It puts in place the measures and funds that are required to protect the most vulnerable people in Scotland from the impact of the UK Government&#8217;s austerity programme and from the dismantling of the welfare state on which the UK Government is embarked.</p><p>I agree with Iain Gray, who said that he &#8220;always had confidence&#8221; in the cabinet secretary. I, too, have confidence in the cabinet secretary, who is to be commended on delivering a balanced budget in the face of the 11 per cent reduction in the fiscal DEL over a five-year period. The reduction in capital investment has been even greater.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is determined to pursue at any cost his failed austerity agenda. Murdo Fraser said that the recovery is &#8220;fragile&#8221;. That is an understatement; it is now forecast that, over the period to 2015, the UK economy will be 5.9 per cent smaller, with borrowing &#163;197 billion higher, than it was when the chancellor first set out his spending plans in 2010. Those policies are not made in Scotland, nor are they benefiting the people of Scotland.</p><p>Jackie Baillie made a characteristically robust and uncompromising contribution on the bedroom tax. Let me say in the new spirit of consensus that I completely agree with her on the bedroom tax. She said that the iniquity of that tax is impacting on 80,000 people across Scotland, eight in 10 of whom receive disability benefits and many of whom are on fixed incomes. They are having to pay the price of Westminster&#8217;s austerity programme.</p><p>We have to reflect on the fact that the bedroom tax is a policy that was made in London to address a problem that does not exist outwith London. Despite Scotland&#8217;s having 20,000 more households being affected by the bedroom tax than London has, the Department for Work and Pensions allocation for Scotland in 2014-15 is &#163;35 million less than the allocation for London. That tells us that the solution actually addresses the problem of overheating in the rental market in London and the south-east of England.</p><p>I welcome the agreement between the Scottish Government and the Labour Party, and hope that we can apply pressure that will be successful in lifting the limit on discretionary housing payments in order that we can address what the Welfare Reform Committee described as the &#8220;iniquitous and inhumane&#8221; bedroom tax. However, whatever the outcome of the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s appeal to Lord Freud, the fact remains that we can only mitigate the impact of the bedroom tax; we cannot abolish it without the powers to do so.</p><p>The Scottish Government has long argued that Westminster cuts are a roadblock to economic recovery, but only last month, Chancellor George Osborne pledged &#163;12 billion of further cuts to welfare spending after the next general election. That is the real threat that the people of Scotland face, which we must address in the coming referendum. We have to contrast that threat with the opportunity that independence will provide, which was brought into sharp focus by the analysis published this week by the Financial Times that said that</p><p>&#8220;the Scottish economy would rank among the top 50 in the world by size of GDP, and would be relatively wealthy, richer than the rest of the UK and in the top 20 countries globally in terms of GDP per head&#8221;.</p><p>Independence will provide that opportunity and allow us to go beyond the limits of the devolved settlement and the budget constraints within which Mr Swinney must operate.</p><p>I commend the cabinet secretary for the measures that he has brought forward and the &#163;8 billion infrastructure investment over the next two years&#8212;some of which will go towards refurbishment of James Gillespie&#8217;s high school in my constituency. The other measures for which I commend the cabinet secretary include the provision of an additional &#163;20 million for cycling infrastructure projects across the country, which has been welcomed by cycling organisations including Spokes, Cycling Scotland and Sustrans Scotland. The funding will enhance the community links programme that is run by Sustrans and it will allow us to factor in even greater additional funding through local authorities. Some of the new funding has already been allocated to improvements in my constituency, including the refurbishment and resurfacing of North Meadow Walk cycle path, which will be to the benefit of many people in my constituency.</p><p>The budget provides investment to support economic growth, to protect our most vulnerable people and to deliver the high-quality public services that people in Scotland have a right to expect.

However, why should other beliefs&#8212;for example, a belief that divorce is wrong&#8212;not be equally protected? Passing legislation that gives greater protection to one particular belief might undermine the legal position of all other beliefs, because courts might take the view that the Parliament intended that beliefs that are not specifically listed in legislation should be less protected.</p><p>Amendment 1 is unnecessary because adoption and fostering legislation already requires decisions to be based on, as Jackie Baillie said, one paramount consideration: the best interests of the child. Constraining the courts, local authorities and adoption agencies, as the amendment seeks to do, could unacceptably interfere with their ability to ensure that the best interests of the child remain the paramount consideration.</p><p>It is clear that&#8212;here I agree with Richard Lyle&#8212;a person&#8217;s view on same-sex marriage should not and must not, as family law and equality and human rights legislation already state, be the determining factor in deciding their suitability as an adoptive or foster parent. However, it would be disproportionate and would distort the decision-making process to exclude all consideration of such views in all cases. For example, where a child has been successfully brought up for some years by a same-sex couple and is now in need of adoption or fostering, the fact that a possible adoptive or foster parent has strong views against same-sex marriage and says that they would seek to teach the child those views might, in some cases, count against their suitability as adoptive or foster parents.</p><p>For those reasons, the amendment is disproportionate.

This is a day that many of us did not think we would see in our lifetime. I am immensely proud that this Parliament will, at decision time this evening, pass into law a bill that will allow same-sex couples to marry. There have been some outstanding speeches from the front benches and across the chamber this afternoon.</p><p>I believe that the bill is the measure of a civilised and just society. It is the hallmark of a country that is comfortable in its own skin and which says with quiet dignity and confidence that we value all our citizens equally. Loving and committed relationships between two people should be accorded parity of esteem and equal status before the law, whether they are between two women, between two men or between a man and a woman. Like Marco Biagi, I have been reminded of that by the rich personal testimony that I have received throughout the extensive passage of the bill. Christian Allard is right to say that the bill is about people. It is life changing.</p><p>Only yesterday, I received a letter from a woman in my constituency who urged me to support the bill. She said:</p><p>&#8220;I am in a civil partnership and feel it is second class marriage. The terminology is terrible, &#8216;civil partnership&#8217; sounds cold and legal, and I have to explain what it is&#8212;that it is marriage but not quite marriage.&#8221;</p><p>She went on:</p><p>&#8220;I am forced to mark myself as different, as not straight as not married. That is tiresome and I don&#8217;t want these battles. Talking about my partner shouldn&#8217;t be about the terminology&#8212;it should be about our relationship.&#8221;</p><p>I was humbled to receive a letter today from a young man of 26, who said:</p><p>&#8220;I have always known that I wanted to be married, not civil partnered, not something other, not something different: married. I had thought we would have to go abroad to do this but thanks to the decision taken today we can marry here in Scotland. I now look forward to what will be the happiest day of my life, marrying the person I love in the place I call home.&#8221;</p><p>I said in the stage 1 debate that Scotland had been a &#8220;cold and inhospitable place&#8221; for many people&#8212;myself included&#8212;to grow up in as gay or lesbian in the 1980s and 1990s. I am glad that Scotland is no longer that cold and inhospitable place. I believe that the bill will have a hugely positive impact on our society and on the health and wellbeing of LGBT people across our country. Future generations of young people in Scotland can grow up as gay and lesbian without the self-doubt and self-loathing that many people of my generation and previous generations faced. They will know that their intrinsic worth as a human being is accepted by the society of which they are members.</p><p>Scotland now has one of the most progressive equal marriage bills in the world. We started the process earlier than England and Wales, and we have taken longer in our consultation on and consideration of the legislation, but, like the Equality Network, I believe that the length of time that it has taken has made it well worth the wait.</p><p>Scrapping the spousal veto and allowing the option of gender-neutral marriage ceremonies means that the legislation will provide genuine marriage equality for all, including for trans and intersex people. As Linda Fabiani reminded us, 34 years after Scotland decriminalised male homosexuality in 1980, we have the opportunity to remove the final piece of sexual orientation discrimination from Scots law and to create full legal equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p><p>Many people deserve credit for achieving this milestone in our history. Special mention must go to Tim Hopkins and Tom French of the Equality Network; to Colin Macfarlane of Stonewall Scotland; to the Scottish Transgender Alliance; and to the many others who played their part in bringing us to this day.</p><p>We should also remember those who are no longer with us. I think of the Scottish Homosexual Rights Group many decades ago, and people such as Janey Buchan, Robin Cook, Father Anthony Ross and our own Scots makar, Edwin Morgan.</p><p>Today is a day to pause and reflect on how far we have come as a society. The mood has been celebratory, as Jackson Carlaw reminded us. This is a day when we come together as a Parliament and as a nation to proclaim the importance of marriage as an institution that is open to all. Men and women across Scotland have new cause to hope for their future, with the wondrous possibilities that may present themselves and the chance to share their lives with the person they love.</p><p>Like all of us, I, too, have cause for optimism for my future. Perhaps a personal ad in The Scotsman: &#8220;Slim, athletic, professional 45-year-old male seeks husband to share his life and passions. Must like a good debate, but not take themselves too seriously. All applications will be carefully considered&#8221;&#8212;I jest.</p><p>This is a profound moment in our nation&#8217;s history. Although we do not yet live in a society that is free from prejudice and discrimination, this law is a bold and positive step towards creating a Scotland that is based on the first principles of fairness and justice for all. It is the final step in the journey for equality for the LGBT community in Scotland, and it is one of which I and all of us within and outwith this chamber can be rightly and immensely proud.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to speak in the debate on an issue that means so much to me and to so many of us.

Hugh Henry told us that the NHS is &#8220;valued and valuable&#8221;. My concern is that all that can be, and is being, undermined by PFI.</p><p>In their report for the centre for international public health policy at the University of Edinburgh, Mark Hellowell and Professor Allyson Pollock state:</p><p>&#8220;PFI projects create a debt for the NHS, which is far greater than the investment it provides.&#8221;</p><p>One of the earliest and most deeply flawed examples of a PFI contract anywhere in the United Kingdom is the contract that is operated at Edinburgh royal infirmary. The debt is such that, by 2028, taxpayers in the NHS Lothian area will have paid Consort Healthcare just under &#163;1.3 billion for ERI&#8217;s maintenance.</p><p>The issue goes to the heart of a publicly run and publicly funded NHS. It matters because such inflated service charges&#8212;which, in the case of ERI, are now running at &#163;60 million a year&#8212;rob our health service, the staff who work in it and the patients who use its services of valuable resources.</p><p>As we have heard, the Scottish Government has acted to protect health funding by passing on all the Barnett consequentials since 2011 and increasing the health resource budget by 22 per cent. However, the fact remains that, as a direct consequence of PFI, there is less money available than there would have been. Let us be clear: we are talking about valuable resources that could be used to recruit and retain hard-working NHS staff; to provide high-quality patient care; and to tackle the inequalities in life expectancy and health outcomes that exist in our most deprived communities. This is a matter that must concern every Lothians MSP and on which we should have the maximum transparency and scrutiny, and a full parliamentary debate.</p><p>The Edinburgh Evening News and its reporter Dan Sanderson are to be congratulated on their campaign to highlight the breaches of contract at the hospital. It was thanks to them that we learned of the totally inadequate level of fines, which means that the contractor can be fined only a maximum of &#163;28.24 a day for serious failures in the maintenance contract. It was as a result of their investigation that we discovered a catalogue of failures that included a serious violation of hygiene standards, with flies being found in operating suites, which led to operations being cancelled; a failure in the power supply that led to some surgical operations being completed by torchlight; incomplete checks on staff; and the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate issuing criticism of hygiene deficiencies in wards and toilets. I am deeply concerned about those serious breaches of contract, and that concern should be shared by every MSP and every party across the chamber.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s amendment refers to measures to</p><p>&#8220;support NHS boards to keep bed capacity requirements under regular review&#8221;.</p><p>There is widespread agreement that the NHS needs to transfer health services and resources from the acute hospital sector to community and primary care settings, as Michael McMahon said, but a significant failure of the contract at ERI was the inability to anticipate and plan for the number of beds that would be required at the new hospital. The British Medical Association, Unison and my respected colleague Margo MacDonald all warned of the shortage of beds as far back as 1999. Their warnings were dismissed at the time, but the passage of time has vindicated their stance.</p><p>A more recent source of concern in relation to bed numbers is the behaviour of Consort Healthcare. NHS Lothian was forced to agree to a no-penalty clause before agreement could be reached on the provision of a new ward with an extra 31 beds at ERI. What that means in practice is that NHS Lothian has been prevented from imposing any penalties&#8212;or what are known as &#8220;deficiency points&#8221;&#8212;for breach of contract for a period of up to five years. I do not believe that such behaviour has any place in our modern NHS. I said at the time that Consort was guilty of &#8220;financial blackmail&#8221; and of an &#8220;utterly scandalous&#8221; attempt to hold NHS Lothian to ransom, and I see no evidence to suggest that I was wrong in making that assertion.</p><p>It is for all those reasons that I sought, through a motion that I lodged in July 2013, to achieve cross-party support for a debate on Consort Healthcare&#8217;s abuse of power at Edinburgh royal infirmary. It was my second attempt to secure such a debate and on that occasion I received the support of SNP and independent colleagues, including Margo MacDonald, whose track record on the issue is second to none. I also received the backing of Unison and BMA Scotland.</p><p>I wanted to work with colleagues in all parties to bring the maximum scrutiny to bear on the operation of the contract; I wanted to explore with the Scottish Government the further measures that it could take to address the contract&#8217;s operation; and, most of all, I wanted us to hold Balfour Beatty and Consort Healthcare to account for their actions.</p><p>Our first duty as parliamentarians is to listen to, reflect on and act upon our constituents&#8217; concerns, which, in my case, means the people who use and work at ERI. PFI is a matter of huge public interest on which there is growing and justifiable public anger, and that public anger demands a united and concerted response from MSPs of all parties. It is, as Jackson Carlaw, Hugh Henry and others have made clear, time to put aside the political blame game and today I call on all my Lothians MSP colleagues to heed that call, act in our constituents&#8217; interests and back all future attempts to bring this vital issue before the chamber and allow it to be discussed.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s debate concerns the future of our national health service.

Many former servicemen and servicewomen describe the difficulty of finding their place in society without the shared sense of purpose and close bonds of friendship that they previously relied on.</p><p>The transition can be more difficult for those who bear the physical or emotional scars of war&#8212;especially those who lose a limb and face a lifelong struggle towards rehabilitation. The military covenant recognises that society has a moral obligation to members of the armed forces for their service. By giving up their civil liberties and placing their lives in danger, our veterans make themselves worthy of the utmost respect and the highest possible standards of treatment and care.</p><p>That is why I am pleased to use the debate to draw attention to the efforts of the people who work to rehabilitate military amputees&#8212;in particular, the pioneering work of the southeast mobility and rehabilitation technology centre, which is based in the grounds of the Astley Ainslie hospital in my constituency. The SMART centre employs more than 70 professionals and is responsible for the on-going care, rehabilitation and support of a quarter of all of Scotland&#8217;s military amputees. Thanks to Scottish Government investment and the leadership that a dedicated veterans minister can provide, the facility will become the centrepiece of a new national approach to amputee care and will provide, which has never happened before, a fully comprehensive rehabilitation service. The centre will have the capacity to fit and repair the next generation of high-technology prosthetic limbs and will offer training and support to patients on how to live with their disabilities. The head of the service, Mr David Gow. has described that advance as a step change in the delivery of amputee care.</p><p>In April 2012, I lodged a motion in Parliament congratulating the Daily Record on its investigation that revealed that as many as one in 10 British Army soldiers is currently battling mental health issues. Many who have returned to civilian life have to cope with the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder. That is why I am pleased that military amputees at SMART will have access to extensive peer-based support with specialist psychological input from trained professionals. Work is now under way to establish that service; it is hoped that it will be fully up and running by April this year.</p><p>Presiding Officer, just as it is my honour to highlight the terrific work of such organisations, I also highlight the efforts of one particular veteran who continues to raise funds and awareness, and contributes to a number of worthwhile causes, including Edinburgh&#8217;s Royal hospital for sick children, for which he has raised more than &#163;100,000, and for the Prestonfield and district neighbourhood workers project, which provides a range of day care services for older people in my constituency. At the age of 93, my constituent Tom Gilzean is a shining example. He can be seen with his trademark tartan trews on the High Street of our capital city, raising funds for those good causes. He is a shining example of the best virtues that any veteran could hope to display. A decorated war hero, his tireless commitment to charity and selfless dedication to helping others is an inspiration to us all, and is worthy of the highest recognition. In raising so much money for good causes, he has touched the lives of so many people. He is an example to us all and a credit to himself and the veterans community. A campaign is under way to have him awarded the freedom of the city of Edinburgh.

I, too, very much welcome the fact that this recommendation by the committee has been accepted and implemented by the Government.</p><p>There is little doubt that the relationship between home owner and factor is tremendously important and can, as colleagues have observed, sometimes be problematic. Like other members, I have received correspondence from troubled constituents for whom that relationship has broken down. I was particularly struck by Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s comments about non-resident owners. How does one change factors or ensure that common repairs commence when a majority of owners are absent or apathetic? That very well made point resonates with my own experience as an Edinburgh constituency member serving many tenemental properties in Marchmont, Morningside and Polwarth, and such issues certainly affect many people across the city of Edinburgh.</p><p>Ensuring that the act&#8217;s operation and implementation are as effective as possible is of the utmost importance and, indeed, John Lamont and the Law Society of Scotland have highlighted the need for solicitors to point out home owners&#8217; responsibilities and obligations when advising clients on such matters.</p><p>The Office of Fair Trading came to the conclusion, in its evidence to the committee, that few options are available to home owners who are unhappy with the service that they receive from their factor. In its submission, it states:</p><p>&#8220;the options available to homeowners who were unhappy with the service provided were not effective.&#8221;</p><p>Clearly, this is a matter of real concern and an area in which further progress needs to be made.</p><p>I have received personal accounts from constituents who say that they have no choice over who provides their property maintenance services and few options available to them when standards of service are not met.

I think that the Scottish Government recognises that in its response. I accept that the Homeowner Housing Panel, which was introduced by the Property Factors (Scotland) Act 2011, will go some way towards alleviating that concern. However, I am of the view that more needs to be done to address issues that cause the most concern to home owners, such as the cost of services.</p><p>I look forward to the Scottish Government taking the necessary steps to remove some of the complexity in this area and, more critically, to providing assistance and information to empower home owners in order to bring about an improvement and a rebalancing of the relationship between the factor and the owner.

Then there are challenges around access to health treatment, which leaves them susceptible to further vulnerabilities. At the seminar that the network held in the Parliament last week, it was highlighted that someone classified by the Home Office as a person of no status has no address and therefore cannot register with a general practitioner and cannot access health treatment.</p><p>That is why as well as marking world AIDS day, the theme of which is striving towards an AIDS-free generation, I also highlight human rights day on 10 December and international migrants day on 18 December, which recognises the rights of migrants throughout the world.</p><p>HIV has been a feature of the developing world for many years, as colleagues have said. In countries such as Botswana and Lesotho, nearly a quarter of people aged between 15 and 49 have been diagnosed with the disease. I will put that into perspective. There are 200,000 orphans living in Lesotho, of which 140,000 have been orphaned because of AIDS, according to UNICEF. The reason for that tragic figure is that only 50 per cent of diagnosed people in the world are able to access antiretroviral therapy, due to a variety of factors that include fear of stigma, the lack of a fully developed and accessible health care system and poor rural infrastructure.</p><p>I agree with the observations made by Professor Lesley Doyle of the University of Bristol&#8217;s centre for health and social care. She said that from the perspective of rich countries it is easy to think that the HIV and AIDS pandemic is a thing of the past, but that is not the case, as countries in the developing world continue to face a series of epidemics.</p><p>In the current climate of austerity, funding gaps between the needs of people in the developing world and the resources available are becoming wider, which is hitting the poorest countries hardest. Although the uptake of antiretroviral therapy has improved dramatically in the past decade, significant challenges remain. The medicine has to be taken for the rest of the individual&#8217;s life, so more funding will be required to sustain and increase the uptake of medication and care for the ill in their later years.</p><p>We must strive to educate people in Scotland and the developing world to dispel the myths of HIV and AIDS.

I know that Alex Johnstone does not like to hear it, but the stark reality is swingeing cuts in capital budgets being imposed by Westminster, challenges facing the private housing construction sector that were brought about by the financial crash, and the reluctance and refusal of banks to release finance for social housing, which exacerbates the financial pressures on small housing associations. All that comes before we confront the pressures that are being brought to bear on registered social landlords as a result of welfare reform.</p><p>Despite the cuts in capital spending that have been imposed by Westminster, the Scottish Government has built 16,000 affordable homes.

The federation rightly recognises the lack of flexibility in the UK Government lending initiatives to boost the amount of finance that is available to housing associations.

RSLs are recording deficits that have fallen to a five-year low. However, social landlords are facing financial pressure through welfare reform increasing the financial risks to housing associations. Again, the SFHA has been helpful in its independent analysis in demonstrating what that will mean. It will mean that there will be a loss of benefit income for working-age tenants in the sector of up to &#163;228 million by 2017, which increases the financial risks for housing associations.</p><p>In evidence to the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee only this morning, the Scottish Housing Regulator confirmed that it was concerned about benefits being paid directly to the tenant rather than, as is the case at the moment, to the landlord, which, of course, provides a regular and assured income stream.

The review goes on to make the sobering observation that such stigma is endemic at all levels in society. Let us pause for a moment to consider what that means. It means that some of the most vulnerable people are not accessing services although they may be more at risk of premature death, which is a sobering thought indeed.</p><p>There has been a transformation in attitudes towards people with mental health problems in our society. Would it not be equally satisfying if we were to see similar changes in public attitudes towards people who are recovering from drug misuse? If stigma is endemic in our society, it would be naive to believe that negative attitudes do not exist on the part of some professionals who are involved in providing addiction services. I was told by someone who has significant experience in the field that one service user told him, &#8220;I go to services as an addict and I get punished as an addict.&#8221; There is a clear challenge for the NHS and other agencies to ensure that there is appropriate training and continuing professional development for all staff who work in services that are designed to assist people on their recovery journey.</p><p>The evidence tells us that recovery is achieved most effectively when service users&#8217; needs and aspirations are placed at the centre of their care and treatment. The role of community pharmacy featured prominently in the review and was endorsed as making a vital contribution to the provision of high-quality care for substance misuse patients. A number of recommendations in the review will improve the provision of services in that area. I pay tribute to the Scottish Drugs Forum for the work that it undertakes to harness the talents, experience and skills of service users to improve the quality of services, promote employability and support individual recovery.</p><p>There are a number of challenges in the report that we must tackle if we are to bring about improvements in the provision of services covering a range of areas. The aim must be to minimise what people need to recover from and to maximise what they can recover to.</p><p>In conclusion, the review provides yet further supporting evidence to underpin the important role of ORT in tackling drug misuse, identifies areas where further improvement must be made and provides a valuable platform that will allow many more people with substance misuse problems to achieve good outcomes.

The bill is about marriage, but its passage into law will also represent the culmination of decades of struggle for equality for lesbians and gay men, as well as bisexual and transgender people.</p><p>Let us not forget that, as recently in our history as 1980, homosexual relations between two men remained illegal, while the very concept of relations between two women did not exist in law. In truth, to be lesbian or gay in Scotland&#8212;I can speak only from my experience&#8212;was to inhabit a cold and inhospitable place. To come out at that time was to face rejection from friends, family and work colleagues; it was also to risk opprobrium and, in some cases, violence. There were precious few positive role models in the media or in our communities, and it seemed that the further one travelled from metropolitan Glasgow or cosmopolitan Edinburgh, the harsher and the colder that climate became.</p><p>Many people chose to leave Scotland rather than stay to face the discrimination and prejudice that were, sadly, a hallmark in much of Scottish society at that time. Thankfully, the culture and temperature have changed. To have had this debate even 10 years ago would have been unthinkable. I believe that, in time, the passage of the bill will enjoy widespread acceptance in our society.</p><p>The challenge for those of us who make our laws is not to do what is popular&#8212;to stick our finger in the air and see which way the wind is blowing&#8212;but to represent our constituents, to listen to the voice of our conscience and to do what is right. I believe that the bill is right and that it commands the public&#8217;s support.</p><p>In the years since 1980, much progress has been made towards equality through employment legislation, the lifting of the armed forces ban, an equal age of consent, adoption rights and this Parliament&#8217;s introduction of a law to outlaw hate crime. However, the struggle for equality has not yet been won. That is why the bill and the debate are so important to so many of us.</p><p>In the context of the debate, the most significant change has been the introduction of civil partnerships, which have undoubtedly enhanced the lives of many same-sex couples across the country by conferring on them many of the rights that married couples enjoy. However, a civil partnership is a legal contract; it is not marriage.</p><p>My constituents have written in their hundreds to urge me to support the bill and I have been moved and humbled by their testimony. One woman wrote to say:</p><p>&#8220;I am a practising Catholic who is a strong supporter of same-sex marriage and would very much want my voice to be heard&#8221;.</p><p>One man urged me to support the bill to end what he called</p><p>&#8220;government supported prejudice against gay people as second class Scots.&#8221;</p><p>Another constituent contacted me to say:</p><p>&#8220;I simply cannot understand what harm it does to anyone if two other people decide to get married. What possible grounds can there be to object to the legislation&#8221;?</p><p>The reason cannot be freedom of religion, because the bill enshrines protection for denominations that oppose same-sex marriage on the ground of theology. At the Equal Opportunities Committee, I asked:</p><p>&#8220;Has your denomination been compelled to perform same-sex marriage in any of the countries that have introduced same-sex marriage?&#8221;</p><p>and the Catholic Church&#8217;s representative said:</p><p>&#8220;The Catholic Church has not.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 5 September 2013; c 1432.]</p><p>Let us be clear: no synagogue, mosque, temple or church&#8212;whether of the Catholic or reformed tradition&#8212;will be forced to conduct same-sex marriages. The bill will not undermine freedom of religion. We will enhance freedom of religion by allowing faiths that recognise same-sex marriage as part of their understanding of God&#8217;s love for all people to conduct such ceremonies.</p><p>The objection to the bill cannot relate to the need to protect traditional marriage, as marriage has evolved over time. Today, who would defend the subjugation of women in marriage as expressed in the 18th century by a Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Braxfield, when he said that</p><p>&#8220;in law a wife has no person&#8221;?</p><p>Traditional marriage has evolved to recognise the rights of women and allow divorce and it has always evolved to reflect social mores.</p><p>The objection to the bill cannot be that it represents an attack on marriage. On the contrary, how can that be the case when it will meet the desire of thousands of loving couples to be brought within the ambit of marriage? Contrary to what Alex Johnstone said, the bill will strengthen marriage.</p><p>Scotland is no longer the cold and inhospitable place that I described.

And they say that transport infrastructure is boring.</p><p>We all realise that transport is vital for the functioning of Scotland&#8217;s economy and for connecting communities across the country, but there is always a debate to be had about how we balance competing transport priorities within the budget that is available. There is no doubt that if Scotland is to cement its future as a modern sustainable economy and society, we must ensure that we have an integrated transport network that is truly fit for purpose&#8212;one that will allow us to maximise Scotland&#8217;s opportunities for commerce, leisure and tourism, and to unlock our full potential. Most of all&#8212;as we have heard&#8212;such investment is essential to our transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>As we have also heard, a well-functioning transport infrastructure can bring about modal shift, as we move from the car to alternative forms of transport&#8212;whether to active travel such as walking and cycling, to public transport such as green buses and rail, or to other forms of sustainable transport, including electric cars and car-share schemes.</p><p>Securing a transport infrastructure that is fit for purpose requires not only focus and insight to meet the challenges head on, but the vision to look ahead at our future needs, and the discipline to manage effectively the decisions that we must make. The Minister for Transport and Veterans has certainly risen to the challenge. The Queensferry crossing is a major capital investment, but it is necessary to safeguard a vital connection in Scotland&#8217;s transport network. The project is currently under budget and on programme. That crossing will bring additional economic benefit of around &#163;6&#160;billion, and it is reassuring that the project&#8217;s management has been commended by Audit Scotland. The existing Forth road bridge will continue to operate, but as a corridor for use by cyclists, pedestrians and public transport. That is the good example that we wish to set, but it is not the only such example.</p><p>We have heard about the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to inject &#163;3&#160;billion into Scotland&#8217;s railways in the next five-year period. In addition to &#163;3&#160;billion investment in rail infrastructure, there will be an additional &#163;1&#160;billion of Government-backed industry investment in strategic network enhancements and further funding of &#163;1&#160;billion over five years for ScotRail&#8217;s Caledonian sleeper service. There will be more rigorous standards for train performance and a dedicated franchise to secure the future of the sleeper service.</p><p>Network Rail will be required to oversee delivery of the Edinburgh to Glasgow improvement programme, the reopening of the Borders railway, the first phase of improvements along the Aberdeen to Inverness corridor, phase 2 of improvements to the Highland main line, and the development of a rolling programme of electrification following the completion of EGIP. I defy anyone to suggest that that is anything other than significant infrastructure investment in our railways.</p><p>That investment forms part of the largest and most substantial transport investment programme that Scotland has ever seen, and the Scottish Government deserves credit for it, but the goal that we must work towards is to secure a fully integrated transport network. That means improving connections across the country and ensuring that the rail timetable is synchronised with local buses and ferries, and that the necessary infrastructure is in place to connect train and cycle journeys.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly with my colleague Fiona McLeod that cycling is neither an afterthought nor an add-on, but should be an integral part of our transport strategy. In advance of the debate, the city cycling Edinburgh forum and Spokes highlighted the importance of cycling as a mode of local transport as well as its being a means of achieving our shared objectives on congestion, carbon emissions and public health. That is why the Scottish cycle network is so important and why we need to learn lessons from not only other European countries and cities but from our English neighbours as they embark on construction of urban cycle networks in their cities.</p><p>I liked Fiona McLeod&#8217;s idea of a 20mph town, which echoes the call from Spokes for at least one cycle-friendly town or city in each Scottish local authority area. I am glad that the City of Edinburgh Council has made good on its pledge and commitment to use 5 per cent of its transport budget to fund active travel; that will rise to 6 per cent and even higher over the coming years. I am also glad that the Government has released &#163;3.9&#160;million of investment for shovel-ready projects for cycling and that &#163;300,000 of that money has already been spent on resurfacing North Meadow Walk for the benefit of my constituents and those in the neighbouring Edinburgh Central constituency. I am delighted with the additional &#163;20&#160;million over two years and the leveraging in of additional local authority funding to bring that figure to &#163;35&#160;million.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had an interesting whirlwind tour of Scotland&#8217;s transport infrastructure, with Lewis Macdonald talking about the Haudagain roundabout, Fiona McLeod proposing that Bishopbriggs be a 20mph town, Chic Brodie&#8212;in an interesting and memorable contribution&#8212;discussing intergalactic travel and Tavish Scott giving us a valuable history lesson, in which he told us about...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Jim", "last_name": "Eadie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80441", "house": "4", "member_id": "80441", "person_id": "25084", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Edinburgh Southern"}, "section_id": "22741929", "hpos": "173", "gid": "2013-11-13.22.34", "epobject_id": "22741963", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-11-13.22.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25084+section%3Asp#g22.34", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80441"}, {"body": "<p>A focus on integrated infrastructure and sustainable travel will help Scotland to achieve the sustainable transport future that I believe everyone in the chamber wishes to see.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A focus on integrated infrastructure and sustainable travel will help Scotland to achieve the sustainable transport future that I believe everyone in the chamber wishes to see.", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Jim", "last_name": "Eadie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80441", "house": "4", "member_id": "80441", "person_id": "25084", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Edinburgh Southern"}, "section_id": "22741929", "hpos": "175", "gid": "2013-11-13.22.36", "epobject_id": "22741965", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-11-13.22.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25084+section%3Asp#g22.36", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80441"}, {"body": "<p>Does Mr Kelly not think that we should give Transport Scotland credit for producing a fairly comprehensive corporate plan up to 2015?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Does Mr Kelly not think that we should give Transport Scotland credit for producing a fairly comprehensive corporate plan up to 2015?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Jim", "last_name": "Eadie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80441", "house": "4", "member_id": "80441", "person_id": "25084", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Edinburgh Southern"}, "section_id": "22741929", "hpos": "190", "gid": "2013-11-13.22.51", "epobject_id": "22741980", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-11-13.22.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25084+section%3Asp#g22.51", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80441"}, {"body": "<p>Will the cabinet secretary join me in paying particular tribute to the Mercy Corps, which is the largest international non-government organisation headquartered in Scotland, with 35 staff based in my constituency?

As others have stated, it is clear that such investment makes a real difference to the lives of thousands of older and disabled people, who are thereby enabled to live active, healthy and independent lives.</p><p>Throughout our inquiry, the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee received extensive written and oral evidence that made the point that community transport services provide a vital lifeline service for many people and communities across the country. Whether people use such services to attend a medical or hospital appointment&#8212;a point made with some gusto by Duncan McNeil&#8212;or to travel to a lunch club or other social activity or simply to go about their normal daily activities such as shopping, community transport can make an invaluable contribution to many people&#8217;s lives. As well as empowering people to participate in the life of their community, community transport services can help to tackle social isolation and loneliness and contribute to good mental health and a general sense of wellbeing. Those are all tangible benefits of community transport services.</p><p>The committee recognised the role that community transport can play in enabling access to healthcare, leisure and social opportunities that might otherwise be closed to those who need them most. The committee also recognised that community transport allows many service users to live independently who might otherwise require supported or residential care.</p><p>We need to capture the contribution that community transport services make in financial terms as well as their wider benefits to society. That is why I welcome the committee&#8217;s call for a robust assessment of the total positive impact that community transport provision has on individuals and communities. I look forward to further progress in that area. The committee was united in celebrating the value of community transport services and in making a series of recommendations, which I am pleased the Government has considered and agreed to implement.</p><p>I pay tribute to Lothian Community Transport Services, which operates in the three local authority areas of Edinburgh, Midlothian and West Lothian. In Edinburgh, the service operates a fleet of eight accessible minibuses that are available for hire, either with a driver or on a self-drive basis, to other voluntary and community organisations. It provides that lifeline service to about 130 different groups.</p><p>I also pay tribute, as Mark Griffin has done, to the dedication and hard work of volunteers in sustaining our community transport services. Without their commitment, those services would struggle to be viable. I hope that the Government will do more to encourage community transport providers to take advantage of the Voluntary Action Fund, which delivers support to voluntary organisations on behalf of the Scottish Government.</p><p>I welcome the further work that is to be undertaken in expanding the role of the Community Transport Association and the doubling of its funding that the minister announced this afternoon. This is not about centralising services, which will rightly continue to be funded and delivered locally, but it is about providing necessary and valuable support and advice at the national level. Perhaps the issue of grant applications, which Joan McAlpine mentioned, is one that could be considered as part of that process.</p><p>Some organisations and some members have talked about the merits of extending the national concessionary travel scheme to include all demand-responsive community transport services, but they have not said how that would be paid for. Age Scotland&#8217;s submission recognised that cost implications would arise from extending the scheme&#8212;it estimated those to be about &#163;11 million, although the minister has said this afternoon that that might well be a gross underestimate&#8212;and it has made a specific suggestion about how those costs would be met.</p><p>The committee received a range of written and oral evidence on the subject as part of its inquiry into community transport. John MacDonald of the Community Transport Association highlighted one of the obstacles that would have to be overcome. In evidence to the committee, he stated:</p><p>&#8220;Concessionary fares in community transport and section 19 services could only ever work where there is a fare-paying passenger. There has to be an individual on the bus, paying a fare. However, on many services, individuals do not pay fares.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 17 April 2013; c 1624.]</p><p>As we discuss the proposal, it is important that we recognise that cost is not the only barrier to the extension of the scheme. A number of witnesses said that concessionary fares are not a priority. It was suggested that the biggest challenge for community transport is the ageing fleet and that investment should be focused on vehicles. John Moore, from Lothian Community Transport Services, said:</p><p>&#8220;Funding fleet renewal is the biggest challenge that faces my organisation ... We have an ageing fleet, which ... is getting more expensive to maintain&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 1 May 2013; c 1650.]</p><p>When it was suggested that the national concessionary fares scheme is not the right vehicle because of the costs involved, witnesses from a range of organisations&#8212;Lothian Community Transport Services, the Women&#8217;s Royal Voluntary Service, Badenoch and Strathspey Community Transport Company and South West Community Transport&#8212;replied yes in unison.</p><p>The evidence that the committee received suggested that there are a number of practical and logistical challenges to extending the scheme. For example, the introduction of ticket machines to read the bus pass could cost up to &#163;10,000 per machine. It was suggested that there might be more pressing priorities.</p><p>The committee was therefore clear in its conclusion. It acknowledged that there is an issue of equity for people in remote and rural communities&#8212;Dr Murray made the point effectively&#8212;but went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;the extension of the concessionary fares scheme would present hugely significant logistical and administrative challenges. The Committee recognises that there is no easy or immediate solution to this problem&#8221;.</p><p>The committee preferred to focus on investment in new vehicles, as Alex Johnstone and Gordon MacDonald said when they argued for capital funding for replacement vehicles.</p><p>We should seek to build consensus on the way forward, as the committee did during the course of its inquiry. We should continue to listen to the providers and users of community transport services in Scotland, so that a vital lifeline service can be provided to the many older and disabled people who need it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and, as colleagues have done, to highlight the important contribution that community transport plays in increasing social inclusion and reducing isolation across Scotland.

As an early co-signatory to Ms Johnstone&#8217;s motion, I am pleased to add my voice to those of colleagues of all parties who believe that now is the time to have a debate not just on cycling safety generally, but on the role that stricter liability could play. Stricter liability may be a matter concerning the civil law, but I stress that it is not an abstract or arcane subject, because it concerns the safety of our fellow citizens, a number of whom&#8212;let us not forget&#8212;have sadly lost their lives in recent years. As such, there can be no more important subject to come before us.</p><p>I acknowledge that there is no consensus on the issue at the moment and I recognise that the law could be changed only following extensive consultation, active engagement with all stakeholders and a full and frank debate about what any proposed change would mean in practice for cyclists, pedestrians and road users.</p><p>However, I believe that the basic proposition behind stricter liability is a fair and sound principle on which to proceed. It is the legal norm in many European countries including Denmark, France and the Netherlands, all of which have a record on cycling that we in Scotland would wish to emulate.</p><p>The Scottish Government maintains that the</p><p>&#8220;data does not supply robust evidence of a direct ... link between strict liability legislation&#8221;</p><p>and the statistics on those who are killed or seriously injured. Maureen Watt pointed that out in her brief intervention. However, the fact remains that as part of a series of measures, such as 20mph zones in residential areas and more awareness training&#8212;points that Margaret Mitchell made&#8212;strict liability legislation has helped to initiate a step change in the culture towards cycling and cyclists in the countries that have adopted it.</p><p>Part of the context for the debate is the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambitious target to ensure that 10 per cent of all journeys are made by bicycle by 2020. That ambition is at the centre of the Government&#8217;s &#8220;Cycling Action Plan for Scotland 2013&#8221; and is embedded in a range of Government policies. Spokes, the Lothians cycle campaign, put it rather well when it stated:</p><p>&#8220;We believe that the single most essential measure for achieving this goal&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>that is, the target of 10 per cent of journeys by bicycle&#8212;is to ensure</p><p>&#8220;that road conditions are, and feel, safe and welcoming for making everyday trips to work, shops, school and leisure by bike. In this way more cycle use should be encouraged, whilst at the same time reducing cycle casualty rates&#8212;and ideally absolute casualty numbers.&#8221;</p><p>I know that the Minister for Transport and Veterans is actively engaged in the safety agenda. In March 2012, he said:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s roads are perfectly safe when everyone uses them responsibly and with respect for each other.&#8221;</p><p>That is precisely what the debate seeks to highlight and what I think stricter liability could contribute to.</p><p>We would do well to reflect on the experience of other European countries and to take on board the views of our constituents. A number of my constituents have contacted me in recent days to make the following points: that stricter liability in civil law is the proper approach for a mature socially conscious nation because it addresses the unacceptable impact of the current system on our most vulnerable road users; that stricter liability will help to promote the idea of Scotland as a cycle-friendly nation and will show that Scotland is leading the UK on cycle safety; that the UK is one of only five countries in Europe that do not operate a system of strict liability, as Alison Johnstone said; and that stricter liability helps to build a culture of greater respect among road users, as is seen on the continent.</p><p>The tenet of protecting the vulnerable by way of stricter liability is not new to Scots law and can be found in consumer protection regulations and regulations concerning control of dangerous animals. I therefore believe that it has an important contribution to make. We have an opportunity to extend and develop that long-standing principle and to serve and protect our cyclists and pedestrians better. Across Europe, stricter liability is an accepted state of affairs. Although, as Rob Gibson said, there is variation in how the regulations are applied in individual countries, reflecting the individual cultures of those countries, it is seen as a key element within a package of measures for encouraging safer road use for cyclists.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713818", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strict Liability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is an important debate, which I congratulate Alison Johnstone on bringing before Parliament this evening.

Founded in 1583-84 by its own town, it came into its own in the 18th century as the leading creative centre of the Scottish enlightenment. Under the leadership of the Rev William Robertson, its principal for more than 30 years, the university produced students of genius, among them Sir Walter Scott, the founder of the modern historical novel; Adam Ferguson, who founded social anthropology; James Hutton, who founded geology; and John Playfair, who developed mathematics and geology. The university&#8217;s medical school became the greatest in the world, holding its place for well over a century.</p><p>Edinburgh exemplified the Scottish tradition of the democratic intellect&#8212;that education is the right and the duty of every person, unfettered by the restriction it suffered elsewhere in being limited to the ruling class and in forcing its students into narrow orthodoxies, religious and otherwise. In Europe, the enlightenment was opposed by universities; in Edinburgh, followed by other Scottish cities, the university led the way.</p><p>Today, the university has demonstrated that it is possible to maintain high standards of academic excellence and, at the same time, to widen access to working-class students from the most deprived neighbourhoods through initiatives such as the Lothians equal access programme for schools, or LEAPS. Widening participation is a strategic priority for the university and it is being pursued vigorously through a number of successful projects including visit campus days, summer schools, mentoring and buddy schemes.</p><p>There are more than 9,000 universities in more than 200 countries worldwide and global rankings of various kinds are used to find the best according to a range of criteria. The impact of research contributes 20 per cent to a university&#8217;s overall score. The Scottish Government&#8217;s global excellence initiative has enabled the University of Edinburgh to invest in high-calibre early career researchers. That has boosted the university&#8217;s research profile, which in turn attracts highly talented students and staff from all over the globe.</p><p>The most recent research assessment exercise confirmed Edinburgh as a first-class institution for research, as 96 per cent of the university&#8217;s departments were found to produce world-leading research. The university was awarded a record &#163;300 million in competitive research grants in 2012-13, which was a 20 per cent rise on the previous year, and it has secured &#163;1.1 billion in competitive research grants during the past five years.</p><p>Notable successes, such as the confirmation of the boson particle by Professor Peter Higgs, are testament to why Edinburgh is placed so highly in the QS rankings. For more than 40 years, the University of Edinburgh has successfully commercialised the intellectual property created from its world-leading research, generating intellectual, social and economic benefits to Scotland and the United Kingdom.</p><p>The university&#8217;s commercialisation arm, Edinburgh Research and Innovation, seeks to promote the university&#8217;s IP to potential funders, collaborators, licensees and investors. It has an enviable record in guiding the university to some of its most significant achievements in invention and innovation throughout recent decades.</p><p>Those innovations include the first genetically engineered vaccine against hepatitis B in 1980, the licence of which has since generated more than &#163;50 million of income to the university and the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. The first prototype sensor-assisted smart wheelchair for children with severe and multiple disabilities was developed and manufactured in 1987, transforming the lives of those children. The first miniature digital camera was developed in 1990; the technology for the camera was licensed to spin-out company VLSI Vision Ltd, which in 1995 became the first Scottish university spin-out company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the past five years, ERI has supported staff and students in the formation of 171 new spin-out/start-up companies across a wide range of sectors.</p><p>Edinburgh is supporting student entrepreneurs to build high-growth businesses in Scotland. All of that activity contributes significantly to the economic footprint of the university and of Scotland.</p><p>On top of its academic benefits, that commercialisation of research provides real benefits to the wider economy. The formation of new companies and the licensing of university technology means that ERI&#8217;s commercialisation activities generate more than &#163;140 million gross value added per annum in Scotland, supporting more than 2,400 jobs in the process.</p><p>As the MSP for Edinburgh Southern, I am fortunate to have two hubs of world-leading projects in my constituency: regenerative medicine at the bioquarter; and energy management and environment protection at King&#8217;s buildings.</p><p>Edinburgh bioquarter is an academic medical centre that combines outstanding biomedical research from the university with the clinical expertise of NHS Lothian and a seasoned team of industry professionals. Through its translational medical research, it supports 900 hospital beds and 1,200 researchers. That is set to rise significantly in the coming years.</p><p>Also located at the bioquarter is the Scottish centre for regenerative medicine, where 230 researchers conduct pivotal work on stem cells and other regenerative therapies for conditions such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and motor neurone disease. That clinical excellence is being advanced to deliver the bench-to-bedside approach in addressing the challenges posed by degenerative diseases.</p><p>Commercialisation is just as efficient at the bioquarter as it is in the rest of the university, as a team of scientists and businesspeople with more than 150 years&#8217; of commercial experience are engaged in that endeavour. All of that activity is designed to accelerate the development of new treatments for human and animal diseases by working with researchers, industry and investors to create new medicines, diagnostic tools and medical devices.</p><p>The Institute for Energy Systems, formed in 2002 and located at King&#8217;s buildings, is one of five multidisciplinary research institutes within the school of engineering. Integrated research combines 40 academic and research staff, alongside 50 postgraduate students, and focuses on areas such as marine energy, power systems, and energy and climate. Their work has led to the creation of the FIoWave TT project. A world first, this unique facility simulates combinations of waves and currents to recreate the extreme conditions of European coastlines. It will be a vital tool to help engineers to harness the renewable power of the sea.</p><p>All of those examples of research and innovation demonstrate the university&#8217;s ability to harness the intellectual power of its academics, researchers, postgraduates and undergraduates. Perhaps the final word should be with one of the university&#8217;s finest sons, the historian Owen Dudley Edwards. He states:</p><p>&#8220;If Edinburgh is internationally recognised today as guarantor of academic excellence tomorrow, it holds that place because of its grounding in the triumphs of yesterday above all in the principles of academic freedom and the knowledge that what its youngest student may write can still inspire its most honoured professor, and that teaching and research remain each other&#8217;s partners, not rivals. But it also owes its fortune to the warmth, humour, friendship, and love which sparkle from its history.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697642", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: University of Edinburgh"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the debate to Parliament this evening, and I am grateful to all those members who supported the motion in my name.

For most of us, learning is an essential part of life, but for many adults in Scotland&#8212;27,000, to be exact&#8212;it is something that can be difficult, if not impossible. That is because they have a learning disability. It is often a lifelong condition that starts before adulthood and it can mean that they need help and support to understand information, learn new skills and cope with living independently.</p><p>Dennis Robertson, who has just spoken so eloquently, reminded us that this debate is about individual people. Unfortunately, at every stage of the lives of people with a learning disability through to old age, they face discrimination and barriers that prevent them from living their lives to the full.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch spoke about the role that the Parliament has played in addressing social exclusion and the way in which human rights are woven into the fabric of this institution. The barriers that people face in their lives should not and need not exist. I firmly believe&#8212;I know that, in this, I am joined by my colleagues across the chamber&#8212;that society is judged on how it cares for its most vulnerable citizens. Surely those who have a learning disability should enjoy the same rights to employment, housing, education and healthcare as the rest of us. They should be at the heart of society, not outside it.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch spoke about the European dimension, and the United Nations has the same belief. Its &#8220;Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons&#8221; makes the point, saying that they must be given the chance to enjoy a decent life that is as normal and full as possible. However, according to Enable Scotland, the country&#8217;s largest voluntary organisation for people with learning disabilities, fewer than one person in 20 in this category in this country are in employment, although that figure excludes those in sheltered workplaces such as Remploy.</p><p>There are a number of specific challenges around employment, so I was particularly pleased that the minister addressed the collaborative work with Skills Development Scotland, NHS boards and local authorities, all of which is designed to meet those challenges. We can all agree with the aspiration and ambition that are set out in the strategy&#8212;that people with learning disabilities, with appropriate support, are able to work in mainstream employment that is suitable to their skills and capabilities. The strategy focuses on helping people with learning disabilities to enter mainstream employment wherever possible.</p><p>That is surely the right approach, but there continues to be a role for supported businesses, which is why I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s independent review of Scotland&#8217;s supported businesses. I look forward to further action being taken to identify the obstacles and barriers that they face and the support that they need to transition from organisations that are dependent on grant funding to ones that can grow and prosper as viable commercial businesses or social enterprises.</p><p>A number of members mentioned the importance of education, and the strategy highlights a number of examples of good practice in that area. In Edinburgh, I am aware of the work of Enable Scotland, which is delivering the stepping up programme in five schools across the city&#8212;Boroughmuir high, Tynecastle high, Leith academy, Pilrig Park school and Drummond community high. Each year, Enable Scotland engages over 40 young people with learning disabilities from secondary 4 to S6 in Edinburgh schools. Those young people are supported in developing the skills and confidence to make a successful transition from school into employment or training. Enable Scotland provides on-going support to both trainees and employers to ensure their long-term success.</p><p>That project is part of a nationwide schools programme that is funded by Inspiring Scotland, which Enable Scotland has been delivering since 2009. It has supported more than 450 pupils who have learning disabilities to make positive transitions from school into employment, vocational training and apprenticeships.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s colleges have been mentioned in the debate. They have a social obligation to the communities in which they operate and a duty to do all that they can to ensure that people with learning disabilities can access educational opportunities and fully participate in society. I was pleased to secure a meeting last year with the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, Michael Russell, and the charities Enable Scotland and Learning Disability Alliance Scotland, which represented people with learning disabilities. Along with my parliamentary colleagues Jackie Baillie and Joan McAlpine, we discussed the provision of courses and student numbers across Scotland. Joan McAlpine mentioned the further discussions that she has been involved in with the cabinet secretary and those charities. As a result of all that activity, the Scottish Government has listened and taken steps to ensure that the colleges&#8217; outcome agreements reflect the needs of people with learning disabilities. That is being backed with additional resources.</p><p>Bob Doris and Stewart Maxwell emphasised the importance of gathering good data and measuring trends on unnecessary deaths, health outcomes and the allocation of social work resources. Bob Doris spoke about including an indicator in the general practitioner contract, and Joan McAlpine spoke about the need for longer appointments for people with learning disabilities. I hope that the minister will take on board both those constructive suggestions.</p><p>In a briefing to members, Enable Scotland said that the collection of data represents &#8220;a clear opportunity&#8221;. It stated:</p><p>&#8220;we are hopeful that the Scottish Government and other partners will capitalise on this opportunity to support the monitoring of the achievement of the objectives of the Keys to Life.&#8221;</p><p>We can all endorse that.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm spoke about the important role of independent advocacy services. I echo his concern that 2018 appears at least at first glance to be a very long-term timescale for agreeing an action plan that involves all the key stakeholders and the Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance. I also welcome his advertisement for the event that I will host in the Parliament on Thursday this week.</p><p>No political party has a monopoly of concern for people with learning disabilities, and no Government of any political complexion in Scotland or the UK has done enough to address the needs and concerns of that important and marginalised group. I welcome the leadership that the minister is providing, whole-heartedly support the strategy, and look forward to further action on behalf of people with learning disabilities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Learning Disabilities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate and to follow a number of very impressive contributions on the quality of life of people with learning disabilities.

The war memorials that grace our cities, towns and villages testify to the sacrifice that was made by so many young men who went off to fight in foreign fields, never to return to their native land. We should all welcome the emphasis that has been placed on restoring those memorials in the anniversary year, and I am glad that the Scottish Government is helping to honour the memory of all those who fought in the war, and particularly the young men who lost their lives or were injured.</p><p>Tens of thousands of men died in the trenches and are now buried in the fields of northern France and Flanders&#8212;casualties of the war that was meant to end all wars. Richard Lyle spoke eloquently about the huge loss of life. Here in Scotland, we are reminded by the historian Richard Finlay of the sacrifice that those men made. More than half of all men between the ages of 18 and 45 took part in the war. That is a colossal number of people, and behind every statistic lay a human story&#8212;a family torn apart by the loss of a loved one who was cut down in their prime: a father killed in battle leaving behind a widow and young children, or a son lost in the conflict. The impact of the war on families and communities was shattering; the war had an incalculable cost and impact on those affected.</p><p>We all have a duty to honour and remember the service of those who laid down their lives. We also have an obligation to preserve that history, so that future generations will never forget. We can do that in a number of ways. One way is through the preservation of sites of international importance that tell the war story. I am grateful to Edinburgh&#8217;s Evening News for its campaign to preserve the site where thousands of soldiers from Edinburgh and across Lothian prepared and trained for life in the trenches. My constituent, the war veteran and inveterate fundraiser Tom Gilzean, recently described the trenches at Dreghorn as a</p><p>&#8220;monument to the sacrifice of millions ... the trenches should be kept for posterity as they are a monument to the men who served in them&#8221;.</p><p>We can all agree with those words.</p><p>My constituency has another important part of the story of the first world war. In 1983, Napier College bought the former Craiglockhart College of Education site, which the military requisitioned during the first world war for use as a hospital that served as a significant centre for the treatment of shell-shocked servicemen. In 1917, the poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon first met at that location, which is where some of Owen&#8217;s and Sassoon&#8217;s greatest war poetry was inspired and written. Their resulting friendship was to have a significant and lasting impact on English literature and on our view of war. I am fortunate to have the war poets collection housed today at Edinburgh Napier University in my constituency. That is a lasting and fitting legacy to those war poets that has a powerful message, which resonates still today.</p><p>As we remember the tremendous sacrifice and service of those men, we should also remember the role played by women. I recognise the efforts of my constituent Ian McFarlane to ensure suitable recognition for Dr Elsie Inglis, who was a war surgeon who set up volunteer hospital units&#8212;staffed entirely by women&#8212;that treated more than 300,000 wounded allied servicemen. Mr McFarlane has worked tirelessly to honour their memory and has succeeded in securing funding to stage an exhibition in this Parliament in honour of those remarkable women. The exhibition will feature the paintings of John Bellany, who is one of Scotland&#8217;s greatest living artists.</p><p>All those examples demonstrate how we continue to remember those who served in the war. They remind us of an important period in our history, which we must never forget and never repeat.

It highlights the important contribution of the national concessionary travel scheme, as well as the contribution that is made by community transport services in urban and rural communities across the country. I am proud that the Scottish Government has safeguarded and funded the scheme and community transport services during its time in office. It is clear that that investment makes a real difference to the lives of thousands of older or disabled people, allowing them to live active, healthy and independent lives.</p><p>Community transport services, as we have heard, are a vital lifeline service for many people. Whether people use them to attend a medical appointment, to go shopping, or to travel to a lunch club or other social activity, community transport services make an invaluable contribution to many people&#8217;s lives. Empowering people to participate in the life of their community, tackling social isolation and loneliness&#8212;as Alison McInnes said&#8212;and contributing to good mental health are all benefits of the concessionary travel scheme and of community transport. We should therefore all unite in celebrating them.</p><p>I pay tribute to Lothian Community Transport Services, which operates in three local authority areas&#8212;Edinburgh, Midlothian and West Lothian. In Edinburgh, it operates a fleet of eight accessible minibuses that are available for hire&#8212;with a driver or on a self-drive basis&#8212;to other voluntary and community organisations. It provides that lifeline service to about 130 different groups.</p><p>The motion in the name of Alison McInnes talks about the merits of extending the scheme to include all demand-responsive community transport services, but it does not refer to how that would be paid for. Age Scotland has recognised that cost implications would arise from extending the scheme and it has made a specific suggestion about how those costs would be met. The Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, of which I am a member, received a range of written and oral evidence on the subject as part of its current inquiry into community transport.</p><p>John MacDonald of the Community Transport Association highlighted one of the obstacles that would have to be overcome. In evidence to the committee, he stated:</p><p>&#8220;Concessionary fares in community transport and section 19 services could only ever work where there is a fare-paying passenger. There has to be an individual on the bus, paying a fare. However, on many services, individuals do not pay fares.&#8221;</p><p>However, in discussing the proposal it is important to recognise that although cost is a factor, it is not the only factor&#8212;indeed, it may not be the only barrier to the extension of the scheme. A number of witnesses indicated that concessionary fares are not a priority. It has been suggested that the biggest challenge for community transport is an ageing fleet and that investment should be focused on funding for vehicles. John MacDonald also stated:</p><p>&#8220;replacing vehicles is a big problem for well-established organisations that have been around ... for 20 or 30 years ... lf one thing should be a priority, it is vehicles.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 17 April 2013; c 1624, 1629.]</p><p>John Moore of Lothian Community Transport Services stated:</p><p>&#8220;Funding fleet renewal is the biggest challenge that faces my organisation ... We have an ageing fleet, which ... is getting more expensive to maintain&#8221;.</p><p>When it was suggested that</p><p>&#8220;the national concessionary scheme is not the right vehicle because of the ... costs involved&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 1 May 2013; c 1650, 1663.]</p><p>witnesses from a range of organisations replied in unison, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The organisations were Lothian Community Transport Services, the Women&#8217;s Royal Voluntary Service, Badenoch and Strathspey Community Transport Company and South West Community Transport.</p><p>The evidence that we have received suggests that there are a number of practical and logistical challenges&#8212;including introducing ticket machines to read the bus pass, which could cost more than &#163;5,000 and possibly up to &#163;10,000 in each case&#8212;and that there may be more pressing priorities at the moment, such as investment in an ageing fleet of vehicles.</p><p>Age Scotland has made a welcome contribution to the debate about the future of the national concessionary travel scheme and community transport, but its report should not be the final word. We should await the conclusions and recommendations of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee; we should seek to build consensus on the way forward; and we should continue to listen to the providers and users of community transport services across Scotland in order to provide that lifeline service to the many older and disabled people who need it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692563", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Concessionary Travel Scheme (Extension)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Alison McInnes on securing the debate.

By 2014, the Forth road bridge will have been an essential part of the national road infrastructure for 50 years. It is vital for the economy of Fife, it is an essential link for the east coast corridor and it is essential for the connectivity of Fife and beyond. The Forth road bridge now carries 25 million vehicles every year, which is almost six times the volume of traffic that it originally carried. There are operational challenges, including its susceptibility to restrictions and closures during strong winds.</p><p>The purpose of the bill is</p><p>&#8220;to make provision about the management and maintenance of the Forth Road Bridge&#8221;</p><p>as part of the wider strategy to upgrade the Forth crossing transport network.</p><p>As we have heard, the bill allows for the dissolution of the Forth Estuary Transport Authority, which currently manages and maintains the Forth road bridge. The bill also allows for the designation of the Forth road bridge as a trunk road, bringing it under the direct responsibility of Scottish ministers. It allows for the transfer of all FETA&#8217;s assets and liabilities to Scottish ministers and for the transfer of FETA&#8217;s staff to the employment of the bridge operator, which will be appointed by Scottish ministers following a procurement process.</p><p>Although the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee highlighted a number of issues, it agreed that a single bridge operating company is the most appropriate and cost-effective approach to the management and maintenance of both the existing crossing and the new crossing.</p><p>The Forth replacement crossing is a major infrastructure project&#8212;one that is necessary to safeguard a vital connection in the country&#8217;s transport network.</p><p>The minister and other members who have spoken in the debate have referred to the transfer of the employment rights of existing FETA employees, which is an important issue. The bill offers continuing employment and certainty of tenure for all existing FETA staff. As my colleague on the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, Margaret McCulloch, said, that approach will avoid compulsory redundancies and ensure that employees&#8217; terms and conditions are protected.</p><p>In its stage 1 report, which was published in March, the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee said that it was</p><p>&#8220;reassured that significant efforts have been made to maintain the terms and conditions of FETA staff transferring to the new bridge operator.&#8221;</p><p>Local accountability arrangements formed the basis of much of Dr Murray&#8217;s speech. We need to remind ourselves of how the committee, having heard evidence from local authorities and other stakeholders, reflected that evidence in its report. The committee&#8217;s view was that</p><p>&#8220;the inclusion of local authority officials&#8221;</p><p>on the Forth bridges forum</p><p>&#8220;allows for an appropriate level of input&#8221;.</p><p>The committee did not recommend any changes to the forum&#8217;s membership, which I think is the correct approach.</p><p>The committee commended Transport Scotland for its work on the arrangements for staff who are to be transferred across, particularly in relation to pensions. It is right that Transport Scotland should continue to offer staff every available support and that it should work with their trade unions and the other bodies representing staff interests during the transition period.</p><p>As my colleague David Torrance highlighted, one of the positive aspects of the bill is the fact that there will be no change for users of the Forth road bridge&#8212;I am thinking in particular of cyclists, pedestrians and those who use public transport.</p><p>There is a role for the bridge as an active travel corridor. I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment, which he reiterated this afternoon, that the public will not experience a diminution in the level of service that is provided. There is therefore an opportunity for the bridge to support sustainable and active travel. Following the opening of the new crossing, the Forth road bridge will be used exclusively by buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. I think that we all welcome that.</p><p>I welcome the stage 3 debate.

I commend the minister, members of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee and members from across the chamber for their constructive speeches this afternoon and the constructive approach that they have taken during the passage of the bill. I look forward to supporting the bill at decision time.</p><p>On the name of the new crossing, tempted though I am by St Margaret&#8217;s crossing&#8212;not least in deference to Margaret McCulloch, who is a member of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, and thinking of my political mentor, Margaret Ewing&#8212;perhaps we can all agree that it should be the Saltire crossing.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the stage 3 debate on the Forth Road Bridge Bill.

Science education is critical if we are to inspire and nurture the next generation of scientists, researchers and innovators, all of whom are vital to the development of our knowledge economy. How we inspire future generations of scientists, engage with young people and give them the confidence to realise their true potential is the challenge that our society must face up to.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s contribution to science is without parallel for a nation of our size. That was recognised by the Scottish Government in its consultation &#8220;Building a Smarter Future: Towards a Sustainable Scottish Solution for the Future of Higher Education&#8221;, which stated that, in comparative terms, only England, the United States and China fare better. We punch above our weight in research, making Scotland-based research the most cited in the world relative to our GDP&#8212;a point that Willie Coffey made earlier.</p><p>Professor Sir Jim McDonald and Simon Jennings sum up the opportunity that we have and the challenge that we face. Writing in the recently published compendium of essays, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future: The economics of constitutional change&#8221;, they state:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s universities, their staff, students and graduates represent a major advantage for Scotland. As economies around the world look to generate competitive advantage in order to secure and retain high-value, high-wage economic activity, Scotland starts from an enviable position.&#8221;</p><p>New scientific discoveries, inventions and innovations constantly emerge from Scotland&#8217;s scientists and engineers. Those ideas have the power to change the way that we view the world. Those innovations push the boundaries of understanding and discoveries and drive change, challenging others in the global scientific community to follow Scotland&#8217;s lead.</p><p>We achieve that by focusing on our strengths as a nation, supporting our most talented individuals to reach the highest levels of academic achievement, inspiring young people&#8212;particularly young women&#8212;to enter science, and supporting engagement with the public through our science centres, campaigns and festivals. We also do it by encouraging a higher rate of participation among the population in clinical trials to develop the new medicines that will treat the diseases that are endemic in Scotland. In developing those medicines, we also have the potential to benefit people throughout the world.</p><p>That engagement also includes engagement between business, stakeholders and academia. Scotland has five universities in the world&#8217;s top 200. They produce a stream of highly educated graduates who engage in the cutting-edge research about which we have heard much this afternoon. They engage in that research in our academic institutions or work for businesses of all sizes, supporting knowledge exchange and the commercialisation of research.</p><p>It is my privilege to have the University of Edinburgh King&#8217;s buildings in my constituency. Work there on renewable energy resources, such as offshore wind, wave, tidal and hydro power, is at the forefront of European and global research.</p><p>The university is also a world leader when it comes to engaging research with business. Flowave TT has created a groundbreaking combined current and wave test facility that I have had the opportunity to visit. NGenTec, which is a company that was spun out of the University of Edinburgh, produces the lightest and most compact wind turbine in the world. Those are two good illustrations of the point that Liz Smith made in highlighting the role of science at the heart of our knowledge economy.</p><p>The Scottish Government has recognised that basic and applied scientific research is key to addressing the major global and local challenges of our time, including dealing with climate change, the need for sustainable energy and combating life-threatening disease. Aileen McLeod spoke knowledgeably and eloquently about the role of knowledge and innovation in Scotland and investment by major global companies into Scotland. I will give two further examples from the life sciences.</p><p>The previous First Minister, Jack McConnell, launched an initiative called the translational medicine research collaboration, which involved the company Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer. There was significant investment in a collaboration in Scotland that involves four of our universities&#8212;the medical research centres at the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Dundee and the University of Aberdeen. It is funded by the public purse and collaborates with national health service boards and a global pharmaceutical company. That investment in Scotland has continued with a second phase of funding of about &#163;5.2&#160;million. Through the project, we have an opportunity to link up the data that is available through the Scottish national medical records database with the research that is being conducted in the universities and across our health service.</p><p>Another example is that of GlaxoSmithKline, which is the biggest funder of academic research in the UK, with Scotland punching above its weight. There are more than 50 separate collaborations between that company and research teams in Scottish universities, including the kinase consortium at Dundee and the Edinburgh BioQuarter.</p><p>In thinking about how to support and sustain all that research activity, we come back to an issue that has been highlighted time and again this afternoon. The STEM subjects&#8212;science, technology, engineering and maths&#8212;are fundamental to our success in all these areas. Scotland&#8217;s schools, colleges and universities provide distinctive advantages and supply Scotland with the intellectual capital that we need to meet our scientific ambitions. However, more needs to be done. It is imperative that the Scottish Government acts to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s young people engage with STEM subjects, and we must create the opportunity for young people to build their awareness and move into STEM-related careers.</p><p>Industry engagement with young people is required to enable them to see the career pathways that exist and to encourage and motivate them to pursue those opportunities. The science and engineering education advisory group recommended more practical, hands-on science learning for young people and said that teachers, particularly in primary schools, need high-quality professional development&#8212;a point that Iain Gray made in his speech and one that, later in the debate, stimulated a useful exchange between Sandra White and Liz Smith on the qualifications that primary teachers require.</p><p>On the back of the science and engineering education advisory group report, careerwise Scotland was launched at the first women&#8217;s employment summit. That has been a recurring theme in our debate this afternoon.

Science education is critical if we are to inspire and nurture the next generation of scientists, researchers and innovators, all of whom are vital to the development of our knowledge economy. How we inspire future generations of scientists, engage with young people and give them the confidence to realise their true potential is the challenge that our society must face up to.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s contribution to science is without parallel for a nation of our size. That was recognised by the Scottish Government in its consultation &#8220;Building a Smarter Future: Towards a Sustainable Scottish Solution for the Future of Higher Education&#8221;, which stated that, in comparative terms, only England, the United States and China fare better. We punch above our weight in research, making Scotland-based research the most cited in the world relative to our GDP&#8212;a point that Willie Coffey made earlier.</p><p>Professor Sir Jim McDonald and Simon Jennings sum up the opportunity that we have and the challenge that we face. Writing in the recently published compendium of essays, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future: The economics of constitutional change&#8221;, they state:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s universities, their staff, students and graduates represent a major advantage for Scotland. As economies around the world look to generate competitive advantage in order to secure and retain high-value, high-wage economic activity, Scotland starts from an enviable position.&#8221;</p><p>New scientific discoveries, inventions and innovations constantly emerge from Scotland&#8217;s scientists and engineers. Those ideas have the power to change the way that we view the world. Those innovations push the boundaries of understanding and discoveries and drive change, challenging others in the global scientific community to follow Scotland&#8217;s lead.</p><p>We achieve that by focusing on our strengths as a nation, supporting our most talented individuals to reach the highest levels of academic achievement, inspiring young people&#8212;particularly young women&#8212;to enter science, and supporting engagement with the public through our science centres, campaigns and festivals. We also do it by encouraging a higher rate of participation among the population in clinical trials to develop the new medicines that will treat the diseases that are endemic in Scotland. In developing those medicines, we also have the potential to benefit people throughout the world.</p><p>That engagement also includes engagement between business, stakeholders and academia. Scotland has five universities in the world&#8217;s top 200. They produce a stream of highly educated graduates who engage in the cutting-edge research about which we have heard much this afternoon. They engage in that research in our academic institutions or work for businesses of all sizes, supporting knowledge exchange and the commercialisation of research.</p><p>It is my privilege to have the University of Edinburgh King&#8217;s buildings in my constituency. Work there on renewable energy resources, such as offshore wind, wave, tidal and hydro power, is at the forefront of European and global research.</p><p>The university is also a world leader when it comes to engaging research with business. Flowave TT has created a groundbreaking combined current and wave test facility that I have had the opportunity to visit. NGenTec, which is a company that was spun out of the University of Edinburgh, produces the lightest and most compact wind turbine in the world. Those are two good illustrations of the point that Liz Smith made in highlighting the role of science at the heart of our knowledge economy.</p><p>The Scottish Government has recognised that basic and applied scientific research is key to addressing the major global and local challenges of our time, including dealing with climate change, the need for sustainable energy and combating life-threatening disease. Aileen McLeod spoke knowledgeably and eloquently about the role of knowledge and innovation in Scotland and investment by major global companies into Scotland. I will give two further examples from the life sciences.</p><p>The previous First Minister, Jack McConnell, launched an initiative called the translational medicine research collaboration, which involved the company Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer. There was significant investment in a collaboration in Scotland that involves four of our universities&#8212;the medical research centres at the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Dundee and the University of Aberdeen. It is funded by the public purse and collaborates with national health service boards and a global pharmaceutical company. That investment in Scotland has continued with a second phase of funding of about &#163;5.2&#160;million. Through the project, we have an opportunity to link up the data that is available through the Scottish national medical records database with the research that is being conducted in the universities and across our health service.</p><p>Another example is that of GlaxoSmithKline, which is the biggest funder of academic research in the UK, with Scotland punching above its weight. There are more than 50 separate collaborations between that company and research teams in Scottish universities, including the kinase consortium at Dundee and the Edinburgh BioQuarter.</p><p>In thinking about how to support and sustain all that research activity, we come back to an issue that has been highlighted time and again this afternoon. The STEM subjects&#8212;science, technology, engineering and maths&#8212;are fundamental to our success in all these areas. Scotland&#8217;s schools, colleges and universities provide distinctive advantages and supply Scotland with the intellectual capital that we need to meet our scientific ambitions. However, more needs to be done. It is imperative that the Scottish Government acts to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s young people engage with STEM subjects, and we must create the opportunity for young people to build their awareness and move into STEM-related careers.</p><p>Industry engagement with young people is required to enable them to see the career pathways that exist and to encourage and motivate them to pursue those opportunities. The science and engineering education advisory group recommended more practical, hands-on science learning for young people and said that teachers, particularly in primary schools, need high-quality professional development&#8212;a point that Iain Gray made in his speech and one that, later in the debate, stimulated a useful exchange between Sandra White and Liz Smith on the qualifications that primary teachers require.</p><p>On the back of the science and engineering education advisory group report, careerwise Scotland was launched at the first women&#8217;s employment summit. That has been a recurring theme in our debate this afternoon. Clare Adamson highlighted the importance of female role models such as Anne Glover, who was the chief scientific adviser to Scotland and is now in a key role in the European Union. That important point was well made. I also acknowledge the comments from Mark Griffin, Hugh Henry, Neil Findlay and the minister that more needs to be done to encourage women into engineering and science subjects.</p><p>There is also a need for better understanding of the various initiatives that exist and better co-ordination between them.

I add my support to the tributes paid to charities such as Beating Bowel Cancer, Bowel Cancer UK and Cancer Research UK. We owe them all a debt of gratitude for their work, day in, day out, on behalf of people with bowel cancer.</p><p>It has been mentioned that Scotland has the highest incidence of cancer and bowel cancer in the UK. As Sandra White reminded us, bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in Scotland. Therefore, there is a huge responsibility on us all to do what we can to raise awareness; to educate ourselves in how to recognise the symptoms of the disease; and to disseminate throughout the general population the vital information that everyone needs if we are to obtain back the testing kits that can help people to detect the disease and ensure that they go on to access appropriate treatment.</p><p>Early detection and treatment of the disease are vital. Malcolm Chisholm highlighted the reduction in mortality rates that we have seen in recent years. If bowel cancer is detected early, nine out of 10 people go on to survive. That is an impressive statistic, but it is too easy to forget that a human story lies behind each of those statistics&#8212;perhaps that of a son who survives bowel cancer and goes on to live a fulfilling and productive life, or of a mother who survives bowel cancer and is able to enjoy a happy retirement with her grandchildren.</p><p>The Scottish Government is to be commended for extending the bowel screening campaign from April of this year. The latest public awareness campaign carries the message, bowel cancer&#8212;don&#8217;t take a chance, take the test. The chief medical officer for Scotland, Sir Harry Burns, has said:</p><p>&#8220;I hope that this campaign will get people talking about bowel screening, and show that screening is the most effective way of detecting bowel cancer early.&#8221;</p><p>Scotland has led the way by starting screening at the age of 50 rather than 60, as is the case in England. However, there is no room for complacency, because our survival rates and outcomes lag behind those of the rest of the UK and, as the motion outlines and as has been stated, Glasgow has some of the worst mortality rates in the country.</p><p>Only yesterday, the chief executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, Mark Flannagan, wrote in The Scotsman:</p><p>&#8220;There are some reasons to be optimistic about Scotland&#8217;s efforts to tackle bowel cancer. Scots now have the lowest screening age in the UK, thanks to the government&#8217;s understanding that early treatment saves lives.&#8221;</p><p>Currently, men and women between the ages of 50 and 74 are invited to participate in screening every two years and, in the future, those who are over the age of 74 will be able to self-refer every two years. However, it is important to remember that bowel cancer is not confined to the over-50s. Although it is rare, men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s can also get bowel cancer.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential that we all overcome our natural reticence to talk about our vital bodily functions and that we all learn to recognise the symptoms of bowel cancer. That point was made with characteristic eloquence and humour by Jackson Carlaw. The symptoms of bowel cancer can include a change in your bowel habit, bleeding from the bottom or blood in your poo. We are going to have to overcome the taboo surrounding bowel cancer and get used to talking about bowels and bottoms, blood and poo.</p><p>The important message from today&#8217;s debate is that bowel cancer is a killer disease, but it can be beaten and is survivable. The bowel cancer screening programme has a vital role to play as part of the detect cancer early initiative. The evidence is clear: early detection saves lives. Each year, more than a quarter of the people who are diagnosed with bowel cancer in Scotland will die from the disease, yet bowel cancer can be beaten if it is diagnosed early. More than 90 per cent of patients who are diagnosed with early-stage bowel cancer will survive five years from diagnosis, whereas less than 7 per cent of patients who are diagnosed with late-stage disease will do so.</p><p>In the public debate on bowel cancer, we are where we were with breast cancer 20 years ago. Then, no one talked about breast cancer and it was seen as a death sentence. Today, it is no longer a common cancer killer but a disease that people talk about, get tested and treated for and&#8212;most important&#8212;survive. That is the position that we want to be in for bowel cancer, so let us have that ambition for Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688198", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bowel Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sandra White on securing this important debate and on her compelling contribution.

It also provides us with the welcome opportunity, based on the extensive evidence that we have received from a range of stakeholders, to identify the further measures that need to be taken and milestones that need to be met if we are to meet the ambitious targets that were set by the Parliament.</p><p>I will focus on housing and transport, as they are areas that can make a significant contribution to meeting our emissions reduction targets and were examined by the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, of which I am a member.</p><p>Housing accounts for 25 per cent of our CO2 emissions, so there is a role for the Scottish Government, local authorities and other agencies to ensure that we do all we can to improve the energy efficiency of our existing housing stock. We should recognise where significant progress has been made. For example, according to the Scottish house condition survey, 65 per cent of homes were rated good by 2011, which was up by 31 per cent from 2002-03. Some 400,000 homes have received loft or cavity-wall insulation since 2008. The Scottish Government has provided further investment for boiler scrappage, and is on target to replace 30,000 boilers ahead of the anticipated timeline. We have a national retrofit programme that is the only scheme of its kind in Great Britain, as Marco Biagi said.</p><p>In welcoming the progress that has been made, we should recognise the scale of the challenge that we face. The Scottish house condition survey also identified more than 500,000 homes with solid walls that need insulation. We need to use the levers at our disposal, which include the role of standards and regulation. Mike MacKenzie sounded a note of caution in relation to the introduction of minimum standards, but that was not the view of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, as my colleague on that committee, Elaine Murray, said. Paragraph 120 of the committee&#8217;s report says:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee acknowledges the ambitiousness of the proposal to introduce minimum standards across all of the private housing sector. However, it requests that the Scottish Government investigates whether the timescales for the introduction of these minimum standards could be revised with a view to an earlier than 2018 introduction&#8221;.</p><p>We heard that view in evidence during the committee&#8217;s consideration of RPP2. Elizabeth Leighton, from the Existing Homes Alliance, stated:</p><p>&#8220;We are talking about a minimum standard&#8212;the bottom level. It is about ensuring that we drive demand so that we do not let off the people who could not be bothered to do anything with their houses, despite the incentives.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 6 February 2013; c 1350.]</p><p>WWF has also issued a challenge to the Government to signal a step-change, which it will need to do if it is to achieve significant reductions in energy demand in Scotland&#8217;s homes. If we can bring forward the 2018 deadline, we will have gone a considerable way towards meeting that challenge. I look forward to further clarification when the Government publishes its sustainable housing strategy.</p><p>Transport has an important role to play in meeting our emissions reduction targets, as Malcolm Chisholm said. Paragraph 239 of the committee&#8217;s report stated:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee recommends that the Scottish Government continues to monitor the impact of initiatives in relation to encouraging behavioural change and whether certain demand management initiatives might require to be considered as potential future options in advance of the publication of the RPP3.&#8221;</p><p>Rob Gibson talked about the need for positive engagement. In what I think is a model of such positive engagement across the chamber, my parliamentary colleagues Claudia Beamish, Alison Johnstone and I have written to the Minister for Transport and Veterans, Keith Brown, making the case for introducing a competitive award for an urban, on-road, segregated cycle lane project. That type of project is commonplace in other European countries and is a practical example of the kind of behavioural change that all the committees called for, which we could facilitate through the introduction and adoption of such a project. It is the type of initiative that is necessary if we are to persuade people who do not cycle because of safety fears that cycling is a viable alternative mode of transport.</p><p>Scotland can join the European mainstream in emulating the success of other northern European countries by investing in housing and transport in order to reduce our climate change emissions.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this important debate, because it highlights the role of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s committees in scrutinising the progress that has been made towards meeting our emissions reduction targets.

The attack featured the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas, as well as conventional bombardment. As Bob Doris reminded us, the UK, Norwegian and Swedish Parliaments have recognised it as genocide.</p><p>It is also right and proper that we mark the fact that Kurdish heritage is rooted in one of the world&#8217;s oldest cultures. We in Scotland owe a great debt of gratitude to the many Kurds who have chosen to make Scotland their home. The addition of a people with such a noble culture, steeped in history, has made a great contribution to the rich and vibrant tapestry of life in Scotland and helps to make our nation a vibrant and diverse place in which to live.</p><p>The Kurdish people are the largest national minority in the world that has no homeland. We in Scotland can be proud that, according to the Kurdish Cultural Association, more than 2,000 Kurds have chosen to make Scotland their home. Last week, Kurds around the world celebrated the festival of Newroz, the Kurdish new year, and I offer my sincere thanks to all the Kurds who are in the gallery and throughout Scotland for the contribution that they make to the country that they now call home. I am proud to have in my constituency members of the Kurdish diaspora&#8212;a people who are renowned for their hard work and for their tenacity in the face of adversity and brutality.</p><p>Around the world the Kurdish culture is famous for its ancient history and its distinct culture transmitted through art, dance and song. The Kurdish people have a rich literary history, despite a long history of oppression that includes the banning of the written and spoken Kurdish word. The defining trait of Kurdish culture is its language, which until very recently was brutally suppressed. Despite the oppression that the Kurdish people have faced, they continue to speak their language, in which Bob Doris opened the debate.</p><p>Scotland is a country that celebrates cultural diversity and that is particularly true in our cosmopolitan capital. We are proud that the Edinburgh Kurdish Society has been based here since 1993 and we benefit greatly from its addition to the local community. One recent event saw the Edinburgh Kurdish Society open its doors to people of all cultures and creeds in order to share ideas and discuss how greater links could be forged between the many cultures that are present in Scotland.</p><p>There are many similarities between our two lands, not least the fact that the Kurdish national dish of serupe, made from all the best bits of a sheep sewn up with various herbs and spices, bears more than a passing resemblance to our own national delicacy. As was pointed out by Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman, the Kurdistan Regional Government&#8217;s high representative to the UK, we both have a population of 5 million; we are proud of our highlands and landscapes; we have devolved administrations and are rich in natural resources.</p><p>The Scottish Government has been proactive in fostering close ties between Kurdish and Scottish officials. Meetings between the First Minister and Karim Sinjari, the Kurdistan Regional Government&#8217;s interior minister, focused on developing future cooperation in areas from education, health, policing, energy and business to culture and heritage. Scotland has already provided some police training in Kurdistan and Mr Sinjari and Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill have already discussed ways to progress that and to widen cooperation.</p><p>Once again, I congratulate Bob Doris on bringing the debate to the chamber.

That point was put rather well in the oral evidence of Graeme Blackett of Biggar Economics, who said:</p><p>&#8220;The short answer is that they are achievable. I am not suggesting that they will be met by onshore wind alone but, taking into account what has already been installed, what is being constructed and what is going through the planning system, I think that that and our current hydro capacity will get us pretty close to the 100 per cent target&#8212;and that is before we consider the offshore sector.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 14 March 2012; c 1108.]</p><p>Why is it so important that we achieve our renewables ambition by 2020? That is about more than simply delivering energy security and providing protection from volatile gas prices while being mindful that the gas price largely drives the electricity price. It also means a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as agreed by the Parliament. In fact, a Cambridge Econometrics study into the economics of gas and offshore wind, which was published on behalf of Greenpeace and WWF in November last year, clearly showed that the deployment of wind could reduce carbon emissions by two thirds across the UK.</p><p>One of the biggest prizes in achieving our renewable energy targets will be the reindustrialisation of Scotland&#8212;a process that will see the creation of highly skilled and high-technology jobs for Scotland&#8217;s future workforce, including jobs in civil engineering, wind farm development, turbine production, 3D modelling and many more besides.</p><p>Over the next four years, Scotland aims to deliver 2,000 modern apprenticeships specifically for the industries involved in renewable energy and climate change, and a pilot apprenticeship framework in wind turbine manufacture has been created at Carnegie College, which was referred to by Margaret McDougall.</p><p>According to the industry&#8217;s route map, which was published by the offshore wind industry group in January,</p><p>&#8220;securing one third of the UK offshore wind market would secure an estimated GVA&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>gross value added&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;in Scotland of &#163;7 billion and create 28,377 jobs.&#8221;</p><p>Over the past three years, the Scottish Government has offered considerable encouragement to the industry. It has done more than that: it has taken the necessary steps to deliver confidence, demand and certainty. Those steps have paid off.</p><p>The reality is that, in the past year, applications were submitted for more than 4,000MW of new offshore generation. To put that into context, that represents the capacity of almost half of the generating plant in operation in Scotland. That is a greater amount of generation capacity than has ever been in planning at any given time&#8212;and more is to come.</p><p>The formation of East Coast Renewables, which is an alliance of 10 local authorities working together to achieve Scotland&#8217;s renewables targets, and the involvement of organisations and companies from Aberdeen&#8212;which Kevin Stewart referred to&#8212;to East Lothian, represented by Iain Gray, is a hugely positive development. Now that the industry has submitted its applications and its environmental assessments, it has provided a picture of what the economic opportunity will look like. There will be a new sector located within a 200-mile radius of Scotland&#8217;s east coast that will require the construction and fabrication of upwards of 900 offshore substructures, each of which will be up to 300 feet high, and made of steel or concrete. On top of those will sit a similar number of turbines, their associated blades, gearboxes and control systems. All the turbines will need to be connected to scores of new technology high-voltage current offshore substation platforms. That will be done with hundreds of miles of subsea cabling, which will eventually take the power to shore. To install that we will need dedicated installation vessels and the development and deployment of specialised deepwater installation techniques. To operate all that, we will need new and dedicated onshore facilities for a new and permanent workforce.</p><p>Alison Johnstone talked about the renewables revolution. Scotland has not had a better opportunity&#8212;in this generation&#8212;to achieve economic prosperity. The prize is the reindustrialisation of Scotland, the reinvigoration of our manufacturing base and the rediscovery of world leadership in heavy engineering.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy Targets"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Along with other members who have spoken in the debate, I welcome the committee&#8217;s inquiry and its conclusion that Scotland&#8217;s renewable energy targets can be met.

It is a fantastic achievement and a significant milestone that we will celebrate later this evening at a reception in Parliament.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago&#8212;almost to the day&#8212;a group of like-minded people came together to hold the inaugural meeting of what is now a much-valued service to hundreds of blind and partially sighted people across Lothian and beyond. I know from my mum, Helen Eadie, who was registered blind in her later years through age-related macular degeneration, just how much she appreciated her talking newspaper and I know that the service, which has been pioneered by Lothiansound, is cherished by people across Scotland.</p><p>Of course, none of it would be possible without the volunteers who give up their time for the benefit of others, so I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the volunteers, and to thank them for the work that they carry out. I am pleased that so many have joined us in the gallery to listen to the debate. I also pay tribute to one special lady&#8212;Susan Wallace&#8212;who is with us in the gallery and deserves particular recognition. Susan was a founder member of Lothiansound 25 years ago and is still an active volunteer today.</p><p>Lothiansound has delivered much in the time since 1988. The charity has produced more than 12,000 editions and has distributed them to hundreds of listeners. The service is delivered free of charge and is distributed through Royal Mail&#8217;s Articles for the Blind, and I know that it brings much enjoyment to many people in my constituency and across Lothian.</p><p>Lothiansound has worked hard to ensure that its service reaches as many people as possible. Back in 1988 it sent tapes to 40 visually impaired people; now its listenership is in excess of 500 and is composed of people who live in Lothian and people who live further afield who still keep an interest in what happens in Edinburgh and Lothian. I understand that one of the original listeners&#8212;Jennifer Meiklejohn&#8212;is with us today and that she still receives her recording with great anticipation.</p><p>Recordings are taken mostly from the Edinburgh Evening News and aim to keep blind and partially sighted people up to date with what goes on in their city and around Lothian. As an MSP for an Edinburgh constituency, I am happy to report that it is not just the Edinburgh Evening News that listeners enjoy; Lothiansound also records a popular Scottish quiz and it is keen to ensure that blind and partially sighted people do not miss out on the rich variety of cultural experiences that Edinburgh provides during the festival and throughout the year. For example, through the Federation of Scottish Theatres it advertises audio-transcribed descriptions of productions that take place in Edinburgh and in theatres further afield, including the Brunton theatre in Musselburgh.</p><p>The value of the service should not be underestimated. In the words of the Royal National Institute of Blind People:</p><p>&#8220;Listening to a Talking Newspaper is one of the things that people can enjoy without having to rely on anyone else. That feeling of independence is so important.&#8221;</p><p>The service plays an important part in fostering that feeling of independence, because it allows people the chance to feel connected to the place in which they live, does much to lessen the isolation that they can feel, and allows them to connect to the world around them.</p><p>The service is not just about keeping up to date with news or current events.</p><p>Stephen Fry is a well-known supporter of the medium of talking books and is patron of the Listening Books charity. What he says about the value of such a service could apply equally to talking newspapers. He has said, with his characteristic eloquence:</p><p>&#8220;The companionship and delight of a voice telling stories is incomparable. It distributes pure, undiluted pleasure and friendship. Not many schemes can make such a claim.&#8221;</p><p>Or, as one listener to Lothiansound put it simply:</p><p>&#8220;The readers are just like friends to me, visiting my home every week.&#8221;</p><p>There are five different reading teams made up of seven people. They are all volunteers who work together to achieve the professional standard that Lothiansound listeners enjoy. Reading takes great skill, especially as the readers do not see the articles until they are about to read them. Of course there can be moments when readers are caught off guard, but their professionalism always shines through.</p><p>Lothiansound has always moved with the times, and in 2008 it made the change from analogue to digital recording. I understand that that has increased the quality of the recordings as well as allowing use of compact discs. However, as ever, the charity is alive to the needs of its listeners and still offers cassette-tape recordings to those who prefer them.</p><p>During April 2012, Lothiansound moved to a property in Newington that is owned by the Royal Blind Asylum and School, where it has the use of a quiet and tranquil environment for each week&#8217;s recording.</p><p>As a charity, Lothiansound is funded by donations and through fundraising. Directing the organisation is a committee of trustees that is headed up by a very able chair in Janelle Scotland. The role of a trustee is important, so I take this opportunity to thank them, too, for the work that they undertake on behalf of Lothiansound.</p><p>My parliamentary colleagues from other parts of the country will be aware that there are other talking newspapers across Scotland. In fact, colleagues have been keen to let me know about organisations in their constituencies, so it is right that our national Parliament gives recognition to this vital lifeline service.</p><p>The Association of Talking Newspapers offers help and guidance to all 65 talking newspapers across Scotland. It provides training opportunities and hosts an annual conference at which volunteers pick up tips from colleagues and learn about recent developments in recording. We can all be proud that our own Dennis Robertson MSP will be one of the guest speakers at this year&#8217;s conference in October.</p><p>On this, the 25th anniversary of Lothiansound, it is entirely appropriate that we recognise the invaluable contribution that this remarkable organisation&#8212;and others like it&#8212;has made to enriching the lives of thousands of blind and partially sighted people across Lothian and throughout Scotland.</p><p>We all have the right to enjoy the acquisition of knowledge and to participate in the world around us. That is a right that Lothiansound has made&#8212;and continues to make&#8212;a reality for many people, so we thank it for that tonight.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684310", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lothiansound"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by saying how delighted I am to have secured the debate and by thanking members from across the chamber who have supported the motion that congratulates Lothiansound on its 25th anniversary.

The international community has proclaimed that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Perhaps the international community needs to be reminded of the importance of those values today.</p><p>Just a few days ago, the world witnessed the brutal massacre of 65 innocent civilians in Aleppo in Syria. That incident represents just the latest in a long line of human rights abuses in that country. It moved the UN peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to declare that the Syrian conflict has now reached &#8220;unprecedented levels of horror&#8221;, which include a range of unthinkable abuses ranging from kidnappings and rapes to torture and executions.</p><p>According to the United Nations, the on-going slaughter in Syria has already taken 60,000 lives, with hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon. At the end of last year, BBC journalist Fergal Keane reported first hand from the camps in Lebanon. He said:</p><p>&#8220;You can see people living in pretty rudimentary conditions in here ... no proper sanitation, no light &#8230; and for these children, no education &#8230; The other striking thing, when you talk to children here and you look into their faces here, is the experience of war they have carried with them ... Story after story I hear from the children of seeing parents attacked, of air raids, of the experience of being shelled &#8230; most people who came out of Syria fled with only what they could carry&#8221;.</p><p>Those people are now dependent on the charity of the UN. When Fergal Keane asked a mother of five how she felt about being in her new home, he received the reply that death would be better than this isolation.</p><p>The raw, unparalleled and absolutely unjustified pain that is being inflicted on our fellow human beings warrants the strongest possible condemnation from the international community. The United Kingdom Government has played a constructive role in highlighting the human rights abuses in Syria, in seeking a diplomatic solution and in providing humanitarian assistance through support for the world food programme, the UN refugee agency and relief agencies that are involved in the provision of medical services and supplies.</p><p>However, the UK&#8217;s claim to be a champion of human rights is undermined by the inhumane and unfair treatment of asylum seekers in this country&#8212;people who are themselves fleeing persecution. Research that was commissioned in 2012 by the Scottish Refugee Council, the British Red Cross and the Refugee Survival Trust revealed that</p><p>&#8220;Asylum support rates are below most poverty measures but, with no income, destitute asylum seekers fall below even the UN global poverty target of $1.25 a day.&#8221;</p><p>Moreover, as confirmed by the Refugee Council, almost all asylum seekers are not allowed to work and are dependent on limited state support. They are unable to access mainstream benefits or homelessness services unless and until they are granted the right to stay in the UK.

As the head of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, John Dickie, has said:</p><p>&#8220;if the UK government wants to target higher rate taxpayers it should do it through progressive taxation so that households without children share the burden&#8221;.</p><p>A vital feature of child benefit is that it is paid directly to the main carer for the child or children. As Christina McKelvie reminded us, it is overwhelmingly the case that women are the main carers. Research has shown that child benefit is spent on children&#8212;research by CPAG shows that it is used by parents of all social classes for clothes and shoes, food, essential items such as nappies and education-related items. The Scottish Parliament information centre tells us that, according to HM Revenue and Customs, the average family that is affected by the cuts will have &#163;1,300 less to spend on such products every year. That will be a painful change for those families, which will hit their pockets. The number of families that will be affected is significant. In Edinburgh, 5,000 families will completely lose their entitlement, and in my constituency of Edinburgh Southern more than 700 families will do so.</p><p>I pause to reflect on the effect on our economy. When an average cut of &#163;1,300 is applied to 90,000 families, it represents a loss to the Scottish economy of just under &#163;120&#160;million every year. At a time when Mr Osborne&#8217;s austerity is driving us to the brink of a triple-dip recession, another tax on family spending is surely the last thing that we need. We should contrast that with the efforts of the Scottish Government to protect family budgets at every turn, through measures such as the council tax freeze, free prescriptions and concessionary travel. That contrast in approach explains exactly why the motion calls for recognition that</p><p>&#8220;it is only through the full powers of independence that it can properly protect the universal benefits that produce fair and equitable outcomes.&#8221;</p><p>Furthermore, the changes are ludicrously complicated. HMRC has required to put 15 new pages on its website to explain the policy to the millions of confused families. Advice organisations are concerned that many families might stop claiming child benefit when they do not need to, and that the policy will add to hardship when income fluctuates or put an added financial strain on relationships when couples separate.</p><p>It is the attack on the universal nature of child benefit that most alarms me. CPAG in Scotland has made the point that, although at first glance the changes might not seem likely to have a direct impact on child poverty, the undermining of a simple, universal benefit will have lasting implications for the role of the state in supporting children.</p><p>An extra allowance for children has been a feature of the tax or social security system since the beginning of the 20th century, as Drew Smith said. Every other European country, except Italy, offers a universal child benefit or a child tax allowance for all children. Campaigners worry that the effect of the changes here, along with that of other cuts, will be that people will be made to feel guilty about receiving a benefit that was once a proud pillar of the welfare state and that children will be seen as a burden for the few rather than as the future for everyone in this country.</p><p>The rhetoric of us all being in this together has long since been exposed, as the majority of high earners, who do not have children, are not affected; those with earnings over &#163;150,000, few of whom have children living with them, have even had their tax cut.</p><p>The child benefit changes will have a profound social impact on children and families across Scotland, and they will remove significant economic resources of disposable income and money circulating in the Scottish economy and in local communities. We in this Parliament can do better, and with independence we will do better for the children, families and communities of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683234", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child Benefit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Even if that were true&#8212;I have some doubts about the member&#8217;s figures&#8212;there is no point in improving the situation with regard to taxation if people&#8217;s entitlement to universal benefits is then removed.

It provides a focus for leisure and recreation activities and it is vital to life, our environment and our economy.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition to make Scotland a hydro nation reflects the importance that we place on our water resources. As Scotland seizes the opportunity to lead the world in tackling climate change, we also have an opportunity to demonstrate leadership in meeting the challenges that the management of water resources presents around the world.</p><p>The bill will place a clear and explicit duty on the Scottish Government to develop the</p><p>&#8220;value of Scotland&#8217;s water resources&#8221;.</p><p>To do that, the Scottish ministers will have additional responsibilities to</p><p>&#8220;take such reasonable steps as they consider appropriate&#8221;,</p><p>as the Deputy First Minister said. The bill will help to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s water has a sustainable future and will underline the worldwide contribution that Scotland has to make&#8212;which previous speakers have outlined&#8212;in areas such as water technology, governance, management and regulation. The bill will also play an important role in cementing Scottish Water&#8217;s international profile as a leading player in the water sector.</p><p>Notwithstanding specific concerns that I and other members have about the need for infrastructure investment in our communities, Scottish Water delivers one of the United Kingdom&#8217;s largest investment programmes for the lowest household bills. It will remain a successful and innovative public corporation.</p><p>The bill confers on Scottish Water the ability to do anything that it</p><p>&#8220;considers will assist in the development of the value of Scotland&#8217;s water resources&#8221;</p><p>and proposes a new duty on Scottish Water to take reasonable steps to develop its property, assets and expertise to promote the next generation of renewable energy. The bill will ensure clear and adequate separation between Scottish Water&#8217;s core and non-core functions, which will protect customers from increased bills.</p><p>During the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s consideration of the bill at stage 1, we heard evidence that profits from the non-core business could subsidise Scottish Water&#8217;s core functions and possibly reduce customers&#8217; bills. However, it is vital that the customer does not pay higher bills as a result of any shortfall in any of the functions of Scottish Water&#8217;s non-core business. When I questioned the cabinet secretary on that point, I was pleased to receive her assurance that</p><p>&#8220;Scottish Water&#8217;s regulatory regime&#8221;</p><p>is</p><p>&#8220;very clear about the protection of core services and&#8221;</p><p>stipulates</p><p>&#8220;that nothing in the non-core part of Scottish Water&#8217;s services should be subsidised by the money that people pay for water and sewerage services.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 7 November 2012; c 1094.]</p><p>Rather, Scottish Water&#8217;s commercial activities should support the Scottish Government&#8217;s overall purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth and the strategic objective of making Scotland greener.</p><p>In the evidence, a number of key stakeholders raised concerns about Scottish Water&#8217;s environmental impact. That point was well made by the committee&#8217;s convener earlier.</p><p>RSPB Scotland pressed the importance of creating in the bill</p><p>&#8220;a clear requirement to ensure that any use of Scottish Water assets for renewable energy generation is sustainable and balances social and environmental impacts.&#8221;</p><p>That point was echoed by Scottish Environment LINK, which stated that it is crucial that any duty on Scottish Water to develop the value of water resources ensures that development is sustainable and includes sufficient provision for the development of assets to achieve the correct balance between the social and environmental impact. Again, the cabinet secretary said in evidence to the committee that the current definition of value notes the importance of the economic contribution, but that it should not be</p><p>&#8220;to the detriment of other factors, such as environmental or social benefits.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 7 November 2012; c 1089.]</p><p>The Scottish ministers will expect Scottish Water to deliver its core functions with increasing efficiency, as was stated earlier, and at a standard that the people of Scotland expect and deserve. That impacts on every aspect of Scottish Water&#8217;s business, from corporate governance and accountability right down to the infrastructure that serves our local communities.</p><p>I have been contacted by constituents of mine from the Shandon area who have suffered no fewer than four serious flooding incidents with sewage-soiled water in the past 16 years. Those floods have arisen because of limitations in the physical capacity of the existing infrastructure. Scottish Water admitted in an email to me this week that it</p><p>&#8220;would require to carry out a capital investment project to provide additional storage or upsize the existing sewer.&#8221;</p><p>However, as yet, Scottish Water has refused to place those properties on the internal flood register. It stated that in order to qualify for inclusion on the register, a property must be assessed as being at risk of flooding during a</p><p>&#8220;1 in 10 year storm event.&#8221;</p><p>A previous event in July 2011 was assessed as being a one in 331-year event. Given that the flooding has happened four times in the past 16 years, that is understandably difficult for my constituents to accept. I am sure that other members of the chamber face similar issues.</p><p>There are therefore issues for Scottish Water regarding accountability. I am concerned that Scottish Water is the judge and jury in its own court when it comes to investment decisions. Is there no place for independent scrutiny of its assessments? I am sure that further clarification on that point would be welcomed by MSPs and the people we represent. As Scottish Water takes on new and onerous challenges to develop our most precious natural resource, it must not be allowed to forget its obligation to customers and people in my constituency and across the country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680425", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Resources (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In a nation that is blessed with as many natural resources as Scotland has, water has a special place as perhaps our most precious and important natural resource.

The condition, which is devastating and is the most common form of muscular dystrophy, mostly affects boys whose bodies do not produce dystrophin, which is a protein that helps to protect muscle. Without it, the muscles weaken, break down and are replaced by fibrous tissue. The first symptoms appear between the ages of one and three, and they usually result in the boys who are affected requiring a wheelchair by the age of eight to 11. Those who are affected may eventually need spinal rods to keep upright. By the time the person is 30, Duchenne is life threatening, as their heart and lungs are affected. In the most severe cases, people need respirators to breathe.</p><p>The motion commends the work of Action Duchenne, which is a charity that supports boys and men who live with DMD. As well as paying tribute to Dean Widd, the charity&#8217;s regional development officer, I give special thanks to my constituent John Miller, advocacy officer for Action Duchenne Scotland, his grandson Lee, aged 14, who has Duchenne and Lee&#8217;s dad, Gary, all of whom are in the public gallery this evening. I also thank Lee&#8217;s mum, Joyce, who is looking after Lee&#8217;s brothers this evening. John Miller has done a phenomenal amount to raise awareness of the condition while lobbying for DMD to achieve the clinical and political priority that it deserves.</p><p>I also pay tribute to the boys and men living with Duchenne, their families and the care support workers and healthcare professionals who are involved in their care. I also record my thanks to the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign for all its work.</p><p>I am grateful to Dr Keith Foster of the University of Reading&#8212;formerly of Royal Holloway College, University of London&#8212;for making me aware of his groundbreaking research</p><p>&#8220;such as the AAV U7 trial into potentially highly effective &#8216;exon skipping&#8217; treatment&#8221;,</p><p>which is highlighted in the motion.</p><p>The landscape for the development of gene medicines based on adeno-associated viruses has changed considerably over the past two years. Earlier this month, the European Commission licensed an AAV gene medicine&#8212;Glybera&#8212;for the first time. Although not in the field of DMD, that is a landmark moment as it defines a clear pathway for AAV-based gene medicines from the research laboratory bench to regulatory approval.</p><p>Two life science companies, GlaxoSmithKline and Prosensa, have already started treatment in a phase 3 clinical study in ambulant boys with DMD who have a dystrophin gene mutation amenable to an exon 51 skip&#8212;up to 13 per cent of boys with DMD. That randomised, placebo-controlled study has enrolled 180 patients from 18 countries and is currently the most advanced on-going study. I understand that all of the phase 3 clinical trial data are expected to be submitted to the European Medicines Agency&#8212;the evaluation agency&#8212;by early 2014.</p><p>Two further AAV-based research programmes have recently been approved and are recruiting patients for clinical trials that will start early in 2013. One research programme, based in Paris, will try to mask the mutation within the boys&#8217; muscle cells. The other research programme, based in the United States, will deliver a truncated DMD mini-gene using AAV into the muscles of DMD patients. In respect of clinical translation, an important point is that parameters to safely deliver adeno-associated viruses systemically to humans have also recently been defined and approved.</p><p>According to Dr Foster,</p><p>&#8220;Within the field of DMD research, progress has been astounding ... For the first time, I have developed a method to restore a full length DMD gene to muscle using three safe AAVs.&#8221;</p><p>Dr Foster states that this research is highly significant,</p><p>&#8220;such that a programme will be applicable for all patients with DMD and is long overdue.&#8221;</p><p>There is an opportunity for Scotland to be part of that groundbreaking research. High-quality testing relies on clinical trials involving large numbers of patients. For muscular dystrophy, Scotland does not have the patient population required to achieve that on its own, but that does not mean that we cannot or should not contribute to United Kingdom and international research.</p><p>Contributing to international research is one of the main functions of the Scottish muscle network, which has been involved in encouraging participation in global trials in a number of ways. The network also promotes the Duchenne registry, which ensures that families can be contacted about trials in which they might participate. There are currently around 70 people on the register.</p><p>Such collaborative approaches are where the focus must lie, and that is where the Scottish Government, through the chief scientist office and the health research strategy, has an important role to play. Action Duchenne is contributing &#163;161,000 to support Dr Foster&#8217;s research at the University of Reading. I would like to see Scotland play its part through co-funding arrangements so that we can support the joint initiative between the University of Reading and the University of Glasgow. Future studies in Glasgow will evaluate improvements to cardiac tissue. A co-funding arrangement would allow greater value and greater resource to be generated by the chief scientist office, working in partnership with medical research charities and potentially other health departments in the UK, to support this pioneering research. That has the potential to deliver the genetic medicines that will benefit boys and men with DMD.</p><p>The motion refers to the need to explore a simplified means of clinical trials for genetic medicines. I am delighted that progress is being made through the development of a road map that highlights the checkpoints and blockages that currently exist in the gene medicine developmental pathway for rare diseases so that we can fast-track clinical research programmes while ensuring the first principle of safety.</p><p>If we invest in research and improve the means for clinical trials, we will meet the ambition that the First Minister set out when he stated in June 2008:</p><p>&#8220;We are determined that standards of care and life expectancy match those in other countries.&#8221;</p><p>The debate is primarily concerned with the breakthrough in research that is giving hope to people with Duchenne and their families, but I will end as I began, by putting the debate into its proper context. My constituent Mark Chapman, who spoke eloquently when lobbying Parliament earlier this year, said:</p><p>&#8220;As adults we need support with social inclusion, we need access to education and employment, we need equipment such as cough assists and ventilators at point of need, we need access to new drugs and treatment. We have a right to live as best we can, be that independent living or not. We have the right to relationships, sex and our own families should we choose. We demand our right to live life. Dealing with Duchenne should be a big enough fight on its own.&#8221;</p><p>By supporting the research, the Scottish Government can leverage the value of every Scottish pound that is spent by matching it with research funding from elsewhere in the UK. If we do that, we will be meeting our moral and practical obligations to a group of exceptional and inspirational individuals and their families by finding a cure for this horrendous disease.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677483", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Parents are not meant to outlive their children.

I whole-heartedly support the efforts of non-governmental organisations and the grass-roots, student-led bollocks to poverty campaign, which involves a group of committed students from the University of Edinburgh, in their fight for tax justice. I pay tribute to their efforts to raise awareness of tax justice among a new generation of young people.</p><p>The tax justice bus has become an effective and highly visible campaign that raises awareness of the terrible damage that tax dodging inflicts on developing countries around the world. Tax is the most important, beneficial and sustainable source of finance for development. Tax revenue in Africa, for example, is worth 10 times the value of foreign aid. Putting a stop to tax avoidance is critical to securing long-term change and a sustainable future in the developing world.</p><p>The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have described tax avoidance as &#8220;morally wrong&#8221; and &#8220;abhorrent&#8221;. Despite that rhetoric, this year&#8217;s budget contained an announcement on relaxing controlled foreign company regulations. According to evidence given by ActionAid to the International Development Committee, those changes will cost developing countries more than &#163;4 billion a year. The CFC rules were put in place to deter UK-owned companies from moving profits to countries with a lower corporate tax rate than the UK, and they are specifically designed to curb tax dodging and the use of tax havens. After the changes, a UK-owned company will no longer have to pay a levy on any profits moved from a developing country to a tax haven.</p><p>That is likely to have a significant detrimental impact on the tax revenues of developing countries and I urge the UK Government to urgently rethink its plans. The chancellor should not make it easier for companies to use tax havens, especially when developing countries stand to lose billions in revenue.</p><p>The Tory Government denies the claims but does nothing to refute them, so the UK Government is undermining its own efforts to make provision for international aid and development. I fully endorse the call from the International Development Committee, urging the Treasury and the Department for International Development to conduct their own analyses of the figures. We need such scrutiny and we should not allow UK-based multinational companies to shirk their tax responsibilities at the expense of the poorest people in the world. Developing countries are precisely the countries that are most in need of our support and they will suffer as a direct consequence of the chancellor&#8217;s actions.</p><p>The Scottish Government, with the support of the Parliament, has doubled Scotland&#8217;s international aid budget to &#163;9 million since 2007 and it remains committed to our global responsibilities. Scotland can play an active role in alleviating poverty, which will contribute to the achievement of the millennium development goals. However, although international aid has a role to play, action on tax has the potential to deliver far greater gains.</p><p>A more sustainable way of promoting development should be considered, giving countries the freedom to pay for their own development by raising their own revenues. One way to do that is to fight against tax havens&#8212;again, I pay tribute to Christian Aid for the work that it is doing.</p><p>Tax dodging affects us all. It means less money for our roads, policing, schools and hospitals, but the impact is felt hardest by the people most in need, as essential services giving access to education, adequate medicine and clean water and sanitation are starved of much-needed funds. By putting an end to tax dodging, we can create not just a fairer, better Scotland, but a more equal and just world for everyone.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676952", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Christian Aid Tax Justice Bus"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will resist the temptation to launch into a rendition of &#8220;The Internationale&#8221; but I, too, congratulate Neil Findlay on securing this important debate.

The artificial distinction between harm reduction and abstinence has been highlighted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which said that there is no</p><p>&#8220;contradiction between prevention and treatment on one hand and reducing the adverse health and social consequences of drug use on the other.

We as a Parliament should be proud of the many good projects that exist across Scotland. In my city of Edinburgh there are some excellent examples of good practice. One example is the recovery hub, which acts as a one-stop shop, provides support services for people with problems associated with alcohol and drugs, and supports those people on their recovery journey.</p><p>Reference has been made by Richard Simpson and others to drug deaths. Dr Simpson&#8217;s suggestion of an NHS pilot, perhaps under the supervision of a pharmacist prescriber, is worthy of consideration.</p><p>Recently conducted research in deprived areas in the east of Glasgow shows that people on a good methadone programme are eight times less likely to die than people who are not on the programme. Also, 50 per cent of drug deaths involved methadone that had not been prescribed. That illegal redistribution of methadone is referred to as &#8220;leakage&#8221;.</p><p>The issue is complex and there may be a number of factors. There may be a lack of supervised dispensing, which allows for illegal redistribution. There may be no proper care plan agreement in place, with GP buy-in and appropriate supervision. The user may not be being prescribed the most appropriate dosage, which may lead to them taking illegal drugs as well as methadone. Those conditions often lead to the dangerous practice of poly-drug use, in which people take illegal drugs along with their methadone prescription.</p><p>Being drug free is not the only positive recovery outcome. As some members said, keeping people alive on methadone who might otherwise die from illegal drug use is surely a positive outcome as well.</p><p>There have been calls for time-limited programmes, but in fact there is no evidence anywhere in the world that such an approach would be successful. Indeed, the originators of methadone maintenance treatment envisaged not people being drug free after two years or so but a long-term programme with appropriate support.</p><p>That does not mean that we need to expect everyone to be on long-term prescribing. It is true that some people will require only a short period of methadone treatment. People can become drug free, with fantastic outcomes, but a broad range of support is required.

I join him in paying tribute to organisations such as Oxfam, Amnesty International and the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund for their work in highlighting the issue.</p><p>As Jamie Hepburn and others have said, later this year at the United Nations, the international community will have an exceptional opportunity to reduce violence and suffering in our world by agreeing an international arms trade treaty. It is therefore vital that we seize this opportunity to secure agreement and for the world to unite behind it. A strong treaty would reduce the number of arms that are going to countries across the world where they are used by Governments, such as the Assad regime in Syria, to repress and kill their own people in violation of fundamental human rights and in breach of international law.</p><p>The problem of the international arms trade is hugely significant, but it seems to have been overlooked. Although we have strict global laws on many products, such as bananas, we have failed to properly regulate the trading of tanks, machine guns and bullets. Every minute, at least one person dies from armed violence. Two bullets are produced for each person on the planet every year. The irresponsible transfer of weapons is often responsible for the prolonged violence in many countries, exacerbating poverty and pushing developing nations backwards.</p><p>In March, I had the privilege of introducing a debate in the Parliament on the violence in Syria, which, in recent days, has thrown the need for an arms trade treaty directly into the media spotlight. As Jamie Hepburn reminded us, on Tuesday a ship was stopped off the coast of Scotland on its way to Syria. It was found to contain attack helicopters and other weapons thought to be from Russia and intended to be used in violence and repression against civilians in Syria. Dr Mounir Atassi of Scotland4Syria has stated:</p><p>&#8220;These kind of helicopters are used against civilians&#8212;they target innocent people who are being killed every day.&#8221;</p><p>As Bill Kidd detailed in his speech, Russia has continued to supply weapons to Syria despite the EU arms embargo.</p><p>The international community needs to take decisive action, but we must ensure&#8212;as Alison Johnstone said&#8212;that the treaty that is agreed is effective and comprehensive. It must not be weakened but must be strong enough to protect civilians and uphold human rights. It should be based on the principal of no trading of weapons that would be used to violate human rights and international law. If that principal were upheld in the treaty, it would be not only strong but just.</p><p>A strong treaty is essential. First and foremost, it would save many lives and prevent millions of people from having to flee their homes. Secondly, 2,000 people die every day as a result of armed violence and Africa as a whole spends $18 billion a year on armed violence and conflict, which is about the same amount as it receives in aid from the rest of the world. Africa desperately needs to lift itself out of poverty, and we can only reflect on what an extra $18 billion could do to ensure that people in African countries could live free from poverty and increase their standard of living. Thirdly, such a treaty would prevent developing countries from being pressured into spending money on arms that they do not need.</p><p>The time for us to act has arrived. There is unity of purpose from individuals to national leaders and from local campaign groups to international non-governmental organisations. As I recalled in the debate on Syria, the UN has declared that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. Here is a golden opportunity to give real and significant backing to that ideal, to preserve life and to nurture security. Let us make sure that we grasp it with both hands.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Arms Trade Treaty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Jamie Hepburn on bringing such an important debate to the Parliament and on the compelling case that he made for an arms trade treaty.

It has reached a number of damning conclusions about the operation of the Crown Estate Commissioners and it has made a number of positive and constructive recommendations.</p><p>It is self-evident from the report that the Crown Estate is simply not fit for purpose. The process of devolution appears to have passed it by. The report helpfully sets out the facts. The post of head of the Scottish estate was abolished; the CEC stopped keeping separate accounts for its operations in Scotland; and it no longer had even a section on Scotland in its annual report. There is not much sign of devolution or a respect agenda for Scotland. If anything, the CEC has reduced its accountability in Scotland since devolution. That is unacceptable.</p><p>Where we should have had accountability and democratic structures, we have had centralisation.

Because the CEC is answerable to London, it is under no obligation to work in partnership with our economic development bodies. That is no longer credible.</p><p>The report provides a damning assessment of the Crown Estate in Scotland, which lacks accountability, transparency and clear consultation, communication and engagement with communities.

The anguish of the people of Syria is truly heartbreaking and is impossible for any of us to imagine. While we cannot imagine what the people of Syria are experiencing, we must not ignore their plight. That is why I took the view that the motion was necessary. It allows the Parliament to unite on behalf of the people of Scotland in showing our solidarity with the people of Syria in their hour of need.</p><p>I thank MSPs across the Parliament for their support and I warmly welcome the members of the Syrian community who have joined us in the public gallery. I am also grateful to my constituent Mr Adam Terris. It was his initiative and his request that led me to lodge the motion.</p><p>In early 2011, people in Syria started to protest against the governing Ba&#8217;ath party and President Assad. The Syrian Government&#8217;s response can be described only as brutal, inhuman and without doubt illegal. According to Oxfam, to date more than 8,000 people have been killed, more than 50,000 people have been declared missing and up to 59,000 people have been incarcerated. In February 2012, the violence escalated sharply. For nearly a month, Baba Amr, a suburb of Homs, was under siege. Heavy artillery and shells were used against civilian areas.</p><p>Amnesty International has said:</p><p>&#8220;The level and gravity of the human rights violations committed in Syria amount to crimes against humanity. The abuses are part of a widespread and systematic attack against civilians.&#8221;</p><p>Those crimes against humanity have included torture. Amnesty International has documented fresh evidence of systematic torture in detention and has presented yet more evidence of crimes against humanity.</p><p>Beyond the grim statistics lie individual acts of the most appalling brutality: crucifixion-type beatings, electric shocks, and male rape with broken bottles or metal skewers. One of the most appalling aspects of the conflict has been the way in which children have been targeted by the Syrian authorities. Only today, the United Nations human rights commissioner, Navi Pillay, told the BBC that</p><p>&#8220;Syrian authorities are systematically detaining and torturing children&#8221;.</p><p>She said:</p><p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone for the children&#8212;for whatever purposes&#8212;in large numbers. Hundreds detained and tortured ... Children shot in the knees, held together with adults in really inhumane conditions, denied medical treatment for their injuries, either held as hostages or as sources of information.&#8221;</p><p>When she was asked whether President Assad bore responsibility for the abuses, she said that there is sufficient evidence</p><p>&#8220;that many of these acts are committed by the security forces [and] must have received the approval or the complicity at the highest level ... President Assad could simply issue an order to stop the killings and the killings would stop.&#8221;</p><p>Ms Pillay said that she believed that</p><p>&#8220;the UN Security Council had enough reliable information to warrant referring Syria to the International Criminal Court&#8221;.</p><p>The suffering does not stop with the killings and torture. Up to 200,000 Syrians have fled their homes to escape the fighting. Food and water are becoming scarce and conditions are becoming dire. Aid agencies such as Red Crescent and Oxfam can assist refugees who make it to neighbouring countries, but humanitarian assistance in Syria is badly restricted.</p><p>Today, we have heard reports that there may have been a diplomatic breakthrough. We must all hope that a peaceful and lasting settlement can be found. According to the BBC,</p><p>&#8220;a spokesman for UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said he considered the Syrian acceptance of his six-point peace plan an &#8216;important initial step&#8217; but that implementation was key.&#8221;</p><p>The six-point plan calls for the Assad Government to remove troops and heavy weapons from population centres and for all parties to allow a daily two-hour ceasefire for humanitarian aid to reach affected areas. It also requires that the authorities release those who have been detained in the uprising.</p><p>I am sure that we all support the call for a daily pause in the fighting to ensure the evacuation of the wounded, permit safe passage to those who wish to leave and allow for the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance, but the weakness in the plan is that it does not impose any deadline for President Assad to implement its terms or call for him to leave power. Amnesty International has called on the UN Security Council to condemn the violations, to issue a comprehensive arms embargo and to freeze the assets of the President and his associates. The UN Security Council must take measures to hold to account those who are responsible, including referring the situation to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.</p><p>To look to the future, the international community must work towards the better regulation of the arms trade. UN members have the perfect opportunity to do that as they negotiate an international arms trade treaty later this year. Russia supplied ammunition to the Assad regime very recently, and Iran continues to smuggle arms. In the hands of such repressive regimes, that action can only exacerbate civilian suffering. An arms trade treaty must address such arms transfers.</p><p>The devastation in Syria is going on under the watchful eyes of the international community, but it weighs heavily in our hearts. As an international community, we have proclaimed that</p><p>&#8220;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&#8221;</p><p>As United Nations, we have declared that</p><p>&#8220;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person&#8221;</p><p>and, as an international community, we have stated that</p><p>&#8220;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;</p><p>Therefore, let us unite to condemn the fact that those fundamental human rights are being breached on such a massive scale and to endorse whole-heartedly the call by Ban Ki-moon for the world to speak with one voice to condemn the violence in Syria, ensure immediate and full access to humanitarian relief, and uphold fundamental human rights.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664532", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence in Syria"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Without any doubt, each of us in the chamber would wish that circumstances were such that the debate was unnecessary.

It is right that we as a Parliament take all necessary action to address the problem.

They, too, deserve credit for changing their stance.</p><p>That brings me to the Labour Party in Scotland. I pay tribute to former Labour health ministers, Susan Deacon and Malcolm Chisholm, for the lead that they have given by supporting minimum pricing. I also pay tribute to the convener of the Health and Sport Committee, Duncan McNeil, who has sought at all times to behave in a constructive and consensual fashion. However, when it comes to Labour&#8217;s official position, it will surely be for future generations to analyse the behaviour of Labour on this issue and to seek to understand why a progressive party of the left of centre refused to support a public health measure that had the support of every health professional organisation in the country, a policy that was backed by each of the four chief medical officers in the United Kingdom, a proposal that was endorsed by the medical royal colleges and a bill that was supported by many others across society. It beggars belief for Labour to proclaim not just that it knows best, but that it knows better than all those people and organisations.</p><p>This is a defining moment in public health policy in the UK. This is the moment when support for a policy that has been firmly established for some time in the wider policy community can finally be reflected by support for that policy from across the political spectrum. The Parliament must seize this opportunity to call time on Scotland&#8217;s relationship with alcohol and to do what the committee calls on us to do and support a measure that we on these benches are confident will save lives, prevent hospital admissions and improve the health of the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to make further progress.

We must ensure that the system of registration, regulation and inspection is not only fit for purpose but fully funded.

The care inspectorate also made it clear that, if circumstances were to change such that it no longer felt that it was sufficiently resourced, it would make the Government aware of the need for additional resources.</p><p>The report covered several other issues, such as whistleblowing so that staff can speak out on behalf of patients. That must be linked to ensuring that all healthcare professionals have a clear duty of care to report all concerns when they arise. The committee felt that that duty should be given far greater prominence in the training of all healthcare professionals.</p><p>This is an important report that can herald much-needed improvements in the regulatory system, but there must be a willingness to take action when it is required, and proper evaluation of progress over time must be done&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662481", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulation of Care for Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of Health and Sport Committee, I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on its report on the regulation of the care of older people.

We have heard this evening about the importance of fair trade in helping to make the world a fairer place and about Scotland&#8217;s ambition to become a Fairtrade nation. We can all unite across the chamber to champion that cause.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s commitment to fair trade is central to the values of our society, which is committed to tackling and eradicating poverty at home and abroad. The movement is a way in which individuals can directly bring real benefits to people living in poverty in developing countries.</p><p>Alongside the Scottish Parliament and organisations such as the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, Oxfam and Christian Aid, we are all campaigning for Scotland to become a Fairtrade nation. As a nation, we have an opportunity to unite in supporting efforts to ensure fair trading practices that will be of benefit to the developing world and that will make a real difference to the lives of the people who live there, as James Kelly said.</p><p>Many respected organisations in Scotland have joined together in the push for fair trade, creating the Scottish Fair Trade Forum. I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s support for the forum, which has seen its funding double between 2010-11 and 2011-12. I pay tribute to John McAllion, a former member of the Scottish Parliament, who will stand down as the chair of the forum later this year.</p><p>Fair trade is about better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers in the developing world. According to the definition set out by the Fairtrade Foundation,</p><p>&#8220;Fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalised producers and workers&#8221;.</p><p>I think that we would all support that.</p><p>Requiring companies to pay sustainable prices, which must never fall lower than the market price, fair trade helps to address the injustices of conventional trade, which traditionally discriminates against the poorest and weakest producers. Fair trade enables them to improve their position and to have more control over their lives.</p><p>According to the OECD Journal on Development, economic growth through trade is potentially the single most powerful tool for eradicating poverty. Even small increases in trade could result in billions of extra pounds for developing countries. However, as they stand currently, many international trade rules are still considered unfair. For example, according to SCIAF, there are still too many deals that protect big companies at the expense of small farmers or that force unstable and newly emerging economies in developing countries to open their markets to European products more quickly than they should. It is that which perpetuates poverty on a larger scale and it is fair trade that has the capacity to challenge the unfairness at the heart of the global trading system.</p><p>It is self-evident that a widespread change to fair trade standards will help to eradicate poverty. It will also aid our efforts to stop child and adult trafficking&#8212;something that Joan McAlpine talked about when she spoke of child trafficking in cocoa industry areas. If the developed world buys cheap cocoa and cotton, for example, and turns them into expensive chocolate and clothes, it is the poor in countries such as Ghana and the Ivory Coast who ultimately suffer and are forced into a cycle of hazardous and unfair farming practices. By supporting Fairtrade-certified producers and distributors, we are aiding a global cause that has the potential to make significant changes in trade and improve the lives of farmers and producers in the developing world.</p><p>Pursuing Fairtrade status for Scotland will lead to consumer benefit both at home and abroad; the creation of educational opportunities; environmental protection through the reduced use of pesticides; better medical care and increased standards of living in rural villages; and new methods of clean water access. We should embrace fair trade as a means of tackling those issues and we should all look forward to the day when Scotland can take its place as a Fairtrade nation.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like colleagues, I congratulate George Adam on securing this important debate.

I am not sure whether he was talking about Edward I, the hammer of the Scots, or his political heroine, Margaret Thatcher. He also took issue with the claim of right of 1689. The distinguished academic historian and author, Owen Dudley Edwards, who is a constituent of mine, has stated,</p><p>&#8220;They were not democratic actions&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>referring to the claim of right of 1689 and the church&#8217;s claim of right in 1842&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;but they were actions increasing momentum for democracy&#8221;.</p><p>I prefer Owen Dudley Edwards&#8217;s view of Scottish history to that of David McLetchie.</p><p>The idea of popular sovereignty was echoed in the original claim of right, which was passed by the Scottish Parliament in 1689. In England, James II was disposed of on the basis of what might be seen as a constitutional fiction, namely that he had abdicated by leaving the country for France. That was not the case in Scotland, as James VII was expressly removed from the throne by the Parliament of Scotland for being in breach of fundamental laws. It is against that background that the Lord President Cooper famously queried the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament as being</p><p>&#8220;a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law&#8221;,</p><p>as Christine Grahame said.</p><p>I pay tribute to the authors of the claim of right of 1988 for the care with which it was worded and the knowledge and appreciation of history that it displayed in acknowledging</p><p>&#8220;the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of Government best suited to their needs&#8221;.</p><p>Its authors clearly had a better grasp of Scottish history than did Tony Blair, who, as Chic Brodie reminded us, said:</p><p>&#8220;Sovereignty rests with me as an English MP.&#8221;</p><p>Placing limits on the powers of Government is not a Scottish idea. Increasingly, the notion of untrammelled parliamentary sovereignty is becoming as extinct, arcane and outmoded as such notions as the Crown in Parliament or the divine right of kings. Instead, over the centuries, citizens throughout the world have put limits on the powers of their rulers through written constitutions or international instruments that reflect a belief in fundamental rights. Similarly, the right of peoples to self-determination is an increasingly accepted doctrine of international law. The UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights opens with the simple notion:</p><p>&#8220;All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.&#8221;</p><p>For us on the SNP benches, constitutional change is the means to achieving that and unlocking it within our society.</p><p>Thus, the idea of popular rather than parliamentary sovereignty that we are debating this afternoon is old in origin, but modern in application. It is a significant piece of Scottish history, but it is part of the European and international mainstream. The sovereign will of the Scottish people is an idea that has been invoked at various crucial points in our history.

We should welcome that as democrats, and it is in keeping with our traditions and heritage.</p><p>The Scottish Government has made it clear that it is willing to include an additional question on further substantial devolution if there is sufficient support for such a move. There are those in civic society, such as the voluntary sector, the churches and the trade unions, who wish to see a second question. I say to my friend and colleague Margo MacDonald that we should not dismiss that, but listen to what they have to say. That view appeared to be supported by the former Labour MP and UK minister Brian Wilson, who stated in The Scotsman on 11 January:</p><p>&#8220;If a way can be found to offer the Scottish electorate a more rounded choice, then why not?&#8221;</p><p>My question to the Labour benches is, why not?

Edinburgh emerges in survey after survey as one of the most attractive places to live and work, with quality of life there rated as being among the best in the UK.</p><p>The success and prosperity of Edinburgh and Scotland are inextricably linked. If Scotland is to succeed, Edinburgh, as our capital city, must grow and prosper. It has attracted, and will continue to attract, talent and investment from around the world, which power growth and jobs for the city and the country. Therefore, the extent to which our capital achieves the targets that are set out in the City of Edinburgh Council&#8217;s economic strategy should be of interest to us all and not just to members from Edinburgh and the Lothians. That strategy has the ambition for Edinburgh to be</p><p>&#8220;a confident, creative and inspiring city ... where the public, private and third sectors collaborate with common purpose; and ultimately a city which puts the people of Edinburgh at the heart of its economic success.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that members all agree with that. Edinburgh is keen to work alongside our other great cities in developing collaborative propositions that can be delivered at a scale that will be attractive to potential investors. I acknowledge that the Government is fully aware of the need for such collaborative working and is committed to the establishment of a Scottish cities alliance, but Jackson Carlaw made a fair point when he said that such an alliance should not be an end in itself. It should be designed to pull together representatives of government, our six cities, and the private sector&#8212;all at the highest level. It would, however, be helpful to understand how the priorities for collaborative working that are set out in the agenda for cities will be determined and what measures will be used to evaluate the success of the approach. I also endorse Drew Smith&#8217;s call for comparative work that would allow us to learn lessons from other locations on what works best and how to apply those lessons to Edinburgh and Scotland.</p><p>As I have already said, Edinburgh is one of our great cities. That makes it all the more important that we set out a vision of our capital as a place that its people and businesses can be proud of. The City of Edinburgh Council&#8217;s economic strategy aims to focus on four specific areas, each of which is designed to consolidate and expand Edinburgh&#8217;s already outstanding role as an engine of local and national prosperity.

By 2018, 37,000 more people could be looking for work in the city than there are jobs available. Tackling the jobs gap and creating the conditions for growth, investment and employment is the key economic challenge that is faced by all who have an interest in the city&#8217;s prosperity and wellbeing. We simply must address that issue and continue to work to resolve it. I would therefore welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s view on how Edinburgh should address such challenges.</p><p>Seven growth sectors have been identified in the Government&#8217;s economic strategy, including life sciences and our universities, both of which have already been referred to this afternoon. They are areas of particular strength for Edinburgh. Our capital city&#8217;s prosperity has always been sustained by its long tradition of academic excellence, and that is more relevant than ever. The city&#8217;s great universities work hand in hand with the private sector and public agencies to deliver outcomes that are recognised around the globe. That is particularly true in life sciences, renewable energy, and green technologies. Academic and intellectual excellence in those areas is a vital part of our knowledge economy and a major contributor to our economic prosperity.</p><p>The University of Edinburgh, which has its King&#8217;s buildings in my constituency, is in every way at the heart of the city, and has for hundreds of years enhanced beyond measure the capital&#8217;s quality of life. In the 21st century, it plays an important ambassadorial, cultural and international role in promoting the city and Scotland. Indeed, Times Higher Education recently ranked it as the seventh-best university in Europe.

I thank colleagues in the Labour Party and the Scottish Green Party and my Scottish National Party colleagues for their support in bringing the debate to the Parliament.</p><p>Under international pressure 10 years ago, chocolate companies signed up to a voluntary non-binding document that set out concrete steps to eliminate the worst forms of child labour and forced labour from all cocoa farms by July 2005. As the report by Tulane University sets out, 10 years on, the industry has singularly failed to meet that deadline and to implement the protocol.</p><p>The protocol grew out of the concern expressed in 2001 about reports of human trafficking and physical abuse in west African cocoa farming in Ghana and Ivory Coast. It is named after US Representative Eliot Engel and US Senator Tom Harkin. The protocol is about growing and processing cocoa beans and their derivative products in a manner that complies with International Labour Organization convention 182.</p><p>I pay tribute to the organisations that have campaigned against the widespread use of child labour and child trafficking on cocoa farms in Ivory Coast and Ghana. In particular, I commend the 10 campaign, which is run by civil society groups around the world, including the International Labor Rights Forum, World Vision and Stop the Traffik. I also pay tribute to members of the media. Good investigative journalism in the public interest serves our society well, and I have nothing but praise for the BBC&#8217;s sterling work in that regard.</p><p>West Africa is the largest supplier of cocoa in the world&#8212;it accounts for 70 per cent of global cultivation. The US Department of State estimates that more than 109,000 children in Ivory Coast&#8217;s cocoa industry work under the worst forms of child labour and that 10,000 or more are victims of human trafficking or enslavement. Such cocoa production is characterised by deplorable conditions, including child trafficking, the worst forms of child labour, labour-intensive production and harvest, poor health and safety measures, low incomes for cocoa farmers and the use of pesticides and fertilisers with damaging effects on public health and the environment.</p><p>Cocoa is traded through a local and international supply chain. Ivory Coast and Ghana are the two largest cocoa-producing countries. By 2012, it is estimated that global chocolate consumption will have increased by 15 per cent since 2006.</p><p>A handful of companies dominate the international cocoa trade and in some countries, such as the USA, that concentration is even greater. Three companies dominate grinding capacity in the cocoa chain and have 40 per cent of global cocoa processing. A further six companies dominate the chocolate market&#8212;they are the household names Cadbury, Nestl&#233;, Mars, Ferrero, Hershey and Kraft Foods. This is big business: cocoa imports to the US are valued at $4.3 billion.</p><p>There is a role for national Governments and the consumer, but the primary responsibility lies with the companies. Such global companies could and should meet their global corporate and social responsibilities, and their moral responsibility, but they have singularly failed to do so, despite signing up to the Harkin-Engel protocol.</p><p>The protocol was meant to address child trafficking and the worst forms of child labour in the industry in west Africa. Its signatories were to develop and implement a</p><p>&#8220;Key Action Plan and Steps to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor&#8221;,</p><p>which would include a</p><p>&#8220;Public Statement of Need for and Terms of an Action Plan&#8221;.</p><p>The protocol states:</p><p>&#8220;Industry has publicly acknowledged the problem of forced child labor in West Africa and will continue to commit significant resources to address it.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to say that</p><p>&#8220;the occurrence of the worst forms of child labor in the growing and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products is simply unacceptable.&#8221;</p><p>It remains unacceptable, but the promise to commit significant resources has not been realised.</p><p>We were promised action on</p><p>&#8220;the formulation of appropriate remedies&#8221;</p><p>for children who were removed from child labour, but little progress has been made. There was meant to be action to identify &#8220;positive developmental alternatives&#8221; for the children removed from the industry, but that too has failed to materialise.</p><p>There was meant to be</p><p>&#8220;a binding memorandum of cooperation among the major stakeholders that establishes a joint action program of research, information exchange, and action to enforce the internationally-recognised and mutually-agreed upon standards to eliminate the worst forms of child labor&#8221;</p><p>in the sector, and</p><p>&#8220;independent means of monitoring and public reporting on compliance with those standards.&#8221;</p><p>That is probably the biggest failure of the industry 10 years on from the protocol. There was also meant to be a not-for-profit foundation with significant resources committed to it in order to help</p><p>&#8220;to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.&#8221;</p><p>The fact that a few companies dominate the market gives them enormous purchasing and selling power, but it also gives them the opportunity to work to bring about a sustainable cocoa economy, as Oxfam and others have said.</p><p>Where there should have been action, there has been inaction. Where there should have been specific, detailed, concrete action to remove and protect children from the worst forms of child labour, there has been a distinct lack of good faith and a lack of will to make good on the pledges that were solemnly and publicly entered into in 2001.</p><p>What is the reality for children as a result of that inaction? The BBC&#8217;s journalist Humphrey Hawksley, reporting from the Ivory Coast earlier this year, told us first hand about the plight of those children. He stated:</p><p>&#8220;I found a group walking along a muddy path towards trees where bright yellow cocoa pods hung ready for harvest. Silently the children squatted down and started work. They wore torn and grubby shorts and t-shirts. There was no laughter or play. On their legs were scars from machete injuries. There was no first aid kit around or any protective clothing.&#8221;</p><p>That is life for those children, and such stories shame humanity.</p><p>The industry&#8217;s direct connection to child labour, human trafficking and slavery is indisputable. It is, as the industry has itself stated, &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;, and yet it continues. The situation is an affront to human rights and to standards of decency and the fact that such a manifest injustice can be perpetrated with apparent impunity in the 21st century is truly shameful.</p><p>Nelson Mandela said that to value our children is to value our future. The chocolate industry has shown by its failure to implement the Harkin-Engel protocol that it does not value the children of west Africa. That must change, and there are some signs&#8212;prompted by the media coverage to which I have referred&#8212;that that may at long last be beginning to happen, with the announcement by Nestl&#233; that child labour will in future have no part to play in the supply chain.</p><p>Scotland as a nation can be a force for justice in the world. Let our collective voice ring out from the Parliament today on behalf of those children who have no voice, and let us demand justice on behalf of enslaved children and all children who are the victims of the worst forms of child labour.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658058", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child Trafficking (Cocoa Industry)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I open the debate to mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin-Engel protocol, which was signed on 19 September 2001.

Back in 1999, it was one Michael Russell who initiated such a debate in the fledgling Scottish Parliament. On that occasion, our Parliament was unanimous in its support for a motion that stated that religious discrimination should have no part in a modern society.</p><p>I recall that one of the most eloquent agitators for change in that debate was the Conservative MSP and former minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton. I recall, too, the spirited efforts of Norman Hogg, the former Labour MP for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, who raised this matter at Westminster.</p><p>The impetus for the debate is, of course, the agreement that was reached at the recent Commonwealth heads of Government meeting in Perth, Australia. That agreement will see amendments to legislation in the United Kingdom and 14 other legal jurisdictions that will allow future monarchs to marry a person of the Catholic religion and will remove the current gender discrimination relating to the line of succession. Both changes are welcome.</p><p>However, as the motion states, it is a matter of disappointment that the changes will not go further and sweep away the discrimination that prevents a Catholic from ascending the throne. In fact, the announcement raises the question, if we can find a way to resolve the discrimination against women, and if we can find the will to resolve the discrimination against those who are married to Catholics, why cannot we find the will and the way to end the discrimination against Catholics themselves? I believe that there is a way, if only the United Kingdom Government can summon the political will. The UK Government has an opportunity to act decisively, but it has chosen to act half-heartedly, which is a matter of deep disappointment.</p><p>As a nation, we oppose discrimination. We believe that no one should be denied the opportunity to participate in society because of their race or ethnicity, their disability, their gender or sexual orientation, their age or their religion.

The member makes a fair and reasonable point that will, I am sure, carry support from across the chamber.</p><p>For me, the issue is straightforward. A society that, on one hand, opposes discrimination should not, on the other hand, enshrine discrimination in its very constitution and at the very heart of its national life. It might well be true that the Crown is now reduced to being a ceremonial part of the British constitution, but as Cardinal Keith O&#8217;Brien has said, the legislation that we are debating not only is &#8220;arcane&#8221; but</p><p>&#8220;causes offence and is hurtful&#8221;.</p><p>As long as we have a monarch as the head of state, the issue remains as pressing and as significant as it would be if we had a bar on a Catholic becoming our head of state through election as president.</p><p>The motion seeks to maximise agreement across the chamber, to build consensus and to reaffirm the will of the Scottish Parliament on the issue. Previous Governments have asserted that the issue is too difficult and complex to deal with, requiring, as it would, changes to various pieces of legislation. That argument has never been convincing. Robert Blackburn, who is a professor of constitutional law at University College London, has written that</p><p>&#8220;this complication would hardly bother the government&#8217;s legislative draftsmen&#8221;.</p><p>Professor Blackburn argues that reform measures such as the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which transformed the office of Lord Chancellor and the position of the law lords, were far more complex, as are the annual finance acts, which he argues are worse in terms of detail and comprehensibility.</p><p>The argument about complexity has always been weak, and now that the UK Government has announced two significant changes, which will require amendments to at least eight significant pieces of legislation, that weak argument becomes entirely obsolete. Nevertheless, the UK Prime Minister refuses to go further and to end the discrimination for fear that allowing Catholics and other non-Anglicans to succeed to the throne would conflict with the sovereign&#8217;s role as supreme governor of the Church of England, as John Mason said. That strikes me as being the most absurd case of putting the cart before the horse. What is the more important role: head of state or head of the Church of England? Are we to say that discrimination at the heart of our constitution must be tolerated, for fear that doing away with it might interfere with the working of the Church of England? Surely it is possible to protect the status of the Church of England while at the same time removing this unjustifiable barrier.</p><p>We all understand that the matter falls outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, but while this Parliament does not have the legislative power to act, it has a political responsibility to lead. It also has a democratic duty to reflect the values of our society and our communities. I believe that by speaking out against the provisions in the Act of Settlement, we are reflecting the values of the vast majority of Scottish society. There is widespread support among members of our religious communities, including the Church of Scotland and the Hindu and Muslim faiths, for ending the discrimination that the act contains.</p><p>Very recent polling shows that a clear majority of the Scottish public are in favour of repeal, and that support for repeal is even stronger in Scotland than it is elsewhere in the UK. There have been many welcome changes since the Act of Settlement, including Catholic emancipation, universal suffrage and votes for women. We should not allow one of the last vestiges of discrimination to remain in place.</p><p>In 1999, this Parliament spoke with a clear and unequivocal voice to call for the repeal of the Act of Settlement. Even with the changes that the UK Government has proposed, the discrimination at the heart of the act will remain in place. I believe that that is unacceptable. Now is the time for our Parliament to reaffirm its commitment to equality. This is our opportunity to restate our view that participation in every aspect of national life should be open to all, regardless of religion.

It recognises that, for every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest without defibrillation, the chances of survival are reduced by around 10 per cent&#8212;that information is from the European Resuscitation Council&#8217;s 2010 guidelines for resuscitation&#8212;and that immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, can triple the chances of survival.</p><p>Coronary heart disease and stroke are a clinical priority for the national health service in Scotland, and reducing the number of deaths from heart disease is a national priority for the Scottish Government. Therefore, it is right that we should debate what more can be done to save lives through greater awareness of and support for emergency life-support training in schools.</p><p>I add my support to that which has been expressed by other members in support of the emergency life-support campaign&#8212;a coalition of organisations led by the British Heart Foundation Scotland, Chest Heart &amp; Stroke Scotland, and Lucky2BHere. All those organisations are campaigning for every child in Scotland to be taught emergency life support in schools. I recognise that the campaign has attracted significant and growing support from, among others, the Scottish Ambulance Service, the St Andrew&#8217;s Ambulance Association, the British Medical Association, the Resuscitation Council UK and the Royal College of Nursing. As we have heard, the campaign has the support of parents, the public and schoolchildren.</p><p>Why does emergency life support matter? The obvious answer is that it is a set of actions needed to keep someone alive until professional help arrives. Each year, 30,000 people in the United Kingdom have cardiac arrests outside the hospital environment, of whom fewer than 10 per cent will survive to be discharged from hospital. There are around 25 cardiac arrest calls each day in Scotland to the Scottish Ambulance Service; evidence shows that around two thirds of cardiac arrests that occur outside hospital occur in the home and that nearly half that occur in public are witnessed by bystanders.</p><p>The objective must be to teach our children and young people the valuable life skills that will remain with them throughout their lives. It is also about schools teaching children and young people how to save a life. We all want our children to learn skills, such as how to ride a bike, play a musical instrument and speak a foreign language. Why do we not add how to save a life to that valuable set of life skills? A survey conducted by the British Heart Foundation found that 78 per cent of schoolchildren want to learn how to save someone&#8217;s life in an emergency, while 86 per cent of teachers agree that emergency life support should be taught in schools.</p><p>Health and wellbeing is a central pillar of the curriculum for excellence, and it includes learning how to respond in a range of emergency situations. It is important that we recognise the vital role that the NHS and charitable organisations can play in visiting schools to help to give children and young people the skills that could save a life.</p><p>The experiences and outcomes in the curriculum for excellence contain a section on physical wellbeing, which includes the statement:</p><p>&#8220;I know and can demonstrate how to keep myself and others safe and how to respond in a range of emergency situations.&#8221;</p><p>It is important that schools and local authorities put in place the resources and commitment to take forward that learning.</p><p>To support Scottish schools and local authorities, officials from the Scottish Government, Education Scotland and relevant charities are working in partnership to develop a case study resource on the teaching of emergency life-support skills, which will be issued to every school in Scotland.</p><p>The vision and ambition must be to ensure that every child leaves school knowing how to save a life, creating a whole new generation of life-savers.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655380", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Heartstart"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to speak in this debate, and I congratulate Siobhan McMahon on bringing this important issue before the Parliament.

Foremost among those is ensuring the health and wellbeing of the older population, people with long-term conditions and those who are trying to remain in or return to work after illness or injury. The motion rightly highlights the crucial role that rehabilitation and enablement strategies and policies can play in translating those positive aspirations into concrete action and service delivery on the ground. I will touch on three areas: older people&#8217;s services; the health of the workforce; and the needs of people with a learning disability.</p><p>Ensuring the long-term health and wellbeing of our growing older population is a serious challenge, with a third of the Scottish population projected to be over 60 by 2033. However, we should be in no doubt that the provision of care for older people that preserves their dignity and independence is one of the most important duties of any civilised society. Ensuring that older people can remain independent in their own homes is what we all want for our own care and that of our families. With the right support packages in place, we can ensure that optimal care is provided. As has been stated, the benefits of that arrangement extend beyond the person who is receiving care, as it allows NHS boards and local authorities to focus and work together to reduce the number of unnecessary hospital admissions and to speed up discharge from hospital after a crisis.</p><p>One of the key challenges is in unlocking the money that is currently tied up in the acute sector to bring about a shift in resources and services from acute hospitals to care that is delivered in the community. The change fund is a key route by which we can bring about that shift&#8212;a shift that is absolutely vital if we are to meet the demographic challenge of an ageing population. The change fund has the potential to leverage in additional resource to support services and to bring about the change that we want.</p><p>I turn to the health of the workforce. The Scottish centre for healthy working lives, which is funded by the Scottish Government, has undertaken important work in that area. Earlier this year, it published &#8220;Working Health Services Scotland&#8221;, an evaluation of projects that were delivered in the Borders, Dundee and Lothian. Those projects involved 1,247 people who were referred to a programme that offered support to individuals working in small and medium-sized businesses who had a health condition that was affecting them at work. Eighty per cent of those people had a musculoskeletal disorder, while 11 per cent presented with mental health problems and 9 per cent had other conditions. The project used a biopsychosocial model utilising case management and provided access to physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychological therapy and counselling services. That interdisciplinary model of working delivered significant benefits. Eighty-three per cent of the people who were absent from work when they entered the programme were at work when they left the programme, and 78 per cent of those who had been long-term absent from work&#8212;absent for 31 days or more&#8212;at entry were at work at discharge.</p><p>How we integrate those ways of working into mainstream health services is a key issue, but it is clear that allied health professionals are key to the delivery of rehabilitation and enablement services throughout Scotland. They work within multidisciplinary teams across health, social care and education, and they have particular expertise that is invaluable. Allied health professionals can promote independent living, and their input can lead to a better use of resources and improve health outcomes for patients.</p><p>The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy would like patients to have the ability to self-refer to a physiotherapist. Given that a person is able to self-refer to a podiatrist through their general practitioner practice&#8212;a service that is available within NHS Lothian&#8212;should they not also be able to self-refer to a physiotherapist, considering the health benefits that such a measure would bring? At the moment, the wait to see a physiotherapist can be up to 10 weeks, during which time a person&#8217;s condition can worsen. Early intervention, diagnosis and appropriate referral and treatment are key to ensuring optimal care and can help someone to remain in work rather than go on incapacity benefit. As we have heard from other members, that approach may also prevent admissions to accident and emergency departments. Avoiding those scenarios will of course save resources.</p><p>How we bring about the necessary culture change and embed it in clinical practice is one question that confronts us. How do we enhance the role of allied health professionals, such as physiotherapists and speech and language therapists? I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s announcement today on the development of a national delivery plan for allied health professionals, which will be the first such initiative in the United Kingdom. The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists has sought clarification on the plan&#8217;s roll-out. It has asked whether a quality service standard for AHP services will be included and whether the quality strategy measurement framework and the health improvement, efficiency, access and treatment targets will be developed to include access to AHP services. I hope that the minister will address those points in summing up.</p><p>As the deputy convener of the proposed cross-party group on learning disability, I highlight the fact that people with learning disabilities face particular challenges in society as one of our most vulnerable groups. Those people depend on social care services or a carer&#8217;s support to live fulfilling and meaningful lives.</p><p>Enable Scotland estimates that some 3,000 people over the age of 65 care for a family member. I welcome the fact that 20 per cent of the change fund for older people&#8217;s services has been set aside for carers and I hope that older people who look after a younger relative with learning disabilities will be able to access those resources. The eligibility criteria for accessing services, the inconsistent levels of provision and the disparity in care charges among local authorities across the country are all issues that the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland has highlighted.</p><p>Action is needed on all those matters to change a culture of dependence into one of self-management, for the sake of the carer, the health professional and the user alike. We would do well to acknowledge the importance of rehabilitation and enablement for the future of a safe, effective and sustainable health and social care service.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation and Enablement"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion sets out several key challenges that we face as a society.

She and Gordon MacDonald set out the extent of the problem and the challenge that we face if we are to reduce the cost of prescription medicine waste to the NHS in Scotland. Nanette Milne made a valuable speech from her professional perspective.</p><p>Richard Simpson talked about the approach that NHS Lothian, in my area, has taken. NHS Lothian estimates that, in 2008, the cost of prescription medicine waste was &#163;3 million. That is the equivalent cost of 75 nurses, or 460 hip replacements, or 260 heart bypass operations. We are right to be concerned about the financial cost to the NHS of prescription medicine waste and the need to secure best value for the taxpayer, as the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Royal College of Nursing highlighted in advance of the debate. I note that the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said in its briefing:</p><p>&#8220;There is no conclusive evidence on whether the decision of the Scottish Government to set prescription charges to zero has had any impact on levels of medicines waste.&#8221;</p><p>In addressing the issue, we need to consider the factors that give rise to medicine waste. We also need to acknowledge that not all such waste is avoidable. Let us take the case of a patient who stops taking their medicine because their condition improves, or a patient who discontinues their medicine because of an adverse drug reaction, which in the UK is subject to the yellow-card reporting system, or indeed a patient who stops taking a particular medicine so that they can progress to a different and more effective treatment. In each case, we can see that what matters most is not the cost to the NHS but the safety and appropriateness of the patient&#8217;s care.</p><p>We must surely minimise waste where we can and I have no doubt that much more can be done in that regard. We must also provide the care and treatment that are most appropriate and effective for the patient. In their report, &#8220;Evaluation of the Scale, Causes and Costs of Waste Medicines&#8221;, researchers from the York Health Economics Consortium at the University of York and the University of London school of pharmacy said:</p><p>&#8220;in welfare terms significantly greater returns could be generated by better medicines use, as opposed to waste reduction per se. Improving adherence in medicine taking can improve health outcomes.&#8221;</p><p>If we consider the wider policy context in which this debate is being held, we can reflect that there have been significant and positive developments in Scotland since the publication of &#8220;The Right Medicine: A Strategy for Pharmaceutical Care in Scotland&#8221; in 2002. One successful initiative was the establishment of a national medicines utilisation unit, to provide the NHS in Scotland with valuable information on how medicines are used, for example through the development of a hospital medicines utilisation database, which identifies how medicines are used in hospitals and allows linkage between information sources. Perhaps we can explore the role that the medicines utilisation unit might have in addressing the important issue of waste.</p><p>There is also an enhanced role for pharmacists and nurses as supplementary and independent prescribers, who provide more timely access to appropriate treatment for patients. There is growing confidence on the part of community pharmacists throughout the country.</p><p>Members might ask what all that has to do with prescription medicine waste; I think that medicines utilisation, pharmacy prescribing and dispensing and community pharmacy all have a role to play if we are to address and tackle the issue better in future.</p><p>The Scottish Government said that work is being progressed through the national prescribing workstream of the NHS Scotland efficiency and productivity programme.</p><p>I hope that we can tackle waste by addressing the issues of the role of annual patient medication reviews and repeat prescribing; reducing the length of supply from 84 days to 56 days, and perhaps in time to 28 days, could make a difference. We also need to ensure that the effective therapeutic partnerships&#8212;GPs, pharmacists and others working together&#8212;can help to improve quality and reduce inefficiency in the system.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prescription Medicine Waste"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Margaret Mitchell on securing the debate.

People may struggle to find and keep a job, they may find themselves without a roof over their head and they may face physical and mental health challenges on a daily basis.</p><p>It is right that our Parliament should be at the centre of the debate about how best to provide appropriate support to ex-service personnel, and it is right that the Scottish Government should continue to engage with the range of organisations that actively support veterans in overcoming the challenges that confront them. Veterans Scotland, the Scottish Veterans Association, Poppyscotland and the Royal British Legion are just some of the organisations that are dedicated to improving the lives of ex-service personnel.</p><p>I join colleagues across the chamber in putting on record my appreciation of those who have served and are serving in the armed forces and for the organisations that support veterans and their families. As we approach remembrance day, the poppy of remembrance is a poignant reminder of the sacrifice of previous generations in two world wars and in conflicts since in the Gulf and elsewhere. The poppy also brings to mind the poppy fields of Afghanistan, which is a stark reminder of the conflict in which servicemen and women continue to risk and, yes, to lose their lives in the service of their country.</p><p>We can all acknowledge the debate and the controversy that have inevitably surrounded the decisions to go to war in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya; at the same time, we can pay unqualified and unconditional tribute to the courage, sacrifice and service of those servicemen and women who have served their country in each of those conflicts.</p><p>We can all agree that the cost of conflict and the pain of war are very real indeed for families who have lost a loved one and for service personnel who see their own lives transformed through injury and disability. The Scottish Government must stand ready at all times to do all that it can to support our veterans and ex-service personnel. That is why I welcome the specific initiatives that have been taken in Scotland to do just that. The Scottish veterans fund, for example, is, as we heard from the minister, a dedicated fund for Scotland&#8217;s war veterans that was launched in May 2008. The fund has provided grants for 33 projects in support of veterans.</p><p>One such project is the Mark Wright Project, an outdoor programme in the Lothians led by qualified outdoor activity specialists that will help veterans to regain physical and mental strength through a range of outdoor pursuits. Erskine homes have been helped to provide supported accommodation through a pilot that provides five cottages alongside welfare, retraining and employment advice for recently discharged service personnel.</p><p>The resources are rightly targeted at projects and organisations that work directly with veterans and their families. The fund complements the veterans challenge fund, which is administered by the Ministry of Defence.</p><p>Other initiatives include funding of &#163;1.2&#160;million for the Combat Stress initiative to support mental health services for veterans; more than &#163;500,000 to fund the Combat Stress outreach service; an investment of &#163;2.3&#160;million to support the Scottish Veterans Residence to build 50 flats in Glasgow; and the introduction of concessionary bus travel for injured veterans. All those measures have been supported by the Scottish Government to improve the lives of our veterans.</p><p>I also highlight the valuable work undertaken by Edinburgh Napier University at the military rehabilitation, assessment and research centre at Napier&#8217;s Sighthill campus and welcome the centre&#8217;s director, Chris Connaboy, who is in the public gallery. I am grateful to my parliamentary colleague Gordon MacDonald for his on-going interest in the centre&#8217;s work. Its long-term vision is to become a centre of excellence in, among other things, providing the best clinical assessments for injured service personnel and conducting cutting-edge research to enhance the performance, care and rehabilitation of armed forces personnel. Edinburgh Napier University and the national state-of-the-art prosthetics group are working with NHS Lothian&#8217;s south-east mobility and rehabilitation technology&#8212;or SMART&#8212;centre in the grounds of the Astley Ainslie hospital in my constituency to develop the best future provision of military prosthetic care. I look forward to the publication in spring 2012 of the Scottish Government&#8217;s new strategy in response to the armed forces covenant that the Westminster Government is taking forward and to working with everyone who provides care and support to veterans and their families.</p><p>The motion calls for society to meet its debt to our ex-service community. In truth, that debt can never be repaid when judged against the sacrifices that have been made. However, as Richard Simpson suggested, we can unite as a Parliament to ensure that our remembrance day commemorations last beyond 11 November and that we provide the lifelong support that our veterans and their families deserve.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Politicians and Governments who send our young men and women into battle and ask them to put their lives on the line have a duty to ensure that when those same men and women come home, having been discharged from the armed forces, and return to civilian life, society does all that it can and more to support them.

The wellbeing of people who require social care is a fundamental issue and the decisions that we take in this place will most certainly affect future generations. We must work together constructively across the chamber to strengthen and safeguard the sustainability and quality of social care services.</p><p>We face a number of challenges, of which we are all well aware: the integration of health and social care; the need to ensure that quality and not just price is the driver in the procurement process; and the need for a robust system of regulation with a strong voice for the public and with service users at its heart. There is an opportunity, through the proposed social care (self-directed support) (Scotland) bill, to empower many more people who wish to commission and receive care that is customised to fit their individual needs.</p><p>We are well aware, too, of the demographic shift: by 2031, the number of people aged over 65 in Scotland is expected to rise by 62 per cent. That figure alone testifies to the fact that there will be more people with long-term conditions and complex needs who will require to be cared for.</p><p>Therefore it is clear that health boards and councils have no choice but to work together more closely and effectively.

Every nation should be in a position to determine its own external affairs. Foreign relations is a field that affects the people of Scotland directly, but it is one in which Scotland has limited opportunity to take independent and decisive action. Be it in climate change negotiations, defending vital national interests in the EU, or the promotion of peace and justice in the world, Scotland&#8217;s voice is not heard as we would wish it to be heard. We are held back, not by our ambitions or hunger to influence change, but by the constitutional constraints upon us.</p><p>Today I will focus on the Scottish Government&#8217;s international development policy. Within external affairs, international development is arguably one of the Scottish Government&#8217;s most successful policies. Scotland has been able to make ground despite the limited capacity to which I have referred. Indeed, Oxfam recently stated:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s International Development Fund ... has grown from its infancy in 2005, into a more mature and significant tool with which to help fight poverty in developing countries on behalf of the Scottish people.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that we all agree with that.</p><p>Many constituents whom I spoke to in the lead-up to the election, including a number of supporters of the British Red Cross, demanded a firm commitment that the Scottish Government&#8217;s &#163;9 million budget for international development would be protected, so I am glad that the Scottish Government has been unequivocal in its commitment to protect the current level of investment, while being mindful of the fact that the global recession and its consequences will be felt more sharply in developing nations.</p><p>It is regrettable that the UK Government defence secretary, Mr Liam Fox, recently set his face against there being a legal target to meet the United Nations national aid target of 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2013. Indeed, according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the five nations in the world that have so far exceeded the UN target are small or medium-sized European countries, such as Norway, Sweden and Denmark. I am sure that the cabinet secretary will share my aspiration to see Scotland in a position to fully contribute and adhere to international aid commitments in the same way as many of our European counterparts do. The truth is that, in 2011, we still live in a world in which, according to the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, approximately 22,000 children die each day because of hunger and malnutrition. The challenges that developing countries face are compounded by the lack of basic infrastructure and public services, such as clean water, sanitation, health and education.</p><p>The SNP Government made a commitment to play its part in helping to achieve UN millennium development goals by committing &#163;13 million over three years, which has gone towards projects in some of the world&#8217;s most disadvantaged nations&#8212;places such as Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda and Darfur. Those projects aim to tackle severe health problems, to ensure that sustainable sources of food can be achieved and, above all, to provide training to ensure that we have doctors, nurses and teachers on the ground.</p><p>The largest Scottish Government-funded programme&#8212;I associate myself with Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s earlier remarks&#8212;is the Malawi development programme. To cite a successful example of the scheme, the Mary&#8217;s Meals project is now feeding more than 10 per cent of the school population in Malawi. The principal aims of the millennium development goals are to eradicate poverty and hunger and to halve the proportion of people who are living on less than $1 a day.</p><p>The Scottish Government must continue to monitor the progress and success of the projects that it funds. To that effect, it is encouraging that the independent review of the Scottish Government&#8217;s projects in Malawi concluded that 32 of the 39 projects selected had met a number of key expectations&#8212;they were, for example, efficiently delivered, effective in meeting their planned outcomes and reasonably sustainable. Last year, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said:</p><p>&#8220;In a few short years Malawi has come from famine to feast; from food deficit to surplus; from food-importing country to food exporting country.&#8221;</p><p>Part of that success has come from ensuring that countries such as Scotland successfully manage projects through credible organisations, thereby ensuring that the development can be achieved in partnership with communities and non-governmental organisations.</p><p>I highlight the work of Christian Aid, which has exposed the cost of tax avoidance in developing countries. Christian Aid has estimated that tax avoidance by multinational companies costs developing countries somewhere in the region of &#163;100 billion a year&#8212;one and a half times what those nations receive in international aid.</p><p>The challenge for the international community is to introduce a system of country-by-country reporting as an international accounting standard in order to prevent tax evasion. Forcing companies to reveal more information, including information on the profits that they make and the taxes that they pay in individual countries, would prevent them from hiding their profits and avoiding their financial, social and corporate responsibility to the world&#8217;s poorest. If countries such as Malawi had access to those funds, they would be able to build schools and hospitals, to improve their infrastructure generally and to lift more people out of poverty. In a country where thousands of children have been orphaned by HIV-related illnesses and people have a low life expectancy, those so-called missing millions would go a long way in alleviating poverty on a massive scale.</p><p>The European Commission has been exploring the potential introduction of a new accounting standard for multinationals, and I would be interested to know&#8212;perhaps the cabinet secretary could tell us when she sums up&#8212;whether the Scottish Government has made representations in support of such reforms, or would be in a position to make them, to the Commission and the UK Government. Scotland can provide leadership on the global stage on issues such as climate change, nuclear disarmament and international aid, and it is high time that we had the real powers that would allow us to have a genuine international voice.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649457", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Culture and External Affairs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in today&#8217;s debate.

Mike is a political adversary, but he has never been a personal enemy. He has been a friend of the communities and people of south Edinburgh for more than 20 years, providing conscientious public service first as a City of Edinburgh councillor and then as the constituency MSP. Members will wish to join me in wishing him and his family well for the future.</p><p>The Parliament draws its strength from the diversity of experience and views that are found within it, but we surely do our best on behalf of our constituents when we are able&#8212;I accept that it is not always easy&#8212;to rise above our different political perspectives and reach agreement on what is best for the people of Scotland.</p><p>One of the Parliament&#8217;s proudest achievements has been the introduction of free personal and nursing care for older people, so today I will focus on the care of older people. In doing so I declare an interest as a former employee of the Royal College of Nursing&#8212;during my employment with the RCN, I campaigned on this issue.</p><p>In recent days there has been widespread coverage of problems in the care home sector, in particular the continuing investigation at the Elsie Inglis nursing home. It is shocking and distressing when there are cases of abuse of older people.</p><p>The role of Government is to ensure that the regulatory regime is robust, to keep that system under constant review and, where necessary, to strengthen it. We must always act to address failings and shortcomings when they arise through proper inspection, and we must also be prepared to carry out further investigation where appropriate.</p><p>In acknowledging difficulties when they arise, we should also recognise and pay tribute to those healthcare professionals&#8212;be they nursing, medical or other staff&#8212;whose job it is to provide high-quality patient care each and every day in a variety of settings. Two such settings are in my constituency, at Liberton hospital and at the Astley Ainslie hospital. Providing appropriate high-quality care to an increasingly older population is one of the most fundamental challenges that we face as a society. By 2031, 1.3 million people will be at or above the state pension age&#8212;one in four of the population. The cost of free personal and nursing care for older people is set to rise&#8212;and rise significantly&#8212;as the population ages.</p><p>The Scottish Government estimates that around &#163;4.5 billion is spent every year on older people&#8217;s services. About a third of that&#8212;&#163;1.4 billion&#8212;goes on unplanned emergency admissions. At the moment, the situation can be characterised as one where the patient follows the money, rather than the money following the patient. Much of that money is currently tied up in spending on the acute sector, rather than being used to provide services where they should be provided and where the most effective outcomes can be achieved&#8212;in the community.</p><p>The rise in the number of emergency admissions to hospital is a real and growing issue, and behind each statistic lies a human story: an older person who has a relapse or complication with their condition; someone who develops a new problem that was previously undiagnosed; or a person who has complex medical needs or social problems. The point is that not all those people are receiving the optimum care, and they are not all receiving their care in the most appropriate setting. If we were to reduce unplanned emergency admission rates by even one tenth, we would save around &#163;560 million in the course of the next spending review. How we unlock that money and make it follow the patient is one of the key issues to address if we are to make progress.</p><p>The Christie commission is charged with examining public sector reform, and I urge its members to make clear recommendations to ministers. If the rising cost of care and unplanned emergency admissions are the problem, the solution must be the integration of health and social care.</p><p>Research by Age Scotland, whose national office is in my constituency, shows that only 26 per cent of people over 50 believe that the current structures for delivering health and social care by separate organisations should remain. Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland, who chaired the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly, which was UK-wide, and who carried out the Scottish Government&#8217;s review of free personal and nursing care in Scotland, said:</p><p>&#8220;Lead commissioning provides the best and quickest way of achieving an integrated care system, and I believe the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach is the right one.&#8221;</p><p>If we get it right and make the right improvements, we will ensure that older people receive care packages promptly and that delayed discharges, lengths of stays in acute hospitals and unplanned emergency admissions to hospital are reduced.</p><p>We must confront the rising costs of people living longer and we must allow people to stay at home, with good support, rather than be admitted to hospital or residential care. We must utilise the opportunities of telehealth to support independent living in the community. Those are just some of the issues that we must face as we seek to meet our responsibilities to our older citizens. Professor Sutherland said:</p><p>&#8220;The time for talking is over. It is now time just to get on with it.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government is getting on with it. It is getting on with the job of delivering the integration of health and social care.
