That concerns all of us, of course, as is evident in the efforts that are made by the providers of food banks, the volunteers who distribute the food and work in the centres, and all the people and organisations that donate to ensure that some of our most vulnerable people get food on the table.</p><p>A number of members have mentioned that Scotland is a wealthy country. Last week, however, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation published a report that said that living standards fell between 2008-09 and 2011-12, which increased the proportion of people living below the minimum income standard to 21 per cent. The report summary says:</p><p>&#8220;in 2011/12, the proportion of families below the standard rose sharply, as benefit and tax credit cuts started to kick in.&#8221;</p><p>That is a clear indication of the damaging impact of the welfare cuts that are coming from Westminster, which will, it is estimated, reduce benefits in Scotland by more than &#163;4.5 billion in the five years to 2015.</p><p>Where is that money taken from? It is taken from the very people whom we have been talking about in this debate: workers on low incomes, families, those with long-term illnesses or disabilities, tenants in receipt of housing benefit, and people in the most vulnerable circumstances. They are precisely the people whom society should be helping, not harming.

I might talk a bit more about that later.</p><p>I am sure that we are all aware of constituents who turn to food banks when they struggle to make ends meet. We should try to understand the issues and help as much as we can. That is why the Scottish Government commissioned research on the nature of food aid provision in Scotland, which Nigel Don referred to earlier. That research was published in December. We now understand more about the extent of emergency food aid in Scotland and that welfare and benefit changes are a major cause of the substantial increase in the use of food banks.</p><p>As members have probably heard, I met Lord Freud last week. At that meeting, I took the opportunity to give him a copy of our research and to inform him of some of the damaging impacts of the Government&#8217;s welfare reform programme on our citizens in Scotland. Meanwhile, the UK Government&#8217;s research on food banks remains unpublished by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Perhaps that is why we have no representatives of parties in the UK Government in the chamber today; clearly, they are not as concerned about food banks as others are.</p><p>We have heard a lot about the cost of living and the low incomes of many people in Scotland. Part of the contract between the people of Scotland and the Scottish Government is our defence and extension of certain core universal services, rights and benefits through the social wage. That includes increasing the provision of free nursery education; freezing council tax; paying the living wage to all staff covered by the public sector pay policy and encouraging other employers to follow our lead; and, from January, extending to families throughout the country the entitlement to free school meals for all children in primaries 1 to 3, which will be worth around &#163;330 a year for each child who takes those meals up.

By freezing council tax, paying the living wage and having free prescriptions, we are helping families; we are not leaving people out. That is the contract that we have with the citizens of this country. We have made efforts to mitigate some of the worst impacts of welfare reform policies. We have provided &#163;40 million to protect people from the 10 per cent cut in council tax benefit and &#163;7 million for welfare mitigation. We have invested &#163;9.2 million in the Scottish welfare fund.</p><p>A lot of questions have been raised about the Scottish welfare fund and I absolutely agree with members. The fund was set up to ensure that money got out to the people who needed it most. It is a new fund; we know that councils have never had to operate it before. As was mentioned, early on, take-up of the fund was not as we anticipated. However, as I announced in the chamber last week in answer to a question, our informal feedback from local authorities and informal statistics to December show that since we introduced easier access to the fund and changed some of the criteria, we have seen take-up rising much higher. That information has been shared with the Welfare Reform Committee and it shows that the fund will be taken up and is now being used in the way that it should be. People are not directed from the welfare fund to food banks if they would qualify for the welfare fund; it is only if they do not meet the criteria for the fund that a local authority will send them to food banks. If anyone has examples of something different happening, we need to have them.</p><p>That is about mitigation and, as I have said, we are mitigating the impact of UK Government policies in Scotland. However, mitigation is not enough. In &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221;, our white paper on independence, we set out why we believe that there is a better way for social security in Scotland. I appreciate that we all share the same views on food banks, but I feel strongly that the way forward for Scotland is to be an independent country and to ensure that we have a social security system in which we all have a stake&#8212;one that we contribute to when we can and, in turn, are able to access when we need to. It needs to be fair, transparent and sympathetic to the challenges faced by people, and respectful of personal dignity, equality and human rights. Benefits should not relegate those who cannot undertake paid work to a life of financial uncertainty and poverty. Welfare support needs to support a standard of living that ensures dignity and enables participation in society.</p><p>I believe passionately that independence would allow the Scottish Parliament to make decisions on welfare; reverse the most damaging of the Westminster changes; ensure that we have a system that better meets Scotland&#8217;s circumstances; and allow us to build a fairer and more prosperous country where&#8212;as everybody in this chamber agrees&#8212;we do not want to see food banks.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22883964", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Banks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I said earlier in the statement, we have a contract with all the people of Scotland.

In Pakistan, we are giving Oxfam &#163;350,000 to assist small-scale farmers to improve their productivity, while in Malawi we are providing Oxfam with &#163;400,000 to deliver a project that is focused on addressing the needs of vulnerable women who have been affected by HIV and AIDS.</p><p>Of course, that is just a flavour of the work that Oxfam does around the world, which is having a huge impact on people&#8217;s lives, reducing poverty and fighting inequality wherever they exist. That is work to which Scotland contributes globally, not just through the funding provided by the Scottish Government, but through the contribution of Scottish taxpayers to the UK Government&#8217;s development assistance programmes and, of course, through donations and purchases made by people in Oxfam&#8217;s 51 shops with 1,000 trained volunteers up and down the country, which members mentioned and on which they commented.</p><p>Last year, Oxfam celebrated 50 years of working in Scotland and, in that time, it has done a marvellous job in raising awareness among the general public of the inequalities that, sadly, persist in many parts of our world.</p><p>Oxfam played a crucial role in highlighting the problem of global hunger through last year&#8217;s campaign, enough food for everyone if. That influenced the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to give funding to the six development education centres in Scotland that provide training and support for Scottish teachers to equip our young people to become global citizens and be aware of the challenges that our world faces and the role that we can all play in helping to tackle them.</p><p>The make poverty history campaign in 2005 is another example of how Oxfam has worked with other organisations to help draw attention in Scotland to the issues that face people in the developing world.</p><p>Oxfam has a track record of dedication and commitment as well as a passion to make a difference to people&#8217;s lives throughout the world. I can see that passion reflected in the lift lives for good campaign that it has launched.</p><p>The campaign rightly highlights the two biggest threats to ending poverty: the growing gap between the richest and the poorest people in the world; and the damage that is caused to poor people by climate change. The Scottish Government takes both of those issues seriously. Right now, our &#163;9 million international development fund is focused on helping some of the poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.</p><p>The &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; publication sets out clearly what action this Government would take in an independent Scotland to help the world&#8217;s poorest people, including commitments to spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on overseas aid, ensure that all our policies across Government do no harm to countries in the developing world, promote gender equality, and give careful consideration to the question of unjust debts.</p><p>We also fully support the lift lives for good campaign&#8217;s focus on highlighting the issue of climate change. The Scottish Government strongly recognises the voices of those who are in the front line in relation to the impacts of climate change. They are suffering from a changing environment that is causing increasingly erratic weather patterns, crop failures, water shortages and newly spreading diseases. Our world-leading &#163;3 million climate justice fund is a recognition of the injustice of climate change and the fact that those who have done least to cause the problem have been most affected by its impacts.</p><p>The fund is already helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change for people in Malawi and Zambia and, last October, the First Minister announced a doubling of the climate justice fund, which will provide further support for vulnerable communities in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The Scottish Government is pleased to support this motion and commends the work of Oxfam in drawing attention to the issues of global poverty and inequality through the campaign. I encourage everyone to get shwopping. I will certainly be doing that. The Government is determined to do what it can to make a difference and I am pleased that, through this motion and today&#8217;s debate, the Parliament will encourage the people of Scotland to support Oxfam&#8217;s lift lives for good campaign in its aim to make an impact on poverty around the world.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:38.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lift Lives for Good"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to close the debate on behalf of the Scottish Government.

The figure that I had was the almost &#163;600,000 one and my last words as I left the office were, &#8220;I am not going to argue with the member moving the motion!&#8221; I am glad that we have sorted out the matter, and think that the award is well deserved.</p><p>The motion highlights the benefits of support services to older people, particularly those who find it difficult to manage some household tasks themselves but who, with a small bit of help, can continue to live independently at home. The fact that Scotland&#8217;s older population is growing is something to celebrate, because it is proof that we are using advances in medicine and technology to live longer and healthier lives. The Government recognises that organisations such as Food Train are vital in delivering good outcomes for older people and acknowledges their contribution to our wider work on housing and support for older people</p><p>&#8220;Age, Home and Community&#8221;, the Scottish Government&#8217;s 10-year strategy for housing and support services for Scotland&#8217;s older people, was published in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in December 2011. We were delighted to include the work of Food Train as a case study in that strategy and I was happy to hear of the recent award from the National Lottery&#8217;s investing in communities fund, as that will allow the organisation to expand its services.</p><p>Between 2010 and 2015, the Big Lottery Fund will invest &#163;300 million though its Scottish grant programmes, which equates to an investment of &#163;1 million a week in Scotland&#8217;s communities. Food Train&#8217;s award of almost &#163;600,000 will help to support many vulnerable older people in Dumfries and Galloway over the next five years. I was interested in the accounts of Alex Fergusson and Aileen McLeod of their days out with Food Train, which I am sure have given them great insight into its work. Hearing about their experiences has certainly given me an insight.</p><p>As we know, current population projections forecast that the number of people aged over 75 will increase by 82 per cent by 2035. Although that presents us with a significant challenge, Scotland has a track record of delivering real benefits to older people, including free personal and nursing care. We have retained those benefits in the face of current spending pressures and plan to continue them.</p><p>It is vital to have the right housing and support for older people, as that will help to enhance people&#8217;s quality of life, help them to feel safe and secure, help to reduce the number of falls and other accidents in the home and subsequent emergency hospital admissions, and allow us to make better use of our resources. Those will all produce good outcomes for elderly people.</p><p>Our national strategy for housing for older people is built around four themes, all of which are clearly shown in Food Train&#8217;s work: seeing older people as an asset, which is obviously vital to the organisation; choice; planning ahead; and prevention. Given that older people tell us that they want to remain at home for as long as possible, it is right that they, like anyone else, should have such a choice, and preventative services such as those provided by Food Train help older people to maintain their independence, retain control over their lives, stay active and contribute to their community.</p><p>A number of speakers have mentioned isolation. Although older people want to stay at home&#8212;and although we want the same for them&#8212;the one thing none of us wants is for them to feel isolated. Initiatives such as Food Train prevent that because they allow people to get involved; indeed, as others have made clear, the work done by volunteers in that respect must also be praised.</p><p>The point is that, in order to meet those needs and expectations, we need a range of different housing and support services. In 2011, we launched the reshaping care for older people programme and the accompanying &#163;300 million change fund, which supported many services that were aimed at improving older people&#8217;s independence and wellbeing.</p><p>A central theme of our work in this area is prevention. Its importance is widely recognised, particularly in the context of public service reform. We cannot pretend that we can always prevent falls or deterioration in health. However, like the services delivered by Food Train, there are many services that can support wellbeing and reduce the likelihood of traumatic and costly hospital and care home admissions.</p><p>Good progress has been made in recent years but, as I said, we need to tackle the social isolation of people who live independently at home.</p><p>Projects such as Food Train and the new living it up project, an initiative that supports active lifestyles for Scotland&#8217;s older people, have the ability to really change the lives of our elderly population, by which I mean our parents, grandparents, neighbours and friends, and, as Bruce Crawford said, all of us, one day&#8212;some of us sooner than others, and I include myself in that.</p><p>Issues affecting older people have rightly gained national prominence in the housing and health and social care agendas. However, we need to increase that momentum. As we implement our strategies and deliver Scotland&#8217;s vision for older people, joint working across the public, independent and third sectors will be vital to the achievement of success.</p><p>Food Train is making a significant contribution to the delivery of preventative services in a number of areas across the country, and I am delighted to hear about the success of the project and the significant funding award from the Big Lottery Fund.

For example, the national housing trust initiative, the first guarantee-based model for housing in the UK, is going from strength to strength, with deals being secured with 13 developers across 10 council areas, generating around &#163;150 million of housing development.</p><p>I turn now to homelessness. In 2003, the first devolved Scottish Parliament unanimously and rightly set an historic target to ensure that every unintentionally homeless person should have an entitlement to settled accommodation. In 2008, Iain Gray described that as</p><p>&#8220;the best homelessness legislation in the world,&#8221;</p><p>but admitted that,</p><p>&#8220;we didn&#8217;t build the housing to make it work&#8221;.</p><p>Instead, it has fallen to this Administration, in tough economic times, to build homes and to deliver on that historic commitment, which I confirmed almost a year ago.</p><p>At the same time, we have also made progress in reducing the number of children in temporary accommodation, alongside wider falls in recorded homelessness in Scotland. For example, in 2012-13, the number of households with children in temporary accommodation reduced by 551 or 16 per cent. Those figures are going in the right direction, but we are not complacent. We want to minimise all time spent in temporary accommodation, and a temporary accommodation sub-group of key stakeholders, including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, councils and Shelter, is due to report to the homelessness prevention and strategy group this month. We will use that and other evidence to consider what further steps need to be taken on standards in temporary accommodation. We also recognise the importance of addressing rough sleeping, and will continue to focus on preventing that from happening wherever possible. The latest statistics again indicate continuing falls in recorded homelessness across Scotland, including falls in rough sleeping.</p><p>Our record on housing leadership over the past 12 months includes boosting housing supply budgets, outperforming Labour on affordable supply, staying on track to deliver 30,000 affordable homes, launching the help to buy Scotland scheme, expanding and developing the national housing trust, and achieving the historic homelessness commitment. Now, with the Housing (Scotland) Bill, which I introduced to the Parliament last month, the SNP Government will again take the lead. The bill will introduce a regulatory framework for letting agents, create a new private rented sector housing tribunal, increase flexibility in the allocation and management of social housing, and end the right to buy, thereby preventing the sale of up to 15,500 social rented houses over 10 years.</p><p>However, only independence will allow us to deliver policies that reflect Scotland&#8217;s values, support strong communities and promote social justice.

Energy Action Scotland has been fully involved in shaping our home energy efficiency programmes for Scotland, or HEEPS, and plays an important on-going role in ensuring that outcomes are delivered.</p><p>Fuel poverty has come a long way over the past 30 years, from a time when it was largely unknown to today, when it is recognised in the &#8220;Oxford English Dictionary&#8221;. That is not something that we should be proud of. It gives me no comfort, as the minister responsible for fuel poverty, that 684,000 households in Scotland were in fuel poverty in October 2011. That was an increase of 26,000 from 2010, but without the improvements in the energy efficiency of homes and in household incomes, the overall number would have been around 770,000 households.</p><p>Although energy efficiency is a sustainable solution, it will never be a total solution to fuel poverty. We need the full powers of independence to tackle all the causes of fuel poverty by addressing household energy efficiency, income and prices, so that Scotland can be a beacon of progressive action to tackle fuel poverty and maintain household incomes.</p><p>A few moments ago Jackie Baillie talked about a price freeze, which is something that the Scottish Government cannot do; we have no control over energy prices. Everyone in this chamber has agreed that rising energy prices are a huge part of fuel poverty, but we have no control over them.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Action Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Nigel Don for lodging the motion and I thank all members for their contributions.

If we have a date set for when the commission will report I will certainly write to Jackie Baillie with that.</p><p>Tackling fuel poverty is an absolute priority for this Government. We have a statutory duty, which we have been reminded of by a number of speakers, to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that people are not living in fuel poverty in Scotland by November 2016. We are doing everything within our limited powers to achieve that.</p><p>We know that fuel poverty is a vital social issue that affects families across Scotland and we have taken action to tackle it. Over the past three years the Scottish Government has invested more than &#163;220 million in a raft of fuel poverty and energy efficiency programmes. Our budget&#8212;for the avoidance of doubt&#8212;in this year is &#163;74 million and we have secured &#163;79 million funding for the next two years.</p><p>In contrast&#8212;we must look at this&#8212;Westminster has cut its fuel poverty funding. From 1 April this year, there have no longer been any UK taxpayer-funded fuel poverty programmes in England. It is the only country in the UK not to have Government-backed support on this important issue.</p><p>We know that the most sustainable way to tackle fuel poverty is to raise the energy efficiency of homes. I have mentioned how, in its role as a member of the fuel poverty forum, Energy Action Scotland has helped to shape the new HEEPS. Those programmes are being used to lever in additional money from the energy companies obligation, or ECO, and offer a support package to all those who struggle to pay their energy bills and keep their homes warm.</p><p>I want to make it clear that the HEEPS pilots&#8212;or the national retrofit programme, as it was known&#8212;indicated that we were levering in more than &#163;2 for every pound of Scottish Government funding. That is important and why we hope to achieve the &#163;200 million figure that has been talked about.</p><p>Of the funding that has been announced, &#163;46 million is for area-based schemes, which is very much what Nigel Don alluded to. The issue is about area-based schemes, through which fuel poverty can be tackled area by area, as opposed to bit by bit. The fuel poverty forum recommended that.</p><p>As I said, the predicted leverage of the ECO is &#163;130 million; there is also &#163;30 million of landlord funding. We have a memorandum of understanding to deliver the affordable warmth scheme, which has been signed with three suppliers to maximise the use of the ECO in Scotland. We have also announced a two-year extension to the energy assistance package that is worth &#163;32 million, which started from 1 April 2013. Up to August 2013, about 2,010 referrals had been made to that scheme and more than 700 installations had been completed.</p><p>The promotion of the hotline is not about reinventing or repeating something. Every time that the hotline is promoted, more people contact the advice centres and more people go on to the programme. We want to reach out to as many people in Scotland as possible, particularly as we approach winter, to ensure that they have a trusted source that they can contact to find out about the energy efficiency measures that they could be eligible for.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Action Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The commission&#8217;s remit is to look at how an independent Scotland can promote fairer, more affordable energy prices, and the role of the Scottish regulator in addressing fuel poverty, delivering affordability and security of supply and environmental sustainability.

It is clear that we must continue to work together if we are to tackle poverty effectively and dispel the myths around those in poverty and in receipt of benefits. I think that every member would agree that there are myths around poverty, which are peddled in many instances by part of the current UK Government and by some of the media. I have said that before, and I do not apologise for saying it again.</p><p>I understand how poverty affects people. For most of my working life I have been involved in front-line services that deal with the most vulnerable groups in our society: those on low incomes or on benefits, and the sick and disabled. I understand the circumstances that they are in, and I cannot stomach it when I hear such people labelled in some quarters as scroungers, when we should be working to understand the issues and help as much as we can.</p><p>The Poverty Alliance works very hard in trying to raise awareness of poverty. We recognised that in the &#8220;Annual Report for the Child Poverty Strategy for Scotland 2013&#8221;. We must listen to those affected by poverty and to what they say they need, rather than to what we think they need. That is why I regularly meet groups from around the country, including groups from the Poverty Alliance. I recently met a group from the Poverty Alliance to inform our strategy on health inequalities and to listen to what people in poverty had to say on the issues that affect them. It was a positive meeting and we got lots of practical suggestions; we will certainly consider them and will take some of them forward. The Scottish Government is committed to a long-term preventative approach to tackling the key drivers of poverty. We will continue that through the revised child poverty strategy, which will be published in the spring.</p><p>The Scottish Government will continue to protect household incomes. We recognised a long time ago that the cost of living was a real issue for people out there. That is why we introduced what we call the social wage: free personal care for the elderly; the abolition of tuition fees, bridge tolls and prescription charges; free eye examinations; the council tax freeze; concessionary bus travel for the elderly and disabled; and increasing the provision of free nursery education. All those things are intended to help people who are struggling to get by and make ends meet.</p><p>We are leading by example in ensuring that all employees for whom the Scottish Government is responsible will receive at least the Scottish living wage.

We are looking at every possible way of reducing poverty throughout Scotland.</p><p>I found it disappointing that, at the start of the debate, a number of issues were raised that brought politics into it. We are doing what we can to mitigate the worst impacts of welfare reform. We have already provided &#163;40 million to protect people from the UK Government&#8217;s 10 per cent cut in funding the council tax benefit successor arrangements; &#163;7.9 million for advice and support services; and &#163;9.2 million to top up the new Scottish welfare fund, which I want to say something about.</p><p>We are all disappointed that that new fund has not been taken up to the extent that we wanted it to be. We are currently carrying out a thorough review, and the guidance has been changed to make things clearer to local authorities, which administer it. We are also looking at and working on improving the consistency of the fund throughout Scotland. Our commitment to the fund was made absolutely clear when the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth announced that its budget would be kept at the same level for the next two years. We do not expect to reduce the fund just now; indeed, we want it to be taken up and will be advertising it and doing everything else possible to ensure that every penny of the fund is used for the vulnerable people who require it.</p><p>On fuel poverty, the Scottish Government continues to provide funding for the fuel poor. We have, for example, the HEEPS scheme and, in response to an earlier question about why the scheme has not been taken up, I point out that we experienced difficulties at the start because the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets and the UK Government were determining the rules for the energy company obligation. We therefore reckoned that there would be an underspend, and that provided some of the &#163;20 million that we are using to mitigate the bedroom tax. That should be recognised, because it illustrates the difficulties that we had in finding that money. However, we found it and ensured that it went back to vulnerable people. The fuel poverty budget will also stay the same for the next two years; we have not reduced it, because we expect the HEEPS scheme to be up and running, with contracts going and fuel poverty in Scotland being reduced.</p><p>Unlike the UK Government, we continue to support fuel poverty projects in Scotland; indeed, we are committing &#163;79 million to such projects to help the very people highlighted by Sarah Boyack. We have also continued the energy advice scheme, which replaced the energy assistance package, because we realised that people were still going to miss out under the UK schemes. The fact that we are committing &#163;60 million to the scheme for the next two years also shows that we are addressing fuel poverty.</p><p>I realise that I have gone over my time, Presiding Officer, so I will finish by saying that we will continue to take action to address fuel poverty. We are committed to the issue for the long term, but we need the support of everyone in the chamber.</p><p>I am more convinced than ever that, in order to deal with poverty in our society, we need to be in charge of our own economy and welfare system, so that we can ensure that they are fully integrated.</p><p>13:17 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698430", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Challenge Poverty Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

Make no mistake: we know that Gypsy Traveller groups are subject to widespread levels of prejudice, discrimination and abuse.

I will talk about unauthorised sites shortly.</p><p>We must look at how we can remove the barriers and we can do that only if there is a better understanding. We know that many of the issues that arise in local communities are very sensitive, but we need to balance the rights of the Gypsy Traveller population to follow their traditional way of life, and the rights of local communities to pursue theirs.</p><p>One area in which we need to balance those different rights is unauthorised sites. We are very keen that the group should examine the rights and responsibilities in relation to authorised and unauthorised sites. We will invite representatives from local authorities, COSLA, the Gypsy Traveller community, and other stakeholders to be in the group, to look at that issue in depth, and to try to resolve the problem. It is about rights and responsibilities.</p><p>The group will look into the quality of some of the local authority sites. I agree that some of the cases that Margaret McCulloch outlined are shocking and none of us wants to see that. I also recognise that residents of local authority sites pay rent and are entitled to get services for that rent, and we will look at that. No one in Scotland should have poor living conditions and, as part of its work, the group will look at including the option of issuing updated guidance to local authorities. We will also explore the development and implementation of a standard Gypsy Traveller site tenancy agreement with set minimum responsibilities and rights. We need to explore that fully with all interested stakeholders before we can make a decision on the best way forward.</p><p>Any agreement should be about the rights and responsibilities of all concerned. When Gypsy Travellers are on a site, the services that they can expect from the landlord should be clear to them, as should what they should do if those services are not being delivered. I want to see that set out clearly in any tenancy or leasing agreement.</p><p>We achieved previous success with the work of the north-east working party, which was chaired by the then Minister for Housing and Communities, Alex Neil. That brought together a wide range of stakeholders and produced a strategy with practical steps to improve and sustain community relations in the north-east.

The Oxfam report outlines how crucial tackling poverty and inequality is to achieving our vision of a successful Scotland</p><p>&#8220;with opportunities for all ... to flourish&#8221;,</p><p>as set out in the Scottish Government&#8217;s purpose. I absolutely agree with the report&#8217;s focus on helping the poorest in society. That is why tackling poverty and inequality is a central priority for the Scottish Government.</p><p>We are taking a long-term, preventative approach to tackling the key drivers of poverty. That includes the actions that are set out in our child poverty strategy on maximising household resources and improving children&#8217;s wellbeing and life chances. At a time when the UK Government&#8217;s austerity programme is placing households under increasing financial pressure, as we have heard from many speakers today, we remain committed to greater equality and social justice. I think that everyone who has taken part in the debate absolutely agrees with that, and I recognise the real cross-party support for John Swinney&#8217;s round-table meetings, which will reconvene to discuss the matter again.</p><p>As part of the contract between the people of Scotland and their Government, we are protecting household incomes through the social wage, free personal care, the abolition of tuition fees, the abolition of charges for prescriptions and eye examinations, and the council tax freeze. Those things all matter to families on low incomes and to those who are working and struggling to make ends meet. All the measures that we have taken are assisting those families.</p><p>I support the report&#8217;s comments on the living wage. The Scottish Government is leading by example in protecting the pay of the lowest earners&#8212;the ones for whom we have direct responsibility&#8212;and in ensuring that all staff covered by public sector pay policy are paid the Scottish living wage. We are actively encouraging all public, private and third sector organisations to do likewise. We are doing that not just because we believe that it is the right thing to do for the benefit of everyone in Scotland, but because international evidence shows that countries that achieve greater equality also perform better in economic terms. Social justice leads to social cohesion, which is a building block of economic success.</p><p>As a Government, we care about the wellbeing of the people of Scotland, how people live their lives, how they want to live their lives, and their aspirations and hopes. That is why our economic strategy and national performance framework include cohesion and solidarity targets that are designed to increase equality and reduce the disparities between different sections of our society.</p><p>I also think that our approach to regeneration reflects the report&#8217;s recommendations. We recognise the significance of local people identifying for themselves the issues and opportunities in their areas, deciding what to do about them and being responsible for delivering the economic, social and environmental actions that will make a real difference. We recognise that the changes required to make all communities sustainable will be achieved only when communities themselves play an active part in delivering change.</p><p>We have started from a strong position in Scotland, as there is already an impressive range of activity taking place throughout urban and rural communities, led by hundreds of committed local anchor organisations. They drive change across a broad spectrum that includes addressing environmental issues; promoting local economic growth; tackling unemployment; supporting vulnerable people; challenging health inequalities; and enabling arts and cultural activity. Crucially, they deliver things that local people know will make a difference.</p><p>During the recess, I visited a number of community anchor organisations throughout Scotland and saw what they were doing for the people and how they worked together to make a real difference for their communities. That is the kind of work that we all want to see.</p><p>Recently, the Scottish Government set up its people and communities fund, which aims to help a wide range of community anchor organisations to deliver outcomes that meet and respond to the needs and aspirations of local communities. It is important that we have organisations that focus on up-skilling, because people&#8217;s capability to move things forward varies among communities. We need to ensure that everyone gets those opportunities and chances.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695616", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oxfam&#8217;s &#8220;Our Economy&#8221; Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate John Wilson on securing the debate, because I welcome every opportunity that the Parliament has to make its voice heard on tackling poverty and inequality in Scotland.

She is a great champion for those with motor neurone disease. As she has explained, it is something that she cares deeply and passionately about.</p><p>We have heard many heart-rending stories about the impact of the condition on people and their families. I thank MND Scotland for its invaluable support for people living with the illness.</p><p>Given the prognosis, we know that people with MND need immediate support and care. It is important that they get the right support at the right time from the health service and social services, and that support is all the more important as the UK Government&#8217;s ill-judged cuts and changes to the welfare system take effect. I know that those reforms are causing a great deal of worry and upset for many people. One of the biggest concerns continues to be the flawed work capability assessment. The DWP has made it clear that, unless a condition is terminal under its definition&#8212;which is when a doctor says that life expectancy is six months&#8212;there is no automatic exemption from assessments, regardless of disability or health condition.</p><p>However, the DWP can decide whether to refer someone for an assessment at the start of a claim based on the evidence provided by the person making the claim and their healthcare professional. We have heard from everyone tonight about MND and life expectancy with the condition. In many cases, it is an absolute nonsense that people are sent for an assessment. I would agree with all the members who have said that&#8212;Kenneth Gibson described it as &#8220;plain daft&#8221;. Nevertheless, the DWP seems to be failing to take account of the evidence that is being provided to it. That is backed up by the many letters that we all receive on the issue.</p><p>The Scottish Government has raised concerns about the welfare reforms with UK ministers on several occasions. Recently, the Deputy First Minister wrote to Iain Duncan Smith specifically about the work capability assessment process. Despite three independent reviews, that process is still not working and yet another review&#8212;to be carried out by Dr Paul Litchfield&#8212;is under way. We have pressed the DWP to ensure that the latest review finally produces a process that is fair and equitable.</p><p>As we have heard from many members, the bedroom tax is another flawed policy that just will not work. The example included in the motion is a tragic case that demonstrates perfectly the indiscriminate effect of this shameless reform. The bedroom tax takes no account whatever of the circumstances of the individual concerned. Of those households in Scotland that are affected by the bedroom tax, 79 per cent contain an adult who has a disability that is recognised under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p><p>During the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, the Scottish Government made clear our objections to the reforms and asked for them to be withdrawn. We were especially mindful of the impact on disabled people, so we pressed for a specific exemption to safeguard those whose houses have been substantially adapted, often at considerable cost to local authorities. Although the UK Government acknowledged the issue, its preferred response was to increase discretionary housing payments so that local authorities could deal with what it described as the &#8220;hard cases&#8221;. The response was specifically aimed at those who have substantially adapted housing, but it does not provide the safeguard that a statutory exemption would provide. If exemptions can be made for foster and kinship carers and for those who serve in the armed forces&#8212;and I welcome those exemptions&#8212;surely people in substantially adapted disabled houses should also be exempt.</p><p>Scotland receives 6.5 per cent of the total DHP budget. Scotland and London have the same number of claimants who are affected by bedroom tax, but for 2013-14 Scotland will receive &#163;10 million in DHP compared with &#163;56.6 million for London. That is not fair, especially given that the original problem existed not in Scotland but in the south-east of England and in London in particular. I have repeatedly asked, and will continue to ask, for an increase in discretionary housing payments to alleviate the impact on our most vulnerable people and those with an illness or disability. The bedroom tax simply has no place in Scotland.</p><p>I note that the expert working group on welfare has today published its report, which I am sure will be an important staging post in the debate to come. I welcome the working group&#8217;s contribution and I note some of the themes emerging from its report, such as the need to treat people on benefits with respect. I echo those calls. People who are too ill to work or who are unable to obtain work should not be stigmatised. They do not choose to be in the position that they are in, so they should not be penalised for it.</p><p>At heart, the independence debate is about choices. It is about ensuring that the key decisions about what we want from our society and about Scotland&#8217;s future are made by the people who live and work in Scotland. We will be able to achieve a fairer welfare system for Scotland that ensures fair and decent support for people only through independence and with full control over welfare issues. I know that this is not a political debate, but, in response to Drew Smith, I point out that all parties in Westminster are now committed to keeping the bedroom tax and to keeping the benefits system as it is. There will be no improvement there, so the only option is the one that we are putting to the people of Scotland.

It has a three-year housing supply budget of &#163;181 million. That is not all that we are spending in Glasgow.

We have shared-equity programmes that help first-time buyers. Over the past six years, the funding to Glasgow City Council has been in excess of &#163;800 million.</p><p>To meet national targets, Glasgow needs to deliver strongly on housing, and the role of community-controlled organisations is vital in that. Housing associations face significant pressures. There is the impact of the cuts from the Westminster Government, which we have heard about, and there are the impacts of welfare reform. Alex Johnstone&#8217;s party in Westminster has imposed those things on Scotland, and he had a bit of a neck to suggest that, in some way, it is the Scottish Government&#8217;s fault and my fault in particular.

Like Patrick Harvie, I think that it was important that the Evening Times highlighted the Glasgow Central CAB&#8217;s work. Like Vincent Chudy, the manager of that CAB, I urge all private tenants to check that their deposit has been paid to one of the three approved schemes. All of us who are elected to the Parliament should highlight that at every opportunity.</p><p>We encourage tenants to think of themselves as consumers who can raise standards in the sector. That is one reason why we recently introduced the tenant information pack, which provides key information for tenants and landlords in an easy-to-read format and includes information on tenants&#8217; rights to deposit protection. As Marco Biagi mentioned, the launch of the pack is supported by the new Renting Scotland website, which is co-funded by the Scottish Government and Shelter Scotland. The website rentingscotland.org is an industry-wide information hub that offers practical guides for tenants and landlords. I have checked it out and can confirm that it provides key information and&#8212;an important point for someone like me&#8212;is user friendly and easy to access.</p><p>I will answer some of the questions that were asked. Clearly, private landlords have a duty to protect tenants&#8217; deposits under one of the schemes. If the landlord fails to do so, the tenant can apply to the sheriff court to enforce the law and the court has the power to fine the landlord up to three times the amount of the deposit. Local authorities can take such a breach of housing law into account when considering the fit-and-proper-person test for landlord registration and for the licensing of houses in multiple occupation.</p><p>Last week, I launched &#8220;A Place to Stay, A Place to Call Home&#8221;, which is the first strategy since devolution that is solely for the private rented sector. The strategy sets out what further action we will take</p><p>&#8220;to improve the quality of property management, condition and service&#8221;</p><p>to deliver a sector that works for tenants and landlords. We want to work with good professional landlords to help them to prosper, but we are also determined to take action against the minority of landlords who damage the image of the sector and our wider communities.</p><p>The strategy proposes a more focused regulatory system for the sector. We will identify new ways of targeting tougher enforcement action against the worst landlords using existing legislation. On the point that Malcolm Chisholm made, we will also look at a tie-in between the tenancy deposit scheme and registration. The fit-and-proper-person test can cover a number of things. For example, if someone was illegally evicted and lost access to the property as a result&#8212;as can happen&#8212;the local authority should look closely at whether the landlord is a fit and proper person to be a landlord.

That does not make us complacent. The Government recognises that we must work hard on the issue, because too many people, particularly young people, are homeless.</p><p>I will talk about the range of partners with whom we are working to prevent homelessness. I welcome the reference in the committee&#8217;s report to the work of the five local authority housing options hubs and its significant impact on reducing homelessness in Scotland and preventing young people from becoming homeless, which is important. If we can prevent homelessness in the first instance, that is the key.</p><p>The convener talked about the benefits that can be gained through family mediation. From my visits to organisations and conversations with homeless people, it has become clear to me that relationship breakdown is often a main factor in someone becoming homeless, whether the relationship is with a family member, partner or someone else. As the convener said, mediation is not the solution for everyone, but it certainly works for some people, particularly young people.</p><p>The convener mentioned respite. The steering group is considering the recommendations of the supported accommodation implementation group in that regard. I recently visited a homelessness project and spoke to a young person who was about to be reunited with her parents. She said that the space that the project had provided was all that she had required. I think that she had found that living on her own was not all that it was made out to be, so going home had become a more attractive option. I think that her parents had been spoken to and everyone had sat down and discussed the situation. Such opportunities should be there for everyone, and the steering group is considering the matter.</p><p>It is important that all our policies are joined up and that we are clear about the importance of approaches such as getting it right for every child. GIRFEC is a multi-agency approach, which puts the child or young person at the heart of all policies and service planning in Scotland.</p><p>There are no easy solutions to the varied and complex issues that lead to homelessness among young people. One approach is the work of the Scottish Government-funded national co-ordinators, who promote four key issues: employability; rebuilding social networks; service user involvement; and accessing furniture. Those issues are crucial for young people who face homelessness. As the convener said clearly, there is no point in just handing over the keys to an empty house&#8212;that is not the solution to the problem, but the start of many new problems. We all recognise that; it is what I find when I talk to people.</p><p>I set out to go around and speak to as many homeless people&#8212;young and old&#8212;as I could to discuss what support they get and the circumstances that make them homeless in the first place. I will continue to do that, because I very much recognise that many young people need support to help them sustain their tenancy, to live independently in their communities and, more important, to prevent them from becoming homeless again. As a result of our concern about the issue, we established the supported accommodation implementation group. Last year, the group issued its final report, which took an in-depth look at housing support for homeless people. Its proposals will be considered by the Scottish Government and COSLA homelessness prevention group, which we have kept going to progress the recommendations in the committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>Another development is the new housing support duty, which comes into force on 1 June. That means that local authorities must assess the housing support needs of certain homeless applicants and ensure that housing support services are provided to all those who need them. We are working with local government and other key stakeholders to develop guidance to help councils implement the duty. The feedback that we have had so far has been very positive.</p><p>The committee report expressed concern about life skills and the resources that are available to teach young people financial management skills from an early age. Education Scotland and its partners are developing a series of half-day workshops for secondary school teachers to discuss financial education in the context of curriculum for excellence. The committee noted that a lot of work has been done by local authorities and their partners to address housing education in schools. The housing options hubs are actively sharing practice in that area.</p><p>The availability of suitable accommodation can make a huge difference to a young person&#8217;s outcomes leaving care. To look at that issue, we established a throughcare and aftercare activity hub on accommodation for care leavers as part of the looked-after children strategic implementation group. The group has an important role: it is looking to develop a model housing protocol for care leavers based on existing best practice. That issue will be discussed at a national event for care leavers in October, which will be attended by the Minister for Children and Young People.</p><p>The committee report highlighted the fact that welfare reform presents a significant threat to sustaining the success of the housing options approach. I am not in any way complacent about the potential impact of welfare reform on the most vulnerable, including young homeless people. The housing options hubs are well placed to address the challenges, and they are proactively engaged in identifying the best options available to help those at risk. That work is crucial, so we have committed to fund the hubs for the next two years so that it can continue.</p><p>The committee had concerns, as has been mentioned, about the operation of the previous social fund and, in particular, community care grants. I am pleased to say that the Scottish welfare fund came into force last month and that the Scottish Government has committed an additional &#163;9.2 million to it. The fund has been going only since April, but the feedback on how the fund is operating and the assistance that it is providing has been very positive.</p><p>The Scottish welfare fund can help young people by providing a safety net in emergencies, or where there is an immediate threat to health and safety. We are monitoring its implementation to ensure that it is working for those who need it most, including our vulnerable young people. The guidance makes particular reference to that group of people.</p><p>Tackling youth homelessness is a priority for me and the Scottish Government. I have highlighted the actions that the Scottish Government, along with local government and third sector partners, is taking and will continue to take to tackle and prevent youth homelessness in Scotland.</p><p>I, too, look forward to hearing members&#8217; contributions to the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Having and Keeping a Home"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I absolutely recognise that we have what I think is the best homelessness legislation in Europe.

There is clearly real concern about youth homelessness in Scotland.</p><p>I want to cover some of the points that have been raised. I start by saying to Alex Johnstone that the first fact is that as many social houses are being built now&#8212;with very restricted funding&#8212;as were being built when funding for the Scottish Government was increasing. The second fact is that there are far fewer people in bed and breakfast accommodation now than there were in 2005. Alex Johnstone suggested that that is not the case, so I should correct the record. I will deal with welfare reform later.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm asked a couple of questions. One was on the prevention monitoring tool. That tool has been developed and so far 31 of 32 local authorities are very supportive of it and are willing to take it on on a mandatory basis. We are in discussions with COSLA about that. I hope that by next year we will be able to proceed with that tool. It is an important element, so he was right to raise it.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm also asked about certain groups of homeless applicants having to be assessed in line with the new statutory obligation. I was referring to those who are assessed as unintentionally homeless and whom the local authority has reason to believe need support. Clearly not every homeless applicant will require mandatory support, guidance and advice. However, it is very clear that a young person would come into that category. If they did not, I would certainly want to know about it.</p><p>Respite was raised a number of times. I thought that I had made it clear in my opening speech that we are looking very seriously at respite as part of mediation. That was one of the recommendations of the supported accommodation implementation group, whose recommendations are being taken forward by the Scottish Government and COSLA homelessness prevention group. I hope that it is quite clear that we are taking that forward.</p><p>I think that everyone is agreed that focusing on prevention is the way forward. The focus that we have had so far with the housing hubs is having an impact. The Scottish Government will continue to support that approach, which has now taken root across Scotland. Meeting the needs of young people, including those leaving care, is an important part of the preventative approach that is being taken through the hubs, which are also involved in taking forward the recommendations of the supported accommodation implementation group.</p><p>More than ever, we are aware of the wide range of issues that can impact on young people who find themselves homeless. A number of speakers have said that it is clearly not just a housing issue. We know that there is a need for a joint response across all sectors and services.</p><p>As the committee highlighted, curriculum for excellence has a key role to play in improving the life chances of all young people. Young people are entitled to support to help them realise opportunities and reach their potential. Through the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, the Scottish Government is considering extending up to the age of 25&#8212;which is beyond the current cut-off age&#8212;the right of young people leaving care to receive support. That will be more in step with ordinary families, who provide support to their children throughout their early adult lives and sometimes&#8212;as in my case&#8212;beyond that.</p><p>As has been mentioned, we have provided an additional &#163;9.2 million for the Scottish welfare fund. Siobhan McMahon raised some points about that&#8212;and she has done so before. The Scottish welfare fund is a national scheme, but it is localised, so it has much more flexibility, and local authorities have the power to award a grant in principle.</p><p>Even when the house is not yet allocated, the local authority knows that an allocation is coming. As has happened in one case, it can award a grant in principle to ensure that, when the person moves in, the necessary resources are there.

However, it is not that they have to go into shared accommodation because of welfare reform. It is not correct to say that welfare reform has given us that option.

It applies across all agencies, bringing key policy frameworks together into one holistic approach for young people who offend.</p><p>Experiencing homelessness can be damaging for anyone, but particularly so for a young person. As I said, I have visited a number of projects across Scotland in recent months, and I have met many young people who are looking to rebuild their lives after periods of homelessness. There are some very positive stories. Some people have come from places of absolute desperation, sometimes with mental health problems or addiction problems.

It is always important to recognise the pioneering women who took vital steps in politics on behalf of all of us who have followed since. It is right that the debate stretches outwith Glasgow and Govan to other parts of Scotland.</p><p>I imagine that when Mary Barbour became the first female councillor in Glasgow in 1920, she thought that gender equality in public and political life would have been secured by 2013. However, almost 100 years later, that is not yet the case. The gender balance in this Parliament is considerably better than that at Westminster, and we are making headway with public appointments, but there is still a lot more for us to do.</p><p>There is little doubt that Mary Barbour&#8217;s passion and success in driving forward policies to improve the lives of many of the poorest people in our society helped to shape the country in which we live today. Although we have come a long way since she was active, we can still draw on her for inspiration to deliver our aim of creating a fairer and more equal country.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to reducing inequalities is echoed in the national performance framework&#8217;s solidarity and cohesion targets as well as in our commitment to the principle of universal entitlement, which I firmly believe maintains the sense of togetherness that should be the cornerstone of any society as of the society of which Mary Barbour was proud.</p><p>For example, through our &#8220;Child Poverty Strategy for Scotland&#8221;, we express our commitment to focus on the need to tackle the long-term drivers of poverty through early intervention and prevention to break the cycles of poor outcomes. That is something of which Mary would approve.</p><p>Despite everything that we are trying to do, our social policies continue to be undermined by the welfare reforms that are being introduced at Westminster. A few members have mentioned that. I wonder what Mary Barbour would have thought of something as unfair as the bedroom tax. Could she have envisaged that, 100 years on, something like that would happen?</p><p>Over the five years to 2015, Scotland will have &#163;4.5 billion taken from hard workers on low incomes, families, people with a disability and social housing tenants&#8212;precisely the people whom society should be helping, not harming, and protecting, not pillaging. Those are the people about whom Mary cared so passionately as she worked so hard to improve their lives.</p><p>Whether we are discussing the changes to tax credits that were introduced by the UK Government last year, which have been hitting the budget of more than 100,000 working families in Scotland, or the fundamental changes to child benefit, there is no longer a universal bond from one generation to the next&#8212;there is just a muddle of unfairness. The sad reality is that reducing the value of tax credits and child benefit will result in a lower income for those with caring responsibilities, the vast majority of whom are women. A hundred years ago, that was very much the sort of situation that Mary Barbour fought to improve.</p><p>Like Mary Barbour, the Government remains dedicated to supporting those who care for children, through measures such as increasing the amount and flexible delivery of free early learning and childcare from 475 hours to a minimum of 600 hours a year. That action will improve outcomes for children and will support women in Scotland into work.</p><p>Issues hindering women&#8217;s access to and participation in employment are a key priority for us. Working closely with the STUC, we held the first ever Scottish women&#8217;s employment summit in 2012 to consider the issues and to identify actions to tackle them. Such measures will provide tangible benefits for women and families across Scotland.</p><p>Like Mary Barbour, I recognise the vital role of social housing in providing people with an affordable home and a platform for getting on in life, and in delivering a community that people want to live in. We have heard about Mary Barbour&#8217;s community spirit and her working for her community to keep it together. To me, that is a significant part of what she did.</p><p>Mary fought very hard for the hardest hit. I wonder what she would think about the one-size-fits-all bedroom tax. It does not matter about someone&#8217;s age or disability, the availability of smaller houses or the economic conditions&#8212;the poorest will be hit the hardest.</p><p>The UK Government&#8217;s reforms call into question the role of housing support in a civilized country. Access to decent housing is a fundamental need and right, which Mary Barbour recognised 100 years ago. I am sure that she would be pleased about what the Scottish Government is doing to try to address that.</p><p>The challenge facing the social housing sector in particular is the reason why we have given money to social landlords to help them to advise their tenants. However, many impacts of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reforms go beyond what we currently have powers over in our own country. It saddens me that the reforms that the Government chose to introduce go against the vision that people such as Mary Barbour had for this country.</p><p>I passionately believe that the best solution can be found by the Scottish people having control over such matters. We must ensure that no one is held back because of discrimination or disadvantage. Until then, the Scottish Government will continue to act and intervene where we have the powers to do so.</p><p>Mary Barbour was indeed an inspirational woman, and a monument is a fitting tribute to her.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692086", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mary Barbour Commemoration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Anne McTaggart for bringing the debate to the chamber.

CAS is doing a superb job highlighting some of the issues that people face as a result of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reforms. The report that it published this morning&#8212;&#8220;Offline and left behind: Digital exclusion amongst Scotland&#8217;s CAB clients&#8221;&#8212;is more powerful evidence of the same.</p><p>From what has been said so far, there are very few members with whom I would disagree. Digital delivery of benefits clearly concerns many members&#8212;and not only those who are present, as it has been raised on a number of occasions in the chamber. What concerns me most is the way that the DWP is choosing to deliver benefits through the digital channel.</p><p>Digital provision in itself is not the problem. I hope that digital is the future. In the future, and increasingly now, many of us expect and demand efficient and responsive public services that are delivered online. However, some of the stories in the &#8220;Voices from the frontline&#8221; report are quite shocking, and I hope that they are not an indication of how universal credit will be delivered.</p><p>As I have said before in the chamber both as a back-bench member and as a minister, when the DWP changed the delivery of benefits from paper to telephone applications, it was a shambles. People were sent from pillar to post. They were not allowed to make their applications using phones in the job centre but were sent to other agencies and, in some instances, to public phone boxes. I am disappointed to see that something similar is happening with digital applications. People have been rejected by the job centre and sent to the citizens advice bureau or another service to make their application. Therefore, I am not as confident as Alex Johnstone. I saw what happened in the past, and I have argued strongly for the situation to be changed. The emerging evidence is saying something different, and I will certainly be keeping an eye on it.</p><p>The research that the Scottish Government published last year shows a similar situation to that shown in the Citizens Advice Scotland research. We found that the people who are more unlikely to go online are those who, as we have heard, have a low income, live in deprived areas, have a disability or a long-term health condition and have numeracy or literacy difficulties. In other words, they are the same people who need the welfare state to be there for them&#8212;and CAS identified the same groups of people.</p><p>I also take issue with Alex Johnstone&#8217;s view that the CAS report simply looks at its customers. Its customers are the people who need and use the welfare system. They are the ones who have been pushed into making applications, including job applications, online. We need to acknowledge that. Of course they will make up a bigger percentage, because they are the very people who need the services. That must be taken into account.</p><p>I say to the DWP that those people deserve a benefits system that meets their needs, rather than one that only meets the needs of the 80 per cent&#8212;an arbitrary target&#8212;who make claims online. I know that the figure, which is highlighted in the CAS report, has caused some concern.</p><p>In simple terms, we can think of three groups of people who claim benefits. There is a group of people whose circumstances are difficult and complex. I expect and sincerely hope that the people in that group would be in the 20 per cent who cannot use digital, but who will get support in other ways. We all recognise that there is another group who will want or be able to manage their claim online. They will be in the 80 per cent, and there needs to be a good service for them.</p><p>There is also a group in that 80 per cent who might not yet have the skills or the access to the technology, but whom the DWP still expects to get online. That could put people at risk of making a claim that is late or, if they are not confident on a computer, of making mistakes, which could result in delays in receiving payment or, potentially, benefit sanctions.</p><p>It was clear from the stories that Christina McKelvie told&#8212;other members have highlighted this&#8212;that we are talking about real people. If they do not get their income at the time they need it or it is late, they have no other source of or access to money. They are stuck in a position that they should not be in. Forcing people to do something in a way that they have no access to or do not have the skills to use is simply unfair and discriminatory. &#8220;Voices from the frontline&#8221; tells us about the 18-year-old claimant whose health suffers because although they can use a computer, they cannot access one. People in that group will be most affected by digital by default: people who perhaps can do it, just not quite yet. They need to be given the skills and the support.</p><p>It is because of that challenge&#8212;this might be a response to Drew Smith&#8217;s comments&#8212;that a number of local authority pilot projects funded by the Scottish Government are looking at digital issues. There are specific barriers in rural areas, as Dennis Robertson highlighted. We have given funding to a project in Aberdeenshire to look at rural issues.</p><p>There are also issues in urban areas. We have heard about the low take-up of broadband in Glasgow, Clyde and Lanarkshire, which is much lower than the Scottish or UK average. A project in South Lanarkshire is testing one approach through one-stop-shop council advice centres. We also recently announced funding of &#163;170,000 for a new two-year project in Glasgow to help people get online.</p><p>I also confirm that the making advice work fund can support projects to help people claim online. Stream 1 of the fund is designed specifically for the transition to the new benefit system and to help people access welfare benefits. I encourage all interested advice organisations to make a bid for that funding.</p><p>A further stream of funding has been ring fenced for social landlords, to help them deal with digital by default. That is some recognition from the DWP, although it is not enough.</p><p>I do not question the necessity of the digital delivery of public services, including benefits, but it is simply not good enough to introduce digital by default without providing the support and resources to ensure that those services are accessible to everyone.</p><p>The Scottish Government will continue to raise our concerns with the DWP about the implementation of digital by default and about the intent of the welfare reforms that are behind it.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:40.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Digital Exclusion"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests and my long past association with Citizens Advice Scotland.

The most recent fuel poverty figures for Scotland, which were published in December 2012, show that Scottish Government action is mitigating swingeing fuel price increases. Despite punishing 14 per cent increases in autumn 2011, improved household energy efficiency prevented 35,000 households from falling into fuel poverty.</p><p>However, it gives me little comfort that 684,000 Scottish households were in fuel poverty in October 2011. Without improvements in the energy efficiency of homes and a small increase in household income, many thousands more households would be in fuel poverty. The statistics show that income growth brought fuel poverty down by 2.2 per cent and that energy efficiency improvements brought it down by 1.5 per cent. However, the increase in fuel prices put fuel poverty up by 4.7 per cent, which cancelled out much of what we had achieved.</p><p>Our target to eradicate fuel poverty as far as is reasonably practicable by 2016 remains challenging, given that it is predicted that energy prices will continue to rise. However, we will not shy away from striving to make energy bills more affordable. Nor will we redefine fuel poverty, as Westminster seeks to do, by reclassifying poor households as too poor to be fuel poor.</p><p>I spoke to a constituent, the week before last. She is in her 70s and she worked all her life from the age of 15. She has a small pension from her work and a state pension; her total income is just under &#163;200 a week. She is struggling to make ends meet. The fuel company asked her to increase her direct debit, but she is currently spending 17.8 per cent of her income on fuel. That is simply not acceptable in 21st century Scotland. My constituent&#8217;s experience starkly illustrates why the Parliament needs the powers to tackle a situation that is a disgrace in an energy-rich nation such as ours.</p><p>In autumn, all the large energy suppliers announced price increases of between 7 and 10.8 per cent. The Deputy First Minister is meeting each supplier to express concern about energy price rises, press for action to protect vulnerable consumers and secure suppliers&#8217; commitment to investing in Scotland&#8217;s national retrofit programme.</p><p>Specifically, we are asking the energy companies to commit at least a pro rata share of energy company obligation targets for Scotland, based on their market share; to tell us what further steps they intend to take to assist vulnerable households; to automatically switch vulnerable customers to the lowest tariff; to implement as soon as possible the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets retail market review proposals that were published in October; and to continue funding for energy best deal plus roll-out throughout Scotland.</p><p>Tomorrow, I will host a summit in Scotland jointly with Ed Davey, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, and Michael Moore to seek further solutions from the big energy companies.

We are aware of the Energy Saving Trust&#8217;s view in that regard. The Government and I are keen to ensure that people do not lose out in the way described, so we are actively looking at a programme for vulnerable groups who do not fit into the national retrofit scheme. We have taken that on board and we have consulted the Energy Saving Trust, which is happy with what we are doing.</p><p>The majority of the Scottish Government&#8217;s fuel poverty budget goes to the energy assistance package, which Elaine Murray just mentioned, and most of the money allocated to that is used to fund central heating and insulation measures for households at risk of fuel poverty. The EAP was designed to integrate with the previous carbon emission reduction targets, which have now been replaced by the energy company obligation. Elaine Murray asked us to ensure that vulnerable people do not lose out and we will do that.</p><p>From April, the Scottish Government&#8217;s energy assistance package will be superseded by the national retrofit programme, which is designed to get the most for Scotland out of the energy company obligation. The majority of the &#163;65 million fuel poverty budget for 2013-14 will go to local authority area-based schemes.</p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to continuing to provide the home energy Scotland hotline and the energy advice, tariff and benefits checking that form stages 1 and 2 of the energy assistance package. The home energy Scotland hotline will integrate with the national retrofit programme. It will provide a route into the support for vulnerable households that are outside area-based schemes, as well as directing households within the areas served by local authority schemes to those schemes. As I said, we have not made a final decision on the best means of providing support to vulnerable households.</p><p>There are a number of issues around rural areas. A number of funds can support the development of renewable options for individuals and communities in off-gas areas. They include the warm homes fund, the community and renewable energy scheme and the home renewables loan scheme. Those schemes are designed to fit with the United Kingdom financial framework for supporting domestic renewable energy and are aimed at supporting a range of applicants, including individuals, community groups, rural businesses and registered social landlords.</p><p>We proposed a community-based approach to tackling fuel poverty in our 2011 manifesto, which earmarked &#163;50 million over the course of this parliamentary session for a warm homes fund to promote district heating and renewables options. The first project, which is supported by the warm homes fund, is at West Whitlawburn, in Cambuslang, which I hope to visit soon. The project is expected to become operational in July 2013. We have other schemes in the pipeline that we hope to announce shortly. RSLs will use the income received from the UK schemes to promote renewable energy to improve the energy efficiency of housing and give people warmer homes.</p><p>District heating networks can provide low-cost heat to households, particularly in multistorey blocks and off-gas-grid areas. Heat networks mean that we can use heat more efficiently from a range of sources such as gas-fired combined heat and power plants, renewables, and heat recovery from industrial processes.</p><p>Fuel poverty is a blight on our country. This Scottish Government will continue to urge the UK Government, which has responsibility for this area, to do more to drive down energy costs and ensure that our households are better protected. However, members of this Parliament&#8212;and the people of Scotland&#8212;can be assured that their Scottish Government has done and will continue to do all that it can within our existing powers to tackle the scourge of fuel poverty.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises the Scottish Government&#8217;s efforts in tackling fuel poverty; welcomes the continued investment in energy efficiency and fuel poverty and the contrast with the UK Government&#8217;s cutting of its fuel poverty budget and withdrawal of any taxpayer-funded support from April 2013; recognises the early indications from the National Retrofit Programme &#8220;go-early&#8221; pilots that energy companies view Scotland as an attractive place to invest; notes the economic benefits of such programmes and the contribution that they make to reducing carbon emissions; supports the Scottish Government&#8217;s call on the UK Government to tackle the energy market to provide a better deal for consumers, and notes with concern the expected impact on household incomes arising from the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reform plans, which it believes will lead to an increase in inequality.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682266", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was coming to that point on the next page of my speech.

I thank the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, in particular, for its scrutiny of the bill throughout its parliamentary stages, and I thank all those organisations and individuals who provided oral and written evidence to the Parliament.</p><p>The bill is a key part of our wider work to reduce the number of empty properties, whether homes or non-residential properties, so that we can make best use of existing buildings and minimise the number of properties that fall into disrepair and become a blight on our communities. Long-term empty homes frequently fall into disrepair and can attract vandalism and other forms of crime. They reduce the value of surrounding properties and can affect the perception of a neighbourhood as a good place to live, which, in turn, reduces residents&#8217; quality of life.</p><p>At the same time, we are determined to reduce the number of homes that sit empty in the long term&#8212;of which we have more than 25,000&#8212;while around 140,000 families are on waiting lists for a social rented home. Bringing many of those homes back into use will help, directly or indirectly, to free up more homes for those who really need them.</p><p>Giving councils the flexibility to increase council tax charges for certain long-term empty properties will help, encourage or, where needed, push owners not to leave their property lying empty. Councils will also be given the flexibility to target any additional revenue at delivering key local priorities, which will provide a useful additional tool, alongside the other measures that councils can already use. For example, the Scottish Government has been funding the empty homes partnership to provide support to councils in tackling empty homes. In addition, we are part-funding three empty homes officers, who are shared across seven councils, on a pilot basis. Those officers are having considerable success in developing a blueprint for successful empty homes engagement work that could be replicated across Scotland, and we should all support the fact that their interventions have already seen a number of empty homes brought back into use.</p><p>We recognise that some owners need financial assistance to bring their homes up to a standard that makes them suitable for letting. That is why we have made &#163;4 million available through the empty homes loan fund.</p><p>The fund will make at least 160 empty homes available for affordable housing&#8212;more, I hope. I am pleased to say that we have had a good response to our call for bids for the fund. Many of those homes could be made available for intermediate rent, which, in turn, would help to grow a more vibrant private rented sector, providing tenants with a greater choice of good-quality homes.</p><p>We have listened to stakeholders&#8212;Parliament and others&#8212;throughout the development of our proposals for the council tax increase and we have amended our proposals as the policy has been developed through active engagement. Examples of changes include limiting exceptions to the increase to only those who are actively trying to bring their homes back into use&#8212;whether they intend to sell or rent them&#8212;and bringing forward stage 2 amendments to increase the maximum level of penalty charge. A council can charge an owner if they fail to provide information about whether their home is unoccupied. That charge has been increased from &#163;200 to &#163;500.

It also allows me to set out the Government's wider work on housing and support for older people, to which Vivarium's work contributes.?</p><p>&#8220;Age, Home And Community: A Strategy For Housing For Scotland's Older People: 2012-2021&#8221; contains our 10-year strategy for housing for Scotland's older people and was published last December. We were delighted to be able to include as a case study the work of the Vivarium Trust to develop co-housing in Scotland.</p><p>We have heard from Fiona McLeod and Alex Johnstone about the challenge of the ageing population. It is forecast that the number of people who are aged 75 and over will increase by 82 per cent by 2035.</p><p>It is also important to note that, as was mentioned, the Vivarium Trust is thinking about people who are aged 50 and over. Perhaps we should be thinking about the issue before it is too late.</p><p>We heard from Clare Adamson about the importance of people being involved in the project from start to finish. That is an important issue for me. In my short time as Minister for Housing and Welfare, I have found, when I am going around housing associations and new developments, that the ones that have involved the tenants and the community are the most successful and are comfortable places to be, even upon arrival. That is what we get from what is being proposed by the Vivarium Trust. Who knows better what is required in design of homes than those who will live in them? As Clare Adamson said, we should be thinking about that in relation to all our housing.</p><p>We also continue to face tough economic conditions, with real-terms reductions in the Scottish budget of more than 11 per cent over four years&#8212;a loss of more than &#163;3&#160;billion, which is not insubstantial. It is therefore vital that we have the right housing support for older people. Our getting that right will enhance people&#8217;s quality of life and their wellbeing. It will also make better use of our resources by reducing the number of falls and other accidents in the home, and consequently the number of emergency hospital admissions.</p><p>Our national strategy for housing for older people is built around four themes that are exemplified in the co-housing model. Those themes are: older people as an asset, choice, planning ahead and preventative support. Our starting point is that older people consistently tell us that they want to remain living in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. It is right that older people, as everyone else does, should have that choice. Where older people are able to live independently in their own homes, wider society benefits as well as the older people themselves. Scotland&#8217;s older people are an asset.</p><p>Co-housing provides an environment where older people can remain active. We heard from Dr Elaine Murray about the activities in older people&#8217;s housing complexes in her constituency. Those sound very interesting, and I think that we would all like to join the parties there. Co-housing allows older people to contribute to their communities and to retain control over their lives.</p><p>I should make it clear&#8212;as others have highlighted&#8212;that there is no single model of housing and support that meets the needs of all older people. Older people are as diverse as any other section of society, with differing needs and expectations that reflect their individual life experiences. That means that we need a range of different types of housing and support services to meet those needs and expectations. Co-housing is one of the newer and more innovative housing models that we are keen to encourage. It showcases age-appropriate design, affordability and, as we have heard, energy efficiency as well as a mutually supportive community.</p><p>One of the central themes of our work on housing and support for older people is prevention. The importance of preventative work has been widely recognised, including in the Christie commission report and in our response &#8220;Renewing Scotland&#8217;s Public Services&#8221;. We cannot pretend that we can always prevent falls or deterioration in health, but there are many preventative services related to housing that support wellbeing and reduce the likelihood of traumatic and costly hospital and care-home admissions. Co-housing demonstrates many of the features of the best preventative support services for older people in terms of the control that it gives residents and its personalisation to their individual circumstances.</p><p>The publication of our national housing strategy for Scotland&#8217;s older people was an important milestone. The strategy was put together with the help and support of a number of housing and older people's organisations, including the Vivarium Trust, as well as&#8212;this is an important point&#8212;older people themselves. However, the strategy did not mark the end of our work; in many ways, it was just the beginning. As a Government, we are committed to the development of preventative support services for older people. We are also considering options for the future delivery and funding of housing adaptations, which play a key role in helping older people to maintain independent living, as we have heard in relation to the evidence that was put to the Finance Committee.</p><p>In conclusion, older people&#8217;s issues have rightly gained prominence in the housing agenda. We need to sustain the momentum that we have built up and to increase it as we implement our strategy and deliver our vision. With its major contribution to the development of co-housing in Scotland, the Vivarium Trust is part of the rich mix of housing and support that we seek to build in order to help enable older people to live independently. I have been delighted to hear about the progress that has been made and I will follow the pilot with interest. Tonight, I wish Vivarium well as it continues its work to develop co-housing in Fife.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:04.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675587", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Vivarium Trust (Co-housing for Older People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Rod Campbell on securing this debate and thank him for drawing wider attention to the work of the Vivarium Trust to publicise and develop co-housing for older people.

That was not because I thought that veterans and serving personnel did not need advice&#8212;I knew that they did, and thought that the local citizens advice bureau was the place to provide it, as that is what citizens advice bureaux do. However, I was not convinced that a special project was needed, as it was likely that those people would need advice on the same issues on which most CAB clients need it&#8212;benefits, debt, employment and housing. However, after listening to Poppyscotland and other veteran organisations, I was persuaded that many veterans experience complex social and health-related issues in trying to move back into civilian life. Research suggests that many veterans experience such issues for years without accessing support or assistance. I was then convinced that a project specifically for veterans, serving personnel and their families would fill a gap and provide a vital service to an important and sometimes forgotten section of our community.</p><p>The excellent &#8220;Civvy Street: The New Frontline&#8221; report from Citizens Advice Scotland, which was published today and which Christina McKelvie referred to, demonstrates the value of the project. The report recognises that the majority of serving personnel make a successful transition to civilian life, which is good, but it also highlights that a significant minority of veterans and their families experience challenging problems. The project focuses on that minority. As we heard from Paul Wheelhouse, there are around 1&#160;million people in the wider veteran community in Scotland, including families, so the minority is substantial.</p><p>In addition to the presenting problems, we have heard about other complex issues, such as people&#8217;s inability to find employment, their few transferable skills, their lack of a partner sometimes, their lack of financial capabilities, little or no family support, mental health issues and social isolation.</p><p>One of the things in the report that struck me is the number of veterans who face real difficulty in getting back on to civvy street. Mark Griffin referred to the regular routine for those in the services, with meals prepared for them and bills deducted straight from their pay, so that they do not have to pay them on their own. One veteran is quoted in the report as saying:</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never had to go hand and foot looking for anything, because it&#8217;s all been done for you ... You come out and it&#8217;s like a different planet&#8230; like planet of the apes.&#8221;</p><p>That is what service personnel feel.</p><p>I have heard people say many times when talking about somebody coming out of the services that at least they will be used to doing things for themselves, so they should cope all right on their own, which is a perception that is clearly well off the mark, as the report highlights.</p><p>I commended the success of the armed services advice project and congratulate all those involved with it. I hope that it continues to provide vital services to our veterans, service personnel and their families.

I also know that we must get the legislation through in time, because the impact on those stakeholders&#8217; work will be worse if we do not get it through. Michael McMahon said that the affirmative procedure would not always have to be used. However, the amendments that Labour lodged would have made the affirmative procedure the only one that could be used, which is where the problem would have lain. The debate on that is over&#8212;those amendments have been rejected, so we should move on.</p><p>I take issue with some of the things that Alex Johnstone said. I do not think that it was ever said in the Welfare Reform Committee or the chamber that we do not want to have a better welfare state, reformed in a better way. What we do not want is for it to go the way that it is going under the Tory Government. At the moment, we are getting to grips with the current changes in welfare reform, which have not even bedded in yet, but we heard about further changes this week that will be much worse. Those changes are not about getting people into work; they are about saving money. My concern about that is as we take people off the unemployment books, more will go on them because of the Tories&#8217; policy.</p><p>Jamie Hepburn pointed out that the Tories seem to think that everyone who is on welfare is not working or has never worked. A huge proportion of people who get help from the state are in work. They are in low-paid work, and their working tax credits and child support have been cut. Everything has been cut for people in work. People on housing benefit work; they just do not earn enough to be able to pay the full rent, yet we are taking that benefit from them. It is shocking that the Tories have not got to grips with that.</p><p>As I have said in the chamber before, I believe that the Tories want to wreck the welfare state. I am concerned that Labour members think that that is better than this Parliament being in charge of its own welfare system&#8212;I just do not get that. The Future of Scotland survey that was published this week shows that 67 per cent of people in Scotland want welfare benefits to be devolved, because they know what is happening to them. Labour should reflect on that.</p><p>The reforms are driven by the wish to save money, and that is all. A report from Sheffield Hallam University on incapacity benefit reform that might interest Alex Johnstone came out in November last year. It tells us that there are more people on incapacity benefit than there are claiming unemployment benefit. Alex Johnstone might say, &#8220;Well, they should be off it and working,&#8221; but the reforms mean that all those people&#8212;in Scotland, it will be 36,000&#8212;will, at the stroke of a pen, be put on to the unemployment register. Those people are in the industrial areas where unemployment is already high.</p><p>We should not forget that many of the people on long-term incapacity and invalidity benefit were encouraged on to those benefits by a Tory Government and successive Labour Governments that were trying to hide the true level of unemployment in the industrial areas. That is why so many people in those areas are on sickness benefit and have been left there.</p><p>Our problem now is that we cannot take all those people off benefit at once and put them on to jobseekers allowance&#8212;that just will not work. I welcome the steps that the Scottish Government has taken to mitigate the reforms as far as it can. Those include the provision of funding&#8212;along with local authorities&#8212;to cover the 10 per cent cut in council tax benefit; the proposals that are before us today to protect passported benefits; and the social fund successor arrangements that the Government has made. Those measures, along with the council tax freeze, free prescriptions, free eye tests, free childcare and promoting the living wage will help our vulnerable citizens within the existing powers of the Parliament.</p><p>The mark of a civilised society and a civilised country is how it cares for its vulnerable citizens. I believe passionately in a welfare system that is fair and compassionate: a system that makes work pay, which supports and encourages people into work, which helps the low paid and which provides a reasonable standard of living for those who are unable to work because of illness, disability or caring responsibilities.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform (Further Provision) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am a member of the Welfare Reform Committee and I thank all the stakeholders who contributed to and informed our discussions.

For some time, they have lived with that worry day and daily. Although the expert advice suggests that there is no evidence to support routine removal of PIP implants, I absolutely understand why some women who have them want them to be removed and replaced. Those women know that they have in their bodies implants that are made of a material that is not approved for medical purposes, and they fear that those implants might rupture at any time. In such circumstances, I would be angry and worried and possibly a bit frightened, so I understand the sentiments of the action group.</p><p>I am sure that all members support the on-going criminal investigation in France into Jean-Claude Mas, the former owner of PIP. We must not forget that that fraudulent manufacturer has the ultimate responsibility for the distress that has been caused to so many women throughout the world, including, as I understand it, about 1,300 in Scotland. As stated in Lord Howe&#8217;s review, the company covered up its deceit and showed complete disregard for the welfare of its customers, which is absolutely shocking. The people who are responsible must be brought to justice.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s actions in responding quickly and giving a commitment that the NHS will provide help and support&#8212;including removal of implants, if that is clinically appropriate&#8212;for women whose private surgery provider refuses to do so or has gone out of business. Private providers of the procedure throughout the sector have a duty of care to all their patients. Women should not be charged for replacement and removal of PIP implants. People who are affected by the scandal have enough on their plate without having to worry about how they will get the money to put things right.</p><p>I hope that any clinical assessment of whether to remove and replace implants will include an assessment of the mental health impact on the individual if the implants are not replaced. As many members have said, lessons need to be learned in order to prevent such an incident happening again. I therefore welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s involvement in the existing UK-wide inquiries, which are covering a range of issues, including health issues surrounding the implants; improving adverse incident reporting; better communication methods on issues that cause public concern; regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry; and a register of implants, for which there is a strong case.</p><p>There is also a European inquiry that is considering better information sharing between EU countries, increasing the scope for EU countries to work together, increased product traceability, and a European database to bring together information about medical devices, economic operations, market surveillance and clinical investigations. Those inquiries and the recommendations that will flow from them should ensure that a similar situation does not arise again.</p><p>I understand the sentiments of those who call for a Scottish public inquiry but, as we have heard, the regulation of medical devices is a reserved matter and the licensing of the products is an EU matter. Therefore, a Scottish public inquiry could not properly investigate all the issues.

I also thank the Scottish Parliament information centre for the briefing papers that it provided. Like Paul Wheelhouse, I was experiencing a parliamentary inquiry for the first time since becoming an MSP, and I thought that staff did an excellent and impressive job. I also thank everyone from inside and outside the Parliament who gave evidence, which helped to inform our discussions and deliberations.</p><p>My first parliamentary inquiry meant a steep learning curve for me on parliamentary procedure, which is not the most riveting topic, however important it is. Some people might ask how someone who is just in the door can decide on changes to the parliamentary week, when they barely know how the current arrangements work. However, the combination of newbies such as me and members who were more experienced in the Parliament&#8217;s workings, along with witnesses who gave evidence, meant that we could look at the situation from every angle and, as the convener said, conduct a thorough MOT for the Parliament. The Presiding Officer&#8217;s commissioning us to conduct the inquiry and to look at the Parliament as an institution and its relevance was the right way to do things.</p><p>During the inquiry, I was struck by the evidence from the Speaker of the southern Irish Parliament, which had recently reformed its week. The Parliament there and its politicians had been under constant attack by the press, which left the Irish public thinking that the Parliament was rarely in session and the deputies had an easy job. Because of that, every party in southern Ireland campaigned to increase the Parliament&#8217;s hours. That was done, but they are now struggling to fill the hours with relevant business, and the deputies are finding it difficult to find time for constituency work, which the public expect them to do. The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee did not want to make that mistake. It was clear that changes should not be made just for the sake of making them.</p><p>It has been said that there were valid arguments both for and against changing the sitting patterns for plenary sessions, but I believe that having plenary sessions three afternoons a week is the right way forward. After all, this is our national Parliament, and very few&#8212;if any&#8212;national Parliaments meet on only two days a week. It has also been said that the Parliament has additional powers from the Scotland Act 2012. No matter what happens in 2014, we know that the Parliament will have more powers, so it is essential that we gear up a notch in preparation for that. I also support the view that plenary meetings on Tuesday afternoons will increase the ability to respond to issues that have emerged over the previous five days.</p><p>I want to take up some of the points that have been made about the committees. The committee recognised that reduced time for committees could have a negative impact on the parliamentary process, but the proposals should not adversely impinge on committee time, as there is sufficient flexibility to allow them to meet on Mondays or Fridays during particularly lengthy inquiries if they choose to do so. As we have heard, a committee can meet at the same time as a plenary session is going on in exceptional circumstances, with the approval of Parliament.</p><p>The issue of scheduling is not for the committee, but we looked at the scheduling of committee meetings and how long they have met for. It was clear that not every committee meets for two or three hours on every occasion. Therefore, I think that the proposals can work without taking away committee time. The committee holds the view that plenary sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons with committees meeting in the mornings strikes the right balance.</p><p>The proposed question time changes, with questions at the start of every sitting, will provide more time to hold the Government to account, and shorter lead-in times for lodging questions will allow more topicality in the issues that are raised. I think that most of us have lodged questions that have been redundant by the time that we have got round to asking them. There will have been a debate on the issue the day before, or the question will have been answered previously. Therefore, I am sure that everyone will welcome the proposed question time changes.</p><p>The proposals to allow more time for back benchers&#8217; business, with an additional members&#8217; business debate each week, should be welcomed. I would have liked to go further on that by allowing the member whose motion was debated an opportunity to respond to the points that have been raised, although the minister would still be given the last word. I would also have liked to see other changes to members&#8217; business debates, but I accept that they are in the remit of the Presiding Officer, not the committee.</p><p>To conclude, I believe that the proposed changes will meet the set objectives&#8212;that is, that they will improve the topicality of parliamentary business, lead to more effective scrutiny of the Scottish Government, and increase the ability to respond to emerging issues. We also have the assurance that the committee will keep things under review and propose further changes if they are required.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parliamentary Reform (Changes to Standing Orders)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am a member of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee and I thank the clerks and committee staff for all their work during our inquiry.

That is certainly my priority. [Applause.]</p><p>I will focus on a couple of areas of the report on which I think most of us agree. The report recognised that there is likely to be a significant increase in demand for advice and support services and recommended that the Scottish government examine whether it can provide additional support to organisations to which people are likely to turn for independent advice.</p><p>We recognise that the DWP has responsibility to provide advice to help claimants to make adjustments and that it should provide advice on entitlements. However, in my view, independent advice is also essential, because that is where people can get practical assistance and assistance to challenge DWP decisions.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland tells us that in March this year alone, citizens advice bureaux dealt with 122 new employment and support allowance inquiries every day. In tribunals at which CABx provided representation, in 69 per cent of cases the tribunal found in favour of the claimant.</p><p>We have heard about the amount of general practitioners&#8217; time that is being taken up in writing letters in support of appeals. The report of the GPs at the deep end group, which was published in March, tells of the negative impact of benefits cuts and austerity measures on patient health and GP workload in some of our most deprived areas. A GP commented:</p><p>&#8220;I observe this again and again that I cannot address medical issues as I have to deal with the patient&#8217;s agenda first, which is getting money to feed and heat.&#8221;</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary to consider whether we should support agencies to provide advice services in GP surgeries in order to allow GPs to concentrate on medical matters.</p><p>Siobhan McMahon mentioned online claims, which are the responsibility of the DWP. The committee&#8217;s convener raised the matter in a letter to the DWP. I found Lord Freud&#8217;s reply, which we received on 14 May, to be wholly inadequate. Lord Freud said:</p><p>&#8220;Recent research ... found 78% of claimants currently use the internet&#8221;.</p><p>However, we know that only 61 per cent of people in Scotland have access to broadband, and that the percentage is much, much lower in deprived areas. Lord Freud also made clear that he expects</p><p>&#8220;alternative access routes to be reserved for the minority&#8221;</p><p>and &#8220;kept to a minimum.&#8221;</p><p>I remember the shambles when the DWP changed from paper to telephone claims. I saw at first hand how alternative access worked for people who did not have a phone. People were turned away from DWP offices; people were refused paper forms; people were not allowed to use phones in job centres and were told to go away and use family members&#8217; phones; and people who had mobile phones could not afford the bills. People were being batted from pillar to post just to make a claim, and it took months of lobbying by front-line organisations before the DWP adopted a more sensible approach.</p><p>We cannot allow that to happen again, so I would like the cabinet secretary to ask the DWP about its proposed alternatives to online applications. What are the alternative access routes? Will the DWP assure us that applications can be made in a DWP office? How will the DWP ensure that claimants can use the technology? What assistance will it provide to third sector organisations to help people to make claims? We need the answers, which are the responsibility of the DWP in the Westminster Government&#8212;not the Scottish Government.</p><p>I look forward to hearing more evidence and to more dialogue with stakeholder groups and individuals who will be affected by the reforms.

We must remember that obesity is not confined to Scotland and is a global problem. The World Health Organization has spoken of obesity as</p><p>&#8220;the greatest health threat of the 21st century&#8221;.</p><p>In 2008, 1.5 billion adults worldwide aged 20 and over were overweight or obese. In 2010, 43 million children were overweight or obese. That is worrying. We have heard the worrying statistics in Scotland on young people who are obese and in some cases severely obese. We have heard that adult obesity in Scotland is predicted to reach well over 40 per cent by 2030 if we do not deal with the issue.</p><p>We have heard about the risks of being overweight or obese, which include a risk of serious disease and premature death. Obesity also contributes to an increased risk of osteoarthritis, low self-esteem, depression and psychological problems. Those latter issues apply to children as well as to adults. In 2007-08, the estimated cost to our health service was &#163;457 million, and the figure is predicted to increase. It is therefore vital that we try to halt any further rise in obesity, while reducing existing obesity levels among the population.</p><p>We need to put the issue in context and understand that preventing obesity is a complex matter. The 2008 report by Sheffield Hallam University that followed an earlier foresight report states:</p><p>&#8220;There is no example anywhere in the world where the obesity trend has been reversed&#8221;.</p><p>I say that not to argue that we cannot do it, but to point out that the challenge is huge. The same report talks about the obesogenic environment that promotes obesity and unhealthy weight levels. That is just by circumstance and not because of anything that has been done deliberately. Alison Johnstone referred to our reliance on vehicles and the fact that our built environment is designed around that. We have labour-saving devices, easy access to and availability of cheap, high-fat and high-sugar foods, internet shopping, eating out, fast foods and takeaways, super-sized products and genetic and social factors.</p><p>Of course, there is insufficient physical activity. Therefore, the challenge is great and requires a complex and multifaceted solution. The cross-cutting approach in the Scottish Government&#8217;s obesity route map recognises that. It makes commitments to tackle all the factors that contribute to an overweight and obese population: food consumption and diet; behaviour in the early years; health and wellbeing in the workplace; and physical activity. Paramount in that is early intervention. Many members have made the point better than I could about the importance of intervening at an early age.</p><p>Much of what I was going to say has been said, so I will say a little about my personal experience of the challenge of trying to maintain a healthy weight. Many people have said to me, &#8220;That is not a problem for you, Margaret,&#8221; but all my adult life, I have struggled to maintain a healthy weight. I have gone to every weight loss club known and reached the target at every one. I have been 2 stone lighter than I am now and 3 stone heavier. However, in the past seven years, I have managed to maintain a healthy weight. I have always had a healthy lifestyle and eaten healthy foods, but I believe that the difference is that I have sustained physical activity, which is walking. I appreciate the minister&#8217;s comments about walking and the national walking strategy. Physical exercise alone will not result in weight loss, and nor will changing eating habits. We need a combination of the two to maintain a healthy weight.</p><p>The focus should be on maintaining a healthy weight, because it does not benefit any of us if our weight goes up and down. I know many people who are in the same situation as me. For me, there is evidence that walking has made a huge difference.</p><p>It is not an easy task, even for people like me who were not overweight as a child. We must recognise that there is a lot more involved than just saying to people that they should cut down what they eat and take a bit of exercise. Lots of other factors must be considered.</p><p>The minister outlined many of the initiatives that the Scottish Government, in partnership with local authorities and other organisations, is taking to increase physical activity among our population. The initiatives include investment in cycling, encouraging walking to school, two hours of quality PE each week&#8212;which we hope to achieve by 2014&#8212;and investing &#163;25 million from cashback for communities directly in sporting facilities. In my constituency, Kilwinning benefited from that money. There is also the legacy of the Commonwealth games, which will ensure increased access to sports facilities and a more active nation.</p><p>Regular physical exercise is important in the jigsaw of tackling obesity, but we are not all budding athletes or fans of the gym. We need to look at what activities are available. There has to be a variety: walking, cycling, aquarobics, swimming, Zumba, and keep fit, to name but a few. We have to aim for every section of the population. We must recognise Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s point about young girls, who, on reaching the age of 12 or 13, give up physical activity. That is a time when a lot of young girls&#8217; body shapes are changing, and they do not want to strip off and take up gym. We need to look at a variety of physical exercise because that, I believe, will have a positive impact on our stated aim of having people live longer and healthier lives.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667320", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on tackling obesity in Scotland.

The summary of evidence clearly identifies the key issues and highlights the challenges ahead for the Scottish Government and the Parliament.</p><p>Like Paul Wheelhouse, I think that we must start by looking at our values. What are the values of our people and what are our ambitions for our people and our country? The Scottish Government has the right vision, which is of a Scotland that is economically secure, prosperous, healthy and socially just. We should never forget that that is what we are aiming for.</p><p>The preventative spend agenda, which has cross-party support, is supported by all the witnesses who gave evidence to the Finance Committee. Focusing on preventing problems by intervening earlier is the right approach to tackling many of the social issues facing us. It also secures better value for the taxpayer and ensures the sustainability of our public services.</p><p>Several members have mentioned the Government&#8217;s preventative spend agenda, which will support adult social care with the introduction of an integrated health and social care system. If it is done properly, the hope is that the system will reduce emergency admissions to hospital and give children the best start in life with the early years and early intervention change fund. There are also plans for improved childcare provision, and the system will help us to cope with a growing elderly population. Everyone so far has mentioned that.</p><p>We should not consider the growing elderly population to be a problem and it concerns me that we do. As someone said, older people can contribute to the workforce. We should welcome the fact that people are living longer and should ensure that they have quality of life. Preventative expenditure should mean that as people get older they will need less help from the NHS and social services. If we use preventative spending correctly at this stage, it should bring savings at the end of the day.</p><p>I was interested in what has been said about tackling inequalities despite the Westminster cuts. I will focus on inequalities and universal services, which were topics of the committee round-table discussions. I was struck by the evidence of Peter Kelly of the Poverty Alliance, who said that unless sustainable growth was inclusive, we would retain the poverty trap and the gap between the top and the bottom 20 per cent. We must focus on that, because unless we remove the poverty trap and have real employment and jobs for people, we will not move forward and, as the report said, people will move in and out of poverty and will have no real advantage.</p><p>James McCormick of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation highlighted that more children in poverty in Scotland live in families in which someone is in work&#8212;it is important to remember that. We should continue to promote the living wage because it is a way out of poverty for many who are in work, but I recognise the value of the social wage for many of our hard-pressed families. In addition, the council tax freeze, free prescriptions and free eye tests keep many families out of debt and poverty.</p><p>There has been criticism of universal benefits such as free prescriptions, but we need to remember that many low-income families and people on long-term incapacity benefit had to pay for their prescriptions. Those with long-term illnesses and chronic conditions who required a number of medications found it particularly difficult to afford to pay for them. Some people went without because they did not have the money for their prescription. As Andrew Walker said in evidence, there is no evidence that free prescriptions or free eye care cost more. The point has been made that means testing some benefits could negate any saving that might be made. I consider free prescriptions to be preventative.</p><p>I also consider concessionary travel to be preventative spend. As I said earlier, we welcome people living longer, but they need to have quality of life. Free bus travel has definite health benefits. It allows people to get out and meet other people and get fresh air; and it keeps them mobile, because they get around and walk to bus stops, for example. Means testing that benefit would mean that people on the margins would lose out.</p><p>During the recent local elections campaign I talked to three people in their 70s who said that they could not do without the bus pass, which was a life saver for them. They are on the margins and do not qualify for pension credit, so they would not qualify for a bus pass under a means-tested system. They value their bus pass highly and know that it keeps them going. One said to me that if they did not have their bus pass and could not get out, they would be sitting at home looking at four walls. Is that what we want for people? That will not help, because it will cost us more at the end of the day. Individuals in such circumstances will require more healthcare and more interaction with our social services. As Paul Wheelhouse said, it is about values. We do some things because it is right to do them, and that is the case for the bus pass.</p><p>I am sorry that I have to wind up, because I have a lot more to say. I agree with Paul Wheelhouse that we are living within a fixed budget and that only when we get independence and have fiscal autonomy will we get the Scotland that we want.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fiscal Sustainability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank the Finance Committee for its work on the report.

We have heard that Scotland has one of the highest levels of MS in the world; recent research shows that its prevalence in Scotland is 200 per 100,000 of the population. In Ayrshire, that increases to 240 per 100,000. Currently, 950 people are registered with NHS Ayrshire and Arran as having MS.</p><p>It is therefore not surprising that Ayrshire has a very active branch of the MS Society, which is based in Kilwinning in my constituency. It is the largest branch in Scotland and it provides a range of support services to people with MS and their families. The service is managed and staffed solely by volunteers. It has been in existence for 42 years and has built up excellent relationships with the health board and the three Ayrshire councils. I spoke last week to branch members who told me that once they are diagnosed with MS, patients in Ayrshire receive excellent treatment and services. However, they also told me that the situation is not the same everywhere else in Scotland. We need to ensure that the very best treatment is available to all those who have MS, wherever they live.</p><p>The Kilwinning branch has adopted a ward in the Douglas Grant rehabilitation unit at Ayrshire central hospital. It is a purpose-built unit that offers specialist services to people who have neurological conditions. The local MS branch supports it by donating furniture, furnishings, televisions and other items to enhance the quality and experience of the people who use the unit. With the help of the staff of Hunterston B power station, they have also been able to provide lifting hoists and a specialised shower that is of great benefit to both staff and patients. Many people may think that such things should be supplied by statutory sources, but the branch&#8217;s view is that it will take that matter up later because it wants to make things better in the short term for people with MS.</p><p>I have not used the word &#8220;suffer&#8221; in relation to people with MS, because the local branch told me that they do not like to use it. However, the secretary, Harry, said to me, &#8220;To be honest, Margaret, I suffer. Some days I&#8217;m really suffering. The consultant said not to use the word, but I suffer.&#8221; We must recognise that.</p><p>The Kilwinning branch resource centre is also a place where, as George Adam mentioned, people can go and just talk to someone. They can get help with forms, in respect of all the complications that are going to arise because of welfare reform, which is a concern to people with MS. We must recognise that, because of the variability of their condition, it has always been difficult for them when they are trying to get the benefits to which they are entitled.</p><p>The branch also has a grants system. It distributes more than &#163;25,000 a year to people in Ayrshire who have MS. The only criteria are that a grant should improve a person&#8217;s quality of life or alleviate crisis for individuals or their families. Outwith Ayrshire, the branch has donated &#163;37,000 over the past two years to the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s J K Rowling research unit. As surveys continually stress, research to find a cure is the number 1 priority. I do not think that any of us would disagree with that.</p><p>All of that is done by fundraising all year round throughout Ayrshire and Arran. We heard about the report that said that there is little public awareness of MS, but it is our job to improve public understanding and to remove preconceptions surrounding the condition. However, the Scottish public give generously every day to the MS Society. Parliament should acknowledge that.</p><p>I pay tribute to all the volunteers, many of whom have MS, in Ayrshire and throughout Scotland who raise the funds and who work in and manage their local MS Society branches, because their efforts and dedication make a real difference to the quality of life of people who are living with MS.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666310", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Multiple Sclerosis Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, record my congratulations to George Adam on securing a debate on such an important issue.

There is now a far better understanding of the reasons for homelessness, and councils have a genuine desire to work collaboratively with other agencies to prevent homelessness and to support vulnerable people in sustaining tenancies to try to redress the problem of repeat homelessness.</p><p>That was not the situation 10 years ago. Then, there was almost a stand-off between local authorities and the advice sector. Neither the local authorities nor the advice sector really trusted the motives of the other, and each did their own thing, which was to no one&#8217;s advantage. We now know that collaborative working produces results, and there has been a welcome reduction in homelessness throughout the country. Like Shelter, I believe that those changes are due to the 2003 legislation, which all parties in the Parliament supported. It made everyone put their heads together and recognise that there was a real problem that had to be addressed.</p><p>The reasons for homelessness are numerous and complex, as are the solutions, and we have heard about many of them today. Councils should be congratulated on their progress but, as has been said, there are still potential barriers ahead that could impact on their meeting their targets. Those barriers include welfare reform, which a number of members have mentioned, and the housing benefit changes, the single occupancy rules and the downsizing of houses, which will perhaps result in local authorities facing a lack of housing of the correct size. There are more mortgage repossessions due to the economic conditions, and we should not forget that poverty produces homelessness&#8212;particularly repeat homelessness. I acknowledge the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach in trying to get everyone into employment and to produce the sustainable growth in the country that will help to alleviate poverty. We will never eradicate homelessness unless we eradicate poverty.</p><p>There is also a lack of funding for advice. Advice is a method of preventing homelessness, and I am encouraged that the issue was covered in the report and that the report recognised and recommended that advice should be part of the statutory procedure.</p><p>Members will not be surprised that I want to talk about the key role that independent advice can play in preventing homelessness. The value of good money advice cannot be overestimated. Many people have been prevented from losing their home simply by getting good money advice on mortgage and rent arrears, by being put on to debt arrangement schemes, or by being assisted with mortgage-to-rent schemes. All that sometimes happens without the local authority knowing about the situation. Homelessness is being prevented by advisers doing their job, but sometimes the statistics do not reach local authorities&#8217; books.</p><p>No one can overestimate the effect that the threat of losing a home has on an individual. I will share with members one of the first cases that I saw when I was an adviser, which is well beyond 10 years ago. A woman approached the citizens advice bureau the day that her house had been repossessed. She had been put out of her house that morning. Her children were at school, and they had not been told. I will never forget that story or the stress in that woman. She totally broke down; she could not cope with the situation, which she had kept from everyone. Her children were at school, but they did not know that they were coming home to a house that had been repossessed and was boarded up.</p><p>Such situations can no longer happen. The mortgage lender would have to tell the local authority that there was a possible repossession action, and the local authority and the other agencies could step in and prevent that from happening. We must therefore appreciate the improvements that we have made.

I will concentrate on a therapeutic garden in the part of North Ayrshire that I represent. As Annabel Goldie did, I received a letter from Trellis, which asked whether I would like to visit a therapeutic or community garden in my area. I admit that I did not know of that project. I said that I would like to take up its offer, and I was referred to Todhill Country Centre, which is situated between Kilwinning and Stevenston.</p><p>Todhill Country Centre is a residential unit for men with learning disabilities. It also caters for day-care patients and respite patients who have learning disabilities. Its garden is part of their therapy. The centre, which is set in the country, has a beautiful garden. It has apple trees and pear trees&#8212;not being a gardener, I hope I get this right&#8212;and it has cauliflowers, cucumbers, courgettes, tomato plants, hanging baskets and flowering plants that it sells to the local community. The plants are all grown from seed by the residents.</p><p>The benefits for the residents are incredible. The unit also has small animals; working with them is also therapeutic for the residents. The residents can choose whether to work with the animals or in the garden. Some of the residents have decided that they want to start making garden furniture and garden gnomes to sell to the local community on their open day.</p><p>Centres such as Todhill offer natural therapy, the benefits of which include feelings of safety, security and increased self-esteem for the residents. There is also the restorative effect of the natural environment&#8212;as we have talked about, there is nothing better than fresh air. The natural therapy also gives the residents a sense of responsibility and pride. They feel that they are part of the community; they are producing things and the rest of the community is coming in, purchasing them and looking around the place.</p><p>I was privileged to visit the Todhill Country Centre&#8212;I admit freely that I did not know it was there. It was one of those occasions when, as an MSP, one learns about something that is good and positive in one&#8217;s constituency. The residents and staff were all working together to prepare for their open day. They were excited about the plants that they were going to sell and they were considering what colours to paint their gnomes.

We have heard from all the organisations from which he seems to have got a different message. Every organisation that sat round the table at a Welfare Reform Committee meeting said that the benefit reforms, including the housing benefit reforms, would have a detrimental impact on all the poorest and the vulnerable in our society. They went as far as saying that the reforms would push child poverty back to its 1999 level. The Official Report will show that that was said.</p><p>I take issue with Alex Johnstone&#8217;s references to propaganda and scaremongering. There has been no more scaremongering than there was when the Conservatives talked about people who got &#163;2,000 a week in housing benefit. The answer to a freedom of information request was that, of the 5 million people in the UK who receive housing benefit, about 10 receive &#163;2,000, and they have particular circumstances. The Conservatives put out propaganda about that, which the tabloid press picked up. We should correct that image.</p><p>We have heard from other members about the issues that will arise for local authorities. My local authority reckons that about 3,000 people will be affected by the housing benefit reforms and that people will lose as much as up to &#163;10 a week, simply because of the single-occupancy rule. I have no issue with people moving house if they want to do so, but I am concerned about forcing people to move simply for the crime of having a bedroom that is not being used. Making such people move is fundamentally wrong and is against everything that I thought that we in Scotland stood for. People should be able to have their home for the rest of their life, if they want. Unfortunately, that will no longer be the case for somebody who is poor. I have an issue with that.</p><p>We hear people say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s give people financial responsibility.&#8221; I say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get real.&#8221; Nobody can teach us better about budgeting than those who are on low incomes or benefits. They could teach us all something about budgeting.</p><p>Those people are really struggling just now. Every single penny counts. They simply cannot afford an extra pound in rent. They are struggling to pay for essential items; they are not buying luxuries or having a coffee. They are struggling to decide whether to buy a loaf of bread or a tin of beans for the kids&#8212;and sometimes the children go without. It is not right to put an extra burden on people who are in such circumstances by telling them, &#8220;There&#8217;s your money; sort out how you are going to pay your rent yourself.&#8221; They do not want that, and neither do the local authorities.</p><p>From my previous job I know that there is nothing more distressing than witnessing the despair of someone who is about to lose their home. It is the final straw for them and comes at the end of a financial and mental struggle from which their health and relationships often never recover. Citizens Advice Scotland anticipates that demand for advice in such circumstances will increase, and it is right to point out that it is cheaper to provide good debt and welfare advice than it is to deal with homelessness and bankruptcy&#8212;and good advice has better social outcomes. I have seen it working at first hand and it truly makes a positive difference to people.</p><p>The poorest and most vulnerable are being penalised simply because they are poor and vulnerable, and that is absolutely unacceptable. We have heard today about the Tories being for the working people. A lot of the people whom we are talking about today work but do not earn enough, so they get help with their rent. They will not be helped by today&#8217;s budget because any assistance that has been given through benefits is taken away through taxes. They will not be better off.</p><p>The devolution of social security would allow this Parliament to do much more for the most vulnerable of our citizens.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663621", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Benefit Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I say to Alex Johnstone that I will not apologise for talking about how the issue will affect people in my constituency and elsewhere in Scotland.

It has been described as a form of credit whereby the borrower gives the lender authorisation to make an automatic withdrawal from their bank account as security for a supposedly short-term loan, which has to be repaid in full, plus interest, on the borrower&#8217;s next pay day. That seems fairly straightforward and it looks like an easy way to access money, until we look at how it operates in practice&#8212;therein lies the problem.</p><p>We should not forget that the proliferation of pay day lenders on our high streets and now online came about because states in Canada and the USA, where pay day lending originated, started to regulate the industry, which made it less profitable. What did the lenders do? They moved into Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom and have grown exponentially here ever since. It is almost unbelievable that nothing was learned from the US experience, where it was found that the cost of borrowing was so high that more than 70 per cent of borrowers could not pay back the loan and loans were rolled over time and again, with increasing penalties and punitive interest charges. It was also found that borrowers typically had loans from more than one pay day lender and that there were clear links between the growth of pay day lending and personal insolvency levels. Significantly, the experience in the US was that, despite arguments to the contrary, the pay day loan industry targeted lower-income and minority groups.</p><p>Does all that sound depressingly familiar? It should, because that is exactly what is happening here. Successive UK governments have ignored the problem, as they did with the banks and the sub-prime lenders until it was too late, and they have still not learned.</p><p>We all know that the companies target the vulnerable and low-paid. You only need to walk down the main street of any our towns, such as Irvine in my constituency, to see that. Irvine is a town in which personal debt levels are already high. When I walk the short distance from my constituency office to the station, I pass four pay day lending shops. On Tuesday, two on opposite sides of the road had billboards outside saying, &#8220;Got a job? Got a debit card? Get a loan.&#8221; That enrages me and it should concern all of us because it is people who are already in debt who are being targeted. The loans are given without regard to the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay. The borrower signs a payment authority as security and, worryingly, that type of agreement can be cancelled only by the lender, so the lender has it every way and the borrower is trapped.</p><p>Let me give you an example from my time with the citizens advice bureau. I had a couple who were in financial difficulties and had borrowed &#163;400 from a pay day lender. By the time they came to me, they were getting &#163;400 every month before pay day from the lender to pay essential bills, then on every pay day the lender got &#163;479 straight back from their bank account. The loan was being rolled over every month, and that had been going on for over nine months before we intervened. It had already cost the couple over &#163;700 to borrow &#163;400, and they still had an outstanding payment. That is the problem: the original loan just keeps getting rolled over again and again and the interest and costs just keep increasing. In my view, that is usury and exploitation of vulnerable people, and it has to stop.</p><p>It is not hard to see how people in circumstances such as I have outlined are then forced into taking out a further loan from another high street lender as they get deeper and deeper into debt. That view is supported by evidence from Citizens Advice Scotland, which tells us that clients with pay day loans have an average of three debts more than those without pay day loans, suggesting that people in long-term financial difficulty are much more likely to take out a pay day loan. We cannot allow people to be trapped in a system that offers them little protection and inadequate access to affordable credit. Regulation is needed and it is needed now. We should ask the UK Government to consider capping interest rates, restricting the number of times that a loan can be rolled over, encouraging data sharing between lenders to ensure people&#8217;s ability to pay and referring borrowers to money advice services when it is clear that they are in financial difficulty.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658774", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High-interest Pay Day Loans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the members who have supported my motion on high-interest pay day lending, particularly those from the Labour Party and the Green Party, whose support helped secure the debate.

However, although I appreciate the consensual approach from Labour this morning, I must point out that it started the welfare reform cuts.

Every last one of those organisations confirmed just how devastating the consequences will be for the most vulnerable people in our communities. Those organisations are at the coalface of Scottish society, and their evidence is based on real experiences of real people on a day-to-day basis. We cannot ignore their evidence. They are telling us that the UK welfare reform proposals will increase personal debt, unemployment, homelessness, discrimination and poverty.</p><p>We have heard about the additional pressure on advice services. They are already struggling, but the evidence tells us that their advice will be needed more than ever before if the proposals go ahead. Advice centres will need to be funded to provide those services, which is another burden on the Scottish Government.</p><p>Although welfare reform is a reserved matter, the cabinet secretary has outlined just how much it will impact on the matters that are the responsibility of this Scottish Parliament and the resulting effect on our local authorities in meeting their statutory obligations and homelessness targets.</p><p>I want to talk about homelessness. A few members have mentioned it, but I do not think that we should underestimate the risk of increased homelessness. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations estimates that more than 60,000 tenants will be affected by the rule on so-called overoccupancy. Many will simply be unable to pay the difference between the actual rent and the benefit that they receive, forcing them into homelessness as rent arrears accrue and local authorities do not have the accommodation to take them in.</p><p>Rent arrears in the social rented sector are likely to increase because, it is proposed, the payments will be made directly to the claimant as part of the universal credit and not to the landlord as happens at present. That is trying to fix something that is not broken. It is not necessary: the current system works. Has no one in London asked how people living in social housing want or need their housing benefit to be paid? The change will affect people who already have to juggle a limited income among items of essential expenditure; people who have no extra money and often have to make immediate but impossible decisions; and people who sometimes have to decide between a pair of children&#8217;s shoes and a power card&#8212;and, now, their rent.</p><p>Incidentally, many people living on low income prefer using power cards&#8212;even though they cost more&#8212;because they can buy the card on the day they collect their benefit or wages and it is one less thing for them to worry about. It is a form of budgeting, as is the payment of rent direct to the landlord. It is a disgrace that fuel suppliers get away with charging more to vulnerable people who are trying their hardest to budget and keep out of debt, but it is also a disgrace that the UK Government, by paying housing benefit as part of the universal credit, will push people into debt and homelessness, putting more pressure on our local authorities and advice services.</p><p>Has the UK Government thought about the practicalities that are involved and how many people will have access to a method by which they can pay their rent? How many people have a basic post office account or a basic, cash-only bank account, with no facility for direct debits or standing orders? For many people on benefits and people who have experienced financial problems, that kind of account is a vital budgeting tool. Those people have taken responsibility for keeping themselves out of debt and they should not be forced to take a different route, which could leave them in financial difficulties. As we all know, few people live next door to the rent office and are able simply to walk in and pay their rent.</p><p>It is clear, from what we have heard today, that the matter of welfare reform requires continued analysis and scrutiny to assess the impact on our citizens and services. That is why I support the establishment of an ad hoc welfare and benefits committee for the duration of this session. I think that we should listen to the voluntary organisations that have asked for that.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s stance on legislative consent.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657862", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have heard many fine contributions from members and compelling reasons why we must continue to persuade the UK Government to reconsider its Welfare Reform Bill.

It is important to consider how the people of Cunninghame South and North Ayrshire will be affected by the proposed changes to public sector pensions.</p><p>Last week, I spoke to many families in my constituency who told me that they are struggling to make ends meet and finding it difficult to cope. They are already experiencing the pay freeze, higher VAT charges, significant increases in energy costs, rising inflation and increases in national insurance contributions, and there are proposed cuts to working tax credits. They are now being asked to pay higher pension contributions, work longer and, in many cases, receive less when they retire.</p><p>Is it any wonder that those families are telling me that they would rather have the money to spend now, because they have to make the choice now between heating and eating, or between buying shoes for their children and paying their house insurance? Make no mistake about it: those are the choices that the families in my constituency, and I am sure in other constituencies, are facing. My concern is that many of those families will simply choose to opt out of the pension schemes. That would be in no one&#8217;s interests, because it would leave individuals and families in a worse position in retirement and affect the viability of the pension schemes, because less money would be going in.</p><p>I very much support the SNP Government&#8217;s position that the case for pension reform should be considered in a timetable that suits Scotland&#8217;s interests, not the UK Government&#8217;s interests, and that any reform must be affordable, fair and sustainable and&#8212;more important&#8212;must happen with the agreement of all those concerned.</p><p>People who are currently in receipt of public sector pensions&#8212;let us not forget that the average pension is less than &#163;6,000, and that the average for women drops considerably&#8212;will also have less money, because the basis for uprating pensions will change from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index. All predictions say that in the long term that will reduce the value of benefits paid out by 15 per cent.</p><p>I referred to this matter affecting all the people in my constituency. I will try to explain that. In case anyone imagines that public sector pension changes and welfare benefit reforms are no concern of theirs, they should consider this: every benefit cut, every additional pension contribution and every failure to uprate pensions fully will cut the money in people&#8217;s pockets, reduce spending power in Cunninghame South and throughout Scotland, and therefore hurt businesses and threaten jobs that my constituency for one can ill afford to lose. Asking public sector workers to pay more towards their pensions at this time is, in my view, just plain daft.</p><p>In contrast, the Scottish Government, within its existing powers, is helping hard-pressed families by introducing the Scottish living wage across the public sector where it has direct control; introducing a no compulsory redundancy policy in its public sector, which protects 10,000 jobs; continuing the council tax freeze for the life of this parliamentary session, bringing an average saving of &#163;1,200 to band D households; introducing free prescriptions, when 600,000 low earners were struggling to pay the charges; and keeping Scottish Water under public control and allowing water charges to be frozen for a further two years.

The former Labour Government introduced employment and support allowance and the work capability assessment, which has never been fit for purpose. We have taken people off that allowance and put them on the unemployed register without any support, or assistance to obtain support. It is reckoned that the number of people who look for every job will increase by five in North Ayrshire, where 23 people already apply for every job.</p><p>Labour wanted a reduction to three in the child&#8217;s age at which lone parents would come off income support and register for work, but it did not get away with that. It cannot turn around and blame all that on the Tories. The maintenance reforms that are to be introduced will increase child poverty, as will benefit caps.</p><p>My colleague Bob Doris spoke well about how the proposed housing benefit changes will increase homelessness and affect the housing strategies of many local authorities up and down the country.</p><p>The most vulnerable and disadvantaged are the people who are sick and unable to work; they feel that they are being persecuted. That happens every time welfare benefits change. The view is, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get the most vulnerable.&#8221; DLA will be removed and replaced by the personal independence payment. We have no idea how that will be assessed, but we know that 20 per cent fewer people will receive that payment, whether or not 20 per cent fewer people will need it. That is wrong.</p><p>In the mental health debate last week, I talked about the impact of benefits changes on people who are mentally ill. I have seen that&#8212;I have seen people being driven back into hospital simply because of how the benefits system has treated them. The work capability assessment was not designed for people with mental health problems and some people have been pushed from pillar to post. I have seen people being taken off employment and support allowance and told to claim jobseekers allowance. When they claim JSA, they are told that they are not fit to work and that they should go back to claim ESA. People go round and round in that circle&#8212;it is still happening&#8212;and they receive no money. That affects people&#8217;s mental health, so that must be examined.</p><p>It is clear that demand for the services of local authorities and voluntary organisations will increase, and we must deal with that. Exceptional pressure will be put on organisations that provide advice and assistance to the vulnerable groups and we must ensure that they are properly funded to deliver the service that is asked of them.</p><p>I make a plea for a separate committee to scrutinise welfare reform, because of its importance.

I hope that I will keep within my time.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate. Promotion of good mental health should be important to us all&#8212;that has come through clearly from throughout the chamber from everyone who has spoken. There is a consensus that we want to do something and to improve our mental health strategy. That is to be commended.</p><p>It is right that our mental health strategy is focused on the individual, but it must also be effective and operate in a culture of continuous improvement. That is why we are looking at the strategy again at the start of this new session of Parliament.</p><p>Many members have spoken about the briefings that we have had from Barnardo&#8217;s, SAMH, and Action for Smoking and Health Scotland. They are helpful and useful, and I hope that they will inform the debate and the strategy that we will finally agree.</p><p>As the minister said, we should recognise that significant improvements have already been made. There has been a reduction in psychiatric admissions; we have the national dementia strategy; there has been an increase in dementia diagnosis by GPs; there has been a reduction in deaths by suicide; there has been a recognition of the role of families and carers in the treatment process&#8212;my colleague George Adam mentioned that; and more people are being treated in the community.</p><p>The one thing we have all agreed is that we have not tackled the stigma completely. We should not beat ourselves about the head too much about that, because we are tackling generations of stigma about mental health; it is not just something that has occurred in the life of this Parliament. I remember 40-odd years ago a member of my family being diagnosed with a serious mental illness. It was not talked about and we were not allowed to mention it. My parents died and it was never spoken about in our family. That is sad, because there was no shame in it. I know, and always knew, that there was no shame in it, but we just did not talk about it&#8212;not in the house and not outside. That is what we are tackling, but we have moved a long, long way since then. I can stand up here and say that my father had a serious mental illness, and there is no shame in it. That is the message that we must get out to all the communities. I therefore support the see me campaign, what it has done in the field and the support that the Scottish Government has given it.</p><p>I will concentrate the rest of my remarks on external factors that have a significant impact on mental health. We cannot have a debate on mental health that does not link with the social and economic issues, such as deprivation and poverty, that all impact on mental health. For me, the best illustration is my constituency in North Ayrshire. North Ayrshire community health partnership has a higher than average percentage of people living in deprivation, and it has the highest unemployment and youth unemployment of any community health partnership area in Scotland. It also has a higher than average number of patients who are being prescribed drugs for depression, anxiety and psychosis; a higher than average number of patients with psychiatric hospitalisation; and a higher than average number of deaths by suicide.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm mentioned the work of the choose life strategy, which has had an impact on the suicide rate in North Ayrshire. The rate is still above the average, but has come down dramatically and is now at a 12-year low. I hope that that trend will continue. It is the work of the see me strategy and that of local groups and organisations, which are not all health-centre based but which work collaboratively for the common aim of reducing the number of suicides. That has worked in North Ayrshire and it must continue, and the strategy that we develop should take that into account.</p><p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran has exceeded the 50 per cent HEAT target for suicide prevention training of front-line staff. I agree with other members that that training should go beyond health service staff to any public services and voluntary organisations that come into daily contact with people with mental health issues.</p><p>We cannot hide from the fact that poor living conditions, worklessness and financial problems are contributory factors to or, sometimes, are the cause of the more common mental health problems. The spending review that the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth announced last week looked to the long term in setting up new enterprise zones in deprived areas, the more choices, more chances programme and the social wage, which will prevent some of the minor mental health issues that we see just now from occurring. All those programmes are designed for long-term stability.</p><p>For those who have more complex and enduring mental health problems, we still need a very integrated service, because external factors will impact on them. Changes to the benefits system, for example, will impact on people with mental health problems. They can be sorted out and their conditions can be stable, but having no money can have a knock-on effect and can have them back receiving more intensive treatment. Such external factors must be considered in any strategy.</p><p>I support the motion in the name of Michael Matheson and look forward to seeing all the responses to the consultation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

Unlike Willie, I am not from Onthank, but I know the community well. I worked with the people of Onthank and others in Kilmarnock for more than 24 years. One of the first things that I learned when I took up my job was that Onthank considers itself to be a community. The people see themselves first and foremost as residents of Onthank.</p><p>I remember that when I started working there, I suggested to someone that Onthank is still Kilmarnock; I was corrected and I never made that mistake again. Onthank is a very proud community and the people do not deserve to be treated in the way that they have been by the BBC.</p><p>Vulnerable people were exploited and, as my colleague Willie Coffey has already said, they regret it now. Some of them are living with the consequences of their day of fame.</p><p>The people of Onthank are proud of their community. They also know that there are problems in the community. They know about the drug and alcohol problems and that some people lead chaotic lifestyles, but they are a small minority of the residents. The people of Onthank, the community groups, the local authority, the health board and voluntary agencies are working actively to address those problems, which are not exclusive to Onthank; they are in every community in Scotland. We have a duty to work together to find long-term solutions to the deep-rooted problems in all our communities.</p><p>My issue with the BBC is about the name of the programme. &#8220;The Scheme&#8221; focused not on a problem but on an area, and that was wrong. It concentrated almost exclusively on the problems of a small minority of people who are living chaotic lifestyles. There was no balance between that and all the good things that happen in Onthank, such as the schools that Willie Coffey talked about. This week, I read about the nursery school in Onthank getting a glowing report from the care commission, and that the parents were congratulated on their input and the effort that they put into the nursery school. A lot of what is going on in Onthank is good.</p><p>Willie Coffey is right about the impact that the programme has had on the people and their families&#8212;I saw it. They took it as a slur on their community, which was portrayed as a community blighted by drugs and alcohol, as if there was nothing else there. That was very insulting to them. They saw the spectacle of people from many parts of Scotland driving around Onthank expecting to see a rammy in the street or people taking drugs in public, which, of course, they did not see. They saw a housing estate like any other housing estate in our towns and cities, with people going about their business as they would do anywhere. That is the reality of Onthank.</p><p>The programme did highlight some important issues about drugs, alcohol and deprivation. Society needs to know about those issues and we must address them, so I do not have an argument with the BBC about that. My argument is with the way in which it tried to build that into some sort of reality TV programme.</p><p>The programme had a negative impact on the majority of the Onthank residents, and on the wider community of Kilmarnock. The people saw their community turned into something akin to a soap opera. I urge the BBC and any other programme producers who want to raise issues in future to consider the impact that the programme will have. When they leave the town and walk away, they will, I hope, consider the problems, the negativity and the way that people are left feeling, and I hope that they will consult the wider community before they try to put a programme like that on again.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649905", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;The Scheme&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Willie Coffey for bringing the debate to the chamber because it raises some important issues.

This is my first speech, so, not surprisingly, the first thing that I want to say is how honoured I am to have been elected to represent the people of Cunninghame South. It is a privilege but also a responsibility, which I will not shirk. I will always do my very best for the people of Cunninghame South.</p><p>It is also appropriate at this time to say something about my predecessor, Irene Oldfather, who was the member for Cunninghame South for 12 years. Irene chaired the cross-party group on Alzheimer&#8217;s, which helped to shape our national dementia strategy, which was announced last year. It is therefore only right that we acknowledge her work in the field of dementia and assure her that the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy is committed to getting it right for people with dementia and their families, as I hope we all are. I wish Irene well.</p><p>I turn now to the debate. I will not say the title, because it is such a mouthful. I will focus my comments on employment. My constituency is in North Ayrshire, which consistently has one of the highest levels of unemployment in Scotland, which we need to change.</p><p>It was the SNP&#8217;s proposals on jobs that got me elected. We heard from members last week that we did not mention jobs during the election campaign, but we did&#8212;it was jobs, jobs, jobs. That is why I am here&#8212;people liked what the SNP was saying on jobs.</p><p>I want to say something about those who have no jobs, because it focuses on why we are all here. Every day in my work with the citizens advice bureau service, I saw the impact that unemployment has on individuals and their families&#8212;the relationships that break down, the mental health problems, the bills that cannot be paid, the homes that are lost and the intolerable strain on families. Our job creation programme will make things better for those people.</p><p>Youth unemployment, which many members have mentioned, is at a crisis level in Cunninghame South, as it is in many other parts of Scotland, and is causing a large section of young people to become disengaged from their communities. I have spoken to many of those young people, who say that they lie in bed all day because there is nothing to get up for&#8212;they have given up. Those people are our future, which is why we need to make things better for them.</p><p>The examples that I have outlined are not exclusive to Cunninghame South; they are everywhere in Scotland&#8212;just ask citizens advice bureaux.</p><p>I will talk about the public sector, which is the biggest employer in North Ayrshire. We all acknowledge that there are tough times ahead, with the looming Westminster cuts. We need to persuade the local authorities to agree a policy of no compulsory redundancies. The Scottish Government has done that for its services; we need to make local authorities do it, too.</p><p>My colleague the member for Cunninghame North said last week that in North Ayrshire Council dozens of classroom assistants and school staff are being made compulsorily redundant. I have to say that that was opposed by the SNP group on the council. Our public sector workers and their families need reassurance and stability, not uncertainty. There has to be another way for them.</p><p>Many are looking to us to make things better, given their hopes and aspirations, so we must support the ambitious plans for jobs and sustainability that the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth has put before us today. That is the way forward. I say to the cabinet secretary that North Ayrshire is ideally placed to contribute to and benefit from the opportunities that renewable energy presents. I will also be asking him to find a place in future plans for the upgrading of the A737, which is one of the main routes into North Ayrshire. The local businesses there see that as their number 1 priority, particularly if they are to benefit fully from the business support package that has been outlined today.</p><p>I return to our young people. The measures that are proposed for them on youth employment, education and skills, such as 25,000 modern apprenticeships a year for the next five years, will make the difference. The key point for me is that those apprenticeships will be linked to real jobs. In the past, we have seen too many supposed job-creation schemes from Westminster that have provided only what I call kiddy-on jobs, which offer the young person neither skills nor opportunities. We cannot allow that to happen again. We must ensure that the modern apprenticeships in our constituencies are linked to real jobs, as intended. I will certainly monitor that in Cunninghame South.</p><p>The strategy that the cabinet secretary has presented today is the right way forward. We will get Scotland&#8217;s economy growing to deliver prosperity and a more sustainable future, but we all&#8212;members in the chamber, people in local authorities, businesses, our young people and every agency in Scotland&#8212;need to work together. It must be a collective effort. However, like many others in the Parliament, I believe that Scotland will really flourish only with the economic levers and powers of independence.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.
