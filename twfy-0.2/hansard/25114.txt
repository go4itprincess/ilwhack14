The leader of the Opposition has been using the term “real world” quite a lot of late, but I think that, sometimes, the Opposition sees the real world as some kind of fantasy land. We heard Sarah Boyack talking about the SNP’s financial straitjacket. The reality is that we work with a fixed budget that is set by Westminster. Her Labour colleagues created the economic shambles that we all must deal with, and the Tory and Liberal coalition is adding to the woes by continuing with austerity. We must recognise what has happened and why there is a financial straitjacket, which is not of this Government’s making but the making of Governments past and present at Westminster. Let us look at how the fixed amount of money that we get is being divvied out. Between 2007-08 and 2012-13 the Scottish budget increased by 6.4 per cent, but local government’s budget increased by 8.9 per cent—higher than the increase in the budget as a whole. Surely no one can deny that fact. We have heard again today an attack on the council tax freeze yet, as my colleague Mark McDonald rightly pointed out, when it comes to elections the Labour Party is all too keen to support the council tax freeze. It is about time it told the people of Scotland the truth about what it would do with council tax if it was in power.

I will tell Sarah Boyack how we could make almost everything fairer—by voting for an independent Scotland on September 18. That is the reality of the situation. We do not have to put up with Labour Governments that trash the economy and Tory and Liberal coalitions that continue austerity programmes. What we need in Scotland is control over our own affairs so that we can deal with things fairly—and the sooner, the better.

The last thing that one would want to do to the people of this country at this moment would be to raise the basic rate of income tax. If we had control over other taxation levers, the situation might be different. Let us face facts: Alex Johnstone and his party want to decrease the amount of money that this Government has to spend. His leader has called for a decrease in that rate of taxation, which would mean even less for local government and other public services, so I will take no lessons from Mr Johnstone in that regard. Let us look at the things that this Government is having to mitigate with moneys that could go into other public services. The bedroom tax mitigation, which is most welcome, the Scottish welfare fund and the council tax reduction scheme are all things that this Government is implementing to mitigate the effect the nonsense that the Tory-Liberal coalition is putting forward. That £0.25 billion over the next few years could do much to provide front-line services, but no, we have to provide a safety net for the poor because the Tory-Liberal coalition will not. I urge Parliament to support this settlement.

The finance secretary most certainly did that. There have been changes in the three-year settlement, as Mr Rennie knows. However, let me ask Mr Rennie—

Will Mr Rennie support me in calling on Aberdeen City Council’s leaders to ask COSLA for a change to the funding formula to take account of population changes, which would allow Aberdeen to get much more money than it currently does?

Will Richard Baker give way?

If memory serves me well, the Labour Party in Aberdeen rejected the business rates incentivisation scheme when the Government first proposed it, just as it rejected tax incremental financing. Unless it has proposed a thing, it is not happy about it. Has the council changed its mind on the business rates incentivisation scheme and on TIF?

Would it be better for Mr Brown not to lecture us on the subject but to do the decent thing and abolish the bedroom tax? [Applause.]

I have told the chamber before that it came as a bit of a shock, when I was first elected some 15 years ago, to be told that I was a parent. My shock increased dramatically when I was told that I was a parent of hundreds of children. Now, in this place, like everyone else, I am the corporate parent to thousands of children in this country. That is why I have always had an interest in adoption and fostering. It is much better if a kid ends up with parents rather than going through the care system. When it comes to adoption and fostering, consideration of a child’s future is paramount. I cannot understand Mr Lyle’s amendment 1, which would make special provision for one set of beliefs but not, as Mr Eadie outlined eloquently earlier, for other beliefs. The amendment is a bit daft, to say the least, because we would end up with huge numbers of other folk coming forward with future amendments on adoption and fostering, asking for special protection for other folks who hold different beliefs. That would be a rod for our own backs. I am very interested to hear what the cabinet secretary has to say on the issue. However, as it stands, amendment 1 should be rejected by Parliament.

Earlier today, during stage 3, Mr Mason asked us to accept one or two amendments to show that we have been listening. Later, Alex Johnstone said that we should have accepted some amendments as a “token”. We should not agree to amendments or make legislation for tokenistic reasons. We have struck the right balance. On showing that we have been listening, I have been listening to the many constituents who have contacted me. By 10 to one, folks in my constituency have told me to vote in favour of the bill today. I have respect for people of all religions and am glad that we have the bill that we have. I will quote one of my constituents, who wrote to me just the other day: “I am a Christian and urge you to remember that there are Christians in your town who wish to support inclusion and equality.” We must all take cognisance of the views of individuals and not just the views of organisations, which sometimes do not reflect the views of those who participate in those organisations. That is my wee bit of politicking. All this is about equality. I think about two wee girls in Aberdeen with two wee mummies—not two wee mummies; two mummies. I am going to get into trouble for that. They should have the same rights as any other family. If their parents want to marry, they should be allowed to marry. Those two wee girls may well have married mummies sooner rather than later. Alex Johnstone talked about strong families; I am a great supporter of strong families. I talked in the stage 1 debate about my family and the strength that I have taken from having parents who have stayed together for many years and who have gone through the joy and happiness and the trials and tribulations of marriage. I hope that others in our society will soon be able to have those same experiences—although maybe with a little less of the trials and tribulations, it has to be said. Like Alex Johnstone, I think that strong families often breed strong societies. He said that marriage should be “a bedrock”. I do not disagree with that statement, either. The only problem that I have, which I hope we will address today, is that folks who love one another and who are of the same sex cannot marry at the present time. Many folk have said that today is a historic day. I agree. I hope that we take the bold step today to rid our society further of discrimination. Most of all, I hope that we will think about the families that already exist across this country in which the parents are not allowed to marry, and the people who will want to follow the line of marriage in the future. I said at stage 1 that I will bear no malice, no matter how folk vote on this issue, but I hope that they will vote for the bill, because I think that it is a good piece of legislation, which has been strengthened by the efforts of the cabinet secretary and the many campaigning groups, on both sides, that have contributed to making it what it is. I will bear no malice, but I will make the same appeal that I made at stage 1: think of the future. Think of your sons and daughters and grandchildren, who may well turn out to be LGBT. Give them the same opportunities that many of you had. Allow them to marry.

The Aberdeen fire and police control room staff in my constituency have provided a high-quality service for many years. I am dismayed at the proposals by the fire board and the Police Authority to close those facilities, and I have let them know my opinion. Does the cabinet secretary know whether the fire board and the Police Authority have considered pooling their resources to share control rooms? If not, should they consider doing so? I would, of course, propose Aberdeen as an ideal location for hosting a joint control room.

Will Mr Gray give way?

Will the member give way?

I commend the cabinet secretary for introducing a budget that protects the social wage and expands the delivery of services to hard-pressed families who are having to deal with the austerity budget that Westminster has thrust upon us. I am pleased that there will be continuing support for free prescriptions, free tuition, concessionary fares, free personal care and—for the seventh year in a row—a council tax freeze. The cabinet secretary says that since the freeze came into being, it has saved the average Scottish family £1,200—and up to £1,600 in some areas of Scotland, such as Aberdeen and Fife.

I do not think that Labour supports the council tax freeze until it comes to by-elections, which is the only time we see Labour members supporting it. In every other fora in which I come across Labour members, they say that the council tax freeze should go and that councils should once more be able to increase that tax. That is yet another one of those Labour policy fudges—[Interruption.] Jenny Marra may laugh from the sidelines, but I want to know what Labour’s position on the council tax actually is. When is the cuts commission going to report back? When will we really know what Labour policy is? We have heard much about mitigation of welfare reform, and I am pleased that the cabinet secretary has found £244 million over three years to deal with the worst excesses of that Westminster policy. Unfortunately, under the devolved settlement, there is absolutely no way in which the cabinet secretary can mitigate every single aspect of welfare reform. All members have to realise that that is the case.

I am very familiar with it, and there have been many arguments over the years about what that power actually means. However, we have a restriction, which was put in place by the Westminster Government, to two and a half times the amount that that Government gave. That is a fact, and one that Mr Eadie pointed out to Parliament earlier. I am glad that Miss Marra and her colleagues have changed their position on the bedroom tax, but I remind them that it was the Labour Party that introduced the bedroom tax, although the Tories and Lib Dems extended it to social housing.

No, thank you—I have taken enough interventions and I need to progress. I reiterate that we all have to understand that not every aspect of welfare reform can be mitigated, which is why I think that the Parliament should have control over all aspects of welfare. We have had good news today on employment. The unemployment rate is at 6.4 per cent, which is the lowest since the first quarter of 2009. Over the year, the number of women in employment increased by 62,000, which is the largest annual increase on record, and we have had the largest annual increase in the employment level since April to June 2007. However, I think that we could do more. For example, we have done extremely well on modern apprentices, yet Westminster prevents us from having the European youth guarantee scheme, which is a real pity. Beyond that, the transformational changes to childcare that are proposed in the white paper “Scotland’s Future” could result in even more women in work. A huge amount of the Westminster Government’s economic policy is based round the needs of London. This week, Tony Travers said: “London is the dark star of the economy, inexorably sucking in resources, people and energy. Nobody quite knows how to control it.” Last month, Westminster’s business secretary Vince Cable said that London “is becoming a giant suction machine draining the life out of the rest of the country”. I want that giant sucking machine to be switched off and the Scottish Parliament to control all the levers of power so that we can do even better in budgeting for the future.

Will the member give way? Mike MacKenzie rose—

I pay tribute to the organisations out there that are doing a huge amount of work in tackling mental health stigma and in trying to prevent suicide—organisations such as the Scottish Association for Mental Health, the choose life programme co-ordinators and volunteers across the country and the Samaritans, who have been mentioned quite a lot in the debate. Many of us recently had the privilege of meeting Samaritans from throughout Scotland who are doing immense work, in my community in Aberdeen and elsewhere. In its briefing for the debate, SAMH asks a number of questions that I have asked myself in a previous guise as a local councillor. It asks the Scottish Government how it will ensure that local authorities and community planning partnerships are held to account for the suicide prevention work that they are obliged to carry out under single outcome agreements. SAMH calls for more transparency from local authorities and others in pointing out what they are doing. I think that that is required. I am convinced that a lot of good work is going on, but it is a subject that we do not talk enough about. We talk about relatives and friends who die of natural causes, but folk often do not talk about those folk that they have known who have taken their own lives. We must get much better at doing that. We also have an obligation to challenge behaviour. Far too often in society—in the media, in particular—we see a stigmatisation of mental ill health. We have seen headlines galore, over many years, using language that should not be used to describe folk with mental health problems. All of us here and beyond should challenge such behaviour. We now have the new media—the social media—which Dr Milne talked about, and we see a huge amount of bullying and horrid language there. Before the debate, I looked at some recent cases of suicide. Dr Milne mentioned the young man from Dunfermline who, after being blackmailed after using the internet, could see no way out other than to take his own life. There are countless stories out there, but one that I was really struck by had the headline, “Ballet girl was ‘hooked on Tumblr where users encouraged her to harm herself’”. That is beyond my ken—why would anyone do that? However, it is obvious that such behaviour goes on. That girl took her own life. We should look at ensuring that social media sites are not used to bully folk and to leave them with what they think is very little option, and I think that we can do that. A BBC Scotland report from 22 June 2012 had the headline, “Social media ‘could cut suicide’”. It said that, in a study by the University of Stirling in 2009, “one in five school children said the internet, including social networking sites, influenced their decision to self-harm.” It went on to say: “Now the researchers say the possible dangers posed by new media could be counteracted if the sites provided support for vulnerable young people.” In that report, Professor Rory O’Connor of the University of Stirling’s suicidal behaviour research laboratory is quoted as saying that “The reasons for adolescent suicide and self-harm are multiple and complex. My colleagues and I see that the challenge is ensuring that new media provide support for vulnerable young people, rather than helping or encouraging self-destructive behaviours.” I am pleased that organisations such as SAMH and the Samaritans now have a presence on Twitter, Facebook and other new media sites, because I think that that can be immensely beneficial. Interaction with such organisations on new media sites is often helpful for people who may have some dark thoughts. The difference between the suicide rate among the poor and that among the more affluent members of society has been mentioned. Mr Coffey said that the suicide rate in the most deprived areas was more than three times higher than the rate in more affluent areas. One of my main concerns is welfare reform and the austerity measures that are being implemented under the direction of the Westminster Government. As many other members probably do, I regularly have folk come to me who feel despair, isolation and a lack of self-worth, because of the changes that have been thrust on them. We need to take cognisance of the impact of the welfare reforms on people’s mental wellbeing, and we must ensure that we do the right thing in that regard by doing all that we can to help folk who have been affected in that way. In my opinion, the best way of dealing with that would be to halt the austerity measures and to stop the worst impacts of welfare reform, and I hope that that will be possible in the very near future.

I am glad that Mr Gibson talked about the inroads that have been made in relation to reporting. There are a huge number of responsible journalists out there. However, one thing that is little discussed is the way in which folks with mental health difficulties are often portrayed in entertainment programmes such as “The X Factor”. Does Mr Gibson agree that we should challenge the producers of those television programmes as well as the print media?

I understand—I do not think that this is a Westminster myth—that, for a great number of years, the sons and daughters of newly elected MPs received a letter from the son of a previous MP about the difficulties that they would face and the pressures that they would be under because their parent had entered elected politics. Mr Carlaw’s sons can obviously cope, but many families cannot. That is yet another area in which some folks do not realise the damage that they are causing.

I look forward to the Scottish National Party spring conference at the AECC later this year. When it came to power, the Labour-led administration in Aberdeen claimed to have written off the debt of the current AECC, but I understand that that has still not happened. Does the minister agree that it might not be wise to invest in a new facility when the significant debt of the existing facility remains on the books?

In every debate that we have on the NHS in Scotland, we inevitably think about the part that it plays in dealing with the illnesses and ailments of our loved ones, whether they be friends or family, and I want to pay tribute to all the staff in the NHS in Scotland, from cleaners to consultants. I think that they are second to none. Like everyone else in the chamber, as an MSP I often have folks coming to my door, writing to me or phoning me to raise the failures that they have experienced. I have to say that such things are almost inevitable in a large organisation but in most cases that I deal with the NHS responds by trying to deal with any mistake that might have been made. On such occasions, I often think about how different it would be for the folks who require treatment if they lived in other places, whether on these islands or around the world. We in Scotland are extremely fortunate to have a publicly funded and delivered health service, and I am glad to hear colleagues say this afternoon that that is the right thing. Mr Carlaw and I often disagree but I think that the Tory party north of the border has shown a different way from the party south of the border. For example, with regard to privatisation in certain day-to-day contracts, Dr Jacky Davis of the keep our NHS public campaign south of the border said today: “This isn’t privatisation by the back door, it’s privatisation by the front door, and it is really putting patients’ lives at risk.” We are following a different path up here and I am proud that, in the main, we agree on most points. Of course, there will always be areas of disagreement, but such is life. The challenges of the future—whether they be the challenges of austerity, which have not really hit our NHS in Scotland as much as they could have because this Government has ring fenced the NHS budget, the challenge of the costs of new treatments as they come along or the major challenge posed by demographic change—need to be kept under constant review. That is why I am really pleased by the strides made by the Government in integrating health and social care. I realise that there is much work still to do in that respect but it is the right way forward. I am glad that we have had the reviews of workforce planning tools and bed-planning tools, as they are extremely important. Many members have talked about delivering the seven-day service, in relation to which there has been a £4 million investment to look at innovative approaches. That is the right approach. There is also, of course, the £50 million that has been put into the unscheduled care action plan. However, we still need to look at budgets in particular and see the shift happening a little quicker, perhaps, than it is at present in moving resource to primary care, as prevention is better than cure. We have seen a number of Government initiatives to ensure prevention. There has been investment in telemedicine, free prescriptions, free eye tests, free personal care—as a number of folk have mentioned—and initiatives such as family nurse partnerships, which I think are making great gains out there. Colleagues have mentioned the policy that was agreed to last week to ensure free school meals for primary 1, 2 and 3 pupils. Some folk may think that that has very little to do with health, but the chief executive of One Parent Families Scotland, Satwat Rehman, has said: “The benefits of free school lunches are particularly important to children from low income families but poor diet and obesity affects children from all backgrounds. Healthy free school lunches have been shown to help tackle health inequalities, as well as reducing the poverty trap faced by parents trying to move into employment.” Those prevention initiatives are the way forward. We have heard that the Labour Party wants a wholesale review of the health service, but that would be a wrong move. I agree with other members. I would much rather see resources being put into the front line than an expensive review that may very well come up with nothing. Finally, I cannot pay enough respect to the folks who work in our NHS in Scotland.

Will the member give way?

How much would it cost to mitigate additional welfare cuts if the Westminster Government extends the bedroom tax to include pensioners, as has been suggested by Julian Brazier MP? Beyond that, how much would it cost if his Government goes ahead with scrapping housing benefit for under-25s? Would not it be better to give this Parliament all the levers of power, so that all those inhumane policies could be scrapped?

7. To ask the Scottish Government what guidance it provides to ensure that children with additional support needs who are educated in mainstream schools receive appropriate support. (S4O-02753)

Is the minister convinced that all local authorities are applying getting it right for every child to ensure that the needs of children requiring additional support are met? Can exam course rules be made more flexible to take into account the needs of young people who may have communication difficulties?

Norway has accumulated a sovereign wealth fund of some £470 billion from its oil wealth. Meanwhile, the UK has built up over £1 trillion of debt and has squandered our oil wealth. Would it not be best if we controlled that wealth?

Will the member give way?

I acknowledge the contribution that Aberdeen and the north-east make to the Scottish economy. It is estimated that, last year, oil and gas production contributed around £22 billion to Scottish GDP, but it seems that some members think that oil and gas are a problem and a millstone round our neck. Decisions taken by Westminster Governments have been a millstone around the neck of the oil and gas industry. There have been 16 substantive changes to the tax regime in a decade, which has stopped development in some areas and caused underperformance in the North Sea basin. That is one of the reasons why we should have control over all of those elements of policy.

No, I have three and a half minutes. Let us turn to some of the things that were said yesterday and today about small business. Some 92,000 businesses in Scotland are benefiting from the small business bonus and providing jobs for many people throughout the country. However, the Labour Party has attacked the small business bonus over the past couple of days. This afternoon, on “Politics Scotland”, when Stewart Maxwell asked: “would you cut the small business bonus?” Patricia Ferguson replied: “We would certainly consider that”. Although she did not mention the small business bonus per se, last night on “Scotland Tonight” Kezia Dugdale suggested removing funding from support for small business but, today, Iain Gray denied that that was in the Labour Party’s plans. Those interventions by two front benchers rather call into question the standing and authority of the Labour finance spokesperson and Labour leader. They need to tell the public exactly what their plans are when it comes to small businesses. The Labour Party has form on the matter because, from 2001 to 2007, business rates in Scotland under the Labour Party were higher than they were in the rest of the UK, costing small businesses some £900 million over the period. Small businesses could have used that £900 million to invest in their businesses and expand them. Let us not let the Tories off the hook. Between 1979 and 1995, business rates were higher in Scotland than they were south of the border. Those are the reasons why we need all of the levers of power in the Scottish Parliament to ensure that our economy goes from strength to strength.

Will the member give way?

Will the member give way?

Thank you. I think that Gavin Brown will find, from looking at the Official Report, that I made that point in questioning Richard Baker rather than in my speech. On spending our oil wealth on vital public services, would it not be better to spend it on such services rather than on illegal wars and Trident nuclear weapons?

How would the local government settlement be affected in future years if there were, as suggested by the Holtham commission, which has the support of all three unionist parties, a £4 billion cut to Scotland’s budget?

Will the member give way on that point?

Mr Brown trumpets those things, but the UK Government’s welfare reforms risk putting a further 50,000 children in Scotland into poverty by 2020 and will take £2.5 billion away from Scottish households.

Will the member comment on that?

Will Neil Bibby give way?

5. To ask the Scottish Government how many times Police Scotland has found so-called legal highs cut with illegal substances but not seized them. (S4O-02671)

I have heard that so-called legal highs—perhaps I should call them psychoactive substances—are sometimes cut with illegal drugs, but there does not seem to be any recording of seizures of legal highs, as the minister explained. Is Police Scotland aware of that problem? What can be done to ensure that drug dealers cannot entrap people into becoming addicted to illegal drugs by using those nefarious and duplicitous means?

Will the member give way?

8. To ask the Scottish Government how many stop and searches Police Scotland has carried out. (S4O-02649)

Since the inception of Police Scotland, stop and searches have increased by 45 per cent in Aberdeen. Given the chief constable’s statement that there are no targets for stop and search, will the cabinet secretary give me an assurance that he will keep a close eye on the statistics in order to assure my constituents that the procedure is being used only when there is suspicion of crime or during special operations?

How many council houses did the Labour-Liberal Democrat Administrations build between 1999 and 2007? [Interruption.]

In today’s Aberdeen Evening Express, the comment section is headed “Take part in debate on future” and states: “The release of the Scottish Government’s White Paper on independence is a major step on the road that leads our nation to September 18 next year. This is the SNP setting out its stall on its vision of the future for Scotland if the people say yes in the referendum. No doubt it will set off a firestorm of debate—one that cannot be restricted to the political classes.” Thank God that it will not be restricted only to the political classes, given some of the nonsense that has been spoken here today—and some of the personalisation, which I think needs to be taken out of the debate. The article continues: “Everyone in the country needs to be involved. We must all look closely at what is being offered by both sides. We must not only listen to the debate, but also ask questions about what it means for each of us. Let’s make sure when we get to the ballot box we know what we are voting for and why.” I think that the white paper that was published yesterday will help folk to form a view in the debate. “Scotland’s Future: Your Guide to an Independent Scotland” is a comprehensive blueprint for the future of this country. Patrick Harvie is right: like him, I can hold the document in one hand, but I have nothing from the better together side in the other. I think that it is unlikely that we will ever see such a document; if we did, in my opinion, it would be an agenda for austerity, decline and decimation of the welfare state that we all know and love. I was quite appalled by some of the things that were said yesterday about some of the white paper’s proposals. Today, many folk have already talked about the ambitious, transformational change that can be made to childcare. As far as I am concerned, the childcare proposals in the white paper will benefit the nation and future generations. We have heard today from members of Opposition parties a claim that all of that could be done now under devolution, but no one from those parties—not one person—has said where the money could come from. In order to gain that transformational change, we need control of the taxation system, which currently lies with Westminster. I would have given some of our unionist opponents some credit today if they had stood up and said, “You know what? You’re absolutely right. We should negotiate with Westminster to try and ensure that any taxation raised through that policy comes back to Scotland to further fund it.” However, they have not got the gumption to put forward a proposal on that, never mind anything else. I think the reason for that is that they are all stuck in the Westminster rut. The reality is that our near neighbours do not fear such changes.

Calman was a joke as far as I am concerned. Let us look at what others have said about the proposals from Labour’s devolution commission. In response to the devolution commission’s report, John Downie, the director of public affairs at the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations said: “it looks as if Scottish Labour is only prepared to make a few tweaks around the edges of the system rather than the radical changes which are desperately needed to meet the aspirations of the Scottish people.”

Some folks here want to tinker at the edges and do not want to see transformational change. In my opinion, that is not good enough for Scotland. That is why I will vote yes today, and I urge people to vote yes next September.

Will Mr Smith take an intervention?

First, I would like to thank all those folks who took the time to write to me and let me know their views on the issue. An overwhelming majority of those of my constituents who have corresponded with me have said that I should vote in favour of the bill today. I would like to read part of an email that I received. It says: “As a gay teenager I cannot state strongly enough the impact that marriage equality would have on me personally, and the wider community. The majority of the political spectrum in Scotland stand by the principle of equality. I ask only that you adhere to it now.” That email made me think of my teenage years. I became a teenager the year after homosexuality was decriminalised in Scotland, I was a teenager at the time of section 28 and I was a teenager at the time when some horrendous things were said about HIV being a “gay plague”. Society seemed to me to be hostile towards gay people. At that point, I decided to play it straight, or at least to try to. I denied my sexual orientation throughout my teens and most of my 20s. I only told some of my close friends at the tail end of my 20s that I was gay. I did not tell my parents that until I was 39, which is something that I really regret and feel guilty about. I kind of slighted them, because their reaction was the same as it had always been in life—unequivocal love. I believe in traditional marriage. I think that it has served me well in terms of the parents that I have, the grandparents that I have, and had, and my brother and sister. It has served people so well that I believe it should be extended to all people. I think that that is only right. On religious tolerance, I have great respect for all views and I can understand why some folk have taken the stance that they have taken. However, Mr Mason talked about religious folk feeling marginalised. I think that we have to take account of folk who have felt marginalised for oh so many years, and actually get this right here today. [Applause.] I have absolutely no malice for those who intend to vote no or abstain today, but I urge them to think of their children and grandchildren, who may well turn out to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. We should give them the right to share the happiness and love and the trials and tribulations of marriage. I urge members, please, to support the bill today.

Will the member give way?

Mr Macdonald is wrong on some aspects. On polling day at the Aberdeen Donside by-election, an emergency proxy vote was given at 3 o’clock in the afternoon to a lady who was receiving chemotherapy. His take on what happens at the moment is slightly wrong.

On 26 November, we will have the white paper, which will set out the SNP Government’s vision for independence. Mr Macdonald talked about the new phase for devolution. Will the Labour Party and other unionist parties put their vision for the new phase of the union to the people before the referendum?

Will Mr Pearson give way?

Local policing is being protected by the Scottish Government. The significant impact of changes to links between communities and their police service can be seen south of the border rather than here, where I think we are doing very well. South of the border, some 4,516 officers disappeared between March 2012 and March 2013. It was the fourth consecutive year of cuts, and 14,186 officers, or 10 per cent of the police, have disappeared south of the border since 2009. A total of 1,300 stations have closed in England. In The Sunday Telegraph on 18 March 2012, Jill Grieve of the Countryside Alliance said that this is the “death knell for the bobby on the beat.” That is happening because of Con-Dem policies south of the border. I believe that we are getting things right here. I am not saying that everything in the garden is rosy, but the reality is that we have to deal with the austerity cuts that have been passed on by Westminster. I believe that the cabinet secretary and the chief constable are taking the right decisions in ensuring that bobbies are on the beat, which gives the public confidence and has resulted in a 39-year low in crime. Having been an elected member in Aberdeen City Council and here for some 14 years, and having served on a police board for 13 years, I have to say that complaints about the police are at an all-time low in my mailbag, too. That is something for which congratulations are due. I find it bizarre that, as Christine Grahame mentioned, Mr Pearson said on 31 October: “I indicated that the business case might well justify some offices closing or amending their hours. My position is not that there should be no closures”.—[Official Report, Justice Sub-Committee on Policing, 31 October 2013; c 259.] Yet today, we see something different in the motion. I think that Labour is grandstanding and trying to grab headlines, rather than dealing with the realities that we have to face.

No. I do not have time.

At that meeting of the Justice Sub-Committee on Policing, the chief constable read out extracts from an email from a member of staff who was on counter duties, who decided to take voluntary severance. That person said: “I did not take this course of action lightly but having experienced a vast reduction in workload over the years, it seemed to me only a matter of time before this happened. We have also been constantly warned for the past three years that this may happen ... The workload has been affected for a variety of reasons, the first being the advent of the Force Contact Centre taking away a huge percentage of phone calls to the front office”. These are the realities of the world that we live in. People are phoning, emailing and tweeting. People are using modern communication methods to get in touch with the police.

The other thing is that they want bobbies on the beat, not the nonsense that we are getting south of the border. The motion is just grandstanding.

Will the cabinet secretary consider what further support could be made available to diversify employment at Grangemouth in order to ensure that it benefits from low-carbon technology?

I apologise to members as I have to leave early to attend other parliamentary business at 5.30. Colleagues can be assured that I will look at all the speeches in the Official Report. I congratulate Alison Johnstone on bringing the debate to Parliament. Her motion states that the Parliament “would welcome further debate on this proposal.” I too would like to see further debate on the issue. Last night, I arrived in Edinburgh at about 9 o’clock and, as we all know, it gets a little bit dark then—it is that time of year. Tiredness got the better of me and I took a taxi from Waverley station to the Canonmills area. On that short journey, I spotted two cyclists on the road without lights, and three pedestrians crossed the road in front of the cab in what I thought was a rather dangerous manner. I am not a driver but I am often a passenger, and such behaviour seems to be becoming the norm. The other side of the coin, of course, is that I often see drivers acting dangerously in relation to pedestrians and cyclists. I truly believe that common courtesy and common sense need to be put into practice by all who use our highways and pavements. Whether they are pedestrians, cyclists or drivers, people should always be aware of others and treat them with respect. The debate is around the civil law, yet every single constituent who contacted me today about the debate has brought up a criminal matter. In particular, people raised the tragic death of Audrey Fyfe and the related court case. Many of my constituents believe that the perpetrator got off far too lightly and that the sentence was far too lenient. I share my constituents’ views: at the end of the day, if somebody killed two folk with a shotgun, they would be unlikely ever to get a shotgun licence again, so why would a driver who had killed somebody get a driving licence again? The problem is that most of the difficulties lie with the criminal law and, unfortunately, the Parliament does not control all aspects of road traffic legislation.

I thank Mr Harvie for that contribution. I hope that there can be a positive change and that we see from everyone the common sense and courtesy that I mentioned. However, a lot of the heat around the debate comes not from the civil law but from the criminal aspects of the issue. I have had mail from quite a few constituents in which the Fyfe case featured very highly indeed. I do not think that we can divorce the civil aspects from the criminal aspects. That is why I say that this Parliament should have all the powers over road traffic legislation. I thank Alison Johnstone once again for bringing the matter to Parliament. In my opinion, this is the start of a debate about not only the civil aspects but the criminal aspects.

8. To ask the Scottish Government what recent discussions it has had with Aberdeen City Council regarding economic development. (S4O-02479)

When the leader of Aberdeen City Council appeared in front of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee today, he talked about Aberdeen’s vibrant economy and about various funding streams, but he made no mention of tax increment financing, which would of course lead to greater economic growth. Has there been any application from Aberdeen City Council for TIF funding since its decision to abandon the city garden project scheme?

I welcome the interim report from Sir Ian Wood’s commission and I am glad that we have the opportunity to debate it today. On “Good Morning Scotland” on 5 October, when asked about the impact of Tory plans to remove benefits from under-25s, Jim Sweeney of YouthLink Scotland said: “young people are individuals and each individual has a story to tell. Each individual, in a sense, needs some help and support that is critical to them in their situation rather than blanket coverage and blanket bans. It creates a very negative image of young people. I think that that is what really annoys, certainly, folk that work with young people on a day-to-day basis ... We spend our lives working with young people and we are absolutely astounded at their resilience in general terms, given what the world throws at them. We feel that there should be a much more positive message about our young people. They are an asset to the country, not a liability.” I agree whole-heartedly that young people are an asset to us. As the minister did at the beginning of the debate, I too want to relate a story from my time at school. I always remember a maths teacher saying about one individual pupil—let us call him John—that he was absolutely useless at maths and should spend all his time in the technical department. The guy was particularly good at designing and making things of value. What the teacher forgot was that the guy used maths skills to design those items and used maths to create the things that he made. It is a difficulty that I think we still have, that many people do not see the strength and the opportunity in others. The minister stated that she wants to see opportunity gaps eradicated. I want to see opportunities seized and strengthened in every area in school, college, university and at home—which is also extremely important. As many colleagues do, I think that bringing employers closer to the workplace is absolutely vital. We have good examples from across the country, but we need to ensure that best practice is carried out everywhere. Sir Ian Wood’s report has 11 pages of good practice, but I wonder how much of it is being looked at in depth by people in other areas, and whether others are following suit. All too often, we do not talk about the good things that are going on and we do not ensure that they are exported throughout the country. In some regards, a dose of common sense is required. Members have heard me talk time and again about gumption; if gumption is brought into play, that will make it much easier to achieve our goals. Clare Adamson talked about bringing women into science. As Dennis Robertson said, engineering and technology sometimes do not have the right image. However, in recent times I have been greatly encouraged by the number of women who are being brought into life sciences. Science is a broad, broad spectrum; technology is a broad, broad spectrum; and engineering is a broad, broad spectrum, so we should be telling people much more about the opportunities.

I am sorry, but I do not have time. As Dennis Robertson said, we sometimes stereotype careers. We have to go beyond that stereotyping and tell folk what the actual opportunities are. One thing that I am a little disappointed about is that the report does not deal with work for people with disabilities—in particular folks with learning disabilities—although I am sure that the issue will feature in the follow-up work. The minister has taken a great interest in the work of organisations such as Values Into Action Scotland, whose young Scotland’s got talent programme has helped many people into work. Much more can be done on that front. The report says that we have to show employers that they need to take an active part in the work and that they should not just passively look on. In relation to the learning disability aspect, we must show employers that they have a lot to gain from employing people with special needs.

3. To ask the Scottish Government what support it provides to universities to attract students from overseas. (S4O-02434)

In a letter that I received from the principal of the University of Aberdeen earlier this year, I was told that, since the removal of the post-study work scheme, the university has seen a drop in entrants from India of 60 per cent and from Nigeria of 22 per cent. What can be done to counter the damage that United Kingdom immigration policies and the UK Border Agency are doing to our capacity to attract overseas students to our universities?

I, too, thank Richard Baker for bringing this issue to the chamber. Like others, I have talked before about my friends and family who work offshore. When people from Aberdeen are away from home and hear news of an accident in the industry, people around them are often surprised that their immediate reaction is to head for the nearest phone to ensure that their loved ones are safe. As Dennis Robertson says, it is no consolation to hear that other people have lost loved ones through a tragic accident. No matter what conclusion we come to at the end of this debate, every member here has played a large role in ensuring that health and safety in the North Sea is as good as it can be. That is particularly true of the members of the cross-party group on oil and gas, who have considered the issues carefully during my time in the Parliament. We have heard from Step Change in Safety, union representatives and the industry about how improvements could be made. Today, we have heard a little bit about all the inquiries that are under way, about the CAA investigation, with support from the European Aviation Safety Agency and input from Norwegian partners. We have heard about the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the operators’ review, and there has been an appeal today for the FAI process to be speeded up. Tavish Scott called for a public inquiry, which is not in the jurisdiction of this Parliament or Government. I have a concern about a clutter of inquiries because there are only so many experts who can look at what the failings may actually have been, but is a quick FAI the answer? I have been looking at this situation and at what is said about FAIs. The documentation from the Government and the courts states: “The purpose of an FAI is to determine: •Where and when the death took place. •The cause of the death. •Reasonable precautions whereby the death might have been avoided. •The defects, if any, in any system of working which contributed to the death or any accident resulting in the death. •Any other relevant facts relevant to the circumstances of the death.” In some respects, a fatal accident inquiry would be in the dark about some of these points because we have not yet concluded what the failings have been. I have also had a good look at the Cullen review of fatal accident inquiry legislation, which was produced in 2009. I have not gone through the entire document, because it is rather large, but there are some interesting points there. From my perspective, and in this I agree with Alex Johnstone, we need to see the improved safety standards without a doubt but, to use the words of Lewis Macdonald, who called for “early and effective” FAIs, I do not think that an early FAI would necessarily be an effective one. This is something on which I intend to dwell as we go forward.

One of the things that concerns me about all of this is that, in considering 141 sexual offence cases that were dropped between July and December 2010, the Carloway review itself found that 95—or two thirds—of them would have had a reasonable prospect of conviction without the requirement for corroboration. What really bothers me is the situation with sexual offences and the fact that so many cases do not go to trial.

We have heard about the Daniel Pelka case. The deputy leader of the Conservative group on Coventry City Council said: “Now is the time to have a radical look at the legal framework surrounding Child Protection”. I agree. Over the years, we have had cross-party support for GIRFEC, which I hope will continue. In relation to the Conservative motion, I say that I certainly would not support anything that “would undermine the role of parents”. The named person system can help parents in many regards. Mr Macintosh might well have the ability to approach health visitors, teachers and all the rest of it, but he is a particularly articulate man who knows the ropes. Not everybody knows the ropes, so what is the difficulty in providing each family with a named person who they may or may not use to get the information and help that they need? The Conservatives have used some pejorative language, which does not surprise me. They always talk about the nanny state and proposals being too expensive. Martin Crewe of Barnardo’s Scotland said that those points would come up and that “Neither of these criticisms is justified. Depending on the age of the child, a health visitor or teacher will usually take on the role, and in most cases will do no more than they do now.” Rather than have the pejorative language and some of the silly things that have come up, we should unite again around the GIRFEC principles. We should let the Education and Culture Committee do its job and hear the evidence. We should come back here at a later date and forget the pejorative nonsense that has gone on today.

The motion talks about “the underlying strength of the Scottish economy”. I will concentrate my speech on that underlying strength. Beyond that, I will talk about my experiences over the past few weeks of talking to businesses in the Parliament and in my constituency. In a debate in the chamber last week, I mentioned the success of the offshore Europe conference, which involved some 60,000 delegates from across the world, 1,500 stands and many home-grown Scottish companies that are doing exceptionally well. We all know about the multinationals but, sometimes, many folk in here and elsewhere do not pay due attention to the work that is done by the many small companies in that sector. However, I am pleased to say that the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism takes cognisance of that. He spent quite some time at the offshore Europe conference, where he went down very well with the folk that I spoke to. The oil and gas sector is thriving, but things could have been so different if the Conservatives had not U-turned on the silly tax measures that they introduced a couple of years ago. Although we are seeing record levels of investment in the North Sea basin, I think that we could have had even more. During the silly period, many companies took their money and invested it elsewhere, particularly in west Africa. Over the past couple of weeks, many food and drink companies have visited the Parliament and have talked about Scotland the brand and how well they are doing. We also recently celebrated 100 years of the Rowett institute, which is a great Aberdeen institution—its first director won a Nobel prize, no less—that has been at the forefront of life sciences over that time. In the remainder of my speech, I will concentrate on the life sciences. Last week, along with other colleagues, I had the pleasure of attending a Scottish Enterprise seminar at NCIMB in Aberdeen. When I went in and saw a badge that said, “We love bugs”, I did not think that I could ever say that. However, I came out of the seminar thinking, “I love bugs; I love the life sciences industry; and I love what is going on here in Aberdeen and the north-east of Scotland.”

No, it does not include spiders.

Sorry, Presiding Officer. In the main, NCIMB deals with bacteria. As the Scottish Government’s “Life Sciences Key Sector Report” of November 2009 pointed out, with Scotland’s competitive advantages in areas such as medical devices, pharmaceutical services, stem cells and translational medicine, we need to be focused on growing the company base in life sciences. The current situation is that our commercial life sciences companies have an annual turnover of £3 billion. Between 1998 and 2010, the sector has experienced 4.3 per cent compound annual growth and employee growth of some 18 per cent. In the north-east, institutes such as the University of Aberdeen, the Rowett research institute, the James Hutton Institute and Marine Scotland are heavily involved in life sciences. We have seen spin-off companies from the universities. The companies involved—such as TauRx, NovaBiotics, NCIMB, GT Biologics, Sirakoss and Ossianix—are doing a great service to our economy in the north-east.

I agree completely and utterly with Mr Robertson that life sciences is a global industry and that the north-east and other parts of Scotland are seen as leaders in the field. Long may that continue. At the Scottish Enterprise seminar, we heard talk of the biologics revolution, which I think is extremely interesting. We also heard about research using DNA from sharks that aims to make big inroads. Without a doubt, the industries that I have mentioned are the underlying strength of the Scottish economy. However, I think that the Scottish economy could be so much better. In order to achieve that, we need all the levers of power in this place, so that we can continue to grow those industries and the many others that do so well in our country.

The cabinet secretary pointed out that Westminster is imposing a cut of more than 18 per cent on local government south of the border. I welcome the fact that the Scottish Government recognises the need to protect local services. Will he expand on how local government spending is being protected in the budget, including through additional funding for early years provision?

I had the great pleasure of spending a large part of last week at the offshore Europe conference at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre, which hosted well over 50,000 delegates and 1,500 stands, with not only multinational companies but small companies, some of which were just starting out. I know that the minister spent quite a lot of time there—I know that because I saw him. During the two days that I managed to attend, many folk said that they had had the opportunity to speak directly to him. That was very much appreciated. Obviously, there are the big players in the offshore energy market, but there are also the small companies that I referred to. Some companies are moving away from their former traditional markets to enter the oil and gas field. One question that I always ask when I visit companies is what their relationship is with Scottish Enterprise, whether they have an account manager and what their relationship is with the local council’s economic development team. When I did the same thing a number of years ago as a councillor, the reports back about Scottish Enterprise were normally unfavourable. That has changed dramatically. While there is always room for improvement, the system that we have now is much better than the previous system. I will make one plea about some of the small companies from outwith the north-east of Scotland that are trying to break into oil and gas. By doing so, I am showing that I am not completely and utterly parochial. Sometimes, account managers from elsewhere in the country do not have the oil and gas experience of those who are based in the north-east of Scotland. I would like to see better flexibility and use of resource. It would be a great boon to account managers if they were to get back-up—and an even greater boon to the companies that are trying to break out of their traditional markets and into oil and gas. I am also enthused by the fact that the VisitScotland expo is coming to Aberdeen in April 2015. It will showcase the best of Scottish tourism and will involve tour operators and travel operators from around 40 countries—from as far afield as India, Russia and the middle east as well as North America and Europe. Such events are often times when Scottish Enterprise comes to the fore. It may be a tourism event that is designed to boost Scottish tourism and Aberdeen as a tourist destination but, beyond that, I am sure that many folk who are there will want to do business in this country. I have listened carefully to what others have said and I think that, sometimes, no matter what side of the constitutional argument they are on, people in this place can sometimes downplay how well we are doing. There was an article on foreign investment in The Economist on 31 August, entitled, “Catching the Scots—why England trails the Celtic fringe”. It is well worth a read. Speaking about the situation south of the border, the article states: “Ernst & Young blames government policy. In 2010 the coalition announced that England’s nine regional development agencies would be replaced by 39 local enterprise partnerships (LEPs), voluntary consortiums of local councils and businesses. This was done two years later. It seems to have made things worse.” It also states: “In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved administrations run economic development, the agencies are undisturbed.” It continues: “Scotland is simply better at co-ordinating different arms of local and central government to deliver what inward investors want—roads for new factories, planning permissions, training packages for workforces and the like. A Scottish government minister cracks the whip at any laggards.” I do not know whether that last sentence is true, but I hope that the minister will confirm it when he sums up the debate.

I am in my last minute—I am sorry. The article concludes: “Edward Twiddy, chief executive of the North East LEP, covering Tyneside and Durham, enviously admires his northern counterparts ... But his Celtic competitors are well ahead, and they show no sign of slowing down.” I think that we could power ahead even further in that regard if we had the full levers of power of a normal, independent Parliament. I am quite sure that, if the minister had that power, we would be doing even better than we currently are.

The article in The Economist clearly showed that people in the north-east of England are a little bit jealous of what goes on here. I think that, after independence, they will refocus their attention from London to north of the border and that, after independence, we should help them to boost their economy.

I, too, pass on my condolences to the families and friends of those who were lost. Like the vast bulk of folk in the north-east of Scotland, I have family and friends who are regular helicopter passengers. Obviously, the situation is concerning. What support can the Scottish Government give to an industry review on helicopter safety?

What will happen to traffic to the airport if Mr Baker’s request for immediate action is granted? If the Haudagain is redone, we will have chaos on the roads of Aberdeen.

Will the member give way?

I have talked a lot in the Parliament recently about common sense—“gumption” is the word that we use in the north-east. Today, we see mair gimmick than gumption in the motion that the Labour Party has lodged. We should not be surprised, because on transport policy Labour never seems to listen to the experts—the roads engineers, who know how things work. I would bet members a pound to a penny that Mr Baker has come to the chamber without looking at any of the modelling work that has been done on traffic in the great city of Aberdeen. Today we heard Labour backtracking on its opposition over many years to a third Don crossing. When Willie Young was asked about the issue some time ago by the Evening Express, he said: “We have been made aware by our officials that the Haudagain roundabout and Third Don Crossing comes as a package at the moment. That may be the situation and we may have to go along with that.” However, there has always been talk of daft alternatives, including from the current depute leader of the Labour-led Aberdeen City Council. She wants tunnels everywhere. How much will tunnels cost and how long will it take to get them into action? Does she know about the geology of the great city in which I live? I think not. Again, it is gimmick, not gumption. That is what we have had all along. The debate is a knockabout one in some regards, and I am sad to see that everybody has put in their wee bit about the by-election. Were Brian Adam here, he would not be happy about some of the things that have been said. Let us put all the knockabout to one side and look at the realities. My main concern is the realities that people face. At the end of the day, the Labour Party wants immediate action, but what will it do with the 200 households in Middlefield that will need to be rehoused? What will it do about the traffic disruption that will ensue should that immediate action take place? The traffic disruption would be massive. Lewis Macdonald sits there and sneers. Apparently, he said on the radio this morning that building work at the Haudagain would cause no traffic disruption. I had a phone call from a constituent not so long ago who asked me to tell Mr Macdonald that that was chronic stupidity. I agree. What about the vital services in Middlefield, such as the Middlefield Community Project and the Middlefield healthy hoose? What will happen to those services if immediate action is taken? The Labour motion is nonsense. It would see traffic disruption galore, the decimation of the north-east economy and the destruction of people’s lives. I urge everyone in the chamber to look carefully at how they vote today.

It is good that we are now seeing some progress on the holy trinity of the third Don crossing, the Haudagain and the AWPR, and I am glad to say that roads engineers are finally being listened to, which is logical.

Does the member think that we should put the experts’ opinion first when we take such decisions?

When the matter was discussed by the council in 2008, Councillor Neil Cooney, who is a Labour councillor, described option 5—the route through Middlefield—as the Middlefield clearances, yet last week, Councillor Cooney, who is now also the chair of housing and environment in the city, watered down the proposals that were meant to ensure that moneys were ring fenced to regenerate Middlefield and to ensure that people were properly rehoused. What does the minister think of the hypocrisy of Councillor Cooney and is that the same hypocritical stance that we see from Mr Baker?

1. To ask the Scottish Government what recent discussions it has had with Aberdeen City Council about cultural issues. (S4O-02105)

Our libraries are great cultural assets. Aberdeen faces the threat of library closures emanating from the Labour-led council, even though in The Press and Journal on 8 January 2010, the current Labour candidate for Aberdeen Donside said: “We welcome the move not to close any libraries as knowledge is key to any city’s success.” Does the cabinet secretary agree that libraries are a key to success? Will she join me in calling on Aberdeen City Council to lift the threat of closure as soon as possible?

I hope to find common ground, too. With regard to the wrong-headed austerity measures that are being implemented by the Conservative-Liberal coalition at Westminster, does Mr Macintosh think—as I do—that it would be better if we had all the levers of power in order to come up with different policies that would help our young people and others in our population back to work?

I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate. These issues are some of the most paramount problems with which we have to contend. I know that the minister shares my passion for this subject, because—although I do not want to give away a lady’s age—like me, she grew up in the Thatcher years and watched as devastation happened in many parts of the country. At that time, youth unemployment rates were very high indeed in many areas, including in the north-east. Some of the initiatives that came about—and which, it could be said, were frowned on by central Government at that time—still thrive in the north-east today. As my colleagues Mark McDonald and Stewart Stevenson have said, in the north-east we are in a slightly different position from many other parts of the country in terms of youth employment. However, Mr Stevenson and Mr McDonald rightly pointed out that there are still difficulties in areas of social deprivation and for folks with special needs. We need to counter some of the difficulties that still exist. Recent research for north-east business week 2013 that was conducted by the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, the FSB, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and Enterprise North East Trust, said that 71 per cent of businesses were going to expand and grow within the next three years. We need to be able to match the skills to the growth that is going to take place.

I did not know that. I have not read all of today’s news, but I am grateful to Stewart Stevenson for that. It shows again that the economy of the north-east is growing. Businesses in the north-east have looked very carefully at how they are going to staff up in these years of expansion. The survey that I mentioned says that, in the north-east, on average 8 per cent of operating budgets are being spent on learning development. That is a healthy sign, although in some areas businesses could probably spend a little more. Beyond that, I know that those companies are very grateful for the support that the Government is providing. At the outset of her speech, the minister said that we must have “the right talent for ... immediate and future needs.” I could not agree more. Many initiatives in my neck of the woods and elsewhere are trying to ensure that we do have the right talent. In my constituency, ITCA training, which I communicated recently with the minister about, is one of the organisations that are making sure that the right talent is in place. We have also heard from Mark McDonald about the energy leadership group and the Prince’s Trust, which are doing the same. I am very pleased that the Government has a commitment to the energy skills academy, which will also ensure that that right talent is in place. At this moment, in the city of Aberdeen there are four applicants for every 10 jobs. Aberdeen is the best place in the whole of these islands in which to get a job at the moment. We must also be able to allow young folk the flexibility to move to those jobs. That is not a case of Norman Tebbit’s “Get on your bike”, which was nonsense. We must create opportunities for people to go and study and take up work in areas where there are those jobs.

In the great city of Aberdeen, the main problem with buses is not services being cut but services being changed and very high bus fares being charged by a company, First, which was born in Aberdeen and seems now to use our city as a cash cow. I would be quite happy to campaign with Ms Marra in Aberdeen to try to get First to change its current charging policies and other ludicrous ideas that it has come up with.

Not at the moment. Let me finish please, Mr Gray. Frankly, First is doing a disservice not only to the young people of Aberdeen but to all Aberdonians. It would increase patronage if it listened to some the campaigners who are calling for that decrease in bus fares. While I am on my feet, I have to say that it is not as if First is not making huge profits out of Aberdeen and elsewhere. I will move on. We have to have the right business case for investing in young people. There should be public-private partnerships to ensure that we provide the right flexible training to allow folk to get the jobs that are out there so that they succeed in the industries of today and tomorrow. I am convinced that we are helping in all the ways that we can from this place. However, I wish that we had all the levers of power. With that power we could change the tax and benefit system to ensure that we could do even better.

I was willing.

I, too, welcome the debate, and Gavin Brown is to be congratulated on bringing it forward. The Local Government and Regeneration Committee is in the third strand of its inquiry into public service reform. As we have gone around the country, we have found a level of uncertainty in the third sector and community-based organisations in certain geographical areas. As a councillor in my past life, I found that annual grants to organisations did not necessarily deliver the goods on the ground and that what was required was certainty about funding for the third sector organisation that was fulfilling a contract and certainty for the council that that was being done. It benefits all to move, when possible, to three-year funding. It offers the people who receive the services that are being delivered a sense of security. I hope that changes that are made through the proposed community empowerment and renewal bill will mean that the various bodies in community planning partnerships go to meetings before they take budgetary decisions and discuss future budgetary decisions, which I hope will lead to more joined-up thinking and more common sense, so that we will see much more joint procurement of services over three years. We are in exciting times in that regard. I wish that we did not have to deal with the cuts that are taking place, but where we are means that we can be a bit more flexible than previously. We can come up with much more radical thinking about the delivery of services across the board. There are always plenty of warm words for the third sector, but in many places the sector’s work is still not appreciated as much as it should be. I might get a slap on the fingers from colleagues in local government for saying this, but my experience tells me that the third sector does better in many areas of service delivery than councils and the health service do. I hope that we will get to a point at which folks can take their hands off the purse strings and trust others—whether we are talking about the third sector or community organisations—to deliver services. We are getting to the point at which we will realise that hope of mine. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the issue and I hope that folk out there are listening to what has been said and are aware of the level of consensus that there has been in the debate so far. I hope that budget controllers will give a little leeway in the future.

I, too, congratulate George Adam on his motion and on securing the debate. The first reception I attended at the Parliament was an MS Society event at Our Dynamic Earth, not long after our first meeting of the session. We had the opportunity to talk to a number of MS sufferers that night, and I probably learned more about MS than I had previously known, even though I know families with an MS sufferer and had visited the Stuart resource centre in Aberdeen, in my former council ward, on previous occasions. I was struck by the bravery of a number of the folk present that night. I went to the Stuart resource centre again to talk to folk there and to see an exercise session in practice, which was a bit of an eye opener. Great as the service provision that we have in Aberdeen may be, what I and others fear most is the welfare reform agenda. On 5 February this year, the Parliament’s Welfare Reform Committee listened to Marlene Hepburn, an MS sufferer from Stirling. She was originally from the north-east of Scotland, but teaching jobs took her elsewhere. She worked as long as she could and was quite blunt about the difficulties that she faced. However, I think that the most galling thing for Miss Hepburn was not the disease itself but her recent work capability assessment. Vulnerable people may be denied lifelines if various benefits are withdrawn from them. Nanette Milne talked about constant assessment, which is fair in relation to ensuring that people get the best possible treatment. However, one constant assessment that I cannot agree with is the constant work capability assessment that folk with MS and other debilitating diseases will face under the current regime. The UK Government needs to get this absolutely right. It needs to rethink Lord Freud’s refusal to designate vulnerable groups and take certain folk out of work capability assessment. I agree with Nanette Milne about constant medical assessment, but we do not want constant work capability assessments. We must ensure that folk who want to grab life, as George Adam described it, and have their independence can have it for as long as possible. That is why it is so important that we ensure that the welfare changes do not affect people’s independence. Some of the evidence that the Welfare Reform Committee has heard at the have your say evidence sessions has been quite shocking. Folk should look back and see what Marlene Hepburn and others have said about what is going on.

Will Mr Rennie give way? I will give him an idea.

To cut out the bureaucracy and the amount of money that is going to Atos to carry out work capability assessments, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions or Lord Freud could designate vulnerable people who should not have to go through constant assessments. That would be one way of saving Mr Rennie’s Government some money and saving some of those folk from going through constant pain.

Margaret Lynch of Citizens Advice Scotland has called the reforms “the perfect storm”, and at today’s meeting of Welfare Reform Committee in Glasgow, Robin Tennant of the Poverty Alliance called them a “tsunami”. Natural disasters have been used to describe what is going on, but what we are facing is not natural but very much a man-made disaster that has been created by the Tory-Liberal coalition at Westminster. Mary Scanlon has talked about the impact of the reforms on people with mental health problems; over the years, she has done a great deal to try to make life better for folk who suffer from mental health conditions. What I am seeing at my surgeries—I know that many other members see the same—is that the folk who are affected most by the reforms are those who have mental health conditions. People who have severe depression or who are bipolar are often put through the work capability assessment and given zero points, which means that they are considered to be fit for work. They then have to go through the appeals process, after which they get the maximum number of points and are deemed to be not fit for work. During that period, their mental health conditions worsen because of the nonsense of that system. After today and after the many hearings that the committee has held, I feel angry and uneasy but impotent about dealing with some of the things that we face. Today, we heard from a number of people including Agnes Allan—who has already been mentioned—whose daughter Sarah Jane has cerebral palsy and a number of other conditions. The family believed that they had DLA for life for Sarah Jane—that was their safety net—but they are now worried that, if it is withdrawn, she will suffer a loss of independence. I can well understand why they are so worried about that situation. According to the Sheffield Hallam University report, 55,000 folk in Scotland will be affected by the changes and are likely to lose on average £3,000 a year. Many of those folk work and use their DLA to transport them to work, which gives them their independence. Without DLA, it might not be possible for them to do that. What I cannot understand about the situation in which we find ourselves is that, on numerous occasions in response to letters from me, Lord Freud has refused to designate certain vulnerable groups and to take them out of the process. We all know that there are folk out there who are never going to work—Mark McDonald gave some examples. Why must those people thole the assessment process again and again? It is cruel, it is heartless and it is nonsense. Today, we also heard from Lynda Hutchison—for the folk from the official report, that it is Lynda with a Y; she was most insistent about that—from the Glasgow stronger together group, for people with learning difficulties. I have also talked to the Aberdeen stronger together group. Those folk have told me about their independence and what they really need from life. People are scared about what is happening. They have talked about the effect of the reforms not only on themselves, but—in Aberdeen, in particular—on others. They show compassion towards other people, but we have a Government at Westminster that shows compassion to no one. The stronger together groups in Aberdeen and Glasgow have more gumption about what is going on than most of the Government ministers whom we have met to discuss the issue. They are too feart to come before the committee formally and would be far too feart to meet some of the individuals whom we have met to discuss their lives and the changes to their lives that will happen because of the reforms. I challenge Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Freud to listen to the evidence that we have gathered thus far and to have the guts to appear in front of our committee so that we can relate to them what we have heard on numerous occasions about the effects of the welfare changes on people’s lives.

Sometimes we talk far too much about statistics. I wish that Mr Duncan Smith and Lord Freud would go face to face with the people involved and hear how their lives are being affected.

Will Mrs Scanlon give way?

Will the member give way?

Will the member give way?

I agree that there should be encouragement, but currently, the European Union legislation and a test case—Dirk Rüffert v Land Niedersachsen—show that we cannot put the living wage into contracts and specify that it must be paid. Would not it be best if we were at the top table in Europe, in trying try to change that legislation?

I thank the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee for giving us this opportunity to debate this important issue today. For many, this issue is not particularly sexy, but I am an anorak when it comes to procurement, and the submissions that we have received show that there are many other folk who take a keen interest in what we are about to embark on with regard to the public procurement bill. As I said, I am an anorak. Where do I begin? In my previous life as a councillor, I was often told that we could not do certain things because of EU procurement rules. That got to me so much that I decided that I would go on some training to see whether those barriers really existed, and I had the council’s procurement system—PECOS—installed on the computer in my office, so that I could track what was going on. I know that that is beyond anorakishness, but I think that it was important, because I found that a lot of the barriers that were said to be there were not there at all. I discovered that the reason why some folk took the view that they did was down to custom and practice and an aversion to risk. We need to challenge some of the custom and practice that exists around procurement. Beyond that, we must ensure that folk know what best value and value for money are. Giving evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee on 27 March this year, James Thomson of Scott-Moncrieff said: “On best value principles, there has been confusion in some of the responses from others. It is not about just going for the lowest-cost option; it is about having regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and delivering continuous improvement and sustainable services.”—[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 27 March 2013; c 1971.] I agree with his definition. Page 3 of the Scottish Government’s “Community Benefits in Public Procurement Guidance Note” says: “The priority for all public procurement is to achieve Value for Money … Value for money does not, however, mean ‘lowest price’. It is defined in the Scottish Public Finance Manual as ‘the optimum combination of whole life cost and quality to meet the end user’s requirement’.” The mention of “whole life cost” and “the end user’s requirement” makes me think of the story about grandma’s 50-year-old broom. It has done a huge amount of work over its 50-year life and it has had only nine new handles and 11 new brushes. Those are the kind of things that we must think of when we make major decisions on procurement. The proposed bill will not be a panacea, as Linda Fabiani and Tavish Scott said. We must deal with the situation in the bill and other forthcoming bills in which procurement will play a major role, such as the community empowerment and renewal bill and the health and social care integration bill. Procurement will be at the forefront of those bills, and we need to consider carefully what we do in that regard. A huge number of the difficulties that we have are the result of a lack of common sense—a severe lack of common sense in some cases. The Local Government and Regeneration Committee visited Ayr on Monday to hear the views of folks from Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway. A huge number of community representatives gave their views in the community engagement session and, beyond that, we had folk giving formal evidence at a meeting in the afternoon. However, some of the best conversations are always had during the breaks and at lunch time. In those communities and throughout the country, a huge number of community organisations are doing everything possible to better the lives of the folks they live alongside. However, bureaucracies that local authorities, health boards and others have put in place are impeding the small-scale procurement that those organisations are doing. I will give an example, although I have only one minute left in which to give it. A guy talked about his community group wanting a new wheelbarrow. They had to go around the houses to buy a new wheelbarrow. They had to get three written quotations and give them to the council for the council to decide which wheelbarrow the group could get. However, this guy had the gumption—the common sense—to realise what the wheelbarrow requirement was and where he could get it for the lowest cost. That kind of nonsense must be dealt with. Although I welcome the bill, it will not be a panacea. I call for a degree of gumption.

The member has barely recognised that a huge amount of the manufacturing base of this country has been destroyed by Westminster Governments over decades. It is now beyond the capacity of firms in this country to produce the amount of steel—or the right steel—for the job that she talks about. That is a great shame, but she supports the union and the Governments that have led to the decline in those industries.

I talked previously about the difficulties around custom and practice. Does Mr Johnstone think that some of the gold plating that goes on is a result of previous custom and practice around the daft compulsory competitive tendering rules that we used to have to follow?

4. To ask the First Minister what recent analysis the Scottish Government has carried out of the impact of the United Kingdom Government’s welfare reforms on the people of Scotland. (S4F-01288)

By the UK Government’s own admission, these changes will dramatically increase the number of people in poverty. It is one thing for Governments to fail in tackling poverty, but it is quite another for them to create it intentionally. Many of the changes hit those who are working hardest, shattering the claims that they are being made in the name of making work pay.

Yes. Given that 80 per cent of Scottish MPs voted against welfare reform and that 90 per cent voted against the bedroom tax, how would the First Minister suggest the people of Scotland democratically resist those changes?

Like colleagues, I take my hat off to Mark McDonald for his work during the passage of the bill. However, in all fairness, even he would recognise that his staff have played a great part, too, and they deserve recognition. I thank all the witnesses who gave evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, of whom there were many, including campaigners, organisations that are involved in biodiversity and many others. I also thank my clerking colleagues for their efforts during the passage of the bill. To begin with, I was a little hesitant about adding deciduous hedges to the bill’s scope. However, the minister’s clear statement that sceptics such as RSPB Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust will contribute to the guidance on the bill is helpful. For those who are slightly reticent, we also have the review period. That has been put in place to look at perhaps extending the bill later, but it might result in restricting the bill, if that is required. I hope that the guidance will help in dealing with all such matters. We have heard today many of the jokes that have been made in the discussion of Mr McDonald’s proposals. We have heard about the triffid bill and Christine Grahame’s privet member’s bill—there have been puns galore. A laugh has been had to a degree in some of the fora in which the subject has been discussed. However, as we have heard from the cases that have come from across the country, this is no laughing matter for the huge number of people who have been affected for many a year. The problem is worse in some parts of the country than in others, because of the climate. As Mr Stevenson said, he has had no cases. I must be honest and say that, as an urban, city centre MSP, I have had no cases either. However, as a councillor in the past, I saw many cases in which high hedges caused huge difficulties, and such problems were exacerbated into even greater problems. Anything that can be done to resolve the disputes is worth while. We have heard that dispute resolution has already occurred in some places because the bill was introduced. If introducing the bill has such an effect, members can just think what will happen once it is passed and the guidelines are in place. Many local authorities will not have to take the required action, because common sense will, we hope, prevail and folk will take the action that should have been taken some time ago. The committee heard evidence about new developments, where conflicts arise not between neighbours but between owners of woodland and new neighbours. The minister’s statement that he will look at Scottish planning policy is a good idea. The committee heard from Dr Maggie Keegan about problems that the Scottish Wildlife Trust had in Cumbernauld, and committee members saw that area for themselves. That shows how easy it could be for such conflicts to arise. People must recognise where a property that they are buying is and what might happen if it is on the periphery of woodland, some of which might not be very old and might grow substantially. Any help that Scottish planning policy can provide on that would be useful. This has been a long journey, particularly for some of the campaigners, and 5 o’clock will bring great relief for many folk here. However, as Stuart McMillan says, this is only the beginning. I hope that some people out there will take cognisance of this and will take action now without more severe action needing to be taken.

The Local Government and Regeneration Committee was responsible for considering aspects of RPP2 relating to local government, communities and planning. I intend to summarise briefly the views of the committee and leave it to colleagues to provide greater detail on individual aspects. At the outset, I express my thanks and those of the committee to the witnesses who provided written and/or oral evidence to us, often at short notice. Without their considerable assistance, we would not have been able to complete the report in the time available. The committee made a deliberate choice to look forward, as RPP2 is an opportunity to set out the proposals and policies to facilitate the delivery of a second tranche of climate change targets. It also, of course, provides an opportunity to revise the approach to meeting the first batch of targets and, again, we have chosen to look forward and concentrate our thoughts on ways in which that can be achieved and reporting improved. Although the total quantity of emissions output from the public sector is relatively small, at 2 per cent, local authorities have large estates and are responsible for a wide range of functions as consumers and suppliers of services. The Minister for Local Government and Planning said that the actions of local government “will be central to the transition to a low-carbon economy and in helping to deliver the associated social, environmental and economic benefits to our communities”.—[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 27 February 2013; c 1758-59.] It is, therefore, right that the committee should consider how local government can influence public behaviour as well as contributing to meeting the targets. All Scotland’s local authorities have signed Scotland’s climate change declaration and all have produced annual statements, the latest of which—published in February 2013—were analysed by the sustainable Scotland network. The ensuing report set out a series of recommendations to improve the reporting of good practice and to support the development and use of its impact and influence. The sustainable Scotland network also made a series of recommendations that were aimed at improving the support that it can provide to local authorities. Basically, it wants more resources—nothing new there—to improve its reporting and analysis. The committee commends and supports its work and has recommended that future climate change reports to the Parliament should include a section specifically on local authorities, along with milestones by which progress can be measured. We also recommend that the future reports of local authorities include the amount that they are spending to support the delivery of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One example of work that is being undertaken by local government that can be shared by all concerns street lighting. Authorities are facing a triple whammy of increasing energy costs, significant increases in the distribution system charges from Scottish Power and increasingly non-compliant, out-of-date lights. Street lights and other lights, such as traffic signals, illuminated traffic signs and so on, account for 18 per cent of local government energy costs, which represents an annual figure of £43 million. Work in East Dunbartonshire Council on installing LED technology and other measures has shown that annual energy consumption—and therefore costs—can be reduced by 63.5 per cent. That equates to a reduction in carbon use of 26,752 tonnes annually. Of course, significant initial capital investment is required but, given the figures that I have provided, the payback period is relatively short. We were pleased to learn that the Government has indicated that it is providing pilot funding to some authorities to take schemes forward and we look forward to such schemes being quickly rolled out across the country. Local authorities have a significant role to play in influencing behavioural change. Like other committees, we were disappointed that the low-carbon behaviours framework was published after we had concluded our evidence taking. It is our view that that document should not be a stand-alone but should find expression in all sections of future RPP documents. Change is required across all sectors of the economy and society, if the targets are to be met. I will stay with our theme of looking forward. We made recommendations in relation to proposed new planning guidance, new building standards and the new national planning framework, all of which are expected later this year. In each case, we recommended that explicit requirements on favouring low-carbon-emission options be included. We also want planning authorities to be required to produce a statement setting out how the implementation of development plans and planning consent for major planning applications would contribute to the reduction of emissions. We were interested in a Government bid fund that has been made available to support local authorities that have applied for assistance in considering planning applications for wind farms. Assistance is provided to ensure that authorities have the necessary resource, policies and guidance in place when considering wind farm applications with the aim of speeding up the decision-making process. We consider that to be a helpful initiative and recommend that the Government widen its scope so that it can provide support for other climate change-related planning issues. I see that I have only 20 seconds left. We see opportunities in the forthcoming procurement reform bill. I hope that the Government will take cognisance of that. I also hope that more recognition will be given to communities’ input—perhaps the minister will deal with that in his summing up. I agree with colleagues that the four reports that were published last week by four committees of the Parliament provide the Government with the basis to improve the draft RPP2. We should be proud of the approach that Scotland has pioneered and do everything that we can to turn into reality the targets in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.

Ms Baxter is right to point out that people will make the difference. However, sometimes people do not need the policies to drive things forward. I saw that when I was on the carbon management board of Aberdeen City Council. Does the member think that, rather than have everything set in stone, we should allow certain people to make decisions as they go along, which often results in huge impacts?

1. To ask the Scottish Government what recent progress has been made on rolling out insulin pumps to people with diabetes. (S4O-01925)

Given the understandable shortage of staff to carry out insulin pump training in Grampian, will the minister consider issuing guidelines to allow trained representatives from the companies supplying the pumps to help to roll them out to patients who require them?

Will the member give way?

Those issues are reserved.

First of all, I should say that I am not a pacifist. I am not sure whether there is such a thing as a just war, but my opinion is that some battles need to take place for the good of humanity. However, 10 years ago, I marched in Glasgow to say, “Not in my name.” As a young loon, I went to the Cowdray hall lion in Aberdeen every remembrance Sunday. First, I went with my grandfather; I then went with the Boys Brigade, and then with the air cadets. For me at that time, I was showing my respect for the men and women who had fallen in wars that had long since happened. For a young boy in the 1970s and early 1980s, the first and second world wars and even the Korean war seemed like light years in the past. In 1982, the remembrance ceremony was more poignant, as we thought of those who had been involved in the Falklands conflict. In recent times, the act of remembrance has changed dramatically, as we think of members of the armed forces who have given their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Cowdray hall war memorial, the MacRobert memorial garden and the many memorials in Duthie park in Aberdeen are now joined by Allan Douglas park, which was named after a young Northfield lance corporal who was killed in Iraq on 30 January 2006. Allan Douglas was on a routine patrol in Amarah when he was shot. Despite receiving medical attention, he later died of his injuries. This morning, I spoke to Allan’s mother—Mrs Douglas—to seek her permission to speak about her son today. At the time, Mrs Douglas expressed her anger over the death of the son who “just loved life, he just lived for life”. The Douglas family last saw Allan when he came home for Christmas. Mrs Douglas said: “He did not want to go back this time—he’d seen enough the first time he was over. He said it was a waste of time people being there, he just really didn’t like it at all.” She went on: “I did not want him to go there at all—it wasn’t his war. We were not very happy that he had to go there. I think it’s a damn disgrace, they should not be out there at all. I do not think Tony Blair should have put any young kids out there—there’s been so many of them killed.” Naming the park after Allan Douglas is a fitting tribute to a brave young man and his family from a community that shares their loss, but will never truly understand their pain. Families, friends and communities in Aberdeen, right across these islands and around the globe have been touched by the war in Iraq. Many grieving parents, spouses and children find it difficult to comprehend why their loved ones were killed or maimed. Casualty numbers vary, but the costsofwar.org website states that there have been more than 189,000 direct war deaths, with at least 134,000 civilians killed. The website goes on to state: “it would not be surprising if indirect death were 2 to 4 times the number of direct deaths due to violence - reaching as high as 536,000 indirect deaths over the 134,000 civilians killed directly by violence.” A 2011 survey conservatively estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million Iraqi children have lost one or both parents. Why? The Guardian’s coverage of the Chilcot inquiry on Tuesday 25 January 2011 stated: “Two former cabinet secretaries – the country’s most senior civil servants – mounted a devastating critique of the way Blair handled the run-up to war. The cabinet were trapped in a position where they had to agree to attack Iraq or bring down the prime minister, the inquiry heard. Today’s witnesses disputed Blair’s claim to the inquiry last Friday that cabinet ministers might not have seen official papers but would have known about plans from the media. ‘None of those key [Whitehall] papers were presented to the cabinet so I do not accept the former prime minister’s claim they knew the score ... That isn’t borne out by what actually happened,’ said Lord Turnbull, then cabinet secretary. Lord Wilson, his predecessor, told the inquiry that if asked whether there were ‘proper cabinet’ decisions in the run-up to war, he would say ‘emphatically not’. He said he remembered saying in March 2002, a year before the invasion: ‘There is a gleam in [Blair’s] eye that worries me.’” If only the Cabinet had had the guts to challenge Blair and to seek all the relevant information and MPs had taken a principled stand, we would not have had to face the unjust, illegal war in Iraq, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis; we would not be mourning the recent deaths of young service personnel at war memorials each November; and the Douglases would still have their son, Allan.

On a point of order, Presiding Officer.

On a point of order, Presiding Officer. The accusation was made that the debate is about the constitution. It is not; it is about 10 years of the Iraq war. I want it on the record that I did not mention the constitution in a single part of my speech. My speech was about families who have been affected by the war.

I welcome the order. It is worth repeating what I said when we discussed the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2013. Between 2007-08 and 2012-13, the resources in the Scottish Government’s control increased by 6.4 per cent while, over the same period, local government’s budget increased by 8.9 per cent, which demonstrates the strong financial settlements that have been agreed with local government during these challenging times. We should not forget that. I welcome the sixth year of the council tax freeze, which will help hard-pressed families throughout the country. I also welcome the maintenance of teacher numbers in line with pupil numbers and the fact that probationers will get jobs as part of the teacher induction scheme. I am an Aberdonian, so I welcome the funding floor that this Government implemented, which benefits Aberdeen and Edinburgh. I still wish that there could be a review of the funding formula. I hope that COSLA will initiate a review, and I hope that it has listened to what ministers said recently about the door being open. I say to Ms Boyack that Aberdeen City Council is getting more money than it previously got and faces no significant cuts. That will not last, because the careful financial management of its SNP administration is no longer in place. It is unfortunate that what we have now looks like a hotch-potch of what we had previously, which almost led Aberdeen to financial disaster. I find Ms Boyack’s amendment somewhat bizarre. Social security is still a reserved matter and it seems that the Labour Party is quite happy for that to continue; I have to say that I am not. The Scottish Government has committed £23 million, with local government providing a further £17 million, to support nearly 560,000 people, through the council tax reduction scheme. When Ms Boyack sums up, will she say why, when the Council Tax Reduction (Scotland) Regulations 2012 were laid before the Parliament last year, the Conservative and Labour members of the Subordinate Legislation Committee voted together to report that the regulations were potentially outwith devolved competence? Was the Labour Party trying to put the kibosh on the scheme? Mrs Mitchell came under attack on the bedroom tax and I have no reason to believe that my colleagues were wrong to attack her on that. However, her view is shared by Helen Goodman, who serves in the shadow Cabinet, no less. Helen Goodman said on “Daily Politics” on 11 March: “We’ve said that the bedroom tax should only apply if people have been offered a smaller place to live and turned it down, because obviously it is better to use the housing stock more efficiently.” What is the true Labour position on the bedroom tax? Is it Scottish Labour’s position, or is it the position of the Westminster Labour Party, which—let us face facts—will continue to control social security if Labour has its way?

We have heard the Labour Party again and again calling what has happened a scandal, but we are also seeing it backtrack on what it has said in the chamber in the past few weeks. Although we know about the situation in Lothian, which the Government acted on very quickly, we have heard accusations and inferences in the chamber about the same things happening in NHS boards throughout the country. NHS Grampian was mentioned in the Parliament only a few weeks ago. Since then, I have been in discussion and communication with it, as probably many members have been. NHS Grampian has said about certain things that have been thrown its way: “Waiting times in Grampian are at their lowest level and most patients are being seen sooner than ever before. We categorically deny any deliberate tampering with lists. There is no evidence of any kind that Grampian staff manipulated waiting list figures to achieve national targets, nor does” the Audit Scotland “report suggest that. We acknowledge that there have been administrative errors, which NHS Grampian had identified two years ago, and which resulted in staff training and the appointment of a new administration manager ... No patient was disadvantaged by these errors. Any patient who is unavailable remains on the list and is treated according to clinical priority.” Those are the facts from NHS Grampian, but many members peddle rumours that there is a major problem in it. That is categorically not the truth. If anybody has any concerns, they should go and talk to the folks in NHS Grampian. One of the things that has been highlighted is social unavailability codes. There were some cases in Grampian when folk were unavailable four times in the course of their wait. Some folk may question why that happened so many times, but I come from a part of Scotland where many people work offshore and their work sometimes does not let them go to get treatment at the times that are offered. I have an example in which that has happened and I am sure that, where there is one example, there are many more. Statements about the manipulation of social unavailability codes sometimes come from folks who may not understand why people would be unavailable at certain times. There has been a lot of talk in the debate about NHS staff. I resent Drew Smith’s final comment about the SNP using NHS staff as a human shield. I have the highest regard for the staff who work in our NHS, particularly in recent times when quite a number of my family and friends have used the services of the NHS in the Grampian area. Saying that people are manipulating waiting times is actually to slag off those staff.

No, I will not take an intervention from Mr Findlay—sit down. I have got far too much to say on the matter. During debates on this issue, some folk have lost sight of how important the NHS is for the people of Scotland. We should thank our lucky stars that we have an SNP Government here that deals with the NHS differently from what goes on south of the border in the NHS. We can consider what our NHS staff have achieved in improving our nation’s health in recent times: we have seen reductions in deaths from cancer, stroke and coronary heart disease since 2007 by 5, 24 and 20 per cent respectively; the standardised mortality rate for coronary heart disease has reduced by 43.2 per cent since 2002 and that for strokes has reduced by 41.8 per cent; the incidence rate for coronary heart disease has decreased by 28.9 per cent over the past decade and that for stroke by 21.7 per cent; and the overall death rate for cancer fell by 12 per cent between 2001 and 2011. Those are things to celebrate. It may well be that not everything is perfect in our national health service, but the folks who work in it are doing the best that they possibly can to improve the health of the people of this nation.

6. To ask the First Minister what impact the reported 30-year high in North Sea oil investment will have on the Scottish economy. (S4F-01200)

The oil and gas industry is the economic powerhouse of not only the Scottish economy, but the UK economy. Even George Osborne’s disastrous changes to the tax regime, which have since been reversed, failed to stymie investment. Does the First Minister agree that it is the success of the oil and gas industry that is propping up the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s failures, and that the fruits of our precious resource would be much better spent on creating a fairer, more socially just and independent Scotland?

It is a pleasure to open the debate on behalf of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, and I thank the Parliament for allowing the debate to take place. I also thank all members of the committee, past and present, the committee clerks, the advisers and those who gave evidence in the various strands of the inquiry. We looked at partnerships and outcomes in strand 1, and we focused on benchmarking and performance measurement in strand 2. We are now looking at progress in the development of shared services, innovative ways of achieving economies of scale, and how to harness the strengths and skills of all relevant public sector partners, led by councils, to deliver the best possible quality services. Strand 3 will build on our earlier inquiry reports. The committee is keen to hear the views of a wide cross-section of members during the inquiry, rather than after the work has concluded. That debate will inform the committee consideration and give members a chance to hear emerging views and set out key issues. We have a background of budget reductions, an economic downturn and growing demands and expectations from the public on public services. We have looked at the Finance Committee inquiry into preventative spend, and the shared services agenda, including the Arbuthnott inquiry in Clyde valley; we have taken cognisance of the Christie commission and the Scottish Government’s response to it; we have looked assiduously at the statement of ambition and its focus on partners acting collectively to deliver outcomes for the community; and we have studied the community planning review and the development of single outcome agreements. Strand 1 of the inquiry focused on community planning partnerships. In our strand 1 report, we noted that they are expected “to promote a strong focus on outcomes, on partnership working, on the use of total resources and on the co-ordination of other activity.” At the tail end of strand 1, the committee’s then convener, Joe FitzPatrick MSP, said: “Community planning partnerships can effect genuine change in our communities. Our committee experienced first-hand the positive impact that effective community planning partnerships can play in delivering public services in Scotland. Community planning partnerships can only do so, however, when all those involved in the partnership are prepared to work together and are working to shared goals. To do this there needs to be a cultural change within parts of the public sector and a recognition of the benefits true partnership working can bring.” When the committee asked whether that ambition had been met, it found that it had not been fully met and that barriers still existed. We stated that CPPs had been “a qualified success”, but further evidence that we have taken in strands 2 and 3, as well as evidence from other inquiries, suggests that we would not now support even that limited endorsement. I will return to that issue later. In strand 1, we found that cultural and behavioural challenges existed, and that bodies had a silo mentality and an inability to work collaboratively to deliver shared outcomes through the sharing of resources and information. Our strand 1 report highlighted that leadership and vision were critical to effective partnership working, that a shared vision with all partners was required and that there should be shared accountability and responsibility. We said that budget sharing would go a long way to assist with that.

The committee has not looked at that in any depth, but Mr McDonald will know that I favour priority-based budgeting. It has been successful in Aberdeen, and I am sure that it could be successful elsewhere. The committee stated that third sector involvement was crucial and that community engagement was essential. In the briefing that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has sent us for the debate, it says: “community engagement and empowerment is at the heart of the community planning process. Recognising that the third sector is particularly close to communities, that is also one of the reasons we are working to realign our relationship with them.” However, on our recent visits to Cumbernauld, Aberdeen and Glasgow, the committee found that communities are not being engaged with to the level that I think that they should be. In a number of places, the third sector feels that it has been pushed out of the process. I think that we need to delve further into that issue in strand 3 of our inquiry. I agree with COSLA that such engagement is vital. That is the view that the committee took in strand 1.

I agree with Mr McMillan. Exactly the same message came across in Aberdeen as did in Glasgow. Folk were keen to talk about the proposed community empowerment bill. Perhaps ministers could give us an indication of how that will help to allow bottom-up consultation to take place, instead of folk receiving the top-down diktats that were mentioned in both cities the other week. We should be moving towards the outcome-based approach, but it seems to be extremely challenging. There seemed to be more of a focus on inputs and outputs than on outcomes. Again, engagement with partners and local communities is required to ensure that we can measure outcomes properly. Such engagement is central to the future development of single outcome agreements. Strand 2 of the inquiry looked at benchmarking, which was a bit of a dream for an anorak like me. It may have been hard going for some committee members, but they considered assiduously the benchmarking work that was going on. We had a lot of engagement with people on the issue and held a seminar on benchmarking that I think was extremely useful for all those who attended. It was a short, sharp inquiry, which considered the work on benchmarking that local government officials who are members of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers in Scotland carried out for almost three years. Progress was slow, but eventually all 32 councils bought into the work. It is critical that the Parliament recognises the significance of that benchmarking project, because it represents the first time that all 32 local authorities in Scotland have co-operated to produce consistent data on key indicators for benchmarking. It is equally critical to recognise that the data will still be influenced by local circumstances and priorities and that that context remains important. The Parliament should welcome that benchmarking initiative and encourage councils and community planning partnership partners to use it to drive forward public sector reform. Benchmarking allows organisations to compare their services, costs and outcomes against those of others who are undertaking similar activities and to do so over a period of time. All local authorities can therefore compare their results and costs against one another’s; in each case, it will be possible to identify which is the cheapest and which has the highest outcomes. The comparison also allows local factors to be taken into account and, crucially, it can reflect local priorities. That means that instead of the previous situation in which authorities often compared apples with pears, they will now compare apples with apples. The committee was told that it was critical for SOLACE that benchmarking “should drive improvement in council service delivery.” We also took evidence from Scottish Water, which has been doing benchmarking for a number of years and which told the committee that it had contributed to annual cost efficiency savings of £100 million between 2002 and 2006. Scottish Water sees absolutely no downside to the benchmarking process. COSLA has bought into benchmarking completely and utterly, and it agreed that it was desirable to collect indicators on a comparative basis across all councils and that comparative analysis seems to be the key management tool of the approach for the future. That of course links into the Christie commission, which recognised that “well designed external challenge can be ‘a catalyst for improvement where it influences behaviour and culture of providers, leading to improvements in the way that services are delivered.’” The committee will continue to monitor the benchmarking indicators as they are brought into play. I think that some are very surprised at how much interest the committee took in that matter. I move on to strand 3 and what still needs to be done. We will continue to look at our findings from strands 1 and 2, and we will involve communities and third sector providers. It was therefore a little galling to see from the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations today a little briefing that is critical of strand 3. SCVO seems to think that we will not involve communities and third sector partners, which could not be further from the truth. The committee has already committed to go on further outings throughout the country to take evidence. So, is PSR happening in Scotland? We think that, yes, the green shoots are there, but it is not happening as fast as is needed or desired. It can be haphazard in certain places and is a bit pick and mix. It can often be driven by external rather than internal factors. There are many reasons, we are told, for the slow pace of change: legal constraints, political will, finance, different rates of development across public sector bodies, data, partnerships, CPPs, outcomes, attitudes, and long lead-in times.

Presiding Officer, I move, That the Parliament recognises the importance of the work of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee in its inquiry into public services reform; welcomes its examination, at strand 3 of the inquiry, of progress being made in relation to the development of shared services, other innovative ways of achieving economies of scale and harnessing the strengths and skills of key public sector partners to deliver the best possible quality services in local areas, and notes that the committee’s work is designed to build on its earlier inquiry reports, at strand 1, into partnerships and outcomes and, at strand 2, into progress on benchmarking and performance measurement.

Sometimes the impediments seem to be perceptions rather than realities. How will the cabinet secretary inform various bodies that what they see often as a legal constraint actually does not exist?

The Local Government and Regeneration Committee is well aware of the impact of welfare reform. That is one reason why we have chosen to go round the country and why we are ensuring that third sector partners are extremely well represented in our evidence-taking sessions. In our Aberdeen and Glasgow sessions, I ensured that we had representatives of the citizens advice bureau because I thought that their input was vital.

Will Ms Boyack give way?

Will Margaret Mitchell give way?

One of the early visits that the committee undertook was to West Lothian, where there was a huge amount of partnership between the council and other public bodies, including co-location and teams from various sectors working together. It seemed that the community was well represented in that partnership. Does Anne McTaggart agree that, although there are bad examples, there are also some extremely good examples?

Mr Pentland is being a bit inconsistent. He said that he wanted systematic change, which I think would stymie the innovation that Mr Rennie talked about. A key point is that there must be freedom to allow best practice to be developed. Will Mr Pentland go into more depth about what he means by a systematic approach?

Does Mr Finnie agree that the change funds that have been put in place have often helped with the sharing of services, which reduces costs but maintains quality of service?

Will Ms Boyack give way?

I welcome Ms Johnstone’s mention of Aberdeen Heat and Power, which does a fantastic job. Does she agree that other local authorities have exactly the same opportunities as Aberdeen City Council and that they should probably look at what has happened in Aberdeen? We need to ensure that best practice is adopted throughout Scotland.

5. To ask the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee regarding its forward work programme. (S4O-01793)

I have spoken to many councillors across the country who believe that SLARC has been rather ineffective in carrying out its duties. What is the view of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on the issue?

Will the member give way?

There have been some interesting speeches. I turn, first, to some of the comments that Ms Boyack made. She said that local authorities cannot trust the SNP. She said: “local authorities do not have flexibility.” I can tell Ms Boyack something, as a former councillor. Certainly, councils did not trust the former Labour-Liberal Executive, which held most of the purse strings through ring fencing, so that councils were forced to spend money on things that were not priorities in the areas concerned. That was economic and financial madness as far as I am concerned, and I am glad that that has disappeared off the agenda. There is more flexibility under this Government, given the signing of the concordat and the respect agenda with local authorities. Many things have been said in today’s debate. However, I quote the COSLA finance spokesperson, one Councillor Kevin Keenan—a Labour councillor. On 13 December 2012 he said, after the announcement that day: “There are no surprises in what the Minister told Parliament this afternoon ... but it has to be accepted that there are challenges in there, challenges that will need to be faced by all 32 Councils in Scotland.”

Not at the moment, thanks. In that man’s sensible comment is recognition of the fact that the Government faces challenges because of the Westminster cuts that we have had to bear. That was not the typical moans and groans that we often hear. Yesterday, we heard from Labour members that the priorities were housing, colleges and the Glasgow to Edinburgh rail link. Today, it seems to be local government. That is one of the things that really annoys me. Since the draft budget order was made, Labour has made announcements with spending commitments of £2.74 billion. Let us consider the realities of local government finance, and let us—

No. Ms Boyack would not take an intervention from me. I might let her in later. Between 2007-08 and 2012-13 the Scottish Government’s budget increased by 6.4 per cent. Over the same period, local government’s budget increased by 8.9 per cent. That is showing respect to local government—an increased share of the Scottish Government budget over the piece.

As an Aberdeen MSP, I was going to come to that. First, I point out that the 85 per cent floor applies over the spending period, as Mr Swinney has explained. Ours is the first Government to have put in place such a floor, and I am very proud of that. At the same time, I still firmly believe that there should be a change to the funding formula. Given our respect agenda, Mr Swinney cannot impose that on local government, so the issue needs to be dealt with by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I fought for such a change within COSLA, and I will continue to call for a change to the funding formula. Mr Rennie may well sit and smirk, but the key thing is that we need a fair funding formula. If Mr Swinney were to impose a change on local government, there would be absolute uproar in this place. Mr Swinney has done what he promised to do in the SNP manifesto, and I am glad that he did so. Do I think that Aberdeen should get more? Yes, and that could be achieved through a change to the funding formula.

Will the minister give way?

Will Ken Macintosh give way?

When I was first elected to Aberdeen City Council in 1999, a wise man—one Brian Adam—said to me, “You know, if you ever aspire to govern, you have to have a budget in opposition.” I stuck to that when I was on the council; Brian Adam did it when he was the sole SNP councillor on Aberdeen City Council; and Mr Gibson did it in Glasgow. We produced a line-by-line budget. I just wish that some of those SNP budgets had actually been passed at the time—we might not have been in the mess that we were in by the time that we came to power. I think that it is really diabolical that any Opposition party should come here today without an alternative budget. It is unbelievable—the people out there will find it hard to believe—that the Opposition parties have failed to do that. Having heard Mr Macintosh both today and previously propose the double counting of spend, I think that he may be a little out of his depth in his current portfolio. Turning to points that other members have raised, I want to start with investment in housing, which Dr Murray mentioned. I welcome today’s announcement from the cabinet secretary on additional investment in housing, which will mean 350 new homes and a huge amount of adaptations and retrofitting. That will be good for all in the social housing sector. More money for such projects could be found, not necessarily from the Scottish Government—obviously, we face cuts to our capital budget from Westminster—but by accessing investment from pension funds to increase the amount of social housing that we can build. On numerous occasions, my colleague Mark McDonald has written with such proposals to the Aberdeen City Council leader Councillor Crockett, who is also convener of the council’s pensions panel, but he has not even received the courtesy of a reply. If the Labour Party is truly serious about these issues—

Not just now, thank you. If Labour members are truly serious about these issues, they will get together with others to find solutions to move things forward.

Ms MacDonald knows full well that I do not trust any Treasury in London. I will come back to that at the tail-end of my speech. Turning to welfare reform, in recent times we have heard lots from folk from across the chamber about what the Scottish Government is doing about welfare. Let us be honest: the welfare reforms that are being introduced are Westminster reforms. The Scottish Government has tried to mitigate the impact of a number of those measures through the Scottish welfare fund, moneys for advice services and mitigation for council tax benefit, but we cannot do it all. There is no way that the cabinet secretary can find the money to mitigate the impact of all the disastrous policies that are coming into play. In some regards, I am amazed at what Mr Rennie said. I do not disagree that we would like to spend money on increased day care for children across the board, but the reality is that the money is not available. We are about to see one-year-olds, two-year-olds, three-year-olds and four-year-olds being kicked out of their houses because there is an extra bedroom in the house. Mr Rennie should try to sort that out before he lectures anyone else. Turning to what I believe is good news, I think that the pilot for town centre regeneration, which seeks to turn empty properties into housing, is an absolutely fantastic idea that will be welcomed in many communities throughout the country. I hope that the pilot is successful in bringing about real and dramatic change in our town centres and that it can be rolled out.

Thank you, Presiding Officer. The extra moneys for trunk roads will also find a great welcome out there. The EDGE fund is also well worth investing in. From the Opposition today, we have seen fantasy finances of the first order. I do not trust the London Treasury because we have seen those fantasy finances before, under the auspices of Gordon Brown as Chancellor of the Exchequer and then as Prime Minister. One reason why we have the tough budget that we face today is because we are having to deal with the aftermath and sotter of that Labour Government.

Many times in Aberdeen, opposition parties supported administration budgets because there was that negotiation. However, they had to be realistic. If the Opposition wants to spend money, it has to tell Government where that money will come from. That is where the process fails.

Thank you, Presiding Officer. I, too, am glad to see you back. The High Hedges (Scotland) Bill came before the committee in October 2012. We received 90 submissions to our call for evidence. The overwhelming majority of the people from whom we heard wanted legislative action to address the irresponsible actions of a very small minority. As part of our consideration of the bill, we held three oral evidence sessions. I thank everyone who responded to our call for evidence and all those who gave oral evidence. It did not come as a surprise to me or to other members of the committee that it was a debate that generated quite a lot of heat. There is probably not a member in the chamber whose constituency mailbag has never had a high-hedge case in it. I also thank the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre and the official report for their support and assistance, and put on record my thanks to all the members of the committee, who were extremely assiduous during the course of our discussions. Members should note that I said “assiduous” and not “deciduous”. I am sorry for that very bad joke, Presiding Officer. The key issue was the definition of a high hedge. Some people wanted the bill to become the high trees and hedges bill; some people wanted specific trees—generally native evergreens and others such as holly, juniper and yew—to be exempt; and some people wanted anything that constituted a barrier to be included, regardless of type, origin or species, and did not see a difference between deciduous trees and evergreen or semi-evergreen hedges. We had some sympathy, but we were warned by, and agreed with, the majority that keeping it simple was best. We accept that care is needed to avoid adverse impacts on wildlife or biodiversity, which could have a number of unintended consequences, not least for costs and workload for local authorities. A majority of the committee supports the simple definition in the bill, which follows the tried-and-tested approach taken in England and Wales. During our evidence sessions, we heard from the Isle of Man, where there have been difficulties in extending a similar bill to include other species and trees. We also heard about some of the associated costs—particularly the legal costs—of adding such provisions. Unfortunately, I cannot give definitive figures, because we do not have them. Evidence was received on the link with tree preservation orders. Some favoured that link, but others did not like the connection. The committee agreed that the test local authorities must apply is similar to the test for the making of a TPO, and that it therefore made sense for the two to live together. If an authority decides that a high-hedge order is appropriate and action requires to be taken against a tree that is part of the hedge, it is implicit in that determination that the continued existence of a TPO is not appropriate. There was a considerable amount of evidence on who should pay the local authority’s costs and on how much the costs could and should be. Perhaps unusually, local authorities had little to say on that, provided that the bill’s impact on them was cost neutral. Those affected by high hedges were adamant that the hedge owner should pay all costs incurred. Such a scheme is possible, but it would increase complexity and, paradoxically, costs. Under the bill’s proposals, the owners of high hedges will have to pay and will be liable for the costs of action taken to reduce the height of a hedge. The committee agreed that, ultimately, the intention was not for action to be required but for parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Under the bill, there is a financial incentive for both parties to reach agreement. The committee hopes that many disputes will be resolved amicably—indeed, it accepts that that will be the case. We have anecdotal evidence that some disputes have already been resolved because of the bill’s introduction. Other areas that the committee considered and made recommendations about include concern that the body of expertise available to local authorities about trees and hedges is diminishing rapidly. The committee suggests that the Government should consider establishing a central tree officer so that a core of expertise is available to all local authorities. We understand that such an officer already exists in Wales. It will do no harm to see how Wales is getting on with the way in which that has been set up, from which we can perhaps learn lessons. Another concern is that we must ensure that where the local authority is a party to an application, either as the applicant or the landowner, sufficiently independent and transparent arrangements are in place to ensure that justice can be seen to be done. Such an apparent conflict is not novel; it also occurs in planning, for example, and is successfully addressed there. We should take advantage of the current review of planning guidance to ensure that future problems with hedges and plants are avoided. The committee recently visited Cumbernauld where we saw some woodland that the Scottish Wildlife Trust had cut back after talking to local residents. Some such disputes would not happen if they were dealt with by a planning authority at the outset. There are lessons to be learned in that regard. We recommend that the national park authorities be made statutory consultees in all applications for high-hedge notices made within their park areas. We believe that the legislation should undergo a full review after it has been in operation for not more than five years. That will allow the questions around the definition and fees to be looked at, and it will present an early opportunity for amendments in the light of operational experience. Our conclusions are that the committee supports the bill’s general principles and agrees with the approach that it takes to the definition of high hedges. We have made recommendations that relate to having a central tree expert and reviewing planning policy in the area, with the national parks authorities included as consultees. We would also like to see a reasonably early review of the operation of the legislation.

Will the member give way?

I thank Ms Boyack. It is key that we get the bill absolutely right. When considering expanding the definition, members need to consider the evidence from the Isle of Man, which has gone a lot further in its approach and has come across a number of difficulties, not least of which is cost. We could get in a pickle if we overegged the pudding at the beginning. The review that the committee unanimously recommended is the right approach. Let us get the broad definition right to start with, and see what happens afterwards.

We have heard a lot today about some of the high-level figures that relate to the cuts and about how many families will be affected. Sometimes, we think too much about those high-level issues in this place, so I want to start by talking about some of the conversations that I have had in my constituency recently about the child benefit cuts. Just as the cuts were taking place, a woman from my constituency who has a part-time job as a cleaner and whose husband works offshore in the oil industry and earns slightly over £50,000 a year talked to me about the impact that they would experience due to the money that they would lose because of the changes. A lot of folk will say, “If her husband’s earning £50,000 a year, they’re probably pretty well off.” However, we all know that lots of people struggle, no matter what their earnings may be. She said, “I would not be so bothered about us losing money if I knew that the money was going to somebody in society who is poorer than me.” However, that is not the case. She said that it was particularly galling that a household in which there were two earners who each earned slightly less than £50,000 would retain the benefit. That discussion went on for some time. The lady had her head screwed on, without a doubt, because she went on to talk about the concept of universality. The Labour Party has stated that it introduced family allowance in 1946, which it replaced with child benefit in 1975. That is something for the Labour Party to be proud of. However, my problem is that, at this moment in time, I do not know where the Labour Party stands on universality any more. The conversation with the lady in my constituency went on. She said, “If this universal benefit is going to be cut by Westminster, is the state pension going to be the next universal benefit to go?” How can the population trust the parties at Westminster on that issue? Annabelle Ewing has already pointed out that, in his 2009 speech to the Tory conference, George Osborne said: “We will preserve child benefit” and other universal benefits. How can folk believe what he has to say? Mr Rennie refused to take an intervention from me, in which I was going to point out that his leader, Nick Clegg, said, just before the last election: “We are not putting child benefit into question.” Once again, another U-turn from the Liberals; another failed manifesto promise. How can anyone trust the Liberals on benefits? It is Labour’s position that really intrigues me. Members might be interested in this quote, which says that the Government “plan to pay the deficit down on the backs of those with low and middle incomes, with a threat to universal benefits such as child benefit and the winter fuel payment ... It is essential that we defend these payments. The alternative is a dangerous erosion of the social solidarity that comes from a universal system.” So said Ed Miliband in The Observer on 29 August 2010. Yet here in Scotland there are questions over the Scottish Labour Party’s position on universality, what with Johann Lamont’s proposed cuts commission. In today’s debate, Labour members need to tell the Scottish people where they stand on the principle of universality. For me, universality is key to that social cohesion. In other small European countries, we see a similar mindset—

I will take a brief intervention from Ms Baillie.

I say to Ms Baillie that today’s debate is on welfare, so universality in welfare is what I am concerned with today. I turn to small European countries, some of which are our near neighbours. In Denmark, child allowance is paid to families with children under 18. In Sweden, families with children under 16 receive a similar benefit. In Norway, the age limit has just been raised from 16 to 18. In Finland, the benefit is paid until children reach the age of 17. None of those benefits is means tested. Why, here in Scotland, are we facing the disastrous prospect of means testing not only of child benefit but in many other areas? How can we trust any of the Westminster parties to ensure that universality in welfare remains? That is why I think that this Parliament needs control over welfare, and I hope that the people of Scotland vote yes in 2014 to allow that to happen.

I actually said that the fact that child benefit is being slashed from the universal system raises the question of what is next on the agenda. Will it be the state pension? That could well happen. Let us be honest. If the UK Government has done that with child benefit and both parties said prior to the election that they would not, who is to say that they will not do the same with the state pension?

We have heard many tributes to the Parliament’s mental health champions, who not only take part in debates in the chamber but continue the good work beyond it. I want to pay tribute to my former Aberdeen City Council colleague, Councillor Jim Kiddie, who served on the Millan commission on mental health and who tries to create mental health champions out of almost everyone whom he meets. People like Jim Kiddie have led us to the place where we are today, where—although I recognise that we still face challenges—we have a mental health strategy, which I think is pretty good. When Malcolm Chisholm referred to differences between the draft and final strategies, I thought that Jim Kiddie was probably one of the folks who had been in communication to say that he was not entirely happy about certain aspects of the draft. I also pay tribute to the many groups and volunteers throughout Scotland who work to help folks with mental health difficulties. On Monday, I had the pleasure of having tea with a friends group in Aberdeen, which is entirely voluntarily run but makes a huge difference to people’s lives. Organisations like that, which often operate on a shoestring budget, are to be praised for the efforts that they make. On health inequalities, it does no harm to reflect on the Audit Scotland report on that from December 2012. Audit Scotland notes: “People in deprived areas have lower overall mental well-being and more GP consultations for depression and anxiety ... (62 consultations per 1,000 patients compared to 28 per 1,000 patients in the least deprived areas). Suicide rates are three times higher among men than women and over three times higher in the most deprived areas. Between 2007 and 2011, the suicide rate in Scotland was 26.4 per 100,000 in the most deprived areas compared to 7.1 in the least deprived areas.” Many people say to me that I come from a very rich city, but in Aberdeen we have poverty amidst plenty. We need to ensure that tackling health inequalities is a priority, so I am pleased that the minister in his opening speech mentioned that as the Government’s ambition. My great fear about the current situation is that welfare reform will have a massive impact on some of the most vulnerable people in our country.

I agree with Mr Robertson on that point. In evidence to the Welfare Reform Committee just this week, a representative of the Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance said that her staff are having to do much more work to help folk through those processes. She gave an example of a client in East Ayrshire who had to attend an appeal tribunal in Ayr, which basically required the advocate to be with the client for the entire day. We need to ensure that those folks who perform the work capability assessments and appeals recognise that some folks have real mental health difficulties. Unfortunately, such difficulties do not always seem to be taken cognisance of. Having gone with committee colleagues Alex Johnstone and Michael McMahon to see Atos undertake a work capability assessment—a very good actress stood in for the client, but it gave us a feel for the process—I think that the assessment process would be pretty scary for many people but it can only add an additional strain for people with mental health problems and learning disabilities. I have a great fear that we may see deterioration in people’s health as a result of the processes that are in place. Mary Scanlon talked about the Harrington review: although that has made things slightly better, there is massive room for improvement. I hope that that will be looked at more carefully.

What support can the Government offer the staff of the Foyer restaurant and gallery who are to be made redundant following the sad decision to close that well-thought-of social enterprise?

3. To ask the Scottish Government when it last met Aberdeen City Council to discuss infrastructure investment. (S4O-01651)

Has Aberdeen City Council had any discussions with the Government regarding tax increment financing—TIF—funding? Can the cabinet secretary confirm that TIF funding for the bid that includes the city garden project is still on the table if Aberdeen City Council chooses to follow the wishes of Aberdonians and proceed with that scheme?

We have already heard some statistics relating to the oil and gas industry, but I will go over some of them again because it is vital that everyone in Parliament recognise the importance of our oil and gas industry. It provides 196,000 jobs in Scotland; it makes a £32 billion contribution to the balance of payments; it accounts for £7 billion in exports; it contributes £13 billion pounds in corporation tax—a quarter of the total that is collected in the UK—and £6 billion in corporate and payroll taxes; and there are 24 billion barrels of oil, worth £1.5 trillion, still to be recovered. That shows the importance of the industry. However, for those of us who come from the north-east—Aberdeen loons like me—it means much more than that, because a great many of our family and friends are employed in the industry. Earlier, when Mr McDonald asked Mr Harvie what he would do with the oil and gas industry, which Mr Harvie seems to be keen to get rid of, Mr Harvie responded, “Transition”. I have to say to Mr Harvie that it would be a huge transition, because according to Aberdeen city and shire economic future, 77 per cent of direct employment in Aberdeen city and shire is attributable to the oil and gas industry.

A 40-year period is a huge amount of time in which to achieve a transition, and we are undergoing that transition. It will take a long while to get renewables on stream, and the skills that we are discussing are transferable, as Rhoda Grant has said. Scotland has a huge part to play in the industry—not only in the next 40 years, but beyond that, in terms of the expertise that we can give to other places in the world. At this moment, my brother is working in Indonesia, my father works in the supply chain in Aberdeen and my brother-in-law works to the west of Shetland. I could go on and on and list a huge number of family and friends. That shows how important oil and gas are to the north-east of Scotland and beyond. I agree completely with the comments that Rhoda Grant, Lewis Macdonald and Maureen Watt made about safety. Like thousands of others throughout the country, the first thing that I did when I heard about the recent ditchings that took place was phone home to ensure that my own kith and kin were not involved. Lewis Macdonald was absolutely right to say that safety comes first in dealing with the helicopter situation. I am really glad that the industry is working with the health and safety representatives in trade unions and has taken a responsible attitude in that regard. I am sure that that will continue. It is right to highlight the importance of the step changes that have been made. The industry, the unions and the health and safety representatives are to be applauded for it. I cannot agree with Rhoda Grant on the tax regime. The greatest danger to the oil and gas industry is the recent United Kingdom tax regime. As has been pointed out, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced without consultation a tax hike on oil and gas production; the supplementary charge went from 20 to 32 per cent. There has been a welcome U-turn on that, but it was all really cack-handed.

I do not have any time. I am sorry. The Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce oil and gas survey that was published in late 2012 noted: “confidence in the stability of the UK tax regime remains low.” I am sure that the tax regime in an independent Scotland will recognise the value of the industry to our country and will create the stable tax regime that is required. We have a huge amount of competition from elsewhere in the world—Houston, Abu Dhabi, Kuala Lumpur and Perth, to name but a few places. We must ensure that investment in the industry continues and that the skills gap is filled. That is why I am so pleased that we will have an energy skills academy. I am sure that the institutions in the north-east of Scotland will play a vital part in it.

6. To ask the Scottish Government what recent discussions it has had with Aberdeen City Council regarding the proposed third Don crossing. (S4O-01643)

The cabinet secretary will be aware that Aberdeen City Council agreed yesterday to progress with the third Don crossing, which is very welcome news indeed. Will the cabinet secretary consider bundling the third Don crossing contract with the AWPR contract if Aberdeen City Council requests that?

We have heard a lot today about lawyers and some of their foibles, to say the least. Some of the science around cod recovery is ignored by the media—we have heard some real scare stories about that recently, which I am sure is not helpful to the negotiations. Can we also call for responsible media as well as responsible lawyers?

How long is the strike action likely to last?

I support the motion, and I commend the minister for the amount of effort that he has put in on this issue and for the non-partisan way in which he has gone about that. There is one thing for sure: I will not support the Conservative amendment. However, I give credit to the Conservatives because at least they have bothered to turn up for the debate, unlike the Liberal Democrats, who seem unable to turn up for any of these kinds of debate and are unwilling to defend the indefensible policies of their Government at Westminster. It is a real shame that they have not made the effort to hear what members have to say. We have a double-pronged attack on disabled people at this moment in time. We have a situation whereby we are about to see massive changes to disability living allowance, with the change to personal independence payments, which will lead to a cut of around £250 million for claimants in Scotland. At the same time, we are seeing the demise of many of the Remploy factories that we have in this country. It is a double-pronged attack on disabled people in Scotland. The closures are at odds with the Conservatives’ stated aim for welfare reform. If they truly want to get people back to work, they have to give opportunities to every single person, no matter what their capabilities are. I agree that, where possible, we should ensure that disabled folk can go into mainstream employment, but we know that, as Dennis Robertson pointed out, there are times when that will not be possible and when impediments are put in the way of people entering the mainstream jobs market. We must also remember that, at present, unemployment rates are quite high and it is difficult for able-bodied people to get into work, never mind folk with severe disabilities. One thing that I find really galling—it is in the Tory amendment—is the claim that “several Remploy factories were not economically viable”. My experience of the Aberdeen situation—I am sure that my colleagues from the north-east will agree with this—is that a huge amount of costs were put on the factory that had nothing to do with what was happening in it. The Aberdeen factory has actually reduced costs dramatically in the past couple of years since the previous reform.

I will come back to the points that Mr Mason has made later in my speech. I want to carry on discussing the burden of the costs that were put on Remploy factories. Mr Macdonald said that, during the negotiations about the Aberdeen factory, Remploy would not put a value on it. I have been told that the factory is worth about £400,000. For a factory of that value, we would expect an annual rent of about £40,000, but no—Remploy was charging Aberdeen Remploy £80,000 a year for the factory.

It is indeed an absolute scandal. The UK minister came here and said that that was the market value, but it is not the value in any of the markets that I know. That was an added burden on that Remploy factory.

I am not an expert on these things and I take at face value what I am told by others. No survey has been done. The member is probably right that the value is lower, but I was giving Remploy the benefit of the doubt. The top tier of Remploy seems to take an awful lot of money to run a business. I think that we need an investigation into the costs of the top tier. I return to Mr Mason’s point, because it is important. We have seen skeleton sales teams at Remploy, and individual Remploy factories have been told that they cannot market their products. How can the factories survive when they cannot market and sell their products? That is what has led to the demise of the factories, and it is shameful that Remploy and the Westminster Government have allowed that to happen. Something needs to be done to stop the double-pronged attack on disabled people. We need to look closely at what is happening in welfare reform—I know that our Welfare Reform Committee is doing that—but we also need to do our best for those folks in sheltered employment and ensure that it survives in this country.

It was not just a case of the Remploy factory becoming much more of a social enterprise—it was the fact that the factory was being turned into a social enterprise hub, so many others were benefiting as well as those folk who were employed by Remploy.

8. To ask the Scottish Government what is being done to boost co-operation between Scottish universities and their international counterparts to enhance research and student opportunities. (S4O-01533)

I thank the cabinet secretary for his answer. Following the announcement that the University of Aberdeen is to be involved in two pioneering research partnerships—with the private sector and with universities in Brazil and the rest of the United Kingdom, as part of the science without borders initiative—can I be assured that the cabinet secretary will continue to ensure that those projects are backed so that we give students the opportunities that are currently available?

I welcome this afternoon’s confirmation from the British Medical Association Scotland that its members will not strike. Will the cabinet secretary confirm that negotiations in the areas of flexibility that he has will continue and that he will do what he can to ensure that the UK Government engages with Scottish unions?

Will the cabinet secretary outline how schemes such as the business rates incentivisation scheme will benefit councils that are successful in attracting new investment into their communities?

Will the member give way?

What guidelines are in place to ensure that Scottish Water deals with regular flooding from sewers such as that in Aberdeen’s merchant quarter?

Will Alex Johnstone give way?

Will the member take an intervention on that point?

Mr Rennie’s amendment refers to a change that according to the “York Aviation report would result in a loss of around £90 million to the Scottish Government”. The reality is that the York Aviation report does not say that at all; it says that there would be an annual loss in tourism expenditure, not in tax receipts. Willie Rennie‘s amendment is flawed from the very beginning.

The Lib Dems are not correct.

Thank you, Presiding Officer. I will stick to five minutes because many colleagues have gone over ground that I was going to cover. Some members are much more expert on some of these issues than I am, including my colleague Brian Adam, who has had a close working relationship with Aberdeen airport over many a year, and Mark McDonald, who was on the Aberdeen airport consultative committee. I had the great pleasure of having Derek Provan, the managing director of Aberdeen airport, on the board of the north east of Scotland transport partnership—NESTRANS—when I was chair. He is a man who is always worth listening to and he always bases everything that he says on fact. Of the York Aviation report, he said: “This report shows, quite simply, that APD is damaging Scotland. It is damaging our economy, our tourism potential and our ability as a nation to bounce back from the recession. It limits our opportunities for growth in the employment market, costing as much as £50 million in the process. At Aberdeen Airport we run a real risk of losing around 200,000 passengers by 2016 through this damaging tax. Each recent increase in APD has had a dramatic impact upon what we, as airports, have achieved and could have achieved without APD. It is imperative that the UK government undertake a detailed and comprehensive review into APD with the utmost urgency, and at the very least freeze APD whilst that is taking place.” Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce said: “We would welcome APD devolution if it enabled a reduction in costs for businesses in the region”— I believe that it can— “Devolution of APD would allow the Scottish Government to work more closely with Scottish airports to devise a Scotland-focused package aimed at boosting international routes, while at the same time securing the continuation of lifeline routes.” Those are the views of some of the people of the north-east of Scotland. I am sure that many members from that region hear about the day-to-day difficulties that folks experience in trying to get to certain places. They are very much of the opinion that we need many more direct routes from Scotland to the rest of the world. More direct flights are absolutely vital to ensure that the powerhouse economy of the north-east of Scotland continues to thrive. I am not arguing here and now for every one of those direct international routes to be from Aberdeen airport—I am quite happy to share with Glasgow and Edinburgh. We find that folk are willing to take the train to leave from Glasgow, Edinburgh or even Prestwick to get to their destination, but if they cannot do it from those airports, they take a flight to a hub airport before flying onward to their destination. My colleague Kenneth Gibson pointed out that we know for a fact that that increases the carbon footprint dramatically. In proposals similar to those that we have seen from the Calman commission, the Silk commission, which reported the other day, said that APD should be devolved to Wales. There is no argument that says that it should not. We know now that in January 2013 Northern Ireland will reduce the duty on long-haul flights from there to zero. I can see a situation in which a number of international carriers will move to Belfast. We will see an increase in the number of short-haul flights from Scotland to Belfast, to take advantage of those new routes. I do not want that to happen. I have no problem whatsoever with the people of the north of Ireland—not at all. I want to see their economy thrive, but I want us to have the economic advantages that we should have. That is why I believe that it is vital that we take control over this tax as soon as we possibly can. I hope that all the other taxes will follow with the full powers of an independent Parliament.

Unfortunately, I would not have the choice of some of the options that Mr Harvie has mentioned. Surely he finds it a little bizarre that, under the current UK system, the APD rates for short-haul travel have increased by 160 per cent but those for long-haul have increased by between 225 per cent and 360 per cent. Mr Harvie has used long-haul flights and sees them as being more environmentally friendly. Why would he allow the UK Government to create the situation that I describe? Why would he not encourage more long-haul flights from Scotland?

Christine Grahame said that we had heard little about the dismantling of the welfare state by the Government south of the border. I think that we should examine the impact of Tory welfare cuts and tax changes on the people of Scotland. George Osborne has said that £10 billion of welfare cuts will be necessary by 2016. That is on top of the £18 billion of cuts that he is already making, with £2.5 billion of cuts in Scotland alone. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that pensioner households in the United Kingdom will be £451 worse off next year. It also says that the average family with children in the UK will be £1,335 worse off this year. Massive changes are being made to housing benefit, council tax and social funds. I am pleased that the Scottish Government is doing something to mitigate some of those cuts but, unfortunately, with a fixed budget, we do not have the ability to tackle them all.

We have not done that at all. Ms Marra is saying the opposite of what Ms Davidson said the other week. Ms Marra obviously wants to raise income tax, while the Tories want to lower it. To be frank, people are paying enough as it is, and Ms Marra is leading folk up the garden path with that nonsensical intervention. We see the dismantling of the welfare state, led by a Tory-Liberal Westminster Government, and we hear from the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament a further dismantling of the welfare state and universal benefits. The Labour Party seems to be in cahoots once again with its Tory-Liberal partners: there has been an attack from every quarter on universal benefits and the welfare state. If Johann Lamont will not listen to what we have to say in the chamber today about keeping universal benefits as they are, perhaps she will listen to some folk outwith the chamber, some of whom would usually be supportive of her. On BBC Radio Scotland on 29 September, Dave Moxham, the deputy general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, said: “We’re a supporter of universal benefits almost per se ... I haven’t heard a clear argument apart from affordability, and there has not been any principled argument, or policy argument, as to why they are bad things.” He called Johann Lamont’s view on the issue an “extreme position”. I agree with Mr Moxham. On Radio Scotland on 28 September, Lindsay Scott of Age Scotland said: “Means testing has been proven time and time again not to do what it’s supposed to do.” She noted that respected institutions such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Pensions Policy Institute and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation have called it “unacceptably complicated, stigmatising and expensive.” In The Times on 1 October, Ros Altmann, the director general of Saga, said: “extending means-testing for pensioners would be a step in the wrong direction. It would be impractical, expensive to administer and a further disincentive for moderate earners to save for old age.” She added that universal benefits “ensure that all those who need money will actually get it”, rather than pride getting in the way of their claiming it. She also said: “the reason we have all these additional benefits is because our state pension is so low for so many people”. She added: “Where to draw the line would be almost impossible to determine.” Those outside figures agree with the policies of the Scottish Government. However—

I am just coming to Lewis Macdonald. It is not just outside figures. On 14 June 2007, Lewis Macdonald said in the chamber: “all the parties in the Parliament are committed to making free personal care work.”—[Official Report, 14 June 2007; c 824.] Does Labour really believe that abandoning such policies when times get tough is the right thing to do?

We are dealing with the devolved situation that we are in. We stood on a manifesto, and today we are discussing a motion that shows our commitment to continue our manifesto commitments. That is all that we can do at present. I wish that the debate was much wider and that we could discuss all benefits, but unfortunately we do not have those powers yet. I hope that the day when we have them will come sooner rather than later, but while we are in the situation that we are in, I will continue to support the manifesto commitments that we made at the 2011 election to continue the social contract that we made with the Scottish people. I support the motion.

Does Mr Harvie agree that one of the ways of stopping some of the cuts that we are seeing from Westminster would be the closure of tax loopholes, including those that let multinational companies avoid taxation, evidence of which we have seen in recent weeks?

3. To ask the Scottish Government what it is doing to improve recycling rates. (S4O-01428)

Can the cabinet secretary expand on what is being done to encourage a cut in food waste and say what is happening across the country to expand food waste collections?

I had the privilege of speaking in last year’s debate on this issue, and I am honoured to be called to speak in today’s debate. In last year’s debate, I said that when I was first elected to Aberdeen City Council an official asked me how many kids I had. When I said that I did not have any children, the official’s response was, “Well, you have 300-odd as of today.” That brings home our corporate parenting responsibilities. Even more daunting is the knowledge that I am now one of the corporate parents of more than 16,000 kids. That is a huge responsibility that none of us should forget. The minister referred to the corporate parent training that will be available shortly to members. I have done similar training and have done GIRFEC training, and I think that it is immensely important that, as members, we know what our responsibilities are. In the debate last year, the then Minister for Children and Young People, Angela Constance, said: “if something is not good enough for our own sons and daughters, it is not good enough for any child or young person growing up in Scotland.”—[Official Report, 27 October 2011; c 2777.] I agree entirely with that statement. We should be aspirational for all the kids for whom we are responsible. I pay tribute to all those folks right across Scotland who work in children’s services. Mr Malik talked about social work services, which are sometimes very much put upon—as many have said, it seems that they cannot do right for doing wrong. As a Parliament, we should recognise the good work that goes on across the country in social services, pay tribute to our social workers and put in place the adequate protection that they require. Over the past year and a half, I have had the great privilege to visit a number of services in my constituency. Just the other week, I volunteered in Barnardo’s Union Street shop with Diane and her team, who do sterling work. Also present was the lady who heads up the Linksfield residential service in Aberdeen, which is a Barnardo’s-run project that I have visited before and hope to visit again. In last year’s debate, I highlighted Aberdeen City Council’s award-winning adoption and fostering service, which also does sterling work. I make no apology for mentioning that service again. Today, I want to concentrate on the impediments to folk becoming kinship carers. While doing research into what general practitioner contracts require GPs to do, I found an interesting anomaly. I received a letter today from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that states: “GPs are obliged within their contractual terms (it is a national contract) to provide certain reports. The most common are medical certificates and death certificates. For others, it falls into two camps”. It is the first camp that we need to take cognisance of. The letter refers to “Collaborative fees where it is recognised that they do work, usually for a Local Authority, and then claim a fee, for example for fostering/adoption.” It continues: “GPs can say no to these requests as it is not obligatory”. That is probably a bit of the red tape that has been talked about so much today. I hope that the minister will follow that up and try to ensure that agreeing to such requests becomes obligatory so that the right information can be sought and we can get on much quicker with fostering and adoption. I want to highlight the difficulties that the new welfare reform regime might throw up when children are being placed. The Welfare Reform Committee visited a housing association last week to talk about the housing benefit pilot that it is undertaking. One woman highlighted the difficulties with the bedroom tax. She is a kinship carer but there is no permanency at the moment. Like many others, she is extremely worried about the impact of the bedroom tax on her ability to be a kinship carer. It will be fine as long as the legal process is on-going, but when it is finished, she might be penalised for having a so-called extra bedroom, even if she has a child living with her. I hope that we can lobby the Westminster Government very hard to take account of those silly situations. Members have talked about early intervention and the speed of the adoption process, but I do not have the time to go over those issues. We must secure the future of the children involved because they are Scotland’s future.

8. To ask the Scottish Government what obligations Scottish Water has to deal with persistent flooding from its sewerage network. (S4O-01423)

I, too, pass on my condolences to Richard Ackroyd’s family and those at Scottish Water. Scottish Water has offered no short-term solution to a persistent issue that is having a major effect on businesses in Aberdeen’s merchant quarter. Does the cabinet secretary agree that that is not good enough and that Scottish Water must act to resolve the situation?

I thank all the folks who gave evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee and I thank the members of that committee and the clerking team. One of the most pleasurable aspects of dealing with the bill was that some of us took a trip to Shetland and gained a huge amount of knowledge in the short time that we were there. I am really glad that the Government has recognised the plight of Shetland Islands Council and has moved to try to alleviate some of its difficulties. That is to be applauded and shows that the Government has listened to the Shetland case. The Government has listened on a number of other issues, too. As George Adam does, I want to see empty properties being brought back into use. The target is 5,500 properties across Scotland, and I hope that that is achieved. The fact that the Government has listened is shown by the fact that it has said that it will introduce the fresh start scheme. That scheme will operate similarly to the scheme that was introduced earlier in the year in Northern Ireland; it will provide 50 per cent relief for 12 months for properties that are brought back into use after being empty for a year. The Federation of Small Businesses said: “A rates discount for properties brought back into use is a great idea that we hope can be made to deliver for Scottish town centres and high streets ... The details of the scheme will be crucial to its success and we hope that all sorts of small enterprises can benefit.” I am sure that the minister will continue his discussions with the FSB and others to ensure that the fresh start scheme is a success. We did not hear much—I mean in particular from the Con-Dem partners—today about the situation in England and Wales. The scheme that operates there is somewhat different, and I have to say that it is not as good as what is proposed in Scotland. Robert Neill, who was a junior minister at the Department of Communities and Local Government, has said that the coalition has “no immediate plans to reverse” the 2008 reforms—reforms that I believe are not as good as the bill that we are debating today. If we look around our constituencies and nearby, we see that there are, without doubt, property owners who deliberately keep their properties empty for whatever reason. They are being subsidised to do that by not having to pay the rates that they should be paying. I will give an example. In my old council ward of Northfield in Aberdeen, which is in Brian Adam’s constituency of Aberdeen Donside, there is a set of shops that have been empty for 13 years. It is not as though offers have not been made for them; for example, there was a suggestion that they could be taken over for community use, but that was rejected by the owners, for whatever reason. Although a lot has been said about the doom and gloom in the economy, in many parts of the country—including my patch—where the recession has not hit as hard as it has hit elsewhere, we have property owners who are deliberately keeping properties empty. That has to be resolved. As I said at the start of my speech, the Government has listened. It has listened in the case of Shetland Islands Council and it has listened to small businesses and has come up with the fresh start scheme. I hope that the Government will continue to listen to those who are affected—I see the minister nodding—and that we will see 5,500 empty properties being brought back into use sooner rather than later.

7. To ask the Scottish Government what analysis it carries out of literacy initiatives such as the reading bus in Aberdeen. (S4O-01372)

Research on the reading bus’s Apardion project shows evidence of cross-curricular engagement, including elements of history, heritage, culture and use of information technology in learning, as well as benefits for reading and writing. Will the minister look at that analysis and consider whether that good practice could be extended elsewhere?

Can the minister outline any discussions that he has had with Aberdeen City Council with regard to its responsibilities for the construction of the third Don crossing, which would complete the holy trinity of vital roads projects to keep Aberdeen moving?

I know that the minister has a good working relationship with energy companies. What discussions has the Government had with the private sector regarding the energy skills academy? What input will there be from energy firms?

Does the First Minister agree that Labour’s cuts commission, for which everything is on the table, could lead to a massive decrease in bobbies on the beat and other police staff, which could mean that our crime levels, which are at a 37-year low, rise again?

The member talks about duplication. I would like her to explain which of those groups and their help to get folk into employment she would abolish. We also heard a proposal for duplication earlier from Mr Macintosh around the work programme. Does the member agree with his view?

Ms McTaggart was present for part of a visit that I took part in to the Clyde Gateway the other week. New companies, including Glacier Energy Services, have gone into the east end of Glasgow with support from the public and private sectors. Is that not to be welcomed and does it not show that investment by the Government is bringing new jobs and investment to the east end?

As a non-driver and regular bus user, I am in the same position as Mr Biagi. Unfortunately, most of my bus journeys are in Aberdeen and, instead of the £1.40 fare that Edinburgh has, I have to fork out £2.40 for a journey, which is disgraceful. However, that is a debate for another day. I will not go on a rant about First Aberdeen. I attended the unveiling of Aberdeen’s new hybrid buses in July with the minister. I do not often agree with the city’s current lord provost, George Adam, but he said that day: “I’m very excited about the development of a greener, smarter bus network in Aberdeen. The introduction of the low-emission buses constitutes a welcome contribution to the environment in which we all live and breathe.” The buses are spectacular in other ways, too, because there is free wi-fi on many of them. What more do some folk need to attract them into getting on the bus than being able to do their work rather than sit in the car doing nothing? The most exciting thing for me about what is happening in Aberdeen is not the hybrid buses—although I hope that there will be more of them—but the Aberdeen hydrogen project. I thank Jan Falconer of Aberdeen City Council for providing me with a wee briefing about that for today. As part of the project, Aberdeen City Council is supporting two strategic Europe hydrogen transport projects. They represent the first major element of the Aberdeen hydrogen project and aim to introduce hydrogen buses to the north-east of Scotland. The buses will be fuelled using locally generated renewable hydrogen, and the production facilities that will be needed to generate the hydrogen will be created. There will also be additional hydrogen for other uses, which is the second element of the project. The project has been made possible by some significant funding from various sources. The First Minister announced £3.3 million for the project—£1.65 million is from the Scottish Government and £1.65 million is from Scottish Enterprise. The project has also secured a large amount of European money and there is, of course, interest from various private companies. It has often been very difficult for Aberdeen and the north-east, which were seen as being particularly rich, to access European funding in any shape or form. I therefore pay tribute to Yasa Ratnayeke of Aberdeen City Council, who has secured £9.2 million of European Union money for the project. His effort should be praised by the Parliament as well as by Aberdonians. Phase 1 of the project is the hydrogen buses and the fuelling station. As I have said, it consists of two European projects: High VLOCity and HyTransit. Ten hydrogen fuel cell buses will be deployed. First will operate four—I hope at a lower cost to the passenger than is currently the case for First in Aberdeen—and Stagecoach will operate the remaining six. This is the first hydrogen bus deployment in Scotland and it is of international significance, as Aberdeen will have the largest hydrogen bus fleet of any European city. The buses will be refuelled at Scotland’s first large hydrogen refuelling station, which will also be able to refuel passenger vehicles, as and when they become available. The buses will operate on routes into central Aberdeen, which guarantees a high profile for the project. New hydrogen-compatible maintenance bays will be prepared to allow maintenance of the vehicles by local technicians supported by international experts. That is phase 1 of the project. I am sure that phase 2 will result in greater debate in the future, but I think that phase 1 is equally exciting, which is why I am so pleased that the Government has backed the project in the way that it has. If a significant regular demand for hydrogen emerges, it will justify the deployment of a hydrogen generation infrastructure on a scale that makes it practical for large energy companies to invest. As I said, many companies are already looking at the scheme and at the benefits that could arise in the future. I will not go into the technologies that we are talking about, because I am not so technical in that regard. However, when somebody tells me that we can become a world leader and that the beginnings of our doing so lie in this project, if it grows in the way that it could, I will certainly grasp on to that, particularly when Aberdeen—that place that I do not mention very often—could be that world leader.

I understand the impact that high fuel prices are having on Mr Findlay’s constituents, as they are on my constituents. Does he support the SNP in its call for a fuel duty regulator to protect his constituents and mine?

I thank all the organisations and individuals who have supplied us with information and briefings for today’s debate. I apologise in advance if I do not mention all the organisations during my speech—I am sure that colleagues will mention those organisations that have made submissions. I thank them very much indeed. The headlines in today’s Daily Record read “Heartless Tests Leave Disabled Penniless” and “The Atos Scandal”. Although I am no cheerleader for Atos, the reality is that its contract has been laid down by the Department for Work and Pensions. It is Westminster that is to blame for the situation and, although Atos is doing its bidding, it is doing so under the contract that has been written by the DWP in London. I am sure that work capability assessments have featured in the postbag of every single member of late. I am sure that many members will have had people coming to their surgeries with their tales of woe. From my own perspective, some of the stories that I have heard are absolutely heart wrenching—it is an absolute disgrace. Unfortunately, some folk are unwilling to have their individual cases told in Parliament, because there is a fear about going on the record. However, last week in this Parliament, at the Welfare Reform Committee meeting, three very brave individuals gave evidence. I am sure that their evidence will feature in later speeches. The Crisis report “Single homeless people’s experience of the Work Capability Assessments” notes that almost a quarter of single homeless people have to wait more than six weeks to receive the outcome of their assessment. Given that the overall assessment process can be daunting, frightening and incredibly stressful for claimants with mental health issues, it is imperative that the time between the assessment and communication with the claimant is kept to a minimum. I agree with Crisis in that regard. For many, work capability assessments are a frightening experience. In my opinion, assessments should be as easy and as flexible as possible in order to take into account fluctuating conditions and extenuating circumstances, but they most certainly are not like that at present. It is most concerning that service providers and advice agencies are being significantly affected due to the nature of the assessment, with citizens advice bureaux in Scotland dealing with almost 20,000 new employment and support allowance issues in 2010-11. The Consultation and Advocacy Promotion Service individual independent advocacy service has reported an increase of more than 75 per cent in the number of cases relating to ESA from October 2010 to March 2011. It is clear from those statistics that the work capability assessment process needs to be made clearer and easier for those completing the assessment. That trend is echoed in many other agencies. We know that 76 per cent of claimants appealed the outcome of their WCA and more than 50 per cent of those people have been successful and given a higher score on appeal. Those are concerning statistics. They show that few claimants trust the decision made by their assessor, and the fact that more than half are successful in an appeal shows that the decisions were incorrect. Appealing a decision, in what can be a stressful assessment for many with mental health conditions, can lead to further health conditions caused by stress, which can trigger depression and other fluctuating conditions. The decisions of healthcare professionals at an assessment need to be trustworthy and free from error to result in fewer appeals and an easier process. The questions and point system of the assessment need to become relevant and fit for purpose when dealing with all conditions, and healthcare professionals should be given some discretion when discussing work capability with claimants. There are significant issues around certain illnesses. For example, the treatment of claimants with blood-borne viruses is often misunderstood. Many of those claimants feel that the healthcare professional who is assessing them has no understanding of blood-borne viruses, the treatment for them and the side effects of that treatment. Terrence Higgins Trust has offered the Department for Work and Pensions free training on blood-borne viruses, which it has not taken up. That is a disgrace. Today, I received a letter from the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland, which says: “With specific reference to people living with Hepatitis C, we would argue that patients undergoing eradication therapy for Hepatitis C should be viewed in a similar capacity to patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Hepatitis C can be lengthy and involve debilitating side effects. Indeed patients with Hepatitis C who are in employment are often reluctant to embark on an extensive course of eradication treatment as this might necessitate being off work for a long period as treatment can be arduous and not without side effects. The same can be true of HIV positive patients who have developed complications from their disease.” RCGP Scotland argues that those folk are in the same position as those “undergoing cancer therapy” and I agree with that. The Atos contract needs to be looked at very carefully. A new contract with a value of £206,703,507 has been awarded to undertake assessments for personal independence payments for Scotland and north England. I have received a copy of the tender for that, which was redacted. I cannot go into any depth on it. The redaction was not done particularly well, and I managed to access information that I probably should not have accessed. I will reveal that at a later date. Finally, the DWP report in today’s Daily Record says that “HALF of people stripped of disability benefits after being ruled ‘fit for work’ by Atos were left unemployed and without income”; that “55 per cent of people who lost benefits ... had failed to find work”; and that only 15 per cent are in jobs and 35 per cent are on other benefits. The paper also says: “Atos have assessed patients with terminal illnesses as ‘fit for work’. And thousands of victims of genuine, chronic conditions have complained of being humiliated by the company’s tests.” That is absolutely disgraceful. The only way to deal with the matter is by the Parliament taking full control of welfare. I hope that that will happen sooner rather than later so that folk do not have to put up with those situations any longer.

In the tender documents, it says that Atos employees should have seven and a half days’ training before they start doing assessments. Does the minister agree that seven and a half days’ training is certainly not enough to allow those people to deal with some of the complex cases that they face day to day?

7. To ask the Scottish Government, in the light of the possible impact on its anti-poverty strategy, what discussions it has had with the United Kingdom Government regarding its contract with Atos for carrying out work capability assessments. (S4O-01282)

Does the cabinet secretary agree that the £206,703,507 that the Atos contract to administer assessments for personal independence payments in Scotland, northern England and the Isle of Man costs the taxpayer, could be better spent paying for 55,332 vulnerable people’s disability living allowance for a year—an average weekly payment of £71.84—and that that flawed Department for Work and Pensions contract—

—is a complete waste of money?

The cabinet secretary has outlined new funding for youth employment, which I am sure will be welcomed by young people and SMEs in my constituency and across the country. What will all that funding deliver? What is the cumulative spending on providing opportunities for our young people?

Ms Baillie must recognise that there are more nurses and midwives now than there were in nine out of 10 years when Labour was in government. Is that a fact, Ms Baillie?

I welcome Mr Neil to his new role and I am sure that he will do exceptionally well. I mean that most sincerely, unlike some other members who have said the same thing. I turn first to Jackson Carlaw, who obviously does not want us to discuss certain things today. I find it quite ironic that he called me “arrogant, smug and belligerent”, as he is a master of all three traits in the chamber on a daily basis. He does not want us to talk about facts or about what is happening elsewhere in the UK at the moment. I want to provide some facts. As the minister rightly pointed out, we are about to see a record spend of £11.6 billion in Scotland’s national health service. Scotland has more qualified nurses and midwives per 1,000 members of the population than anywhere else in the UK—7.9, compared with 5.9 in England and 7.2 in Wales. Overall, there was an increase in the NHS workforce of 3,331.4 whole-time equivalents between September 2006 and June 2012, which amounts to a head count of 3,475.

I know that similar situations occur quite often—we hear about that in our mail bags—but they are not the norm in hospitals in this country. We would all like to spend even more on our national health service, but the only way we will be able to do that is if we control our own affairs. At the moment, we are constricted by a fixed budget. There may be a real decline in our NHS because of the effects of what is happening down south—I refer to a 227-page report that has just been published in England by the clinical advisory group for prescribed services. Dr Eoin Clarke, founder of the Labour think tank Labour Left, has defended Labour’s introduction of commissioning at local level, based on the argument that Labour would not have allowed monopolies to happen at a national scale. Dr Clarke said in his blog “The Green Benches” that the report “paves the way for centralised and accelerated sell off of specialist services within the NHS at a national level”. He adds: “If these services (or ‘products’ as they refer to them on page 6) are to go ahead and be sold off it would represent the biggest brain drain in the history of the NHS.”

I will tell the member exactly what it has got to do with the—

The report and its consequences will inevitably lead to cuts south of the border, which means that the Barnett consequentials of health will be cut to this Parliament. That is a fact.

I want to see the health service protected. We are at great risk from what is happening elsewhere. The NHS is safe in this Government’s hands, but let us keep an eye on what—

In light of cases such as that relating to the Aberdeen western peripheral route, in the north-east, which has been subject to huge delays as a result of legal challenges, how can the planning process be streamlined further to ensure that decisions on key strategic infrastructure projects can be progressed more efficiently?

I echo the many kind words that have been said about Charles Hendry. As an Aberdeen MSP I have come across Mr Hendry and I know how highly he is regarded in the oil and gas industry. It is a great pity that when we find a good energy minister—and they have been few and far between—they disappear quickly in the revolving door that seems to be in place for energy ministers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change. I thank the organisations that have taken the trouble to provide MSPs with briefings. I am happy that there will be a statutory role for the Scottish ministers in the process, and that the Scottish Government will be a partner rather than a consultee. That is a great move, although I would rather that we had full control of energy in this Parliament. It is extremely important to draw attention to WWF Scotland’s words about nuclear energy in its parliamentary briefing and I make no apology for reading out that section of the document. It says: “WWF believes the Energy Bill risks distorting the investment environment towards nuclear at the expense of renewables. Recent developments in the UK’s nuclear market suggests that it is extremely unlikely that much nuclear capacity will be built in the UK over the next 20 years. This is exemplified by the recent withdrawal by E.ON and RWE from the UK’s Horizon Joint Venture and the doubling of construction costs of building reactors in France and Finland, both of which are between 4 and 5 years behind schedule. The effect of the current package of reforms could be an energy bill that falls short of providing the framework for renewables and yet nuclear still doesn't move forward due to spiralling costs - a lose-lose situation.” I agree with WWF Scotland. Beyond its words, in other parts of the world we have seen a move away from nuclear technology. We are seeing it in Japan and Germany. I hope, although I may hope in vain, that the UK Government does not gamble with nuclear at the expense of the renewables industries that we want to be developed—we can be at the forefront of those industries.

I have not seen that submission. EDF must have missed me out when it circulated it—perhaps because it is aware of my views, I do not know. I disagree with Mr Fraser. I think that it will become even more difficult for anyone to enter the nuclear market unless there is that huge degree of subsidy, which I hope does not continue. I believe that we should be at the forefront of renewables and should be forgetting technologies such as nuclear power. Fuel poverty is a major issue in my constituency, as it is in the constituencies of others. We should be minimising the costs of energy to consumers, and I hope that we can achieve that in the reform that is going ahead. I also agree with the speakers who have talked about the transmission charging regime, because it needs to be changed if our island communities are to take full advantage of their position. Ms Grant mentioned the Shetland wind farm development. During a recent visit that was undertaken by the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, I saw the site of that development, and I hope that it can go ahead and that there will be reasonable transmission charging, so that Shetland can benefit to the great degree that it should. We have, in Fergus Ewing, a minister who will have the ability to bring those matters forward in discussions with the Westminster Government. I know that he is no patsy and that he will ensure that Scotland’s best interests are at the heart of the discussions that he will have on electricity market reform. I support the motion and the amendment.

Before being elected to the Parliament, I had the privilege of serving on the board of Aberdeen business improvement district. Are business improvement districts making a difference in helping to revive town centres?

It may have escaped some folks’ notice, but I am an Aberdonian born and bred. I am proud of the granite city and of the vision that led to the construction of Union Bridge and Union Street and which led to Aberdeen having a vibrant heart that was fit for that era. James Matthews, a great architect who was an apprentice of the legendary Archibald Simpson, was one of the men who were at the forefront of designing great buildings and places, such as Aberdeen grammar school, the Tivoli theatre and the music hall. Matthews, who became lord provost of the city, also designed Union Terrace. I understand that his great ambition was to cover over the railway line that runs near that great city thoroughfare. Let us move on from Matthews’ great 19th century vision to today’s Aberdeen: an Aberdeen that could see the covering over of the railway and road that run through the Denburn; an Aberdeen that could see the amount of green space in its city centre expanded greatly and made more accessible than it currently is; and an Aberdeen with an eye to the future. Like many big schemes, the city garden project is not without controversy. It would be fair to say that the proposed city centre development polarised Aberdonians’ views. That polarisation was exacerbated by the many myths that were peddled about the scheme and who was likely to profit from it. Let us be honest, because as far as I am concerned the only folk who were going to benefit were Aberdonians. However, because of that polarisation I, as a councillor at the time, put it to the council that a referendum should be held on the issue to get the true views of Aberdonians so that the people who make the decisions could take the decisions knowing full well what the views of the majority of Aberdonians were. That referendum took place and 45,301 people voted for the city garden project and 41,175 voted for the retention of Union Terrace gardens, which meant a majority of 4,126 for the former. We have seen in recent times that referendum result being ignored by the Labour-led administration in Aberdeen. I believe that that is completely and utterly anti-democratic and goes against the wishes of the Aberdonians who took the time to vote in the referendum. Since then, we have seen a situation wherein the Labour Party does not know where it is going in dealing with Aberdeen. Some of its members say that the referendum result should not stand, because it was not a real referendum. I argue that the Labour Party legitimised the referendum by coming out as a campaigning organisation in the run-up to the vote.

That is a strange intervention indeed, because there were supporters and opposers of the city garden project who were in favour of the referendum and happy about the way that it was conducted until the result was announced. Ms Grant slurs Crawford Langley, the independent officer who dealt with the referendum. I have great respect for that man, who has conducted numerous elections in his career.

I will move on, because I will come to Mr Macdonald later on in my speech. What are Labour’s plans now? It has rejected tax increment finance, which would probably have had great benefit for Aberdeen and, after the loan had been paid off, would likely have left the city with £36 million to invest in further infrastructure. What is the transformational project that Labour wants to undertake? It has changed day by day. Labour recently came out in favour of the pedestrianisation of Union Street but, the day after, it was not quite sure about that—I am sure that we will hear more about that later. To do some of the things that the Labour group has said, other things need to be put in place. Those include improvements to the road network, such as the proposals for the Berryden corridor, the third Don crossing and the Haudagain roundabout, all of which Labour rejected. What are Labour’s great plans for the city? Today, the council leader said that he had written to the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities saying that he wanted her to back and pay for a rail link to the airport. There are no strategic plans for that, but he expects the cabinet secretary to put her hand in her pocket and do it. That is nonsense. I imagine that, tomorrow, he will come out in favour of the eastern peripheral route. Who is in charge of Aberdeen City Council? Is it Barney Crockett, the president of the presidium; Willie Young, the general secretary; or Tsarina Marie Boulton—or is there a Rasputin in the background? In reality, the council group is unhappy at the interference from certain quarters. Gordon Graham wrote to Willie Young in an e-mail on 7 March: “I write to express my concern that Lewis McDonald MSP is stating on radio today that if Labour are elected at the local council elections then this project will not go ahead. This is not the decision made at a group meeting last night and I am extremely concerned that it appears as if someone has sanctioned Lewis to speak on our behalf. I also reserve the right to refute what Lewis is saying and say that we have reservations over the funding however no decision has been made by the Labour Group.” It seems as though there is Rasputin-like interference from outside. I want to know what the future is for Aberdeen city centre. I hope that it is a bright future with real vision. Let democracy reign, let the council listen to the people and let us go ahead with the city garden project.

The accusation of being anti-development is probably the right one: anti-third Don crossing; anti-Haudagain; anti-stadium; anti-city garden project. What is Labour for in Aberdeen?

Will the minister give way?

The minister is a proud man from Renfrew. If a local Renfrew person offered £50 million of investment for a project in his town that was backed by the public, does he believe that Renfrewshire Council should bite their hands off to take that money?

I thank all those who gave evidence—either written or oral—to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, which helped us in our deliberations. I also thank the committee’s clerking team, which, as usual, was excellent in the tasks that it had to deal with. It is fair to say that on a number of issues the committee was unanimous and that on other issues there was some controversy. I am sure that other members will bring some of that controversy into play during the debate. I should perhaps begin with the non-controversial part of the bill—the housing support grant element. A cross-party group from the committee had the pleasure of visiting Shetland. As usual, the population of Shetland provided us with a warm welcome. Shetlanders are extremely canny people and they lobbied hard for the retention of the grant. However, it has to be recognised that Shetland Islands Council is the last council to be in receipt of that grant and the circumstances of the borrowing that it has made are somewhat strange. As the minister pointed out, unlike most other authorities it has not borrowed money from the public works loan board—instead, it has borrowed money from its own harbour fund. Canny as the Shetlanders are, the harbour fund has been charging them interest and, in some regard, the housing support grant has been helping to pay that interest to increase the harbour fund. The committee unanimously agreed that that could not go on and recognised that the £15 million transitional fund that was asked for was not really a goer either. However, hats off to the Shetlanders for their lobbying efforts. In moving from the area of complete agreement to the areas with some controversial aspects, I will deal with the housing element first. In terms of what the minister has just said, the committee would welcome the £200 fine for not registering an empty property going up to £500—the committee would see that as going in the right direction. The committee will look at that again at stage 2 but, quite frankly, the committee felt that a £200 fine for not registering was not that much. The committee welcomes the fact that there is local input to setting rates. Coming from a local government background, I always welcome the flexibility of allowing our local councils to do such things. There was a huge debate about whether those moneys should be ring-fenced to be put back into housing. Again, coming from a local government background, I am not really in favour of ring fencing, but the committee fully endorsed the proposal to get the accounts after implementation to show where the money has been spent. The longest part of my speech will probably be on the non-domestic rates proposals, because that is the area in which there was some disagreement in the committee. We certainly welcome the fact that industrial and listed buildings will be exempt from the plan. I welcome the minister’s comment that there might be a look at a relief element if a property is filled, because that was a topic of discussion in the committee. A number of organisations that appeared before the committee argued that the proposal was a bad thing, but no one likes new taxes—let us be honest about that. If it is possible to try to stop a tax, people will do everything that they can to do so. There were also elements of discussion in the debates that were held at committee about different things happening in different areas of the country. It would be beneficial if the minister could have a look at that. The minister rightly pointed out that the power is an enabling power only, that there are no plans at the moment to introduce it, and that if there were such plans, the matter would come back to the committee for a further look-see during consideration of the instrument that would need to be passed. That is one reason that the minister has given for there being no business and regulatory impact assessment, or BRIA. There was some debate about whether a BRIA should have taken place beforehand, and I am sure that other members will pick up on that point as the debate progresses. There was a robust debate on that part of the bill dealing with the cost to the public sector if this measure is implemented. The minister has stated that the costs to the public sector will be £1.8 million. According to the Scottish Property Federation it may be up to £3.6 million. However, costs of £1.8 million or £3.6 million should be compared to the complete rates bill of £2.3 billion or so—we need to take account of that. I have not referred to many of the other elements of the bill, but the Local Government and Regeneration Committee will discuss a number of those elements during its stage 2 scrutiny. I am pleased that the minister continues to consult stakeholders because some members of the committee were critical of a lack of consultation. I am pleased that he has said he will look at the fine for non-registration of an empty property as that was a major element in discussion. I hope that, when amendments are lodged, he will look at some form of relief for filling properties. I look forward to the debate in committee at stage 2, which I am sure will be as robust as that which we had during stage 1. I look at colleagues as I say that. I enjoy Local Government and Regeneration Committee meetings because people are frank, but we all come out still speaking to one another—99 per cent of the time, at least. I hope that we can do exactly the same thing at stage 2.

Will Ms Boyack give way?

Will Ms Boyack give way?

Will Ms Mitchell give way?

Mr MacDonald has highlighted the fact that some large business owners have stymied growth in some regards. Does he agree with the FSB’s view on rates relief? It has said that only 2 per cent of its members have benefited from small business rates relief and that only 19 per cent believe that it had a positive effect on small businesses. I wonder how many of the owners of large businesses would think that it had a positive effect for them. It would probably be the ones who are keeping property empty in Mr MacDonald’s constituency.

Will the member take an intervention?

I remarked earlier about small businesses and the FSB. Only 2 per cent of FSB members said that they benefited from empty property relief and only 19 per cent of its members believed that the relief had a positive effect on small businesses. Small business—certainly in my area, and probably in Glasgow, too—does not see a huge benefit from the relief. What it sees is a huge benefit going to the bigger boys.

The Minister for Transport and Housing clearly stated to the committee: “The issues will take time to work through. If it was clear that a sincere effort had been made to sell or let a property, for example, we would not want to punish somebody for a genuine attempt to bring an empty home into productive use.”—[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 30 May 2012; c 1077.]

Nothing in the bill at the moment would bring the power into action. An enabling power is an enabling power. If the Government chooses to use the power later, that will have to come back to a committee, as I said in my speech.

Will the member give way?

Mr Don has summed up very well the situation in which it is beneficial for a landlord to wait. I represent the centre of Aberdeen, where there are a large number of empty properties although there is a lot of demand. Those properties are not being offered at rents that people can afford, and there is an advantage for many landlords in keeping their properties empty until high rents are attainable again. That is why I, in searching for an office, and many others in my constituency find it very difficult to get affordable property although there are lots of empty properties about.

It was an extremely canny move on the part of Shetland Islands Council, and I congratulate the council on its canniness in that regard. Previous Westminster Governments supposedly said that they would eventually pay off the debt. Unfortunately, it seems that Shetland got no written guarantee to that effect. It appears that we have yet another scenario in which Westminster has not lived up to its obligations.

Although it was unable to do so, the Local Government and Regeneration Committee wanted to talk to the folk who are involved in business improvement districts. Will the minister talk to those folk, as I have done in my area of Aberdeen? They have a lot to give. As Hanzala Malik said, those districts often contain a large amount of small businesses, and that would give them a say in the proposals.

Will the member give way?

I do not disagree with anything that Mr Findlay has said. I live in the 35th poorest data zone in Scotland, which is in Aberdeen—some folk do not believe that. Does Mr Findlay not agree that, in order to tackle many of the issues that he has raised, including taxation of fuel companies and various other things, we need the levers of power here? To deal with the things that he wants to see righted and which I want to put to rights as well, we need those powers. We could do better. Why is he quite happy for Westminster Tory Governments to control the reins of power on those important issues?

Will Mr Fraser give way?

If so much can be done to change European procurement rules, perhaps Mr Fraser can tell us what the Tory-Liberal Government in London has been saying at the top table to try to change those rules.

2. To ask the Scottish Government whether Aberdeen City Council has submitted any new tax increment financing applications since rejecting the business plan incorporating the city garden project. (S4T-00001)

The Labour-led administration has ignored the wishes of the majority of people who voted in a referendum for transformational change in the city. Does the cabinet secretary believe that the new TIF proposal will create transformational change?

As the cabinet secretary said, the council has rejected £55 million of private investment. Does he agree that its proposals equate to the inverse Midas touch and will likely stymie future investment in the city from the private sector?

As we are talking about radicalism, would not it be a bit radical for the Labour Party to spell out what extra powers it wants for this Parliament, or is it happy for the Tory-Liberal coalition to decimate the country?

Ms Davidson mentioned soft-shoe shuffles. Perhaps she should tell members that there has been a 30 per cent reduction in capital budgets and that cuts to colleges in England are of up to one third of budgets.

Will the member give way?

I thank Mr Park for giving way. I support the living wage as well, but there are difficulties in implementing the living wage in certain procurement contracts because of European legislation. The Dirk Rüffert v Land Niedersachsen case is a prime example of the difficulties. Does Mr Park agree with me that the best way of overcoming those difficulties would be if Scotland had a seat at the top table in Europe and could argue such points there?

1. To ask the Scottish Government when it last met Creative Scotland to discuss its work in Aberdeen. (S4O-01189)

Has Creative Scotland been in discussion with partners, including Aberdeen City Council, about the proposed city garden project? Has the Labour-led Administration indicated to Creative Scotland what its funding plans are to refurbish Aberdeen art gallery if it rejects the tax incremental financing bid?

I will be as brief as I possibly can. I draw members’ attention to subsection (1) and subsection (3)(b) of the proposed new section in Mr Smith’s amendment. I do not know whether he did this inadvertently, but if those two subsections are put together the effect is to require ministers to prepare a statement that explains the policy objectives of all the regulations that they will ever make under the act, and to lay that statement before the first regulations are laid. That seems to me to be rather illogical, to say the least. It also makes it very difficult because, as we are all aware, ministers are still unaware of Westminster’s intentions on some of those issues. I ask Mr Smith to say when he sums up whether that was done inadvertently, or whether it was just lack of common sense.

I, too, start by thanking all the stakeholders who gave evidence to the Welfare Reform Committee. Beyond them, I thank all the organisations and individuals in Aberdeen who have contacted me on the issue. I have had many meetings to discuss aspects of the impact of the bill. Today, again, we seem to be concentrating on process rather than on people. Siobhan McMahon’s speech showed clearly that some folk are more interested in that process than in the people. I say to her that, if we had gone with the affirmative procedure, as was suggested, it might have led to unnecessary delays. We should be clear that there is a huge difference between the use of the negative procedure and the use of the affirmative procedure in being able to implement things at an early date. I do not believe that any organisation thought about the process to any huge degree until they were asked leading questions by certain members of the committee. I see Mr Johnstone nodding in agreement, and I am about to turn to him and the reforms that are being put in place by the Conservative and Liberal coalition. We are about to see £2.5 billion ripped out of Scotland, and George Osborne has said that there will be another £10 billion of welfare cuts before 2016. We might hope that the Liberal Democrats will do something to try to stop that, but I sincerely doubt that they will achieve it. However, it is good to see Mr Rennie in his place here today. He failed to appear at the stage 1 debate, instead choosing to appear on television. I am pleased to see that he is in the chamber to listen to the debate this afternoon. I turn to the subject of housing. With the housing benefit changes, some 95,000 social tenants in Scotland will be affected by the legislation. As my colleague Margaret Burgess rightly pointed out, many of those people are in work but require that benefit because they are not paid enough by their employers. It is far too easy for Tories to say that an attack is being made on workshy folk. Unfortunately, folk who are in work are also being affected, as are folk who cannot work. Let us be honest and tell people out there that the reality is that many folk who are affected by the changes have jobs.

I do not have time; I need to plough on. On the day when the better together campaign was launched, Cameron made a speech that has gone largely unnoticed. I was really scared by the attack on housing benefit for young people and by the fact that under-25s might not qualify for that benefit in the future. That would undermine the Scottish Government’s ability to reduce homelessness, on which we have done well of late. What can I say? How does Mr Cameron know the circumstances of each person who is under 25? Does he expect an abused child to stay at home with the parents who abused them until they are over 25? Does he expect kids who have been in care homes to get no housing support whatever? Is that right? Does that really show that we are better together? Maybe we should be completely and utterly honest. The reality is that there is not much disagreement between Labour and SNP members. However, what we could do with the powers of an independent Parliament is so much greater that we would be talking not about mitigation but about having a fair welfare state.

I rise to my feet as the longest-serving member of Grampian police board. I do not recognise the picture of local accountability in the operation of police boards that is being painted by Labour and Tory members. The reality is that a few members from each local authority serve on the board. They do not representative their councils on that board—they represent the board. The reality of the bill is that there will be more local accountability than there has ever been. Members of the Opposition should have spoken to members of police boards before they made their speeches today.

Mr Macdonald again paints the wrong picture. We were accountable, but we were not accountable to the local authority, and thus we were not accountable to the electorate of a local authority. Mr Macdonald needs to get that absolutely right, because all councillors and their constituents will now have a say in that, which they did not have before. He must admit that fact.

Will the member give way?

Will the member give way on that point?

If a son of Dundee offered £50 million for a project that was backed by the majority of Dundonians, what does the member think Dundee City Council’s reaction would be?

I too congratulate Rob Gibson on bringing this debate to the Parliament. I have an admission—sadly, I had not read very much of Cunninghame Graham’s work until the motion was lodged. However, I was aware of many of his sayings. One of the most satirical was about Henry Campbell-Bannerman, about whom Cunninghame Graham said: “He has all the qualifications for a great Liberal Prime Minister. He wears spats and he has a beautiful set of false teeth.” That is absolutely amazingly funny. G K Chesterton proclaimed Cunninghame Graham to be “the Prince of Preface Writers” and famously declared in his autobiography that although Cunninghame Graham would never be allowed to be Prime Minister, he instead “achieved the adventure of being Cunninghame Graham”, which George Bernard Shaw described as “an achievement so fantastic that it would never be believed in a romance”. That sums up the man. I also have to admit that I missed a recent STV documentary about Cunninghame Graham, but it seems to have sparked quite a lot of debate on the internet and elsewhere. Some of that debate was on the Greenock Morton fans website. One does not normally expect to find such debates on football supporters’ websites—I have certainly never seen one on the Dons website, it has to be said. Something that has always amazed me about Cunninghame Graham is the number of artists, including Epstein, who either painted or sculpted him. There is a famous bust by Epstein in Aberdeen art gallery, which is a quite fantastic piece of work. Other members have already said quite enough about all the things that Cunninghame Graham stood for and what he did in Parliament. However, I found one piece of writing—which uses a word that we no longer use to describe black people, so I will not mention that word when I quote from it—that is a complete and utter attack on poverty, religious fundamentalism, racism, imperialism and the grab for land and resources. He wrote: “The Malays, the Malagasy, Japanese, Chinese, Red Indians as Sioux, Comanches, Navajos, Apaches with Zapatecas, Esquimaux, and in the south are”— the n-word that I am not going to say”— “though their hair is straight, Turks, Persians, Levantines, Egyptians, Moors, and generally all those of almost any race whose skins are darker than our own, and whose ideas of faith, of matrimony, banking, and therapeutics differ from those held by the dwellers of Primrose Hill, cannot escape. Men of the Latin races, though not born free, can purchase freedom with a price, that is, if they conform to our ideas, are rich and wash, ride bicycles, and gamble on the Stock Exchange. If they are poor then woe betide them, let them paint their faces white with all the ceruse which ever Venice furnished, to the black favour shall they come … At times a thinking man knows scarcely what to think, and sometimes doubts whether God is the God we took him for and if he is a fitting Deity for us to worship, and if we had not better once for all, get us a God of our own race and fitted for our own ways.” As I said, that piece of writing is an attack on poverty, religious fundamentalism, imperialism, racism and the grab for land and resources. To me, it shows that he believed that we are a Jock Tamson’s bairns. He was a believer in an independent Scotland and an immense internationalist. We should all celebrate Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham.

Gordon Brown once said that there would be no more boom or bust in the economy—how wrong he was. I wonder what the Labour Party really thinks of his legacy, which has left us with a Con-Dem coalition whose only solution to the economic quagmire is austerity. I argue that its economic and financial medicine is a poison that is causing even more damage. As in the 1980s, our young people are feeling the worst effects of the situation. In the early Thatcher years, we saw the dole queues lengthen and millions thrown on to the scrapheap of economic inactivity. As a young man, I watched many of my school mates struggle to get a job; indeed, many of them were forced into the YTS, which, in my area, was commonly known as “Yon Thatcher’s”—and I cannot say the final word, but there are seven shades of it. However, unlike the 1980s, the people of Scotland now have their own Government. Although it has limited powers, it has acted to try to get as many of our young people as possible into work, education or training; invested around £72 million last year to support 26,427 modern apprenticeships; is spending double the amount spent by the last Labour-Liberal Executive on apprenticeships and training; and has doubled the total number of modern apprenticeships and other training opportunities from 55,288 in 2006-07 to 112,501 in 2010-11.

That is the official figure that I have; £72 million is more than double that £35 million. Nothing that we have heard from Labour is about common cause. The reality is that the modern apprenticeship scheme is exactly the same scheme that existed under the Labour-Liberal Executive; the only difference, as the minister has pointed out, is that the scheme is now bigger and better and is doing the job. Iain Gray rose— I have very little time, Mr Gray. I have already taken an intervention. We have heard some real nonsense. During his speech, Mr Gray talked about the budget, but the fact is that Labour tried to vote down the budget, which included provision for 25,000 modern apprenticeships.

I may take an intervention from Mr Smith later. On 10 February last year, John Swinney said that he had offered Labour “all they had asked for and more ... This, apparently, is not enough for Labour. Every single thing I was asked to deliver by the Labour Party I offered the Labour Party. They have now been caught red-handed in a state of total hypocrisy.” Today, we are again getting total hypocrisy from the Labour Party. When Ms Dugdale sums up, I would like to hear exactly what the Labour Party wants to do in this sphere. Her amendment does not spell everything out. Does she intend to deny those folk who are already in employment the chance to gain a modern apprenticeship? If she does, I would like her to meet some of the folk in Aberdeen whom I met recently, who have benefited from being on the modern apprenticeship scheme. During his speech, Mr Gray also said that he would like every council to have a youth employment strategy and a way of dealing with the issue. I completely and utterly agree with him. I urge him to ask his colleagues in Aberdeen to back the motion of Councillor Gordon Townson on his plan for a youth employment strategy for Aberdeen. Thus far, it seems that they will ignore it.

There is an easy answer for Mr Gray. There were measures in place to deal with youth employment in Aberdeen, although they did not amount to a full strategy. The SNP’s manifesto contained a commitment to deliver a full youth employment strategy to tie in with the Government’s youth employment strategy, but it seems that the Labour Party and its Tory and independent allies do not want to go down that route. Labour is again being hypocritical. I do not want people to be put on the scrap heap, as happened in my youth in the 80s. I want to hear from Ms Dugdale what she would do about those 10,000 folk who are on the modern apprenticeship scheme and who were previously in employment. Does she intend to deny them that opportunity? She should be straight, not hypocritical.

Can the minister outline the benefits of the council tax freeze to the average household in Scotland and tell us how the position compares with that under the previous Scottish Executive’s tax regime?

Will the member give way?

Mr Macdonald is rather unfair about the conduct of the referendum, which was carried out by Crawford Langley, who is one of the leading lights among returning officers in the country. There was agreement on the process from all parties, apart from the Labour Party, and from those for and against the proposition. What is wrong is that the Labour Party cannot admit defeat in a referendum. Will it do the same in 2014?

Folk have talked about exchange trips, but it strikes me, as I listen to the debate, that people do not take advantage of what we have here at this moment. We have folk who have come to Scotland from all over the world—a lot of Polish people, for example. Why are we not immersing our kids to learn Polish, alongside those kids? That would work extraordinarily well. Polish is one example, but there are many others.

2. To ask the Scottish Government how it supports cultural initiatives in Aberdeen. (S4O-01050)

Does the cabinet secretary agree that it is great that Aberdeen is looking to become the 2017 city of culture? However, the controversial Labour-led administration, which has just put the pay of senior councillors up by 5 per cent while Scottish National Party councillors in Angus have reduced theirs by 5 per cent, is also being controversial in that it plans to drop tax increment financing funding, which will halt the possible development of cultural icons such as Aberdeen art gallery.

I asked a question at the start, but I will ask another one.

Does the cabinet secretary agree that that is wrong-headed?

I thank Ms Ewing for giving way. It is noticeable that the Liberal Democrats are not present in the chamber and yet Willie Rennie has just been on television defending the indefensible as regards welfare reform. Does Ms Ewing think that the Liberals are as culpable as their Tory colleagues, who at least have had the decency to turn up today?

Does Mr Brodie agree with Aberdeen Action on Disability, whose view I share, that many politicians and the media are billing many folk who are incapable of working as scroungers, and that that is part of the black propaganda during the welfare reform process?

As an Aberdonian, I have to stress the importance of the all-energy conference to jobs in Scotland. Surely Dr Murray will recognise that our priority at the moment must be to increase the number of jobs in the country.

8. To ask the Scottish Government what recent discussions it has had with the United Kingdom Government regarding devolving air passenger duty. (S4O-01006)

The managing director of Aberdeen airport, Derek Provan, has said that “Air Passenger Duty in its current form will damage tourism and weaken Scotland’s competitiveness. It is growing in the UK at a time when other European countries have abandoned the tax entirely because of its damaging effects.” He continued: “We call for the tax to be devolved to the Scottish government where we feel any revenues raised would be pushed back into helping support the aviation industry and attract new routes.” Does the cabinet secretary agree with Mr Provan?

There are concerns in Aberdeen, the north-east and throughout the country about the recent ditching of a Super Puma helicopter. In light of the impact on employment in the oil and gas industry, what discussions has the Scottish Government had with the United Kingdom Government and its agencies regarding the grounding of the Bond Super Puma fleet?

Will the member give way?

“Delusional” is a good word to describe the Labour Party on this issue. The five-point plan for growth that it published in November contains only one area of policy that is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Surely if the Labour Party wants to end austerity and get back on the right track, it must agree with the SNP that the best way to do that is to have all the reins of power in the Scottish Parliament.

I am glad that Ms McTaggart has mentioned the modern apprenticeship scheme. I, too, hope that there will be positive outcomes, unlike those from some of the schemes south of the border. Why did Ms McTaggart vote against modern apprenticeships in the recent budget?

Well, your party did.

Will Mr Brown give way?

I point out that we are talking about those numbers throughout the UK and not only here in Scotland. Mr Brown talked earlier about how he would fund some of his commitments, which would mean scrapping such measures as free prescription charges. That is not particularly progressive. We require all the levers of power to boost the economy, which would see increased taxation. One of the first things that I would scrap is Trident nuclear weapons. Will Gavin Brown comment on that?

Will the member give way?

I congratulate Mr Baker on securing the debate. Aberdeen and the north-east have a proud tradition of philanthropic giving to health services in the area. For example, Foresterhill came into being as a result of large donations. In recent times, we have had Friends of ANCHOR—the Aberdeen and north centre for haematology, oncology and radiography—the Archie Foundation and UCAN. Mr Baker is right to pay tribute to Dr George Stevenson for the efforts that he has made in that regard, and I also join the member in paying tribute to Professors McClinton and N’Dow. The campaign already has a huge amount of support in Aberdeen and the north-east. Some time ago, UCAN was helped by a grant from the common good fund and, just recently, it received money from the Lord Provost’s Charitable Trust. It will be the main beneficiary of money raised from the Crathes vintage car and motorcycle rally, and Fraserburgh football team members decided to pose naked recently, covering their modesty with footballs, to raise money for the campaign. I, too, have made a donation. I have no intention whatsoever of posing with a football covering my bits and I am sure that that is a great relief to everyone. Mr Baker listed many of the benefits of this robot-assisted surgery. The key thing for me is the benefits for patients if it comes into play, which I am sure will happen. The huge benefits for the patients include smaller surgical incisions, of 1in or less; less blood loss during surgery and less need for blood transfusion; reduced post-operative pain and discomfort; shorter hospital stays; faster overall recovery; earlier restoration of urinary and sexual function; and less cosmetic scarring. There are also huge benefits for the surgeons who would use the equipment: enhanced 3D visualisation; improved dexterity; increased range of movement; greater surgical precision; improved access; consistent performance; the simplification of many existing MIS techniques; a shortened training time for MIS procedures; and less physical demand on the surgeons. UCAN has made some great advances since it came into being at ward 44 in 2008. As Mr Baker rightly pointed out, a recent refurbishment was led and scrutinised by Dr Stevenson. Like Mr Baker, I do not know how the estate staff at the hospital coped with that. On a recent visit to the Parliament, Dr Stevenson inspected the woodwork—that is the way of the man. He is to be greatly respected for the efforts that he puts in. I named some organisations that are rallying behind the campaign. I hope that there will be more of that and that the target is reached sooner rather than later.

I declare an interest as a former chair of the north east of Scotland transport partnership. In the north-east, there has been an initiative to fit Fresnel lenses free on articulated lorries, which has led to a reduction in the number of accidents. Could that initiative be rolled out across the country?

A mandatory 20mph limit was put in place in Sunnybank in my constituency in Aberdeen without any accompanying traffic-calming measures. Such measures had to be put in, because the speed limit was largely ignored. Can Dr Murray comment on that?

The Aberdeen combined heat and power scheme has got it right in my opinion. In part, the expansion in recent times has been down to the £1 million grant that was received from Government, which was most welcome. Does Mr Harvie agree that, although lessons should be taken from Aberdeen and exported elsewhere, that should not be down to Government insistence, and that it should be up to local authorities to move forward in their own way?

Will Ms Boyack give way?

Does Mr Macintosh agree that many of the Remploy factories, including the one in Aberdeen, have moved forward in trying to create social enterprise hubs? They have also attracted support from private business. Does he agree that that is a way forward and something that we should be encouraging instead of closing the factories?

Dr Murray has missed out a few folk who might be affected by the proposal. They include parents who have restricted or limited access to their children and who might not get access if they do not have the extra bedroom, and folk who have medical conditions and require the extra bedroom to deal with those conditions.

This is nonsensical reform rather than radical reform. True radical reform would have considered ways of helping people out of poverty; the reform that Mr McArthur is talking about will put even more people into poverty. Will he comment on the fears of some social landlords about the fact that housing benefit will now be paid to the individuals, which might lead folk into even greater poverty than they are in already?

9. To ask the Scottish Government what the average council tax saving has been in Aberdeen since the council tax freeze was introduced. (S4O-00807)

I am sure that that £520 has been well received by hard-pressed Aberdonian families. Does the minister agree that it would be a travesty to increase the council tax at this time? That would put additional pressure on family budgets. Furthermore, does he agree that it is incredible that many Labour politicians throughout the country continue to press for a council tax hike?

Will the member give way?

I did not think that he would.

Will the member give way?

Will Mr Kelly give way?

I thank Mr Kelly for giving away—rather, giving way and giving away nothing, come to think of it. Why have Labour leaders of councils across the country accepted the package? Beyond that, why do they continue to welcome the progress that the Government has made in getting rid of ring fencing and allowing independence at local level?

Does Mr FitzPatrick agree that even though we are living through these tough times of having cuts imposed on us by the coalition Government at Westminster—a situation that is down to the fact that the Labour Party caused economic chaos—the Government has increased the amount of money that goes to local government in Aberdeen and Edinburgh through the introduction of the 85 per cent rule?

Will the member give way on that point?

The member is right to point out that Peacock Visual Arts did not have the entire package in place at that point, but that is not the reason why it does not feature now. It decided to remove itself from the process at that point because it would not talk to anyone else.

Does Mr Macdonald not recognise that there is a difference between an opinion poll that has no rules and regulations in place and which canvasses the opinions of only a small percentage of the city’s population and, in some cases, those from outwith the city, and a referendum in which more than 52 per cent of the city’s citizens voted?

I declare an interest as a member of Aberdeen City Council. I will begin with Jenny Marra’s speech. When one prepares a speech for the chamber, one should use up-to-date figures. She used figures from the five-year business plan that are rather out of date, thanks to the fact that the SNP Government provided the council with more finance. Once again, we have the negativity but not the positivity. Ms Marra talked about the closure of some schools, but she did not talk about the 10 new schools that have been built in Aberdeen in recent times and were delivered by the SNP-led administration. That is interesting, but not entirely surprising. There is absolutely no doubt that the debate about Union Terrace gardens has polarised the city. One reason why I called for the referendum and moved a motion at the council, which was passed, is that there was only one way to deal with the matter and that was to let Aberdonians decide what the situation should be. Last week, 52 per cent of Aberdonians voted in favour of the city garden project. I voted yes, as did many others. I will give members a few numbers: 51.1 per cent versus 48.9 per cent. The figure of 51.1 per cent is the share of votes that Anas Sarwar received to become the Labour Party’s deputy leader; 48.9 per cent of folk voted agin. Does Labour dispute that he should be the deputy leader? Lewis Macdonald probably does, but he received only 15.62 per cent. The usual local government election campaign has started and Labour has nothing whatever to say that is positive. It has of late punted out a leaflet called “Aberdeen Leader”—I think not—the headline of which is, “Your City, Your Say”. Labour then gives citizens an instruction: “Vote to Retain Union Terrace Gardens”. I am a little bit of a cynic, but I think that Labour has printed a huge number of those leaflets, canna see them go to waste and winna have them pulped, which is why we are having the debate. It is no surprise to me or my colleagues that the Labour Party is holding up the development of our city. Ms Boyack said that we were discussing “a local planning issue”. It is not a local planning issue yet, although I am sure that it will be. The Labour Party has voted en bloc to turn down every major planning proposal of late. That applies to the third Don crossing, as has been said, and to the community stadium, Marischal college and so on. The Labour Party has been in trouble before over possible whipping on planning issues—we saw the demise of one of its councillors not so long ago over the Kingswells stadium bid. Some time real soon, somebody will probably look at Labour’s voting records and at the fact that politics is coming into play in planning issues. Ms Boyack said in the Evening Express this week that Labour would paint the Town house red. That is a matter for the people of Aberdeen, but I do not see that coming, because the Labour Party has gone down and down in recent times. If she wants to paint the Town house red, she will have to visit B&amp;Q to get a few tins of paint and some brushes, and I am sure that she will have an argument with Historic Scotland about that.

Does Alex Johnstone agree that the Labour Party should have done the same as the other parties in the council and given its members a free vote on the issue?

I agree that that is the way that the process should be carried out and I would not expect anything other. Will the cabinet secretary join me in calling on private money holders to put their hands a little bit further into their pockets so that the amount that we need in TIF can be reduced even more? I am sure that other benefactors may wish to contribute to the amazing project.

Will the member give way?

Will the member give way on that point?

10. To ask the Scottish Government what progress has been made in securing a tax increment funding pilot for Aberdeen. (S4O-00768)

I feel a bit bad about asking these questions as we have already had a debate on the subject this morning. In the light of last week’s referendum, does the cabinet secretary intend to meet Aberdeen City Council to discuss the business case? The city garden project is not the only project, as we also have the St Nicholas house redevelopment, the city art gallery redevelopment, improvements to the city realm and the north Denburn valley redevelopment.

7. To ask the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with Aberdeen City Council regarding the business rates incentivisation scheme. (S4O-00735)

The cabinet secretary knows that I am a great fan of the business rates incentivisation scheme. I cannot wait for 1 April, when it becomes a reality. Does the cabinet secretary have any plans to further reward local authorities that invest the income from the business rates incentivisation scheme in encouraging even greater sustainable growth?

In the light of the findings of Oil & Gas UK’s “2012 Activity Survey”, does the First Minister intend to have discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the detrimental impact that the United Kingdom Government’s oil taxation policy is having on the economies of Aberdeen and the rest of Scotland?

First, I thank the committee clerks, those who gave evidence to the committee and the committee members, including the convener and former members Kezia Dugdale and Mark Griffin, whom I know gave a lot to the inquiry. I am glad that most of today’s debate has been consensual. Something that has not been talked about at all today is evidence that the committee took at the beginning of the inquiry that blew away the myth that implementing the living wage would have a detrimental effect on equal pay and single status. The blowing away of that myth and the fact that people were talking about the living wage led to a situation in which more councils felt confident about implementing the living wage. I think that that is why we have seen other councils around the country moving forward on the living wage, and I hope that more will follow. I will not touch on many of the issues that the convener addressed in his speech, but I will follow up on some issues around procurement. The convener said, as have many others, that the cabinet secretary, Alex Neil, has written to the European Commission on procurement. I will not bore members by going into any depth on the on-going case of R?ffert v Niedersachsen. I think that it may be a while before we get a reply from the European Commission on procurement. However, it would be wise to wait for that reply; I am sure that no member would want to breach European law. Sarah Boyack said in her speech that there should be a living wage unit in the Government. I refer members to paragraph 135 of the report, which states: “The Committee notes the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth’s view that there is no need for the establishment of a living wage unit within the Scottish Government. The Committee took the view that the co-ordination and mainstreaming of work on the living wage across different strands of government was more important than there being a dedicated unit.” I do not want to get my colleagues John Pentland and Anne McTaggart into trouble, but that view was agreed unanimously by the committee on the basis of the evidence that we heard. I was interested to note that John Pentland seems to have changed his mind today about that. Margaret Mitchell was part of the unanimous agreement to the report, but she, too, seems to have changed tack today. I will not consider in any depth the comments that she made, but I disagreed with a lot of what she said. Kezia Dugdale rightly pointed out the issue around CBI Scotland’s written evidence, which in one instance quoted only half the evidence to which it referred. In addition, the committee was most disappointed to hear the suggestion that CBI Scotland’s written evidence to the inquiry was drafted in London, and it was equally disappointed that CBI Scotland said that nobody was available to come to give oral evidence. That tells me that the folk from CBI Scotland were not going to be able to defend the written evidence that was submitted on their behalf. It is really disappointing when an organisation submits written evidence but is—I think—afraid to come to the committee to defend it. I hope that that does not happen again. I pay tribute to John Wilson, who, over the years, has made a big contribution to the debate, as director of the Scottish Low Pay Unit and in various other capacities. He rightly pointed out that major companies in London back the living wage, including Barclays Bank. Let us be honest—in some regards, banks do not have a good record of late but, in this case, they have a very good record. That shows that there is in London a coalition of views that to pay the living wage is a good thing. We know that John Park, too, has a very good record in the matter. I hope that we will be able to move forward on procurement, but we need some positive words from the EU. I would suggest that Mr Park read the case of Rüffert v Niedersachsen, but I am sure that he has better things to do with his time.

I agree that, in some regards, it is easy to do things if the political will exists, but in this case the evidence that the committee got was so complex that we would be wise to wait and see what the European Commission says in its response to Alex Neil. Maureen Watt talked about the purchasing power of households being spread more thinly. That is a good reason why the living wage should be implemented, where possible. She also gave the example of Germany and its wage councils; I think that we could learn a number of lessons from other places. Anne McTaggart mentioned the hospitality industry. I hope that people in that industry were listening to her speech. I have to say to Bill Wilson that I dinna remember Dubcek in 1968, because that was the year in which I was born. Mr Wilson contributed greatly to the debate.

I beg your pardon—I meant Mr Walker. [Interruption.]

John Pentland is right that fairer wages can lead to better physical and mental health—there is evidence on that—but I again point out that his position on a living wage unit represents a change of heart, as it is different from the position that he agreed to sign up to as a member of the committee. John Mason mentioned his time in London—[Interruption.]

I am amazed that people in London are trying to raise the living wage to £8.30. I also agree with Mr Mason that tax credits are sometimes a subsidy for private companies that could afford to pay their staff more. I have missed out a number of members, and I apologise for doing so. All the speeches have been quite positive, apart from the Tory ones—but there is no surprise there. Gavin Brown talked about wasted money, on which he refused to take an intervention from my colleague Mark McDonald. Does Gavin Brown believe that the money that was spent on implementing equal pay and modernisation was wasted money? If he does, then I do not know—the Tories here get more right wing by the day. Comment has been made on evidence to the committee that, when the living wage has been implemented, there has been greater productivity, less absenteeism and lower staff turnover. Those are three very good reasons why we should do everything possible to implement the living wage. I hope that more local authorities will take that on board and that we will make progress on procurement. It is not often that I agree with Boris Johnson, but he is right—the living wage is morally right. It is just a pity that some of his colleagues in this place do not think the same way.

4. To ask the First Minister, given the economic impact, what action the Scottish Government is taking to ensure that competition remains on routes from Scotland to Heathrow airport. (S4F-00477)

I am sure that the First Minister shares my disappointment that earlier this week Ryanair announced its decision to cut back its services from Edinburgh. What progress is being made in urging the United Kingdom Government to devolve the power of air passenger duty so that Scottish airports—and the important links between Aberdeen and London—can remain competitive?

Will the member give way?

Does Mr Chisholm agree that a lot of the levers of power still rest with Westminster and that they should be here? After all, four of the five points in Labour’s action plan for jobs refer to powers that Westminster has retained. It would be much easier for us to deal with the situation if we had those powers here.

I declare an interest as a member of Aberdeen City Council. Colleagues often accuse me of being Aberdeen-centric, and there is probably a suspicion that I will make a last-minute bid for Aberdeen to be the site for the green investment bank. I can put members’ minds at rest: I fully support the Edinburgh bid. I agree with the leaders of the six cities in Scotland, who believe that this is the right place for the bank, and I am pleased that there is that unity of purpose.

I agree with Mr Malik. Glasgow is a fine city, and Aberdeen is, of course, top of my list. In the past, there was competition between Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen for the Energy Technologies Institute. Unfortunately, we could not get together on that, and it ended up in Loughborough, when it would probably have been better placed in Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen, so I am glad that there is unity of purpose with regard to the green investment bank. However, I would never undersell any of Scotland’s great cities—particularly not Aberdeen. Scotland is lucky with regard to the renewables activity that it has attracted to its shores from outwith the country. I am sure that Liam McArthur will tell us about the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, and I am pleased that Aberdeen will—I hope—be the home of the European offshore wind development centre. Those centres are immensely important. Many parts of Scotland are benefiting from the renewables revolution, and there is more to come. I hope that the siting of the green investment bank in Edinburgh will mean that it will be easier to get investment for some of the brilliant ideas that are out there. Sarah Boyack talked about district heating systems, and Aberdeen is at the forefront in that regard. Thanks to the Scottish Government, an extra £1 million went to the Aberdeen combined heat and power programme recently, which means that the network now goes into the centre of the city. We should not have to rely on public grants to move such programmes on. Private companies should be willing to invest, too. I think that the green investment bank will encourage that. I have talked in the chamber before about hydrogen technology, and Aberdeen’s bid to have hydrogen buses and to expand that technology. That is extremely important, not only for Aberdeen and the north-east of Scotland but for the whole of Scotland. I believe that we can also be at the forefront of that technology, if the investment is right and we are able to push that forward. I thank the organisations that provided members with briefings today, particularly Scottish Renewables, because its bullet-point briefing gives all the reasons why the green investment bank should be sited in Edinburgh. The announcements about recent jobs and investment in the renewables sector represent a great story to tell. The briefing lists a number of such announcements, and it goes back only to last November. It mentions Mitsubishi in Fife; the establishment in Glasgow of the headquarters of the effort to develop technologies to capture and use power from offshore wind; Moray Offshore Renewables; and SSE investment. That is all great news, but I think that there can be even more, and the siting of the green investment bank in Edinburgh will ensure that we have even greater things ahead of us. Far from being parochial about Aberdeen, I fully support Edinburgh’s bid. The siting of the green investment bank in Edinburgh will benefit Aberdeen, as well as the rest of Scotland. That is why I am fully behind the motion and the bid.

I have in my hand a copy of the Labour Party publication The Edinburgh Voice, which castigates Glasgow for the amount of money that it gets and says that Edinburgh deserves more. Is Labour playing divide and rule across the country?

Ms McInnes knows as well as I do that a reason why the formula has not been changed is intransigence in COSLA. Maybe a change in COSLA will change that. Does she agree that the 85 per cent floor, which will benefit Aberdeen City Council, is a welcome move by the cabinet secretary and the Government?

Bleating?

Will the member give way?

Mr Griffin has served on the Local Government and Regeneration Committee of late and I know that he is not in any sense a silly man. However, something that has become more and more apparent over the past few days is that Labour wants to spend money galore without telling us what it will actually cut. We seem to be going back to the fantasy economics of Gordon Brown. Will Mr Griffin tell us which budget he would cut to secure the moneys for local government that he is talking about?

Will the member give way?

Will the member take an intervention on a point that she has already made?

I declare an interest as a member of Aberdeen City Council. I thank the cabinet secretary for the more than £5 million of additional funding that the council will receive through the budget, which is more than welcome in the granite city. In the stage 1 debate, I highlighted the fact that although, in November, Labour published a five-point plan for job creation, four of those points concerned Westminster-retained powers and the only thing that we had power over in this Parliament was capital spend. Labour’s plan says that capital spend should be brought forward; therefore, I am disappointed that there have been no congratulations from the Labour Party today to the cabinet secretary on increasing capital spend by another £380 million over the next three years. During Mr Macintosh’s speech, which was supposedly about job creation, I noticed that he did not talk much about job creation or the four levers of power in Labour’s plan that remain with Westminster. I would be interested in hearing what the Labour Party has to say about such issues if it were truthful and honest about the powers that Mr Swinney and the Scottish Parliament have. I would like us to have all those powers—if we had, we would have seen a very different budget today.

One thing John Swinney did, which I have mentioned, was increase capital investment by moving funds from the revenue budget to the capital budget. If he had not done that, we would probably have been in a much worse position than we are in. Nevertheless, the main levers of power still lie with Westminster. I believe that those powers should be here and that we should be making those decisions, so that we could have a real budget for job creation using all the powers that we should have. I also welcome the additional investment in housing that has been announced today. Aberdeen has benefited since the SNP Government came to power, with new housing in various places including Tillydrone, in my constituency, and current building in Stockethill.

This party, which is standing up for Scotland, is providing capital investment. The budget provides an extra £97 million for housing, £68 million for digital infrastructure, £72 million more for transport, £60 million for NHS boards, £54 million for local government, £20 million for the Scottish Prison Service and for female prisoners in particular, £5 million extra for culture and £3 million to ensure that asset disposal is done properly. What more does Neil Findlay want at a time when Westminster has cut the block grant to the Parliament by £1.3 billion? Claudia Beamish (South Scotland) (Lab) rose—

No—I am sorry; I have taken enough interventions and I need to finish. Mr Gibson talked about crocodile tears, of which there have been a lot in the Parliament today. One of the things that really annoy me relates to colleges, which were one of the many priorities of the Conservatives and the Labour Party at stages 1 and 2. We have had some good news today, which I am sure that the NUS and others will welcome. I wish that the Conservatives and Labour would sit back and reflect on what has changed. Mr Rennie did that; I acknowledge that the Liberal Democrats took the time to appreciate what Mr Swinney has done. Of course, we would not be in the current position if it had not been for the previous Labour Government’s excessive spending. Gordon Brown—Mr Prudence—always went round saying, “Look how prudent I am.” However, the reality is that the previous Labour Government was probably the most profligate Government in the history of these islands. Now, we all have to suffer the consequences of that profligacy. That is why we have had to deal with the cuts that we have had to deal with.

I have taken enough interventions. In this time of adversity, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth is to be congratulated on his efforts in putting together the budget. I support the motion.

Will Rhoda Grant say what Labour would do instead? What is beyond redemption, as far as I am concerned, is that neither the Tories nor the Labour Party will say exactly what they would do in the current circumstances. That is wrong.

I refer the chamber to my entry in the register of members’ interests, which states that I am a member of Aberdeen City Council. I am glad that Mark McDonald did not steal all of my thunder. I welcome this debate, and I particularly welcome the announcement of the extra £1.1 million of consequentials for infrastructure. I hope that the cabinet secretary will think about providing Aberdeen art gallery with some of that money, as it is in need of some roof repairs—I will probably talk to her about that later. At the moment, the gallery has a wonderful exhibition called “From Van Gogh to Vettriano”, which features paintings from private collections that do not normally see the light of day. I urge folk to go and have a look at that. As Mr McDonald said, Aberdeen will celebrate 40 years of the Aberdeen international youth festival this year. Over that time, that festival has brought people from around the world to perform in Aberdeen. It has brought thousands of visitors to the city. I am looking forward to it, particularly to the events in communities. I agree with Ms Ferguson that they are what we need. I am particularly interested in creating the artists of tomorrow and particularly proud of the reading bus in my patch. That initiative teaches kids to read in a fun manner and gets their parents involved. Beyond that, it gets kids involved in Doric culture and teaches them animation. Apple and TAQA Bratani have helped to sponsor it, which is amazing. Radio DJs and presenters of the future are being created. In combination with the reading bus, Station House Media Unit in Aberdeen is teaching kids those skills at a young age. I agree with Ms Urquhart that it is best to catch them early. If we get a five-year-old interested in something, it is likely that they will be interested in it for the rest of their life. Sometimes we do not marry up tourism and culture very well, although I am not blaming the cabinet secretary or the minister for that. We spend huge amounts of money on marketing Scotland throughout the world, including in the United States.

I agree with Mr Dey. I am sure that anybody who has been to Arbroath abbey would agree that a visit there is a great day out. We should celebrate our links with the United States and try to persuade folk from there to come here. However, it is not just about Arbroath. We miss opportunities. I wrote to the cabinet secretary recently about a constituent of mine who has written a huge number of musicals over the years and has found it difficult to access funding from the usual bodies, including Creative Scotland and the National Theatre of Scotland. There is sometimes a certain amount of snobbery in the allocation of funds, which needs to be done away with. My constituent, Mike Gibb, recently musically adapted the “Outlander” books by Diana Gabaldon, who is an American author. All of the “Outlander” books, the first of which was called “Cross Stitch” in the United Kingdom, are entirely based in Scotland. I have to be honest and say that I have not read the books, as they are described as romantic drama, which is not quite my bag. However, the series of books has a huge fan base and has sold 20 million copies worldwide, and the musical has been staged in Dundee. Visitors from the United States managed to catch it on a Facebook site. If our cultural and tourism organisations got together to create linkages and provide initial funding that could get returns, we could sell Scotland even more culturally and in other ways throughout the world. We need to consider carefully how we dole out funding. Far too often, it is doled out to the same things, which is not right. I hope that the cabinet secretary will agree to meet me to discuss that topic so that we can perhaps thrash it out and see whether we can link tourism with culture in making cultural grants. This has been a brilliant debate in which there has been no disagreement across the chamber. I hope that we do brilliantly in 2012.

I completely agree. One of our frequent failures is to spend lots of money on advertising when some things advertise themselves—or they could if they were done properly.

I did not realise that the minister was such a fan of Peploe. He can see some Peploes at the Van Gogh to, er—[Interruption.]—Vettriano exhibition at the Aberdeen art gallery. [Laughter.] I got too excited by Peploe there. I have a vision of the picture in my head now.

Will the member give way?

I declare an interest as a member of Aberdeen City Council, which will no doubt come up in the debate. Like Mr Swinney, I have led on many a budget in another place. When one leads on a budget, one finds that there is often a lot of heat but not a lot of light and there are more priorities than one knows what to do with. Some of the nonsense started right at the beginning of the debate. Mr Macintosh, who is no longer in the chamber, said that jobs are the priority. I do not necessarily disagree with Mr Macintosh, who went on to say a number of things about job creation. However, let us go back to 3 November 2011, when Labour published its five-point plan for jobs. Those five points included a £2 billion tax on bank bonuses—a Westminster-retained power, if I am not mistaken; a reversal of January’s damaging VAT rise—a Westminster-retained power; a one-year cut in VAT on home improvements to 5 per cent—a Westminster-retained power; and a one-year national insurance tax break for every small firm—a Westminster-retained power. The only point within that five-point plan to get people back to work and get growth going again for which we hold the power was the proposal to bring forward long-term investment projects, which the cabinet secretary has been brave enough to do in moving moneys from the revenue budget to the capital budget.

I thank Mr Chisholm for that. I hope that he supports our plans to take those powers for the Scottish Parliament, so that we can create those jobs instead of waiting for the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to do something about it, which they never will. It is unfortunate for the Labour Party that it would rather be ruled by that bunch following their misguided economic policies than allow the Parliament to take those powers for itself and do the best for the Scottish people. That, to me, is wrong.

I agree completely with Kenneth Gibson. I was going to go even further because, after that, Mr Macintosh talked about three decades of high unemployment. For 13 years of those three decades, Labour was in power. What did it do? Absolutely nothing. Time and again, Alistair Darling said that his cuts would be deeper than Margaret Thatcher’s.

I say to Mr Macintosh that the SNP Government is doing a damned sight more than the Government south of the border. I have talked about the cabinet secretary moving money from the revenue budget to the capital budget in order to boost jobs. We have also recently created the post of Minister for Youth Employment. Unfortunately, she does not have all the powers that she needs to have at her disposal, either; however, I am convinced that she will make a difference. We have heard a lot about college budgets. I feel for colleges in that regard. However, if the UK Government was in charge of college spending north of the border, we might face the same cuts as there are south of the border, where the UK Government is cutting colleges’ budgets by 25 per cent in cash terms, from £4.3 billion in 2010-11 to £3.2 billion in 2014-15. That cut is 7 per cent deeper in cash terms than anything that is proposed here, north of the border. We have heard the suggestion of throwing money at things, with no idea of where that money would come from—that is typical from the Labour Party. Throwing money at things does not necessarily lead to improved services. That lesson needs to be learned. That is why I am so glad that the cabinet secretary has put the emphasis on preventative spending that he has, and more power to his elbow.

Will the member give way?

Ms Grant says that we are all in deep trouble. That is the problem: we are in deep trouble and it is of her Government’s making. Gordon Brown sold us all a pup and left us in debt—£1 trillion-worth.

Ms Boyack said that we should do everything possible to get folk out to vote. Over the years, I have found that many young people in fifth and sixth year at school are immensely interested in politics, but when they leave school they are suddenly disinterested because we have not grabbed their interest at that earlier point. Does the member agree that giving young people the vote at 16 and 17 would keep them interested in politics?

Will the member take an intervention?

I welcome the new minister and the shadow spokespeople to their new posts. It came as no surprise to me that the Gould report was as damning as it was. At the May 2007 election, I spent a night and a day in an election count hall in Aberdeen watching the on-going farce. I certainly do not blame any of the election staff for that farce, because folk did their best. Unfortunately, not enough planning was done on what would happen with the electronic vote machines on that night. Some slight difficulties—“slight” is not really the word that I would use—were caused by simple things such as the fact that the machines could not handle postal votes that had been folded. I am glad that much more testing of that has been done so that we can be confident that we do not see the same farce happening come May 2012. Local government elections are extremely important. I am still a local councillor and refer members to my entry in the register of interests. Unlike Mrs Eadie, I think that most folk think that local government has a huge part to play in their day-to-day lives. Many folk think that local government is much more important than this place and certainly more important than Westminster. We should therefore do everything possible to encourage—

I thank Mrs Eadie for clarifying that. I do not entirely agree that local government is of no consequence in folk’s lives; in many folk’s lives, it is the paramount authority. Today, we have heard a number of speeches about encouraging people to register and to vote. I agree with Ms Boyack that there is work being done in some places but not in others to encourage people to register to vote. I also agree that it is more difficult to get folk in areas of deprivation to register. The efforts of electoral registration officers and evaluation boards should target those areas to encourage people to register to vote.

I am always wary of adding to statutory burdens. However, best practice should be spread across the country. We should examine some of the good stuff that has gone on in certain places and ensure that it goes elsewhere. I am sure that, in his closing speech, the minister will go over that point and consider whether it is possible. Perhaps he will issue some guidance rather than put some new statute in place. Mr Griffin made some interesting comments. I do not know whether turnout will increase in his council seat when he stands down or whether it will increase in Mr Mackay’s former council seat, just as I do not know what will happen in mine. One of the key things about Mr Mackay and Mr Griffin is that both were elected at a younger age than most. We require more young folk in local government, and I was proud to lead an SNP group in Aberdeen that had four folk under 30. They were elected for the first time at the previous local government elections and one of them, John West, was 18 at the time. Those four councillors were fully engaged with the process, and I think that the fact that we had young candidates encouraged younger folk to go out and vote. As I said when I intervened on Mrs Mitchell, 16 and 17-year-olds are engaged but there comes a point—and I do not know when it is—when a number of young folk become disengaged. We should give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote in every election—I have believed that all my days and will continue to believe it—so that we continue to keep them engaged in the process and do not have a point of disengagement. I cannot see what the difficulty is with enfranchising 16 and 17-year-olds. We have had some flip-flopping on the issue from the Liberal Democrats, who have not bothered coming to the chamber, and from some Labour members. It is time for the Parliament to have the right to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local government and Scottish elections.

I completely agree with the Scottish Youth Parliament, the NUS and Mr Robertson. I truly believe that 16 and 17-year-olds should have the franchise and I hope that they will have it in elections in the very near future. I know that the minister will do all that he can to ensure that we get the powers to enable them to have it.

After the most recent election I thought about changing my name to Aaron Aardvark. Robson rotation, which involves putting candidates in different positions on ballot papers so that there is no such advantage, is used in some places, including New Zealand. However, there is a difficulty, in that such an approach might make counting much more difficult. I do not know whether it would be worth our tinkering with the approach, given the experience in the count after the 2007 election.

3. To ask the Scottish Government what plans are in place to allow artworks of national importance to be displayed throughout the country. (S4O-00581)

Aberdeen art gallery and museums worked with the British Museum and National Museums Scotland to feature the event, unmasking the Lewis chessmen, from 7 October 2010 to 8 January 2011, which cast fresh light on one of the most important archaeological discoveries ever made in Scotland. During the 13-week showing, 43,696 people visited the event, compared with the previous year’s figure of 39,533 over the same period. A similar increase in visitor numbers was also recorded for a showing of “Diana and Actaeon” by Titian.

Certainly. Can the cabinet secretary assure me that works of national importance can be displayed throughout the country, and particularly in Aberdeen to boost visitor numbers at Aberdeen art gallery?

I begin by declaring an interest as a member of Aberdeen City Council, as a former chair of Nestrans—the north east of Scotland transport partnership—and as a former director of the Aberdeen BID Company Ltd, which will all feature in my speech. I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate; in my view there are never enough opportunities to talk about the great city of Aberdeen. I very much welcome the Scottish cities alliance, and the collaboration that it is hoped it will bring about. Far too often, our cities have been in competition rather than being collaborative. We, as a country, have lost out on many things because our cities have been competing against one another. One of the best examples is the Energy Technologies Institute: Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh tried to get it, but it ended up in Loughborough. That was a major loss for Scotland and for all three cities. I turn to Aberdeen and will look first at connectivity, which is mentioned in the cities strategy. I will begin on a bit of connectivity for which we in the north-east have waited far too long: the Aberdeen western peripheral route. I hope that the court proceedings will be dealt with very quickly so that we can get on with the job of building that bypass and dealing with some of the other problems in the roads network. I say to Drew Smith, who mentioned the Haudagain roundabout, that nothing can be done there until the western peripheral route is in place. If we started on the Haudagain roundabout without the AWPR, the whole city of Aberdeen would be in gridlock. Jackson Carlaw mentioned Aberdeen airport. I am extremely pleased at the level of investment in the airport in recent times, in particular for the runway extension, which has since brought us new routes to places such as Baku and Frankfurt and is good for the city and shire economy. There is not just the airport. There has also been investment in deepening the harbour mouth, which has allowed better access because stormy weather sometimes caused difficulty in that regard. I, like my colleague John Finnie, who is sitting to the left of me, want improvements in the Aberdeen-Inverness railway and to the A96. The Government is committed to doing those things. It is not all about connectivity. We must also consider sustainability. Other places could learn many lessons from things that are going on in Aberdeen. I have mentioned in the chamber previously the success of Aberdeen combined heat and power. CHP, along with district heating systems, has failed in many other places—for what reasons, I do not know—but lessons could be learned from Aberdeen city in that regard. I pay tribute to the folks who have been involved in that. Members had the opportunity last night to meet the Aberdeen renewable energy group and others to discuss the European offshore wind farm development, which I hope will come to fruition in our city very soon. Officials from Aberdeen City Council met Government officials yesterday to discuss possible funding for hydrogen buses in the city, which could also lead to a massive amount of European money coming to the city. That is worth exploring. I hope that, given the low-carbon economy agenda, some of the £7 million catalyst fund can be considered for that project.

We want sustainable growth. Domestic short-haul flights produce much more carbon than long-haul flights. I want Aberdonians and folk from the north-east to be able to travel on long-haul routes without having to go down to the south-east of England to get connections. So, no: I do not see a contradiction at all. Knowledge is the other major item on the agenda. Aberdeen has the University of Aberdeen, the Robert Gordon University and Aberdeen College, all of which are worthy institutions. Beyond that, we have knowledge in many other areas—particularly in the subsea industry, in which we are the leaders. Dennis Robertson, who is not in the chamber, would say that Westhill is the capital of that industry. It is slightly away from Aberdeen, but not that far away. In culture, we have the Aberdeen international youth festival and Aberdeen Performing Arts, in which regard we are at the top of the tree. Aberdeen has a huge amount to give and could, in co-operation with the other five cities—which will, we hope, be joined soon by Perth—do even greater things. Collaboration rather than competition is the key. I wish the cabinet secretary all the best with the alliance.

Will the member give way?

I refer members to my entry in the register of members’ interests, as I am a member of Aberdeen City Council, which will inevitably come up in the debate. I thank the committee for its inquiry and I welcome the innovation of having the debate before the report is written. In his opening remarks, the convener said that he was keen to hear about where things work. I hope that he will get a feel for some of the positives in my constituency today. I will talk first about positive destinations rather than attainment. In Aberdeen, we have a reasonable amount of success in that regard. The council works closely with schools, 16-plus co-ordinators, Skills Development Scotland, voluntary projects and further education colleges to ensure that looked-after young people who are leaving schools are offered a positive destination. The council is delivering the family firm approach whereby businesses offer supported placements for young people who are leaving care. The council has promoted the approach with a number of private sector partners, and several council directorates have successfully offered internships and apprenticeships for eligible young people who are leaving care. One colleague in Aberdeen said that such positive discrimination is wrong, but I argue that, if a member of our own family were leaving school, we would do everything possible to get that young person into work and would pull out all the stops to do so. I do not see why we should do anything different for our young folk who have been looked after. In Aberdeen, 71 per cent of children and young people who were looked after by the city and who left school during 2009-10 were in a positive destination at the time of the follow-up destination survey. That compares to a figure of 44 per cent nationally. The city is ranked first among comparable authorities, with the highest number of folk in a positive destination. Lessons can be learned from Aberdeen about achieving those positive results. Some folk will say that the fact that the economic outlook in Aberdeen is better than it is elsewhere is a factor. I have no doubt that that is the case, but I still think that there are lessons to be learned. Nevertheless, we should not rest on our laurels, because the destinations survey showed that 86.9 per cent of kids who were not looked after were in positive destinations. That is 15.9 per cent higher than the figure for looked-after children, so there is still a lot to do. Mr Maxwell also talked about joined-up working and the fact that it is sometimes lacking in certain places. In Aberdeen, all primary, secondary and special schools have a designated manager who is responsible for monitoring the position of looked-after children and identifying their additional support needs at school. The monitoring of looked-after children is a key component of the council’s quality improvement framework. The local authority also has a dedicated looked-after children teacher, who is responsible for overseeing and co-ordinating education provision for children in its own children’s unit. The teacher offers guidance and support to residential childcare workers, field social workers and young people, and also advocates on their behalf. The most innovative thing that is going on in Aberdeen is an initiative between the council and Barnardo’s Scotland. The project is called strive and is making major moves forward. It is an innovative new programme, which is designed by Barnardo’s to help to improve the educational outcome of looked-after young people by providing them with opportunities to experience success, build their confidence and increase their motivation. The project is aimed at children between the ages of 11 and 16 who are looked after at home or away from home and who are struggling with mainstream school provision in terms of attainment and attendance or who are at risk of exclusion. The young people concerned are engaged in learning and in improving their educational attainment. The project stems the flow of looked-after young people going to negative destinations and it takes a holistic approach. The service offers coaching out of school hours, which seeks to engage young people in inspirational, fun and structured individual and group activities to promote learning and achievement. It includes a £500 learning fund for each young person, which adds freedom and focus to the coaching relationship and gives the relationship resources to make change happen. There are also one-to-one sessions with a specific school focus, which connect success and motivation from out-of-school-hours learning to school performance. The project is in its early stages and an analysis of how well it goes will be conducted. I could talk about it for some time, but I am coming to the end of my time. I hope that the committee and the minister will look at what strive has done thus far and at what I think it can do to improve the educational attainment levels of our looked-after children. If it is shown to be a success, which I am sure it will be, I hope that it can be rolled out across the country.

The point that I was trying to make was that although some see such action as positive discrimination, I do not see it as positive discrimination at all. The reality is that, if a member of our family was in that situation, we would do everything possible to get them a job. I think that as corporate parents, whether in the Parliament or in councils, of which some of us are still members, we should do the same thing that we would do for family members. Although some would call it positive discrimination, I would not label it as such.

GIRFEC training is still being carried out in silos in certain parts of the country, which has been detrimental across the board. Does Liz Smith believe that GIRFEC training should be carried out across the professions and that elected members should be involved in it so that they know what they are doing when it comes to creating a new policy?

I refer members to my entry in the register of members’ interests. I am a member of Aberdeen City Council, which will come up in my speech. I thank everyone who provided MSPs with briefings and evidence on the Welfare Reform Bill. The Scottish campaign on welfare reform told the Scotland Bill Committee: “It is critical that before they vote on a legislative consent motion all parties take the time to consider the bill’s impacts very carefully and think about whether we want such impacts in Scotland.”—[Official Report, Scotland Bill Committee, 4 October 2011; c 330.] Citizens Advice Scotland wrote: “CAS firmly believes that although this is a Westminster bill covering a reserved area, its impact on the people, services and economy of Scotland as well as the current devolution settlement, means the Scottish Parliament must scrutinise its proposals and assess its probable impact”. Those comments lead me to talk about the ad hoc committee, about which there has been some debate. It is vital that the committee is put in place. I heard the evidence that was given to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, of which I am deputy convener, and I read the evidence that was given to the Health and Sport Committee and the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, and it is clear that lots of folk out there do not know what is about to hit. We need to ensure that we scrutinise the awful Welfare Reform Bill every step of the way. Mary Scanlon said that there had been numerous meetings between the Scottish Government and Westminster about the issues. Numerous meetings do not always lead to answers and conclusions, in any way, shape or form, as the evidence that the Local Government and Regeneration Committee took from COSLA clearly showed. There might have been numerous meetings, but they have provided no answers and a huge amount is still up in the air. At a very early stage, Aberdeen City Council instructed officers to investigate the impact that the proposed reforms would have in Aberdeen city. No one could even guesstimate the impact on the council and the economy, because the information is sadly lacking. We could take all day to talk about particular issues and look at the higher levels of the debate, but let me turn to individuals. Mrs Scanlon mentioned the pilot on assessment in Aberdeen. If that is how assessment is going to be carried out throughout the country, I have grave concerns. I will give members an example. A woman attended my surgery recently whose claim had been rejected. What troubled me was that the assessment was of a secondary condition and not the main condition—the condition that would have prevented her from working. If that is the kind of nonsense that will occur throughout the country and pass for assessment, I am sorry but that is not good enough, and nor is putting people through that sort of torture. Many members have hit the nail on the head: the welfare reforms are about reducing the budget by £2.5 billion. They are not about the proper prior assessment of the impacts of that reduction. They are about Tory, and now Liberal Democrat, dogma. I do not think that the reforms will lead to deficit reduction; in fact, I think that they will lead to deficit expansion as folk become more and more reliant on services when they reach crisis point. Whether members agree that there will be deficit reduction or, as I believe, deficit expansion, I think that most of us in the chamber agree that if the Government’s proposals are pushed through, they will lead to massive devastation in people’s lives in this country. In my opinion, that is unacceptable.

Given the obstacles to the publication of the statement of reasons, such as data protection and the official secrets acts, why has the Scottish Government introduced a bill on the issue?

Will the member take an intervention?

Mr McDonald has given us a good example. Some bureaucrats prefer to focus on packages rather than on outcomes. Does he agree that some of the new learning disability packages being delivered in Aberdeen by organisations such as Cornerstone are much more outcome based?

2. To ask the Scottish Government when the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth last met the leader of Aberdeen City Council. (S4O-00490)

I am sure that the cabinet secretary will not keep me in the dark with his answer to this question. The next time that the leader of Aberdeen City Council meets the cabinet secretary, I am sure that he will thank him for the increased amount of money that is heading towards the city of Aberdeen—£5.3 million this year. Does the cabinet secretary intend to discuss with Aberdeen City Council and other councils the business rates incentivisation scheme to help encourage sustainable growth?

Will the member give way?

We often hear about the bankers’ mistakes and what the bankers have done. I am no friend of the bankers, but I remind members—particularly those on the Labour benches—that it was up to politicians to regulate the bankers. Tim Geithner, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, recently said that a lot of the problems with deregulation emanated from London and from Gordon Brown.

A light touch is better than none at all, which is what happened under Labour. Many Labour members still believe that Gordon Brown was the economic and financial messiah. However, in the words of Mrs Cohen from Monty Python’s “Life of Brian”: “He’s not the messiah. He’s a very naughty boy!” The sooner they learn that, the better. I turn to the impact of the budget statement on my constituency and the city that I represent. The thing that really strikes me is its impact on the child tax credit, which was mentioned by Malcolm Chisholm and others. That will put 10,000 more Scots children into poverty, many of whom will be in my constituency. The figure is £40 million for nearly 400,000 children—I thank Save the Children for highlighting that for us. In complete contrast with the Scottish Government’s early intervention policy, that is early damnation. We, as a Parliament, must condemn that aspect of the statement.

I am not at all happy about that, because the UK Government is changing the measures. I am happy about the measures that Save the Children, rather than the Con-Dem coalition, wants. Another aspect that affects my constituency is oil and gas taxation. I have talked previously in the chamber about the need for stability on that, to ensure that the North Sea sector continues to be vibrant. We heard nothing about that in the autumn statement, yet the chancellor is happy to take £54 billion in oil revenues in the next few years. This Parliament should control those moneys, so that we can make the right decisions for this country.

We will have a referendum, but not when Mrs Scanlon wants it—we will have it when we promised to, in the second half of the parliamentary session. I welcome this week’s infrastructure announcements, which will be welcome throughout Aberdeen and the north-east. I want better rail links between Aberdeen and Inverness and between Aberdeen and the central belt. We were promised them many years ago by various other Governments, but nothing much came of that. I am confident that we will get the rail network right this time. Like Mr Doris, I welcome the fact that we are planning for future strategic infrastructure projects. That is the way to do it. I hope that we will see the beginnings of the Aberdeen western peripheral route sooner rather than later. As many members have heard me say, that road was first planned in 1948. When we think that we will finally get it, somebody is always there to kibosh it. I hope that the court situation will be dealt with sooner rather than later, so that we can eventually get on with that infrastructure project. Transport is a key part of infrastructure spend in the areas that many members represent. I disagree with Mr Chisholm’s point that we should not spend money on roads. The AWPR is vital to the economy of Aberdeen and the north-east. It would be wrong to say that no road building whatsoever should take place. When the Labour Party sums up, will somebody tell me what its plans are for road building and whether it commits to the AWPR? I support the motion in Mr Swinney’s name and I hope that all other members will do so, too.

9. To ask the Scottish Government what recent discussions it has had with Aberdeen City Council about improvements to the trunk road network in the north-east. (S4O-00437)

Many in the north-east are concerned about maintenance and the current trunk road network being downgraded because of anticipation of a new trunk road network—I know that we are all waiting in anticipation for that. Can the minister assure me that maintenance work is continuing as usual on roads such as Anderson Drive?

In the 2011 budget, it was accepted that Lord Hutton’s recommendations would form the basis for negotiation. Why in the past wee while has the UK Government not negotiated—[Interruption.] It has not negotiated. The general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress has said that there has been no formal dialogue with the unions since 2 November. Where is the negotiation?

When?

First, I pay tribute to Dennis Canavan, who saw the St Andrew’s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill through the Parliament. Mr Canavan was terrier-like in his actions on that issue. The first mention that I found of Mr Canavan with reference to St Andrew’s day was in the Hansard of 30 November 1983, when he asked the then Secretary of State for Scotland, George Younger, whether he would declare St Andrew’s day a public holiday in Scotland. George Younger replied: “I have no authority in this matter as public holidays in Scotland are fixed locally by district councils.”—[Official Report, House of Commons, 30 November 1983; Vol 49, c 871.] As I said, Mr Canavan was terrier-like in seeing his bill through Parliament, but I think that we still have quite a bit to go in celebrating St Andrew’s day. Saint Andrew, of course, was a Christian apostle, the brother of Saint Peter, who became the first pope of the Catholic church. Andrew was the founder and first bishop of the church of Byzantium and is the patron saint of Scotland, Ukraine, Russia, Sicily, Greece, Romania, the diocese of Parañaque in the Philippines, Amalfi, Lucca and Malta. He is also the patron saint of fishermen, fishmongers, rope makers, golfers and performers. Andrew preached in Asia Minor and in Scythia along the Black Sea, and was crucified in Patras on the northern coast of the Peloponnese. He was crucified on an X-shaped cross—that is, a saltire—reportedly at his request, as he deemed himself unworthy to be crucified on the same type of cross as Christ. Legend has it that Andrew became the patron saint of Scotland in the 10th century after Angus II led an army of Picts and Scots in a battle against the Angles at Athelstaneford. On the day of the battle, Angus is said to have seen an X-shape in clouds in the sky, representing Saint Andrew—that is where we get our flag from. Angus’s army won the battle and Angus proclaimed Saint Andrew to be the Scots’ patron saint. The feast of Saint Andrew is observed on 30 November in both the eastern and western churches and it is of course Scotland’s national day. Only yesterday, Archbishop Mario Conti said in the Independent Catholic News: “Scotland is a nation with an ancient history, and that history is inextricably formed in the shape of the cross; the cross of St Andrew. ... To this day the St Andrew’s Cross is a flag which all Scots hoist with pride, and the emblem of our patron is emblazoned on many buildings and coats of arms, logos and letterheads across our country. And so it seems logical that we should mark our dear saint – the first of the apostles to be called by Christ – through a properly recognised national holiday.” I agree with the archbishop on that point. St Andrew’s day, however, is more than just a religious feast day; it should be about the history, the heritage and the culture of our nation. I sometimes feel that Scots abroad and Scots’ descendants abroad celebrate Saint Andrew more than we do. The first Society of St Andrew was formed in Charleston, South Carolina, on 30 November 1729. It was founded by immigrant Scots, many of them from Aberdeen and Fife, and dedicated to the relief of suffering and distress among the inhabitants of the infant colony. Twenty years later, the St Andrew’s Society of Philadelphia was started by 25 Scottish residents, to give relief to the poor and distressed. Two signatories of the declaration of independence were founder members of that society: James Wilson, a graduate of the University of St Andrews, and John Witherspoon, a native of Paisley and president of Princeton college. I could go on listing famous St Andrew’s societies across the world, but I do not intend to do so. We have our own ancient St Andrew’s Society of Aberdeen, and I have been pleased to attend its celebrations on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, I will not be there tonight. Those are all worthy examples of celebrations of our history, heritage and culture elsewhere in the world, and of the provision of poor relief in the early days in North America. Having talked to folks abroad about this, I believe that, even today, St Andrew’s day is a bigger event in other countries than it is here in our own nation.

I was just coming to that point. The Sunday Times this week stated that St Patrick’s day had made some €80 million for Ireland, which is good news for the hard-pressed Irish economy. Mr McDonald will know that, a few years back, the city of Aberdeen had some Commonwealth visitors at the time of St Patrick’s day. They asked whether the St Andrew’s day celebrations were wilder than those for St Patrick’s day, and I had to tell them that that was, unfortunately, not the case. We must make St Andrew’s day better. In the past two years, children have had the day off, but that was due to adverse weather conditions last year and strikes this year. I want them to be able to have the day off for real, so that they can celebrate our patron saint on our national day.

Will the member give way?

Will the member take an intervention?

I agree completely and utterly with the member that we should not substitute St Andrew’s day for another public holiday. However, I would be willing to substitute another holiday with independence day, which should also be a public holiday. Does he agree?

Will the member give way?

First, the member is describing not a school bus but a bus that goes past schools. School buses are something different. Does she agree that initiatives such as hydrogen buses in Aberdeen, and schemes such as Getabout, run by Nestrans—I declare an interest as a former chair of Nestrans—are ensuring that active and sustainable travel continues?

Will Malcolm Chisholm give way on that point?

I thank Christina McKelvie for lodging the motion for debate. Like Mr Gibson, I tried to lodge a motion earlier but the matter was, of course, declared to be sub judice. Also like Mr Gibson, I wrote to and got a reply from Mr Robathan. Although I could talk about that—it would not be sub judice—if I strayed into it, I might go into some unparliamentary language. Therefore, I will talk about the victims of nuclear testing worldwide, who have suffered immeasurable pains and who deserve justice and the Parliament’s deepest respect. I will explore some of the policies that other countries have made in response to the call for compensation for the victims of nuclear testing, along with the compensation policies that the UK Government has offered the Australian Government while it neglects the people in its own backyard. I am interested in the subject because, early doors after the election, I was visited by a nuclear test veteran—Bill Bryce, who stays in my constituency—and relived with him some of the moments that he experienced. The things that those folks have faced over the years are absolutely horrific and, although four of the five original nuclear weapons states—the US, France, Russia, and China—have concrete compensation policies for nuclear test victims, we still fail on that. Following the passage of the US Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990, any victim of nuclear weapons testing in the US was entitled to receive an apology from the US Government and monetary compensation for any diseases that were contracted as a result of radiation exposure. Compensation varies from case to case. However, all awards fall within the range of $50,000 to $100,000—or £32,000 to £64,000. There is also a special fund of $45 million to compensate those who were affected by testing in the Bikini Atoll and the Enewetak Atoll of the Marshall Islands. Since the compensation programme began to operate in 1992, more than 34,000 claims have been filed and the US Government has awarded $1.6 billion. The huge number of claims reflects the widespread effects that nuclear testing can have on a country and its people. Although the other countries with compensation programmes have not been as forthright in their reparations, France, Russia and China also have policies to compensate their victims of nuclear testing. In France, long-standing opposition to even acknowledging the French Government’s responsibility for nuclear testing was finally put to rest in 2009. After significant arm twisting by advocacy groups and politicians, the French Government agreed to set aside a €10 million fund to compensate cancer victims and others who were affected at the north African testing sites. There is also an amendment to the law that states that additional funds will be added if the first €10 million runs out. The Russian and Chinese compensation packages are not quite as good as that, but their Governments have recognised their nuclear test victims. It is time for the UK Government to live up to the words of the armed forces covenant and compensate the men who were affected by the tests that the United Kingdom carried out.

10. To ask the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with the United Kingdom Government regarding reducing VAT on house extensions and other improvements. (S4O-00367)

Does the cabinet secretary agree that reducing VAT on alterations, repairs, maintenance and extensions for dwelling-houses would cut down on the amount of black market work that currently goes on, maintain health and safety standards and boost legitimate trade, and could lead to a greater tax take for the Exchequer?

Sometimes, we Aberdonians are accused of inbred pessimism. Presiding Officer, you witnessed my pessimism this morning when, in response to someone who asked how I was, I said that I was fair to middling. That is sometimes how we look at things. I remember that, in the early 1970s, when I was a young lad at the harbour with my grandfather watching the Queen flick a symbolic switch to turn on an oilfield, a guy next to my grandfather said, “It’ll nae last five minutes, loon.” That kind of pessimism, I am afraid, has been displayed by politicians over many a decade since those early discoveries—“It’ll nae last.” I am glad that we have a major breakthrough in the chamber in the fact that everyone is saying that we have a number of decades of oil and gas to come. In his opening speech, the minister said that there may be more than £1 trillion of revenue out there in the North Sea. Depending on what survey we look at, there may be up to 35 billion barrels of oil left out there. The income from that would be £2.45 trillion, which is a phenomenal sum. We must do our level best to extract as much as we can from the North Sea fields over the coming decades. I agree with Sarah Boyack about carbon capture and storage. Peterhead, if the CCS project goes ahead there, has a part to play, because pumping the carbon into the existing pipeline networks could force more oil out, so that we get even more revenue. Although I agree that we should be at the forefront of CCS technologies, we are now a little behind, unfortunately. We had a stall on Peterhead previously, a stall on Longannet and we are now back to Peterhead. The UK Government needs to make some decisions on this so that we can get the most we can out of the North Sea. I see Tavish Scott shaking his head, but that is the reality. We are behind because the investment has not been put in place.

There is £1 billion available, but nobody in Westminster wants to spend that £1 billion. It is a bit like the fossil fuel levy—£200 million is available, but we are getting only half of it now, after years of arguing for it. There has to be a certain amount of honesty here. If the UK Government is going to make that investment, let it do so and not keep the money for ever and a day while other areas of the world are allowed to advance in the technology. I agree with Tavish Scott that we also have to be prepared for the decommissioning of fields. I want to make sure that all that work comes to Scotland. Health and safety have featured a lot in the debate today, and rightly so. I was at the oil and gas remembrance service just the other week in Aberdeen. There are very few folk in my area who have not been touched, or who do not know somebody who has been touched, by a tragedy in the North Sea. We have made great strides, but there is further work to do and we cannot rest on our laurels. Skills are the most important thing. We have heard today that 15,000 jobs could be created in this sector in the next five years if we get this right. We have got to get this absolutely right. Sometimes, there is a little doom and gloom in the chamber about education and providing the skills for the future, but I am extremely optimistic about some of the things that I have heard in recent times. As Maureen Watt mentioned, many of us visited Aberdeen College the other day. It is extremely exciting that the college hopes to have an oil rig simulator up and running soon. That will give the necessary practical skills to the folk at that college.

We need to encourage all of our supply chain to bid for contracts, and we must do everything that we can to secure contracts for companies here. However, I remind the member that we are bound by European Union procurement rules, so it might not be as easy as he thinks. The greatest asset that we have is the people. I have a brother who is currently working in Perth, Western Australia, and folk I went to school with are all over the world using skills that were developed in Aberdeen and the North Sea. We must continue to ensure that the skills are developed. What I take from the PWC report is that we need to look at having some kind of academy, which I hope would be in Aberdeen. It does not have to be forced on the educational institutions in Aberdeen, because it seems that the University of Aberdeen, Robert Gordon University and Aberdeen College are moving that way anyway. My key message is that we must build the skills for the future so that Aberdeen, the north-east and Scotland as a whole remain at the forefront of the oil and gas industry, not only here in the North Sea but worldwide.

He is that sort of minister. [Laughter.]

Will the member give way on that point?

I pointed out that there was £200 million in the fossil fuel levy, only half of which has been released thus far. I, too, could say that I am going to invest £1 billion in something that will never happen, and I think that that is the intention of the Westminster Government. It has said that it will invest in CCS, but it has turned down the Peterhead proposal and the Longannet proposal, and is now considering another proposal for Peterhead. Will the Peterhead project be refused funding again, with the result that the Government goes back to Longannet?

Hear, hear.

Will the member give way?

Will the member take an intervention?

I thank Mr Johnstone for giving way. Without pointing the finger of blame at anyone, I would say that it is at times such as this when we have to be a little innovative in what we do. Does Mr Johnstone agree that the approach the Government is taking through projects such as retail rocks in Aberdeen and the funding of district heating systems is a way to regenerate communities without huge cost or the need to bring in investment from elsewhere?

The member says that the cuts are world cuts, but many other countries are investing in capital projects to put their people back to work and ensure that the worst excesses of the cuts are not felt. Unfortunately, we do not have the levers of power in this Parliament to do all those things. Does the member agree that one of the first things that might be considered is a rethink of the increase in the Public Works Loan Board interest rate?

Does Mr Fraser agree that business improvement districts, which have been pushed forward by the Government, are immensely beneficial in ensuring that town centres do not suffer as badly as they otherwise would from the factors that he mentions?

3. To ask the Scottish Government what guidance is issued to national health service boards about the funding of advocacy services. (S4O-00330)

Given that information from the Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance shows that Grampian is now the lowest spender on advocacy services in Scotland, will the cabinet secretary put pressure on NHS Grampian to meet its responsibilities in delivering effective advocacy services?

The other year, I was involved in a very successful charrette in Aberdeen, which was backed by the Scottish Government and which many people complimented. Does the cabinet secretary see charrettes playing a bigger part in helping to plan new and existing streetscapes? I think that a charrette is an extremely worthwhile exercise.

Will the member give way on that point?

I declare an interest, as I am a member of Aberdeen City Council, which I am about to mention. There has been some discussion today about turning old buildings into modern, sustainable ones. Will the minister comment on the rebirth of Marischal college, which is an old building that has been given a new, modern design with a top BRE environmental assessment method rating, and which is a jewel in the crown of Aberdeen? Does she agree that those who were involved in the project deserve some praise for that?

Will the member give way?

Ms Baillie pointed out that there were 95 delayed discharges in July and 12 in April. Does the member acknowledge that in October 2001, when her Executive was in power, 2,162 were waiting for more than six weeks, when Iain Gray was the minister?

I refer members to my entry in the register of members’ interests. I am a member of Aberdeen City Council, which I will mention. There was a bit of a spat between Jackie Baillie and me earlier on delayed discharge. I think that 95 delayed discharges is too many delayed discharges and I would like the figure to be zero. I certainly do not want to go back to the dark days when 2,162 folk were waiting to get out of hospital.

It was implemented by a minority SNP Government and will be continued by this SNP majority Government. I was elected to Aberdeen City Council in 1999, and it used to perturb me greatly to see the number of folk whose discharge from hospital was delayed. I hated the term that was used at that time even more, so I am glad that we have got away from that horrid term “bedblocking”, which was so often used. To ensure the required changes, Aberdeen City Council in collaboration with NHS Grampian put a number of things in place, including Rosewell house and Smithfield court. I have had the benefit of a family member being in the latter. I will not say too much about those things, because another member of Aberdeen City Council will speak after me and I think that he will cover some of those points. On enablement—I will use that word rather than re-enablement because my council colleague Jim Kiddie hates that term—there has been an £800,000 investment in a new enablement service, ensuring that the occupational therapy teams are in place with the physiotherapists to keep folk at home whenever that is possible. Nanette Milne referred to e-health and telecare in her speech. In Aberdeen, we have some of the leading lights in Scotland in that area. I agree with Nanette Milne that we are not rolling out some of the schemes quickly enough. We should look much more closely at the knowledge and skills that we have in order to roll that out a bit more. I hope that the minister will deal with that in his summing up. A very important issue that no one has talked about in the debate is the impact of the Westminster Welfare Reform Bill and what we will try to do here in that regard. Evidence on the bill that was given at the Local Government and Regeneration Committee today showed that there will probably be impacts on aids and adaptations and there will certainly be impacts on transportation. There will also be impacts on home care budgets right across Scotland. All that will cause major difficulties if we hope to achieve what the motion lays out. It is up to all of us to scrutinise the Welfare Reform Bill to the nth degree because—let us be honest—we do not know very much about its detail. However, we do know that it will have a major effect on some of the poorest and most needy in our society. Jim Eadie spoke earlier about learning disabilities. We still have very old-fashioned service delivery throughout the country to provide for the needs of people who have learning disabilities. There was a furore in Aberdeen a couple of years back when we closed a day centre, but it was the right thing to do, because the service that was provided there was extremely old-fashioned. We now have services that allow a level of independence for folk that was not there before. I pay tribute to the charity Inspire, which has taken over some services and ensures that people are out and about, living life to the maximum. That is what we should aspire to do right across the country, whether for our older people, our folk with learning disabilities or our people with chronic ailments. I hope that we can learn the very good lessons that are taking place in some areas and ensure that best practice is rolled out throughout Scotland. I hope that the minister will comment on that in his summing up.

The Local Government and Regeneration Committee has heard in evidence that the reason why there might have been a delay in delivering the change fund is because local government budget cycles do not necessarily tie in with those in the health service. Will the minister consider that issue to try to make the process easier in future?

I am glad that the minister has outlined all the things that the Scottish Government is doing for veterans, but it seems that the UK Government is failing on certain issues. We now have the military covenant, but veterans are still having to fight for their rights through the courts. I am thinking particularly of nuclear-test veterans. What does the minister think of the fact that certain veterans have to fight the UK Government in court to get their rights?

In addition to the countries on the list that Ms McLeod has cited, China has compensated some of its veterans. The Isle of Man, a dependency, has also compensated its veterans. The only country that has not done so thus far is the UK.

Will the member give way?

I refer members to my entry in the register of interests. The fact that I am a member of Aberdeen City Council will come up in my speech. When I joined Aberdeen City Council, a social worker asked me how many children I had. When I said that I had four nieces but no children, that person said to me, “No, you have several hundred children of whom you are now the corporate parent.” I was a little shellshocked. I should say that I now have a nephew, too—he would never forgive me if I did not mention him. We must all recognise our role as corporate parents. Recognising that completely changes our attitude to policy formulation and to what is best for the children of whom we are corporate parents. I will touch on a couple of points that have been made about the financial aspects of being a corporate parent. Claire Baker and Liz Smith mentioned Dundee City Council’s overspend on children’s services. At the Local Government and Regeneration Committee today, we had the pleasure of hearing evidence on the budget from David Dorward, who is Dundee City Council’s chief executive. We talked about needs-led and demand-led social work. Mr Dorward said that he was not too troubled by the council’s overspend on children’s services—I am sure that he does not say that often—because it is needs led. The reality is that the members of his social work team, who are the professionals, have decided that the interventions that have been made are right at this time, and Mr Dorward and his finance officers have recognised that that team is right. I would not say that he was relaxed about the overspend, but he realises that it is because of needs-led requirements. That is how to deal with such matters. Claudia Beamish said that the approach should be about putting children’s needs first and not about saving money. I say to everyone in the chamber that it can be both. Local authorities have often spent lots of money on putting children away from their areas. Aberdeen City Council did that in yesteryear, and some children were sent as far away as possible, which broke any ties they had left in their city of birth. That did neither children nor the public purse any good. I am glad that I played a part in trying to change that. It seemed far too easy for some to send children away. The approach was, “Let’s forget that problem and send them away.” We would not do that as parents, so why would we do it as corporate parents? Such attitudes still exist in some places and we must change them completely. Another issue that used to perturb me is that we as corporate parents were happy for kids to be in residential homes that, if they were our houses, we would deem inadequate. Residential facilities need to be the best that they can be for the children of whom we are corporate parents. New-build residential homes have recently been constructed in Aberdeen. Across the country, we need to look again at what the stock provides. During the recess, I had the great pleasure of visiting Barnardo’s in Aberdeen. I visited a number of its services. I talked to foster carers, who are some of the most dedicated people whom a person could come across, and visited its Linksfield residential home. I am mightily impressed by the work that is going on in that organisation in my home city, and ask the minister to say in her summing up what we will do to help to recruit and support more foster carers and adoptive parents. The best way of attracting folk to become foster carers is to get them to talk to other foster carers, because they are normally the most enthusiastic and passionate people, and they will tell others exactly what they can get out of fostering. Another thing that has perturbed me over the years is the lack of joined-up thinking that there sometimes is between local authorities, courts, children’s panels and children’s reporters. In her summing up, will the minister say how she sees things gelling together a little bit better? There are opportunities in the planned children’s services bill. Will she say how she sees the bill helping us with what we are discussing? I will never forget that I am a corporate parent. All of us must recognise what our duties are to the kids for whom we are responsible.

They were needs led.

We have heard from many lawyers today. Like my colleague George Adam, I come at the issue from the aspect of an ordinary punter, but during my study before the debate, I considered the views that many people have expressed over the past few months and years. When the then Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, gave evidence to the Scotland Bill Committee, she said: “there is a real danger that we will have not just harmonisation of our criminal law on procedure and evidence but, indeed, a complete loss of identity for Scots law, unless the Supreme Court process is genuinely rarely exercised and takes place in the context of a matter that is of substantial constitutional significance across the United Kingdom or where there is a very new piece of jurisprudence that is clearly ambiguous.”—[Official Report, Scotland Bill Committee, 8 February 2011; c 479-80.] I have huge respect for Elish Angiolini, who worked in north-east Scotland before she became Lord Advocate, and I take on board her views in that regard. I am extremely proud that Scotland has kept an independent legal system. That is quite unusual, in light of the many pressures since the act of union on other institutions that existed in this nation. When I speak to people from elsewhere, it is interesting that they say, “You have an independent legal system. Surely that means that you are independent.” I wish that that were the case. I think that we are seeing a minor attack on our legal system. In October 2010, the Scottish Law Commission made a submission to the Advocate General for Scotland’s review of devolution issues and acts of the Lord Advocate, in which it said: “Scots criminal law is a jurisdiction which is not only constitutionally separate from English criminal law. Many of its practices and procedures differ substantially from those of English law. There is no more reason why a particular feature of Scots criminal law need be the same as any feature of English criminal law in order to comply with the requirements of the Convention as there is that any feature of either system should be the same as a feature of Russian law to achieve that purpose ... The European Court of Human Rights has recognised the ... inadvisability of attempting to introduce a ‘one size fits all’ approach to disparate systems of criminal justice.” Members talked about equality of partnership in the union. Why must certification take place in Northern Ireland, Wales and England but not in Scotland? That is very wrong and shows that some of the parties in the Scottish Parliament do not believe in equality of partnership in the union. Maybe folk need to think about that as we near the referendum. I watched—in the dead of night—a fascinating BBC 4 documentary on the Supreme Court. I do not think that the court’s membership necessarily reflects society in the UK.

Even if I had recorded the programme and given it to George’s auntie, she would probably be half asleep before the first 10 minutes had passed. Flippancy aside, we are talking about a serious matter. The Supreme Court does not reflect the society that we live in, and the matter needs to be looked at in greater detail. The opening of the Supreme Court gave us the partnership of Cameron and Clegg, because that event was the first time that they had ever really spoken to each other. In many regards, the Supreme Court has a lot to answer for.

Will the member take an intervention on that point?

I realise that local and central Government have a part to play in co-ordinating. However, in the two severe winters that we have had, it has been almost impossible for gritters and snowploughs to get to every place. Does Lewis Macdonald agree that individuals have a responsibility to clear their own paths, to help their neighbours and to do as much as they can with the support that local and central Government can give them?

Many councils have done well in telling the public what they can do in the course of the winter. However, it is important that they spell out exactly what the priorities are so that folk know that, when severe conditions hit, certain places will come first: the main roads, schools—Mr Bibby referred to that—and sheltered housing, for example. I must say to Mr Mason that my first priority would not have been to clear outside the town house in Aberdeen or Glasgow city chambers; I would have regarded the sheltered housing in my ward as the priority.

Will the member give way?

It is difficult for some employers, but it should be easy for other employers to allow a certain amount of flexibility. As Mr Robertson knows, because we have spoken about it before, the vast bulk of teachers in Aberdeen city seem to live in Aberdeenshire and vice versa. If teachers cannot get from the city to a school in a rural area, for example, they should report to their nearest school, which may prevent schools from having to close completely. Last year, one of the big problems was not that kids could not get to school but that there were no teachers when they got there. The need for such flexibility must be addressed.

Everyone has said that the debate is very emotive, and it is. There is probably no one in the chamber or watching the debate who has not been touched by cancer in some way, whether directly or through family or friends. I am in the chamber today having been selected for the Aberdeen Central seat at the last minute because the lady who was originally selected was diagnosed with cancer. Everyone has been touched by the disease. However, the solution is not a separate drugs fund. Colleagues have touched on the issue already but the argument is worth repeating. If we created a separate drugs fund for cancer, what other drugs funds would we have to create? That is the key question for me in this debate. There are huge numbers of other diseases, some of which are terminal, for which it could be argued that patients would benefit from a separate drugs fund. Where would it end? Alison McInnes summed up the issue in her speech. She quoted her colleague Ross Finnie, who criticised the Tory plans for a cancer drugs fund, saying: “The Conservative plan for a Cancer Drug Fund is unfair. The Scottish Medicines Consortium is the independent body designed to recommend the cost effectiveness of drugs. Politicians shouldn’t be second guessing the SMC.” I agree with those comments. I think that members from all sides of the chamber, apart from the Tory side, would agree with them, and we should take cognisance of that.

I listened to yesterday’s debate on mental health in which there seemed to be agreement that it was up to clinicians to decide what to prescribe. For the situation that we are debating, physicians can submit individual patient requests. That is the way to do it. I do not see a problem with that at all. As politicians, we should not second-guess those who are experts in their field.

I have given way once and I have only four minutes. I wish the debate was more about prevention than about setting up a separate drugs fund. We have heard about the early detection fund, and I certainly welcome the moneys that have been put into that, as I am sure members across the chamber do. However, sometimes we do not deal with prevention very well. MSPs often have the opportunity to meet folk in the Parliament who are involved in various health organisations, such as Melanoma Action & Support Scotland, whose representatives Ken Macintosh invited to the Parliament the other week. Mary Fee attended that event as well. We could have simple solutions to deal with some problems. Melanoma is on the increase, but we charge VAT on sunblock and sunscreen. That makes no sense to me whatsoever.

Thank you, Presiding Officer. We should think about prevention rather than necessarily having to deal with cures all the time.

I am proud to be a member of this Parliament and proud of the fact that the previous Parliament approved the most ambitious climate change legislation that exists. I am surprised that the legislation ended up being passed unanimously, having heard what Alex Johnstone said just now. In recent times, we have heard David Cameron pontificating about the Conservatives’ green agenda—so green that the Conservatives changed their party logo to a tree. However, if atomic Alex Johnstone gets his way, maybe his preferred leadership candidate can change the logo of the party in Scotland—whatever its name may be—to either a belching chimney or a nuclear power station. Much has already been done in Scotland to create a low-carbon economy, but much more needs to be done. I am glad that the Government is doing all that it can in that regard. I am proud to represent a constituency in the energy capital of Europe. Already, in my constituency and throughout Aberdeen, much has been done to create a low-carbon environment. Lewis Macdonald mentioned Aberdeen Heat and Power Company; I am pleased that politicians of all hues in Aberdeen have backed that company. The key for me is not just the saving in carbon emissions, but the saving in costs to the people who pay the bills. We have heard about the volatility of fuel prices. As a result of the schemes that exist in Aberdeen thus far, residents’ fuel bills have been cut by up to 50 per cent, which is pretty spectacular stuff. Beyond that, the emissions from buildings have been cut by 56 per cent. Much more needs to be done on combined heat and power, however, and I am proud that the Government recently gave £1 million to Aberdeen Heat and Power Company to extend the services that it provides. Combined heat and power is one of the things we need to see across Scotland. There have been failures in certain areas and ministers have been talking to experts in areas where it succeeded.

Aberdeen Heat and Power Company received £1 million from the Government recently and is also seeking moneys from elsewhere, including the private sector. In itself, that can create the required investment. I pay tribute to those who work at Aberdeen Heat and Power Company—in particular, Janice Lyons, who has been in the vanguard of this work and who deserves tribute. The work that she has done has led to the organisation’s receiving the outstanding achievement in housing award at the UK housing awards 2008, and the sustainability award in the innovation and progress category of the Guardian newspaper public sector awards in the same year. That shows how good Aberdeen Heat and Power Company is. I also thank the previous Government for having the foresight to locate the Scottish European Green Energy Centre in the University of Aberdeen. I am sorry if I am being too parochial, but that is the way it is. That organisation’s existence has led to a number of achievements, not least of which is the securing of €40 million for the development of the European offshore wind deployment centre. That is extremely important for the city and the shire and the sooner it is in place, the better. It is a partnership between the public and private sectors. I pay tribute to Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, Vattenfall Wind Power UK and Technip for bringing it forward. In Aberdeen city and shire, we have developed a huge amount of skills to be used in the renewable energy sector. I hope we will be able to ensure we can develop further skills to be at the forefront of this new industry. I fully agree with the motion in the name of the minister and I urge everyone to support it.

What are Mr Chisholm’s feelings about small-scale biomass, such as the biomass boiler that is being used to deal with the energy needs of the new Marischal college project in Aberdeen, which has received European funding?

Hear, hear.

We heard from Mr Stevenson that Siemens is withdrawing from the nuclear market. Countries around the world—including Austria and Germany—are moving away from nuclear power and trying to use alternative technologies. Is the UK somewhat different from all those other places?

I hear the member’s analogy about King Canute. A previous chancellor, one Gordon Brown, was a man who ignored what was up ahead. What does Mr Kelly say about that?

4. To ask the First Minister what recent discussions the Scottish Government has had with the United Kingdom Government regarding changes to the tax regime for North Sea oil and gas. (S4F-00116)

I thank the First Minister for his wise intervention with the chancellor. I hope that the UK Government will listen. Does the First Minister agree that the Prime Minister’s comments yesterday, in which he branded as “stupid” the 68 per cent of Scots who believe that North Sea oil revenue should be allocated to Scotland, were disgraceful? Would the Prime Minister’s disparaging comments not be better reserved to describe his chancellor and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, whose fag-packet formulation of changes to the North Sea tax regime have caused an immense amount of grief to the industry and those who work in it? [Interruption.]

Can Mr Baker provide one international example of a country that cut its corporation tax rate and did not generate an overall increase in corporation tax revenue? I will give him a clue: the answer is none.

I share my colleague Rob Gibson’s positive vision of Scotland’s future, although it is clear that others in the chamber do not. Mr Carlaw was trying to stamp his authority on the Tory leadership campaign today—more than anything else he is a proud Scottish Conservative and Unionist—but I share Murdo Fraser’s view. The Scottish Conservative Party should think about changing its name. He has called for action and a new centre-right party in Scotland. I therefore suggest that the party should call itself the “Centre Right Action Party”. That acronym is already often used to describe the Government in Westminster. That is a good option and I hope that the Conservatives will consider it. I agree with some of what Alex Johnstone said, much of which was reiterated by Dennis Robertson, but I will make one correction to Mr Johnstone’s speech. He said that no local authority fell below the 85 per cent average in respect of funding, but two local authorities do so: Aberdeen City Council and the City of Edinburgh Council. The 85 per cent funding level that was guaranteed in the SNP manifesto would have seen Aberdeen get an extra £4.1 million this year. I look forward to that being introduced in the next financial year.

If Mr Johnstone had paid attention to the Press and Journal after the Minister for Local Government and Planning’s recent visit to Aberdeen, he would have known that she said that it will begin in the next financial year. That will be very welcome in the city of Aberdeen.

The Minister for Local Government and Planning also said that there would be no effect on any other local authorities. That is welcome throughout the country. Economic growth has featured in many speeches. We need to move Scotland forward and I agree with Alex Johnstone about the contribution of north-east Scotland in driving our economy forward. There have been many welcome announcements this week on the back of the Offshore Europe conference. Energetica has moved forward, with some £350 million already committed, and there has been a new development of economic land at Dyce Drive in the past few weeks. Those developments are vital. As Mr Johnstone and Dennis Robertson stated, the Aberdeen western peripheral route is also vital. I am glad that the Minister for Housing and Transport is in his seat in the chamber now, because I know that he shares my frustration at the situation that we find ourselves in, whereby a small minority of people are blocking north-east Scotland’s economic future. I believe that we require the holy trinity—as Callum McCaig, the leader of Aberdeen City Council called it—of the Aberdeen western peripheral route, improvements to the Haudagain roundabout and the third Don crossing to ensure that we can retain our vibrancy. It seems, however, that that small minority may win through. I hope that the minister will do everything within his power to ensure that we are able to move those projects forward. Beyond that, we need to examine the law as a whole. I have no problem with people objecting to projects—it is their democratic right to do so—but it is disgraceful when a small minority blocks what the majority wants. Certain parties who are involved in the blockage have become, in my opinion, professional nimbys who will do everything possible to stop every project. That is not good enough. With £1.2 trillion-worth of reserves left in the North Sea, we need to ensure that Aberdeen continues to drive the economy of not only the north-east of Scotland or Scotland as a whole, but the United Kingdom. That is where Alex Johnstone and I disagree, because I believe that that £1.2 trillion should be invested to secure a better future for the nation of Scotland and that is why I cannot wait for the independence referendum.

I am glad that infrastructure in the north-east has been mentioned again. Do all members of Alison McInnes’s party support the Aberdeen western peripheral route, changes at Haudagain and, of course, the third Don crossing? There are mixed messages and I believe that some members of her party are members of Road Sense, which is the organisation that is holding up the WPR.

Paisley also gave us Andrew Neil, but it must be forgiven for some things. I declare an interest in sculpture, as I was at the forefront of ensuring that a statue of Robert the Bruce appeared in front of Marischal college in Aberdeen. Sculpture is immensely important. We should celebrate the fact that we have Mr Stoddart, Alan Herriot and some of the best sculptors in the world and that we help them to export their amazing art.

It will be briefer; it is a simple question. Labour had a manifesto commitment on music tuition and it has said similar things in Aberdeen before now, but it has never said how it would fund the commitment. Will the member give an indication of how Labour would have funded its manifesto commitment?

13. To ask the Scottish Government what support it gives to help small companies bid for public contracts. (S4O-00044)

I thank the minister for his response and welcome him to his post. The Government needs to do everything possible to allow small companies to access public contracts. Are there regular discussions with the Federation of Small Businesses on some of the difficulties faced by businesses?

To understand what is going on here, we must look at the key facts from Oil & Gas UK’s survey. According to it, the tax change has rendered marginal 25 projects, £12 billion of capital investment, the production of 1.04 billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent, and 30 per cent of investment in projects that were previously considered likely to proceed in the next decade. The reduction in production will necessitate energy imports worth £50 billion, result in lost tax revenues of £15 billion to £20 billion and forgo the creation of around 15,000 jobs. The tax change will accelerate the decommissioning of 20 fields and associated infrastructure by up to five years. Those are the key facts, but the realities are somewhat different on the ground. We can talk about numbers, but the changes to which I referred have had a major effect on people in my constituency, throughout the north-east and across Scotland. After the tax increase was implemented, it was interesting to find as we went around the doors during the election campaign in Aberdeen that people were talking about it in their droves and had real concerns about it. I am sure that members who campaigned in the city at that time know that that was the case. I always say that when the oil industry sneezes, Aberdeen and the north-east catch a cold. Previous downturns in the industry have caused great difficulty for the area that I and others represent. Concern for the future of those who work in the industry and those who rely on it is what troubles me the most. As my colleague Mark McDonald said, the tax increase was a bolt from the blue for the industry. Prior to the budget, there were noises that everything was going to be okay, then suddenly something different happened. Mark McDonald is right to say that what is required is stability and consultation. Situations such as this, when no consultation has taken place, can often scare companies into going elsewhere. We can see that, across the globe, there is a move to areas with stable or lower tax regimes. In recent times, we have seen investment in Brazil and Angola and away from places such as the UK and Kazakhstan. We must get stability back and ensure that in future such measures are accompanied by a great deal of consultation. We need the chancellor to talk to the oil and gas sector and to listen to what it has to say, because the short-term gains that he intends to make mean that tax take in the long term will probably be much lower than it would otherwise have been. My plea is for cross-party support for Mr McDonald’s motion, because it is vital not only for the north-east of Scotland but for Scotland as a whole.

I declare an interest, in that I am a member of Aberdeen City Council and a member of Grampian joint police board. It was disturbing to hear Mary Fee blame the Cabinet Secretary for Justice for cuts, when it was the previous Labour Government that almost bankrupted the UK—the cuts have been passed on. The Labour Party is all too good at blaming bankers as well. Perhaps they should consider last week’s comments by Timothy Geithner, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, to the effect that Gordon Brown was the man who was responsible for relaxing the regulatory regime that let the bankers go wild. Blame on two fronts, I would say.

Not at the moment. I am pleased that crime is now at a 32-year low. The reason for that is the effort that the cabinet secretary has put in over his term in office to increase police numbers. When I joined Grampian police board in 1999, officer numbers were sitting at under 1,100. In 2007, there were 1,374 officers in Grampian and now there are 1,516. That is welcomed by communities across Aberdeen and the rest of the north-east of Scotland, and has made huge impacts on tackling the kinds of antisocial behaviour that my colleague Colin Keir talked about earlier. Beyond that, there have been innovative schemes in my area. The council created the city warden scheme, which has won national awards. I hope that the cabinet secretary will consider that work in order to determine whether it can be replicated in other parts of Scotland. Again, it has been of huge benefit to the communities that I represent. Earlier, Alison McInnes talked about local policing. Like my colleague John Finnie, I believe in bobbies before boundaries. We have to consider carefully how to proceed because, if we continue to have eight police forces, there will be cuts in police numbers, which is the last thing that people across Scotland want. We also need to ensure that the police co-operate with other public bodies to ensure that savings can be made. Last week, I was pleased to attend the opening of a combined medical centre and police station at Whinhill in my constituency. That is good practice. What is not good practice—I do not blame Grampian Police for this—is that there was an inability to create a joint fire and police headquarters for Grampian. That will be regretted for a long time to come. I will move on to some local issues. In Aberdeen, there has been cross-party agreement that something needs to be done about the use of airguns. I know that the cabinet secretary is restricted in what he can do and I hope that we get all the necessary powers to deal with that sooner rather than later. I pay tribute to Councillors Norman Collie and Muriel Jaffrey, who have been at the forefront of trying to put a stop to some of the nonsense that has happened, particularly in the east end of my constituency. I agree with Mary Fee—who seems to have left the chamber—about the situation of women prisoners. The fact that most female offenders have to go to Cornton Vale is particularly bad for families. I am pleased that the justice secretary managed to ensure the reopening of the women’s unit at Aberdeen, which is immensely beneficial. There is some controversy about the future of the prison estate in the north-east of Scotland, especially HMP Grampian, but anyone who has ever been in Craiginches will tell us that it is not fit for purpose and that we need to improve that estate. It should have happened years ago, but Mr MacAskill has dealt with that. Although I am sure that we will discuss my scepticism about some of the issues surrounding HMP Grampian, the good thing about it is that it will have that dedicated women’s unit, so that families will not have to travel mile upon mile to visit their loved ones while they are inside. I agree with colleagues about cashback for communities. The £30 million restriction is a nonsense. Funded projects such as midnight football have made a huge difference, both in the city that I represent and elsewhere. I say all power to the cabinet secretary’s elbow in trying to ensure that we get more of that cash.

On a point of order, Presiding Officer. As a new boy, I am not completely and utterly au fait with standing orders but, in another place of which I retain membership, a summing-up speech should sum up and should not bring in new stuff, as Mrs Mitchell has done. Will you please make a ruling on that?

I thank Dr Murray for bringing the motion to the chamber for debate. I remember going to the circus with my grandparents as a treat when I was a young boy. I thought that it was absolutely fantastic, and a great time was had by all. However, the end of the trip was spoiled for me because I had the opportunity to go to see the animals after the event. The animals were confined in small cages, and I realised—even at that young age—that that was not right. I am glad to say that, in certain places, a progressive attitude to the issue has been taken. For example, Aberdeen City Council banned wild animals in circuses quite a long time ago. While I was preparing for the debate, I came across an extremely disturbing article in the New Scientist. It reported on a study by Stephen Harris of the University of Bristol that showed that, on average, wild animals in circuses spend only 1 to 9 per cent of their time in training and the rest of their time—91 to 99 per cent—enclosed in extremely small cages. Such a cage is no place for a tiger, a bear or a lion. There are further restrictions, even within those restricted cages, in that nothing is put in the cages to keep the animals entertained. The study says that, even in the larger pens, the animals’ owners do not give them anything to play with—for example, bears are not given logs to play with in case they use the logs to escape the cage. Animals are being kept in confined spaces with absolutely nothing to do. That is barbaric. The study also considered travel sickness and stress levels among the animals. The report says: “Travel also takes its toll, although the evidence is limited. The study cites data showing that concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol in saliva from circus tigers remains abnormal up to 6 days after transport, and up to 12 days in tigers who’ve never travelled before.” That shows clearly that the animals are completely and utterly stressed out by travel, which is unacceptable. I return to my original point. As a small child, I was disturbed to see animals in confined spaces. That was many moons ago. Today, we should go beyond what happened in yesteryear and ensure that no child, no adult and no animal must see such conditions again. Jim Paice, the UK environment minister, said in the UK Parliament that banning wild animals from circuses could breach human rights legislation. In this case, I am interested not so much in human rights as in animal rights. I hope that we can do something about the situation in the near future. I thank Dr Murray again for bringing the issue to our attention.

I am interested in Ms Ferguson’s comments about the cancellations of major projects. I am most interested in how Labour would have paid for those projects and what projects it would have sacrificed to pay for the likes of GARL. For example, would those have included the Aberdeen western peripheral route? Beyond that, does the member recognise that, if the Parliament had not made the mistake of paying for the Edinburgh tram system, there would have been much more to spend on infrastructure projects elsewhere?

Does the member agree that there are huge differences in the amounts that health boards spend on advocacy to deal with folk such as the people who were questioned in the SAMH survey that she mentioned? Does she think that there should be a look-see to find out how much each health board is spending on that, and that some guidance should be given?

I declare an interest as a member of Aberdeen City Council. I will make no apology for mentioning the council throughout my speech. However, I should probably apologise to my colleague Mark McDonald, who has heard me refer in many speeches to the wonders of Aberdeen’s 1952 local plan. He probably thought that he would not hear very much about that again. However, the minister prompted me to go on about it, because he mentioned the great secretary of state, Tom Johnston, who wrote the foreword to the 1952 plan, in which he talks about—I paraphrase here—the red weevils of bureaucracy holding up progress. In renewables, it is not the red weevils of bureaucracy that are holding up progress but a lack of political will, not in this place but elsewhere. In a document from the Public Accounts Committee at Westminster, Margaret Hodge criticises the Westminster Government—in particular, the current Labour leader, Ed Miliband—for the lack of progress that has been made in the UK and the fact that we are failing to meet the targets that were set. Mr McArthur talked about the progress that had been made since Chris Huhne took over as the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. I am sorry, but I cannot see the progress that Mr McArthur is talking about.

That does not really signify progress. As far as I am concerned, progress would be for the Scottish Government to get the fossil fuel levy that we deserve in order to invest in renewables here in this country. Quite frankly, if we do not get on with that investment, we will be left behind. Just recently in Aberdeen, we saw the all-energy conference, which is the UK’s largest renewables conference, where countries from across the world had displays. If we do not invest, we will not make progress; other countries will make the running in this sector when it should be us making the running. I will be slightly parochial and talk about Aberdeen. I am sure that I will be accused of being parochial on a number of occasions in this chamber. Jeremy Cresswell, who is the chair of the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, said that Aberdeen’s phenomenal concentration of renewable energy expertise is critical to the success of the renewables revolution—which not just Aberdeen but the whole of Scotland will go through. I am pleased that Mr Cresswell heads up an organisation that has gained €40 million from the European economic recovery plan for the proposed European offshore wind deployment centre, which will be in Aberdeen bay. I hope that that facility will create jobs and economic benefit for our area and will attract scientists, researchers, engineers and supply-chain companies. Dennis Robertson was right to highlight the part that small businesses should play. Lewis Macdonald questioned the minister on district heating. I was really pleased that the previous Government invested £1 million in Aberdeen Heat and Power, which is expanding its operation, particularly in the Seaton area of my constituency—long may that continue. Aberdeen Heat and Power has an amazing champion—a formidable lady called Janice Lyon. I hope that the minister will have the opportunity to meet Mrs Lyon soon; I am sure that he will find that quite an experience. I hope that combined heat and power will be expanded in Aberdeen and elsewhere, because it is one measure on which we should concentrate. Duncan McNeil says that competition is fierce. That is the case in the sector, which is why I do not apologise for returning to the point that we must invest now, because it might be too late to do so in five or 10 years’ time. The Westminster Government must ensure that we get the moneys that we deserve so that we can invest in the future. Let us reap the opportunities for Scotland from the renewables sector.

Will the member give way?

Thank you very much, Presiding Officer. I welcome you to your new post and let me say, in the Doric manner, weel done, quine—I hope ye dee brilliantly in the job and I’m sure that ye will. I will begin by following on from Jackie Baillie, who called for compromise from the Government. I think that there also needs to be some compromise from the Opposition in future years of the session. I am honoured to have been elected to serve the people of Aberdeen Central in the Parliament, and I will work for all my constituents to the best of my ability. I am proud that the previous SNP Administration froze the council tax, put more bobbies on the beat and froze prescription charges. Those are issues that matter to people out there. I am also pleased that Aberdeen gained a new, state-of-the-art dental school in the previous session. We have new council houses in places such as Tillydrone, with more to come in areas such as Stockethill. I was also immensely proud to chair the 3Rs board, which has seen the construction of 10 new schools in our city, including at Mile End and Seaton. However, I was disappointed that the previous Government’s attempt to review the local government funding formula was defeated by 31 votes to one at COSLA. That was a brave attempt by Mr Swinney to review the formula but it was, unfortunately, overturned by others. I believe that that formula required to be changed because it disadvantaged Aberdeen. I am gratified that the SNP manifesto pledged that no local authority will get less than 85 per cent of the funding average. That will benefit Aberdeen City Council by £4.1 million annually, which is good news for our city and for the citizens who rely on the services that Aberdeen City Council provides. Many people believe that the streets of Aberdeen are paved with gold but, in truth, we have poverty amid plenty. In the Ashgrove, Seaton and Stockethill areas of my constituency, more than a quarter of the population has a disability or limiting long-term illness. Although policies for which we have responsibility, such as free personal care, free prescriptions and free concessionary travel, can make a big difference, the benefits system is still entirely controlled by London. Last week in Aberdeen, all the political parties on the council united to express their concern about the proposed changes to the mobility element of disability allowance. I hope that all parties in the chamber will unite in opposition to the benefits cuts that will have a major impact on the disabled members of our society. To change the subject matter slightly, I hope that we will also see the end of the court case that is holding up the construction of transport projects that are vital to the future and economy of the north-east. The western peripheral route was first envisaged in 1948 and our area has waited for far too long for it to become a reality. It is a great pity that two objectors are holding up that project, which has a knock-on effect on projects such as improvements to the Haudagain roundabout and the dualling of the Balmedie to Tipperty road. I notice that the transport minister is sitting here and I am sure that he will take notice of all that I am saying about those matters. I hope that the courts, too, will take notice and reach a decision shortly. Aberdeen is the powerhouse of the Scottish and UK economies and I want that to be true for many years to come. Private and public investment in areas such as the extension of the airport runway, the deepening of Aberdeen’s harbour mouth, and the development of the energetica corridor show that there is still confidence in our area. However, that confidence can so easily be shattered by others making wrong decisions elsewhere. The Chancellor of the Exchequer’s decision to raise the supplementary rate of corporation tax on the oil industry from 20 to 32 per cent has knocked confidence and has already led to the cancellation of a number of projects. Optimism has plummeted. This morning, Annabel Goldie talked about sharing our assets but, in this case, our assets are being plundered for short-term gain rather than being used for long-term investment in the north-east and the rest of Scotland. For far too long, the oil industry has been Westminster’s cash cow but, this time round, the overmilking might well lead to the cow running dry long before it should. That would be immensely damaging for the people of Aberdeen, the north-east and Scotland as a whole. It is for those reasons and many others that I believe that Parliament should hold all the levers of power so that we can take long-term, strategic decisions for the good of our people rather than have others taking short-term decisions that, at the end of the day, will benefit no one. That is why I believe that there should be an independence referendum and that the people of Scotland should decide their own future.

Does Mrs Milne agree with her colleague Sandy Wallace, who worked in the social work sector in dealing with alcohol? He has gone on record on many occasions to say that the Conservative Party should have backed minimum pricing. What does Mrs Milne think of his comments?
