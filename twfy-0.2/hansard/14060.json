That has given the Parliament the opportunity to discuss what is a worrying issue in Scotland and, indeed, across the whole of the United Kingdom. It is an issue that I would much prefer not to discuss, but we need to do so.</p><p>I thank the Trussell Trust, Barnardo&#8217;s, Oxfam, Nourish Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland for providing briefings prior to the debate. I welcome representatives from the Trussell Trust, who are in the public gallery. The commitment and dedication of the volunteers at the Trussell Trust and at other emergency food providers are to be whole-heartedly commended. I also thank everyone across Scotland who volunteers their time in their communities, whether in food banks or in other activities, to provide support for those in need.</p><p>It is important to put on the record the work of food banks and what they are. A food bank is a place where, after referral, people can go to obtain food.</p><p>The Trussell Trust&#8217;s food banks provide a minimum of three days&#8217; worth of nutritionally balanced emergency food; they also support people in crisis. Clients cannot obtain unlimited food&#8212;they may redeem up to three food bank vouchers in a row. More than 90 per cent of the food that is given out is donated by the public. I saw that at first hand when I took part in a food collection day before Christmas at the Tesco store in Port Glasgow. I was genuinely overwhelmed by the generosity of the public on that day.</p><p>Every person who goes to a Trussell Trust food bank is referred by a professional such as a social worker, a welfare rights adviser, a tenancy support worker or a school liaison officer, and the food bank tries to work with the individual to help them to resolve the underlying cause of the crisis.</p><p>Members who look at the scale of the issue will be shocked. In 2011, there was one Trussell Trust food bank operating in Scotland, but by October 2013, the number had increased to 43. There are more than 400 food banks operating throughout the UK, and the Scottish Government report, &#8220;Overview of Food Aid Provision in Scotland&#8221;, which was published in December 2013, identified 55 food banks and soup kitchens. However, many independent, community and small-scale providers are not reflected in the figures.</p><p>A report that was published by Church Action on Poverty and Oxfam stated:</p><p>&#8220;We estimate that over 500,000 people are now reliant on food aid&#8212;the use of food banks and receipt of food parcels&#8212;and this number is likely to escalate further over the coming months.&#8221;</p><p>That is a UK figure.</p><p>However, there are concerns that the figures reflect only part of the problem. Nourish Scotland is concerned that the statistics that show increased demand for emergency food provision are just the tip of the iceberg. In fact, Citizens Advice Scotland told me that, in January alone, Scottish citizens advice bureaux advisers referred more than 400 people to a food bank or other emergency support. That is the highest monthly figure that CAS has ever seen.</p><p>Oxfam told me that visits to West Dunbartonshire Community Foodshare&#8217;s service have increased markedly. The service had 186 visits last October, 215 in November, 237 in December, and 358 in January this year. The increasing trend is affecting families, too: there were visits from 36 families in October, 64 in November, 123 in December, and 145 in January.</p><p>Of the 1,967 vouchers that have been distributed by the Inverclyde food bank since it started operating in April 2010, 250 have gone to families and 266 to single parents. In total, those 1,967 vouchers have fed 2,571 adults and 974 children.</p><p>More recent figures for Scotland estimate that somewhere around 55,000 or more Scots rely on emergency food aid. As Oxfam states,</p><p>&#8220;No one turns up at Foodbanks because there is an opportunity for free food. They are driven there in sheer desperation.&#8221;</p><p>The charity indicates that 34 per cent of those who turn to emergency food banks are experiencing some sort of benefit delay. Citizens Advice Scotland and the Trussell Trust put the figure at 30 per cent.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland states:</p><p>&#8220;Evidence from bureaux, and from food banks themselves, indicate that benefit delays and welfare reform are driving increased need for food parcels.&#8221;</p><p>According to the Trussell Trust,</p><p>&#8220;Since April 2013, welfare reforms have impacted many people and resulted in more referrals to foodbanks as a result of benefit delays or changes.&#8221;</p><p>As we know, people on benefits usually have the lowest incomes, with no savings to cover unforeseen circumstances. Even a slight delay in receiving benefit can mean that they have no money to buy food for themselves or their children.</p><p>One of the most alarming pieces of evidence from Oxfam highlights the depths of some people&#8217;s distress. Some people who use food banks have actually started handing back food, not because they do not need the food that they have been given but because they cannot afford to turn on the electricity to cook it. What does it say about our society when people cannot even afford to cook the food that they have been given?</p><p>Despite all that evidence, the UK Westminster Government fails to act&#8212;and it is not just the coalition Government, as we are now in the middle of a Dutch auction between the Tories and Labour to see who can cut benefits the most.</p><p>As if that is not bad enough, we heard the news this week that members of the House of Lords are complaining about the declining standards of their subsidised catering facilities, with one peer being &#8220;scarred&#8221; when his table booking was cancelled suddenly and his party were &#8220;unable to lunch elsewhere&#8221; because his wife was wearing a tiara. That surely proves that the Westminster elite is completely out of touch with the reality of austerity UK.</p><p>However, there is an opportunity to change all that.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22883964", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Banks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members&#8212;particularly Opposition members&#8212;who supported the motion, which has allowed the debate to take place.

At the outset of my speech, I want to congratulate a minority sport that is not participating in the Commonwealth games&#8212;cricket. This morning, the Scottish cricket team qualified for the 2015 world cup. It is only the third time in the team&#8217;s history that it has done so, so I congratulate Cricket Scotland for a tremendous achievement.</p><p>The Commonwealth games has already brought, and will continue to bring, major investment into the city of Glasgow; it will also provide a legacy further afield&#8212;it will touch all parts of Scotland. I will highlight a couple of areas regarding legacy 2014 and the work that is being done to achieve a long-lasting legacy that will touch many aspects of life in Scotland.</p><p>The first issue that needs to be cleared up is what is meant by &#8220;legacy&#8221;. Legacy 2014 is about using the unique opportunity of the Commonwealth games in Glasgow to deliver lasting change across the whole of Scotland, both in the run-up to the games and in the years beyond. The legacy ranges from business and economic opportunities to sporting and cultural opportunities. I hope to highlight just a few examples of how the legacy can help to benefit not just the people of Glasgow, but the whole of Scotland.</p><p>On the business and economic side, we have heard from other members about the investment in new facilities. Obviously, there is the potential business legacy of boosting the Scottish economy by building and maintaining the facilities. There is also the opportunity to promote a skilled Scottish workforce and to enhance their reputation both at home and abroad.</p><p>The games will also raise the profile of Scotland as a place to do business, and as a welcoming host for many events&#8212;cultural events or sporting events such as the Ryder cup. It will help to promote Scotland as a distinctive brand, and it will showcase goods and services, develop relations with international markets and improve Scotland&#8217;s reputation as a good place in which to do business.</p><p>I turn to sport. A range of programmes are either in place or being developed to build a lasting legacy from the Commonwealth games. They include programmes to encourage more people to get active and improve their health, and programmes to create plans to promote sport and exercise. There is a 10-year plan to adapt for Scotland key elements of the Toronto charter for physical activity&#8212;which makes the case for increased action on tackling physical inactivity&#8212;that links the charter directly to the Scottish Government&#8217;s legacy ambitions for the games. In addition, the Scottish Government and its partners continue to spread the word about the importance of physical activity by informing people through a range of websites about how and where they can get involved.</p><p>Another legacy element of the games is provision of funding and support to local authorities and schools to help them to deliver physical education, physical activity and sport in the curriculum and in the wider community. That will help children and young people to develop the skills and confidence that they require to take part and to become more active.</p><p>Community sports hubs have been developed as homes for local clubs and sports organisations; they are based in local facilities including sports centres, community centres and schools. Sportscotland is working with all 32 local authorities across the country to ensure that at least 150 sports hubs are in place by 2016. By working together, those clubs can benefit each other via shared facilities and funding applications, thereby creating a better outcome than they would normally achieve by themselves.</p><p>Looking to the future, there is the organised workforce programme, which involves investment from sportscotland in sport governing bodies and affiliated clubs to support them as they develop, and to sustain a strong infrastructure. That work includes increasing the number and quality of sport coaches and volunteers, and it will involve additional training.</p><p>There are wider cultural aspects to the legacy programme, including the Glasgow 2014 cultural programme, which is a nationwide celebration that will play a central role in how Scotland hosts and welcomes the games. Culture 2014 is the Scotland-wide cultural countdown to the games and what comes afterwards, and festival 2014 will transform the host city from 19 July to 3 August 2014.</p><p>The minister mentioned the Queen&#8217;s baton relay, and other members have mentioned the opening and closing ceremonies of the games. Those events will be used as innovative platforms for promoting and celebrating Scotland&#8217;s culture, not only in Scotland, but in the Commonwealth and even more widely.</p><p>There are other initiatives to widen the cultural aspect. One example is a celebration of dance across Scotland, which involves key dance organisations and brings together professional and amateur dancers of all ages to dance in public spaces in our towns, villages and cities, thereby ensuring that the games legacy widens its appeal.</p><p>We should also welcome the celebrate venture, which is a joint venture that involves the Big Lottery Fund, Creative Scotland, the Heritage Lottery Fund and sportscotland. It is a &#163;4&#160;million fund that will provide opportunities for community groups across the country to mark the arrival of the games by holding an array of community-focused events&#8212;including events that have a cultural focus&#8212;to celebrate the people, places and culture of the Commonwealth. The celebrate venture offers grants of up to &#163;10,000 to sports, arts, community and heritage organisations throughout Scotland.</p><p>In music, the big big sing&#8212;which we heard about earlier&#8212;is a developing nation-wide celebration of singing that is being produced by the Glasgow UNESCO city of music initiative. It will inspire thousands of people to sign up and get singing in the lead-up to and during the games. The big big sing will provide a wide range of opportunities for participation.</p><p>In addition, there is the 2014 new music biennial, which will involve the performance of 20 brand new commissions by some of the UK&#8217;s most exciting composers being performed across the UK. It will culminate with two special weekend events at London&#8217;s Southbank centre and in Glasgow to coincide with the Commonwealth games, and it is also part of the culture 2014 and festival 2014 programmes.</p><p>There is no greater legacy than connecting with children. I tend not to talk about my family when I am speaking in the chamber or outside it, but my eldest daughter came home from primary school one Friday a few months ago and told me about Clyde, which her class was discussing that week, and the &#8220;Clyde&#8217;s Story&#8221; video that can be seen online. I thought, &#8220;She&#8217;s six and she&#8217;s getting involved.&#8221; She is being encouraged to learn a bit more about Scotland and the games. I thought that it was tremendous that my six-year-old came in and started telling me things. That was not the first time it has happened and I am sure that it will not be the last. However, I thought that what her primary school was doing was excellent, and it highlights where primary schools have such a tremendous opportunity, and that they are delivering on it.</p><p>I suggest that another key part of the legacy is the sportspeople in our communities. I know somebody who unfortunately missed out on the Delhi games due to having sustained an injury prior to them. It is Jane Armour from Inverclyde, who had been picked for the Scotland weightlifting team. The team for the Glasgow games has not been announced yet, but I wish Jane and the others who want to participate every success and I hope that she manages to compete in this year&#8217;s Commonwealth games.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games and Legacy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My colleague John Mason spoke earlier about minority sports and the legacy from the Commonwealth games for those sports.

I wish Annabel Goldie well in her recovery.</p><p>Towards the end of 2013, I went to HMP Greenock and throughcare support was one of the issues discussed. I was greatly interested by the project as the revolving-door syndrome has blighted the Scottish criminal justice system for far too long and action is required to break that cycle. I also know that no one-size-fits-all strategy will suit everyone. However, for any system to be successful, a number of factors must be in existence. One such factor is a prison estate in which overcrowding is at a minimum or non-existent. Locking prisoners in their cells for 23 hours a day is no good to them, the prison officers or society. I offer my thanks to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Prison Service for improving the prison estate, which has aided this particular project.</p><p>I am aware that an evaluation event on the throughcare support project took place today. I was contacted after that meeting by an individual who had informed folk that they would be in touch with me. As part of the discussion, we talked about what one issue&#8212;what part of the system that needs to be improved&#8212;they would raise in this debate. The person suggested housing. Part of their email said:</p><p>&#8220;We need to examine ways in which the process can be finally tuned to better meet the needs of returning citizens. This would involve better planning, resources being made available and a move away from the attitude that returning citizens do not deserve or need the same access to housing as others within the community.&#8221;</p><p>That was a very important point.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw rightly highlighted the project details, so I will not repeat what he said. However, I will highlight a few brief points. First, I commend all the staff who are involved in the project. They appreciate the necessity of intervention to aid people&#8217;s journeys, so that they do not return to prison. Secondly, the project initiation document is detailed enough while retaining flexibility to aid prisoners. The project is in its infancy, so regular scrutiny and evaluation of its success is critical to its long-term viability and in delivering for prisoners and society. Thirdly, in order for any multi-agency project to be successful, the delivery of the plans needs to be robust, which is certainly the case for the housing issue that I mentioned.</p><p>I was informed about an example in which one person who was released&#8212;not from HMP Greenock, but from another prison in the estate&#8212;had various issues, including mental health issues. The project at that prison did not work for that person. The charity Positive Prison? Positive Futures stepped in to assist and it has ensured that that individual has remained out of the criminal justice system and prison.</p><p>I whole-heartedly welcome the throughcare projects across the prison estate, particularly in HMP Greenock. Once again, I congratulate Annabel Goldie and Jackson Carlaw on the debate and I thank all those who are delivering for the project. We must always strive to deliver the best service that we can. I am sure that the initiative at HMP Greenock will continue to aid more prisoners and our society.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843781", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Throughcare Support Project (HMP Greenock)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Annabel Goldie on securing the debate and Jackson Carlaw on his speech.

I am more optimistic about Scotland&#8217;s future through independence, as all the evidence demonstrates that Scotland is a wealthy nation. Indeed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that Scotland could be the eighth wealthiest nation in the world.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s wealth is also built on solid financial foundations, a diverse economy and substantial economic potential in the new industries, such as biotechnology and renewables, as well as current key sectors such as food and drink, tourism and gas and oil.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s economy includes &#163;21.4 billion in construction, an industry that employs 170,000 people; &#163;11.6 billion in tourism, which supports 292,000 jobs; and &#163;39 billion turnover a year in manufacturing with a value added of &#163;12.7 billion and 127,000 people employed.</p><p>Scotland also has world-leading expertise in life science, world-class universities&#8212;five are in the world&#8217;s top 200&#8212;a multibillion-pound creative sector, vast energy resources, including oil, gas, tidal and wave, and fishing and agricultural resources. We also performed strongly as a location for inward investment and have a strong financial services industry.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s relative labour market performance has also strengthened. Scotland&#8217;s employment rate has been higher and its unemployment rate lower than in the UK as a whole for most of the recent period. Over each of the past 32 years, Scotland has contributed more tax per head of population than the UK as a whole. In 2011-12, Scotland provided 9.9 per cent of UK taxes and received only 9.3 per cent of total UK spending. That means that Scotland would have been &#163;4.4 billion better off as an independent country last year alone.</p><p>Our public finances have consistently been healthier than those elsewhere in the UK, giving us a strong platform on which to build economic success and maintain strong services. All that shows that Scotland can easily afford not only to be an independent country but to flourish with independence.</p><p>With independence, we could do so many things. We could build a new taxation system that stimulates the economy, builds social cohesion and sustains Scotland&#8217;s public services. We could develop a new tax system to boost our economy as well as the key industries, such as our renewables industry where Scotland has 25 per cent of Europe&#8217;s offshore wind and tidal energy potential and 10 per cent of Europe&#8217;s wave power potential. We could also focus on the Scottish Government&#8217;s aim of reindustrialising Scotland. That could see economic, industrial and taxation policies combine to boost our manufacturing sector, pushing it towards the level of manufacturing that there is in Germany, where manufacturing makes up around 21 per cent of GDP in comparison with 12 per cent here. With such a move, we would not only strengthen our industrial base and provide a more balanced economy but generate thousands of jobs.</p><p>We could also use the benefits of the taxation system to provide a better social security system&#8212;one without a bedroom tax and one that does not aim to be tougher than the Tories, which seems to be the Labour Party&#8217;s aim as stated by Rachel Reeves MP, the shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p><p>With independence, we can send a clear signal that Scotland is one of the most competitive and attractive economies in Europe, with tax rates designed to boost economic activity and support the fast-growing industries that already have a comparative advantage. Corporation tax rates remain an important tool for securing competitive advantage and for offsetting competitive advantages enjoyed by other parts of the UK, notably London.</p><p>A debate took place in the chamber only yesterday on Scotland&#8217;s future. In the debate, we heard a confused position coming from the Labour benches. A party of so-called principles that once emanated from socialist ideals voting against free school meals highlighted to me everything that is wrong with the Labour Party. To add to its woe, the Labour front bench was on television last night questioning, as did Patricia Ferguson today, the small business bonus scheme that has been a lifeline to many small businesses up and down the country and, as a consequence, our economy. Thank goodness there is growing support in the Labour Party for the Labour for independence banner among people who know that there is a better way for their party and for Scotland.</p><p>Although the economy is improving, there are ever-increasing numbers of people going to ever-increasing numbers of food banks as I have mentioned. Many of those people are the working poor and not just those who are unemployed. In response to Willie Rennie&#8217;s comments, I do not understand how that can be a positive. Scotland does not need to be like that. We are a wealthy country and, with power over all financial matters, we can work to alleviate the necessity for food banks.</p><p>I urge everyone in the chamber to vote for the motion in John Swinney&#8217;s name.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22827587", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Iain Gray&#8217;s comments took me back to the old adage that we are too wee, too poor and too stupid.

The important topic of community optometry has been discussed many times by the group, both while I have been convener and, previously, when I was an ordinary member. It is only right that we should give credit where it is due. That is certainly the case with those providing such a valuable service to local communities.</p><p>According to the latest figures, more than 180,000 people throughout Scotland have significant sight loss. That equates to about one in 30 people. As the motion states, that is set to increase, mainly due to the ageing population in Scotland. However, more than 50 per cent of sight loss can be avoided, and many older people are needlessly living with sight loss. Almost two thirds of sight loss in older people is caused by refractive error and cataract.</p><p>Eye health checks provide quick and convenient access to an expert, allowing for rapid diagnosis and timely intervention for treatment and management of any condition. As with other conditions, most eye disorders respond better when detected early, resulting in shorter recovery time, less patient distress and a reduction in the overall care costs. Early diagnosis and intervention, and the provision of information to people and their carers at the point of diagnosis, is critical. That is why regular eye checks and the work of community optometrists are important.</p><p>I believe that the service is also highly valued by the public. Community optometry plays a key role in primary care. Eye health checks reduce the burden on secondary care, retain people with minor problems in the community and improve the quality of referrals. The service has led to a 4.5 per cent reduction in referrals across Scotland, compared with an increase in England of approximately 23 per cent over the same period.</p><p>It is also worth highlighting in this debate the role of the Scottish vision strategy, which we have heard about from one or two previous speakers. It sets out a blueprint for improvements in eye care services in Scotland, giving direction to the work in this sector. Key strategy outcomes include: awareness and understanding of sight loss; early intervention, timely treatment and access to early and appropriate services and support; and the full participation in society of those with sight loss.</p><p>The Scottish vision strategy continues to enjoy the endorsement of a wide alliance of statutory, health and social care bodies, voluntary organisations, eye health professionals and individuals.

After all, one of the five key defence priorities is to reconfigure the defence estate inherited at the point of independence to meet Scotland&#8217;s needs. Retaining Faslane as a fully operational naval base and the addition of a joint forces HQ will sustain existing military personnel numbers at the base; moreover, civilian posts will be needed to support these operations and construction work will be required to reshape Faslane to the needs of a conventional Scottish defence force.</p><p>As for another aspect of defence capabilities, the recent events on the Clyde involving BAE Systems indicate the importance of shipbuilding to not only the Scottish economy but the Scottish psyche.

No matter which way members vote tonight, and no matter which way the electorate votes next September, the bill process has been transparent, inclusive and clear. Indeed, the briefing that we received from the Electoral Commission for today&#8217;s stage 3 debate states:</p><p>&#8220;Our overall view is that the Bill as amended currently meets this standard and reflects many of the recommendations that we made&#8221;.</p><p>The standard referred to is about having</p><p>&#8220;absolute clarity on the roles and responsibilities of those administering the referendum&#8221;.</p><p>Today, we will pass the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill.

The challenge for both sides in the debate is to rise to the occasion, to engender debate, to foster a greater understanding of the political process and to take the opportunity to encourage more people to take part both in the referendum and in future elections.</p><p>We all need to provide a clearer picture of what Scotland will look like in the event of a yes vote, or even a no vote, on 18 September. I look forward to the publication of the white paper on 26 November and I also look forward to reading the offerings from those campaign groups that will be encouraging a no vote. We need to know what the consequences would be for Scotland in the event of a no vote. On that point, I acknowledge the comments that Tavish Scott made earlier.</p><p>The referendum will provide the people of Scotland with the choice to make history.

I will also know that those who are no longer with us have done their part in keeping the independence flame burning through some tough times for the national movement.</p><p>The phrase &#8220;standing on the shoulders of giants&#8221; can be utilised all too freely, but today we on these benches are standing on those shoulders. We have a responsibility to lost friends, as well as to our families and colleagues, to deliver our shared dream of an independent Scotland that can provide a better future and opportunities for our future generations.

I recognise that the process is not easy.</p><p>My colleague Mike Russell MSP has been, and I am sure will continue to be, a strong voice in the campaign for a return to a passenger and vehicle ferry on the route. He is the member for the Argyll and Bute constituency, so I am sure that his support will be important as the campaign progresses.</p><p>I want a return to a passenger and vehicle ferry on the route for a number of reasons. It would provide town centre to town centre vehicle access and it would provide competition on the Clyde. I am sure that it would also have an environmental benefit, given that carbon emissions in Gourock would be reduced if vehicles did not have to go through the town to reach the Western Ferries route. I am also sure that the bigger ferry that would be required for the route would be more reliable and efficient. The current vessels are not perfect and it is clear that the MV Ali Cat is not reliable, particularly in the harsher months.</p><p>A vehicle and passenger ferry would bring economic benefits to both sides of the River Clyde. There might be an opportunity for a new ferry to operate on the route. Whether we were to get one ferry or more than one, as David Stewart proposed, and whether the new ferry was second hand or new, there would be advantages. The building of a new ferry or ferries would present opportunities for Clyde-based shipbuilders and others to tender for the work, which would bring even more economic benefits to West Scotland.</p><p>I appreciate that we must, as well as addressing the longer-term issue of returning a vehicle and passenger ferry to the route, address the short-term matter of the MV Ali Cat&#8217;s unreliability. In the longer term, we must also address the issue to do with the EU, which has been going on for many years. In recent years there has at least been some movement to try to deal with the issue; in the past it has been sidelined and never fully taken on.</p><p>I commend the hard work, dedication and determination of all the campaigners who care so much about the route. In particular, I thank the members of the Dunoon-Gourock ferry action group, whose drive and focus are helping to progress the issue.

The first of those is the bedroom tax, which is also commonly known as the spare room subsidy. Frankly, the policy penalises those who are in most need. It punishes those who are on housing benefit and there are simply not enough one-bedroom properties to make the policy work in Scotland. It takes valuable income away from those at the lower end of the income scale as they struggle to retain their house. The policy will also end up costing the state more as tenants of social landlords look to the private sector for housing, even though such housing generally costs more in benefit claims.</p><p>All the main unionist parties support the policy in one way or another. Labour introduced it for private sector tenants and the Lib Dems and Tories expanded it to cover the tenants of social landlords. It will be interesting to hear from Labour politicians, in their closing speeches, about their current position on the bedroom tax.

That is &#163;222&#160;million that could be spent on investing further in the Scottish economy, the national health service, local government or even colleges. As the finance secretary recently highlighted, Scotland is a prosperous nation. We know that. We have paid more in tax per head in each of the past 30 years than the rest of the UK. With the full fiscal and economic powers of independence, the Scottish Government could do more to strengthen our economy and to create more jobs.</p><p>However, the main gain from independence is that it will be fundamentally better for us all if decisions on Scotland&#8217;s future are taken by the people who care most about Scotland&#8212;that is, by the people of Scotland.

I am sure that his handling of the committee helped it to get to the point of recommending to the Parliament that the general principles of the bill be agreed to, which is recommended in paragraph 323 of the stage 1 report.</p><p>Taking a co-operative approach from the outset with the signing of the Edinburgh agreement, right up to where we are now, is a positive sign. It has ensured that the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill will be made in Scotland, for the electorate of Scotland to decide on Scotland&#8217;s future.</p><p>As for every bill that goes through Parliament, we received a tremendous amount of evidence. One key comment was from the Electoral Commission, which stated:</p><p>&#8220;this is a strong piece of legislation&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>as shown in paragraph 36 of the stage 1 report.</p><p>Issues of visual impairment and disability and other equalities issues are mentioned in paragraphs 302 to 306 of the report.

I genuinely believe that that is vital for democracy.</p><p>Whatever the outcome of the referendum, the process and the scrutiny thus far have been thorough and robust. I do not see how any side of the debate could use them as a mechanism for challenging the outcome if it goes against their particular wishes. We still have a few steps to take, but I have no reason to think that the level of scrutiny will differ from what has been brought to bear thus far.</p><p>Today is yet another historic day in Scotland&#8217;s journey. In little more than 12 months, we will have a better understanding of where that journey will take us. There will be robust debate, campaign literature, adverts, billboard posters and television and radio broadcasts aplenty, not to mention the social media campaigning that Tavish Scott obviously loves so much. It is right and proper to have such a robust debate. We all have our respective positions and we will take an active part in the campaigns up and down the country.</p><p>We have to work to inspire people to vote and to consider what they want Scotland to be like after the referendum.

I also know that the Parliament should be charting its own course to make decisions for the people of Scotland. It should not be concerned about developing rearguard action policies to deal with decisions from Westminster.</p><p>The Scottish Independence Referendum Bill allows that opportunity to happen. By the time it passes through the legislative process, no one will be able to say that the creation of the referendum has not been fair. Indeed, as the policy memorandum says, the bill&#8217;s main objective is to ensure that the referendum next year is</p><p>&#8220;a fair, open and truly democratic process which is conducted ... to the highest international standards.&#8221;</p><p>I welcome the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s comments earlier and in the letter that we received regarding amendments at stage 2.

It contributes about 12 per cent of our electricity needs, as we have heard. In 1930, Scotland had a mere 45MW of large-scale hydro, and the rest of the UK also had 45MW. In 2012, Scotland had 1,339MW of large-scale hydro, while the rest of the UK had 132MW. We currently have enough hydro power to provide almost 1&#160;million homes with their electricity every year. Hydro has been a reliable source of energy for decades; today we celebrate 70 years since the passing of the 1943 act.</p><p>In the race for cheaper, cleaner and renewable energy sources, it is too easy to forget the role of hydro power&#8212;not only in the past, but when we look to the future. There is potential for more than 1.2GW of smaller-scale hydro to be developed in Scotland, but some issues need to be resolved for that to happen. They include feed-in tariffs, which my colleague Rob Gibson touched on. Feed-in tariffs have been cut by a set amount every year, depending on the level of deployed capacity. Other issues include electricity market reform and delays in connecting new projects to the national grid.</p><p>Many, if not all, of those delays are due to the slow pace of the Westminster Government. With independence, a Scottish Government of whatever hue could provide stronger support to that key industry, which could certainly provide renewable energy to tackle the scourge of fuel poverty. The report on the achievability of the Scottish Government&#8217;s renewable energy targets by the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, which I was a member of until the report was drafted, highlighted that</p><p>&#8220;the support the Scottish Government can provide to the development of the renewables sector is limited by the current constitutional arrangements.&#8221;</p><p>It was also interesting to note that</p><p>&#8220;The Committee does not believe that there is significant evidence that the current constitutional debate is undermining investment decisions regarding renewable energy.&#8221;</p><p>That report also highlighted a number of issues that need to be addressed, including the transmission system and the charging regime. There is widespread concern that Scotland&#8217;s generators are being penalised for providing power while those in other parts of the UK receive generous subsidy.</p><p>Although the committee report welcomed the recent decisions that have been taken to level the playing field for mainland generators in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK, there is still concern that the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets&#8217;s proposed improved incremental cost-related pricing does not go far enough, and that island generators remain at a distinct disadvantage compared with those on the mainland. I have touched on that point in previous debates. The situation will render many projects uneconomic&#8212;I expect that Liam McArthur will touch on that in his speech, as he is an Orkney MSP. Given the significant renewables resources that are located on and around Scotland&#8217;s islands, a fairer system must be found.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report also mentioned the empowering of communities either to generate their own energy or to gain the maximum benefit from developments in their area. Microgeneration provides the opportunity for householders, businesses and communities to participate in the low-carbon economy. The importance of community and locally owned renewable energy is also recognised by the target of achieving 500MW of community and locally owned renewable energy by 2020.</p><p>I am aware of moves in West Scotland to create a community-led micro-hydro generation company. That would, I hope, provide hydro power to the grid and provide community benefits, much as similar community-led projects have worked with onshore wind farms. I genuinely believe that that is an exciting prospect for areas in West Scotland. The one that I know of is in Inverclyde, which as members will know has no lack of rainfall to provide the raw resource that is necessary to drive hydro power projects. A number of sites across Inverclyde are being looked at as potential locations for micro-hydro generation. It is hoped that they can be developed either in partnership with Scottish Water or as stand-alone community-interest companies.</p><p>By following a community-led approach, such as has been used by the Neilston community wind farm, we could empower community groups to generate additional funding for their areas while they generate electricity for the grid. Such funding could be used to help to combat fuel poverty and to improve energy efficiency in homes, or it could be used for a range of developments that are aimed at improving communities. Inverclyde Council has been investigating the possibility of hydro power schemes being in council ownership or control, as part of its approach to renewable energy generation.</p><p>It will certainly be interesting to see how those schemes develop and, I hope, combine to support communities in Inverclyde. It is of great interest to me that, in the past, much of the heavy industry in Inverclyde was powered by hydro power and that much of that infrastructure still exists. With a bit more investment, who knows what could happen?</p><p>Another positive side to community hydro schemes is that they can help to address flooding, which would be greatly advantageous in Inverclyde.</p><p>We need to make it easier for communities to come together with councils and businesses to form community interest groups to ensure that at least some of the profits of hydro power go back into those communities. For that reason, the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to retain the level of support for the sector is significant. That will certainly be a boost to the smaller developments that are being looked at across the country. Such developments face more challenging conditions and higher risks, so maintaining of support&#8212;unlike what appears to be happening in the rest of the UK&#8212;is significant and will provide some stability for investment. Further support through streamlining planning consents will also encourage the future development of smaller facilities.</p><p>In conclusion, hydro power has a long and successful history in Scotland. It provides a significant amount of clean renewable electricity. With the continuing support of the Scottish Government, there are good prospects for the future development of hydro power in Scotland&#8212;potentially on a smaller, community-led, basis.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693928", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hydro Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a timely debate that examines the past, present and future of one of Scotland&#8217;s most valuable assets&#8212;a source of renewable energy that can help to combat the current problems of high fuel bills and fuel poverty in many of our communities.

Members of the committee, including me, were able to question the minister on key aspects of the future of the planning system in Scotland. During that evidence session, I was pleased to hear the minister state that he wanted a planning system that would</p><p>&#8220;focus on delivering jobs and growth&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;facilitate investment in infrastructure&#8221;.</p><p>That reflects the Scottish National Party&#8217;s 2011 manifesto commitment, which said that</p><p>&#8220;a more efficient and effective planning system will be good for investment and growth.&#8221;</p><p>I am sure that that approach will be welcomed by many here today.</p><p>At the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, the minister also said that the Scottish Government is committed</p><p>&#8220;to making a transition to a sustainable, growing, low-carbon economy ... the primary focus of&#8221;</p><p>its</p><p>&#8220;proposals for the third national planning framework.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 22 May 2013; c 2151-2.]</p><p>As part of that, there must be a focus on areas that were previously developed but which are now, in effect, economically challenged communities. Regeneration is vital for such areas. I was therefore delighted to hear John Pentland&#8217;s comments about Ravenscraig and his welcome for Ravenscraig&#8217;s inclusion as one of the national development areas.</p><p>There are too many such sites in Scotland as a whole, and far too many in the west of Scotland in particular. I am happy that the Firth of Clyde area has been identified in the national planning framework as an area in which major change is happening or anticipated to guide the implementation of the national strategy. Regeneration is one of the key issues for the Firth of Clyde area; the others include green infrastructure and supporting investment in key economic sectors.</p><p>As I said, there are far too many areas in the west of Scotland in which regeneration is an issue. We need to encourage investment and development in such areas to breathe new life into their communities. I hope that the focus of the new planning framework and planning policy on economic growth will result in developments in such areas that will stimulate their local economies and bring much-needed employment. It is good to hear the minister talk of removing barriers to planning to help the economic development of our country. I know that, as other members have said, in some local authority areas in the west of Scotland, those barriers have been significant.</p><p>It is important that the public&#8217;s view is not ignored. I am pleased that the use of charettes in promoting early engagement and intervention is to be rolled out. I am sure that that will help to improve community involvement in the planning process, and I hope that it will ensure that those involved in the local economy and local elected representatives will have significant input in future developments that promote jobs and growth.</p><p>We in the Local Government and Regeneration Committee started our regeneration inquiry today, and community involvement is a key issue that arose not only in our discussion today but when we have done other pieces of work. Rather than things being done to a community, we must ensure that the community genuinely has a full and thorough input into what is going on in its area. Without such input, communities will not fully progress.</p><p>Public involvement in the planning system is crucial. Enabling local communities to have a say at the pre-application stage, through charrettes or some other process, will help to allay fears and will enable developers to adjust their plans so that local objections are minimised. Such an approach can help to make planning a more consensual activity than it has been in the past, when communities have felt that their views have been ignored.</p><p>Tourism is an important element of the Scottish economy and there is scope for more investment and jobs throughout the sector. The main issues report explores how the framework can support sustainable tourism.</p><p>I raised with the minister at the Local Government and Regeneration Committee the huge success of the cruise ship market. During the past year, more than &#163;42 million came into the Scottish economy as a consequence of cruise ship tourism. In May, more than 10,000 cruise ship passengers visited Greenock, which demonstrates the extent of the tourism potential in Inverclyde. The industry plays a huge role in bringing in additional revenue to the Scottish and Inverclyde economies, but the port of Greenock will turn vessels away this year, due to a lack of capacity. Discussions are going on between the Scottish Government and the port&#8217;s owners and operators, to ascertain whether assistance can be provided. I welcome those discussions. I was pleased with the minister&#8217;s response to my questions, and I hope that there will be a successful outcome.</p><p>I welcome this debate on the national planning framework 3 and Scottish planning policy, which will help to set the context for a modern planning system, with a focus on regeneration and growth.

I should put it on record that I have an RBS account.</p><p>Store, factory and bank closures are always a matter of concern because they affect people&#8217;s livelihoods as well as their local communities. That said, although the bank closures that we are discussing will certainly have a negative impact not only on Glasgow Shettleston but on Gourock, the closure itself will by no means destroy Gourock&#8217;s fabric. Moreover, the motion focuses on RBS closures but it is important to note that other institutions are closing branches. For example, the Nationwide Building Society has closed a branch of the Dunfermline Building Society in Alexandria in the west of Scotland.</p><p>A key element of a successful town centre can be the presence of a number of large high-street branded stores. That can bring comfort to localities, but I have to say that Gourock bucks this trend because, although there are larger chain operations such as the Post Office and a couple of bakers, many of the shops in the town are actually small independent traders. That augurs well for the future because the town already has a sense of resilience and pride. When I talk to people in the town about the bank closure, the message I get is that the people of Gourock will deal with this sad news and move on.</p><p>Nevertheless, the decision to close the branch is disappointing. When I contacted RBS, I was told that the reason for the closure was, as has already been pointed out, that the number of people using the branch has fallen by nearly 30 per cent over the past few years. It is right that any business that experiences a drop in numbers needs to ask itself what it should do. However, before it gets to the position of closing, I suggest that it asks itself what more it can do to make its business busier and more relevant to its customers, former customers and potential new customers.</p><p>I am not aware that any of those things has taken place in this instance. However, I am sure that after today&#8217;s debate I will receive some correspondence from RBS, in which it will tell me what it tried to do before it decided to close the Gourock branch.</p><p>I welcome the agreement made with the Post Office to allow RBS customers to access their accounts, withdraw money and check their balances after the closure. However, that is too little, too late. Furthermore, given the westwards population shift that has been taking place in Inverclyde for many years, not to mention the development work that will take place in Gourock, I suggest that there was an opportunity to promote the branch more widely, as a means to keep it open.</p><p>I accept that the way that people bank these days is different from that of, say, 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Much more is done online&#8212;I have an online account. However, many people like me do not want to do everything online, and many people who are IT illiterate will suffer from the closures.</p><p>Many people commute daily from Gourock to work outside Inverclyde. Gourock is a gateway to Argyll for tourism and a tourism location itself. I genuinely cannot see how an RBS branch cannot exist in the town. Maybe a more imaginative opening-time structure would have meant that the branch could have been kept open. Maybe more promotion of the branch would have kept it open. Maybe&#8212;just maybe&#8212;the constant battering that the RBS has taken as a consequence of past reckless decisions is a sign of a lack of confidence in the institution.</p><p>I know that the RBS is working hard to get back to a healthy financial position. However, I ask its management to remember that it was not its branches that took the bank to the brink. It was not the communities in our constituencies and regions that took it to the brink. It was others who were clearly out of touch with the high street.</p><p>I am sure that a RBS representative will be listening to or watching today&#8217;s debate.

The minister&#8217;s amendment highlighted the &#163;331&#160;million of planned investment up to 2015. That figure takes into consideration many aspects of ferries policy, one of which is construction of ferries. The Scottish Government deserves some credit for the &#163;20&#160;million-plus that has been invested in the two hybrid ferries that have been built at Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd in Port Glasgow. The first, the MV Hallaig, was launched in December last year and the second, the MV Lochinvar, is being launched tomorrow. Those orders have safeguarded 75 jobs and created around 100 new jobs and up to 20 new apprenticeships. That was a tremendous economic boost to the Inverclyde economy and saw the first ship in five years being launched on the lower Clyde.</p><p>When the Scottish Government announced in November 2011 that those orders were to go to Ferguson&#8217;s in Port Glasgow, the news was warmly welcomed. The comments in the Greenock Telegraph online were incredible. One of them was:</p><p>&#8220;Real jobs. Absolutely magnificent. Well done to all concerned.&#8221;</p><p>It is important to highlight that those are the world&#8217;s first diesel-electric ferries and that they were designed in Scotland. I repeat: they are the world&#8217;s first. Everyone in Parliament can unite in celebrating that.</p><p>The second issue on which I will touch is the pay dispute between Caledonian MacBrayne and some of its staff who are represented by the TSSA. Unfortunately, I could not attend the lobby that took place in Parliament last week, but I signed the motion in the name of my colleague Kenneth Gibson. As others have, I have been contacted by the TSSA on the matter and I wrote to Caledonian MacBrayne to establish its position regarding the dispute.</p><p>It is disappointing that the dispute has reached the stage that it has reached. It is incumbent on Caledonian MacBrayne and the TSSA to continue their discussions. I note the comments that the minister made a few moments ago, but it is really important that the discussions continue until there is a satisfactory outcome.</p><p>I do not imagine that any business would want to amend staffing contracts lightly, but I believe that attempting to do so is a retrograde step.

I suggest that he ask his colleagues in the better together campaign to put forward a positive narrative as to why Scotland should remain part of the UK, compared to what we want to see, which is Scotland becoming a normal independent country.</p><p>Regarding paragraphs 139 to 141, the evidence that we received from the National Deaf Children&#8217;s Society was very welcome. It related to an issue that I raised in committee regarding the colour of the paper to be used for young people registering for the first time. I raised that issue because I chair the Parliament&#8217;s cross-party group on visual impairment and am a member of the cross-party group on dyslexia. A number of my constituents and a number of my friends are dyslexic, and on more than one occasion they have raised with me the point that when they access information, the colour of the paper is very important to them.</p><p>I also raised the issue in committee because I genuinely believe that registering to vote is important for every single election. This referendum is a chance to fully engage with younger members of society. From representing constituents, I know that there are challenges in that regard, but if we want to make sure that young people who can register for the first time actually do so and feel that they are taking part in the process, we in Parliament must make sure that we do everything that we can to have a dialogue with them and make it easy for them to register.</p><p>I also genuinely believe that if both sides of the debate want to fully engage with the people of Scotland we must ensure that not only the information that is issued but official documentation is available to all Scotland&#8217;s people. In that respect, I am keen to find out more about the testing process that the cabinet secretary mentioned earlier and which the committee touches on in its report. I whole-heartedly welcome the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s assurances about language, which was addressed in paragraph 140 of the committee&#8217;s report, but given the importance of the testing process to the referendum I would like to find out how that is going.</p><p>As for the franchise itself, I, like other SNP members, believe that it is right to lower the voting age to 16 for the referendum; indeed, I would like that to happen in every election and the lowering of the age limit in the referendum is certainly another important step in taking that forward. In the many debates that I have had with 16 and 17-year-olds not only during school visits to the Parliament but outside the Parliament, I have found their general awareness of current affairs something to be proud of. In fact, I gently suggest that many over-18s could learn a thing or two from them. The Scottish Youth Parliament&#8217;s consultation has been mentioned. It received more than 40,000 responses, which I think indicates that 16 and 17-year-olds want to take part in the political process and determine their own future&#8212;and, as far as this referendum is concerned, Scotland&#8217;s future.</p><p>I remember the first time I voted and although the outcome was&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;not the one that I wanted I can only imagine how huge a thing it will be for 16 and 17-year-olds to vote for the first time in next year&#8217;s referendum. Not only will it be their first vote but they will help to decide their future and the future of the country. I certainly associate myself with my committee colleagues&#8217; praise of Emily Shaw MSYP and Andrew Deans MSYP, whose oral evidence was a lesson for everyone who is called to give evidence to the Parliament. I suggest that people go on to the Parliament website and examine what they said and how they said it.</p><p>Finally, on individual voter registration, I have to say that I have no qualms about its introduction by Westminster being delayed and think that it is the right thing to do. However, I also think it right to give EROs the flexibility to start the process on or around 1 October in all parts of Scotland. If the Scottish Government stipulated that registration must happen on a particular day, it would be accused of centralising power and, as I have said, it is right to give EROs that flexibility.</p><p>I look forward to the bill continuing its progress through Parliament. The people of Scotland have a choice: hope and aspiration, or austerity with the union.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and at the outset I associate myself with the comments made by Bruce Crawford, the committee convener, and the Deputy First Minister regarding the assistance received by the committee thus far.

I have no hesitation in wearing the memorial ribbon.</p><p>Workers memorial day was created in Canada in the 1980s and is now an international day of remembrance for workers who have been killed in incidents at work or by diseases that were caused by work. The need for such a day is revealed in the ILO&#8217;s figures, which show that more than 2 million women and men die every year as a result of work-related accidents and diseases. One worker dies every 15 seconds, world wide&#8212;that is 6,000 workers dying every single day. More people die while at work than while fighting in wars.</p><p>Hazardous substances kill 440,000 workers annually, and asbestos alone claims 100,000 lives. I refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests; I am an honorary member of Clydeside Action on Asbestos.</p><p>The purpose of workers memorial day is twofold: to remember those who have died or been injured or made ill at work, and to ensure that that loss and suffering is used to reinvigorate the campaign for healthier and safer work for workers, for their families and for their children, who will become tomorrow&#8217;s workers.</p><p>The most recent figures for Scotland showed that 20 people in Scotland died at their work. There is also the problem of illnesses that people contract at work, but which do not emerge until years later. The prime example is asbestos-related diseases, such as mesothelioma, which can develop 20, 30 or even 40 years after the initial exposure to asbestos. That is why I wear the badge of Clydeside Action on Asbestos.</p><p>According to figures from the Health and Safety Executive, more than 2,000 people every year in the United Kingdom are diagnosed with mesothelioma, and a further 2,000 cases of lung cancer are likely to have been caused by asbestos exposure. The number of people who are diagnosed with fatal conditions is set to rise, and it is estimated that 1.5&#160;million workplaces still contain asbestos.</p><p>This Parliament has a good track record in supporting people with asbestos-related diseases. We legislated to overturn the disgraceful House of Lords decision in 2007 that blocked people who have pleural plaques from seeking compensation from negligent employers&#8212;successive Westminster Governments have failed to do that. It is appropriate that in debating workers memorial day we remember people who contracted asbestos-related diseases as a result of their employers&#8217; negligence. The issue has scarred many communities, not just in the former industrial heartlands in the west, but throughout Scotland. Asbestos-related diseases are still with us and will remain so for years. It is important to use events such as workers memorial day to reiterate the need for greater health and safety in the workplace.</p><p>Health and safety legislation should be applied as quickly as possible. Members will be aware of this week&#8217;s news about the Flying Phantom&#8212;the tug that sank in the Clyde in December 2007, with the loss of three lives. The loss of the tug was a tragedy for all concerned; three people lost their lives and their families were left devastated. It was not until Monday past, more than five years later, that it was announced that the companies involved will face prosecution under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. I know that the Crown Office spent a considerable time investigating the Flying Phantom tragedy, but the families have had to wait for a long time to see the case being brought.</p><p>Too many families suffer the horror of a loved one going to work but never returning. It is important that health and safety at work legislation be taken seriously. Health and safety in the workplace is not an optional extra but a fundamental right for all workers.</p><p>The motto of international workers memorial day is:</p><p>&#8220;Remember the dead; fight for the living&#8221;.</p><p>We have done that in this debate.</p><p>I am conscious of time, Presiding Officer.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Workers Memorial Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a very sad day for the Scottish Parliament.

Indeed, in January the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities wrote to all the Parliament&#8217;s EU reporters to identify changes to EU public procurement rules and other EU limitations on shared services as key priorities for local government in 2013.</p><p>Members will be aware that the Local Government and Regeneration Committee is undertaking the final strand of its three-strand inquiry into public services reform, in which we are looking at shared services and new ways of delivering services. In late February, the committee agreed to my proposal to seek, as part of evidence gathering for our inquiry, further information from COSLA on the potential impact of new EU public procurement rules and shared services limitations on local government. I have written to COSLA to request the evidence and I look forward to receiving it in due course. I will, of course, ensure that the information that I receive is shared with the European and External Relations Committee, the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, all of which will scrutinise the important aspect of public services delivery that we are considering.</p><p>It has become apparent from the evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee&#8217;s inquiry that the EU procurement rules are incredibly complex&#8212;Kevin Stewart touched on that. Although the rules provide necessary protections to ensure fairness and provide safeguards in relation to the spending of public money on the supply and purchase of goods and services, they appear to place fairly stringent restrictions on the ability of people who procure public service contracts to maximise contracts&#8217; effectiveness and find local, flexible solutions, which are proportionate to need.</p><p>On Monday, the Local Government and Regeneration Committee visited South Ayrshire Council and took evidence as part of its public services reform inquiry.

Last week, the UK Secretary of State for Defence came to Scotland to tell us that an independent Scotland could not afford to defend itself. Perhaps he should have paid a bit more attention to the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s spending patterns, which, over the past 10 years, have resulted in an underspend of &#163;7.4 billion in Scotland. In other words, we contribute more to the UK defence budget than we get back. The only time that Scotland gets more than the rest of the UK is when cuts are announced or when it comes to the siting of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>The defence secretary also attempted to pour scorn on an independent Scotland&#8217;s defence capabilities. He claimed that, if Scotland were to get a share of existing UK assets, it would get</p><p>&#8220;half a submarine and under one Red Arrow.&#8221;</p><p>Surely that poor excuse for an argument highlights the shockingly poor state of the UK&#8217;s current conventional defence capabilities. If the UK Government is relying on the Red Arrows to defend these islands, we have a major problem.</p><p>Trident has been a constant drain on the MOD&#8217;s resources&#8212;so much so that the UK Government has cut back on conventional defence to pay for it. Currently, Scottish taxpayers pay &#163;163 million a year towards the running of Trident. Furthermore, it costs &#163;350 million a year to fund the design work for the renewal of Trident, which sustains 1,200 jobs. That amounts to &#163;300,000 per job per year, which is a lot of money for one job. We have to ask ourselves what else that &#163;300,000 per job per year could deliver for our communities.</p><p>The voices that are warning about Trident renewal come from various sources and not just the SCND or anti-nuclear politicians. Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute is on record as stating:</p><p>&#8220;sharp increases in spending on Trident renewal in the early 2020s seem set to mean further years of austerity for conventional equipment plans.&#8221;</p><p>That is because Trident will account for a massive 35 per cent of the MOD&#8217;s capital expenditure. Some Conservatives are against Trident. The former defence secretary Lord King has stated:</p><p>&#8220;It is certainly not obvious to me that there is any longer a need for a major nuclear system based on 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week availability.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Lords, 24 January 2013; Vol 742, c 1243.]</p><p>His colleague former defence secretary Michael Portillo is also on record as stating his objection to Trident. He said:</p><p>&#8220;No&#8212;it&#8217;s completely past its sell-by date.&#8221;</p><p>He continued:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tremendous waste of money. It&#8217;s done entirely for reasons of national prestige ... and at the margins it is proliferation.&#8221;</p><p>However, the best argument that I can marshal against Trident today comes from an email that was sent to me by a constituent in advance of today&#8217;s debate, which states:</p><p>&#8220;Dear Stuart McMillan, your party has an admirable record on consistent opposition to the immoral and obscenely expensive weapons of mass destruction sited at Faslane. Please do pass on my full opposition, don&#8217;t be fobbed off with pretended practicalities. If it is at all possible, get rid of them now! (Don&#8217;t even wait for independence!).&#8221;</p><p>That came from the Rev David Coleman, the minister at the Greenock west United Reformed church.</p><p>We are all aware of the Labour-led Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster spreading fears and smears about defence and saying that the rest of the UK state would not order Scottish goods for its armed forces. We have heard that again today from Jackie Baillie. In one of that committee&#8217;s reports, we are told that no Royal Navy vessels would be built in Scotland. However, the report omitted the comments from Vice Admiral Andrew Mathews, who confirmed that the UK Government would keep the option to build such vessels on the Clyde if Scotland became independent. Who are we to believe&#8212;a partisan Labour MP protecting his Tory masters or a vice admiral of the Royal Navy?</p><p>Furthermore, given that the UK has ordered fleet auxiliary tankers from South Korea, why would it not turn to Scotland, whose workers and yards build a world-class product? Why would a future London Government deny itself the best product on the market? Perhaps the ultimate irony is that, allegedly, a future London Government would not be prepared to order ships from Scotland but would be prepared to order Trident from the USA.</p><p>Removing Trident would not mean that there would be no future for Faslane&#8212;quite the opposite, in fact. Scotland needs a defence base on the Clyde, and the SNP has given a commitment to operate conventional naval forces from HMNB Clyde following independence. We believe that the Trident weapons system that is currently based on the Clyde is not sustainable morally, strategically or economically. As the report that was produced jointly for the STUC and Scottish CND highlights, there is a future for Faslane and that report demonstrates that</p><p>&#8220;the replacement of Trident will cost Scotland more jobs than it will provide&#8221;.</p><p>Who knows, actually? As is highlighted in an article in this weekend&#8217;s Scottish Sunday Express, following research carried out by my colleague Chic Brodie, there may potentially have been 30 years of lost economic opportunity from non-Trident jobs.</p><p>As the STUC and Scottish CND report stresses, the funding that is currently wasted on weapons of mass destruction could be directed to boosting the national and local economy, particularly in the west of Scotland. Have no doubts that independence will bring a positive future for the Faslane base, which will serve as Scotland&#8217;s main conventional naval facility. The funding that is being wasted on Trident will be redirected to boost local and national economic growth in industries that would benefit from the skills base that is currently at Faslane.</p><p>The UK Secretary of State for Defence has said that the SNP&#8217;s plans are vague and lack credibility. Well, what is not vague are the cuts in welfare spending, such as the bedroom tax, that are paying for Trident missiles. If the supporters of Trident want certainty, as I challenged Ken Macintosh earlier, why do they not tell us who they are prepared to use the missiles on? There is absolutely no certainty&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687091", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is an important debate, particularly for the 80 per cent of Scots who oppose these weapons of mass destruction, as indicated in a recent opinion poll.

I am confident that the Local Government and Regeneration Committee will play a key role in supporting the European and External Relations Committee&#8217;s scrutiny of EU policy, in the areas that are within its remit.</p><p>Tomorrow I shall propose several EU priorities that I have identified for 2013 to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee for its consideration and agreement. Although the European Commission&#8217;s work programme for 2013 does not identify specific priorities for the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, there can be no doubt that many EU initiatives have a direct impact on the functioning of local government, and on delivery of regeneration work in Scotland.</p><p>A number of on-going EU policies that are of significant importance to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee will complete their legislative journey throughout 2013: the multi-annual financial framework and the Scottish partnership agreement for 2014 to 2020, the future of European structural funds, and changes to EU public procurement rules.</p><p>The Local Government and Regeneration Committee is currently undertaking two inquiries on which those EU policy areas have a direct affect. First, the committee is undertaking an inquiry into delivery of regeneration. The recent agreement by the European Council on the EU&#8217;s financial framework for 2014 to 2020 signals the first-ever reduction in the EU budget since its establishment. More worryingly, if planned changes to the framework for allocating structural funds take place, the UK could see substantial funding cuts to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, while England could be set for an overall increase. European structural funds play a crucial role in funding delivery of regeneration activity in Scotland, so a significant reduction in those funds could have a direct negative impact on our communities and on Scotland&#8217;s economic development.</p><p>The recent indication from the UK Government suggesting that it has agreed to talks with the Scottish Government on how EU structural funds will be allocated is welcome; it will be helpful, because it is crucial that a constructive solution to the problem be found.</p><p>It is well known that there was a demand by some member states for the overall European budget to be reduced, but a disproportionate cut to Scotland&#8217;s funding would be unacceptable. Tomorrow, therefore, I shall propose to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee that, as part of our inquiry into regeneration, we examine evidence on the potential impact of loss of European structural funds to successful delivery of the Scottish Government&#8217;s regeneration strategy.</p><p>Secondly, the committee is undertaking the final strand of its inquiry into public services reform, which we will debate this afternoon. The inquiry is looking at shared services and development of new ways of delivering services.</p><p>In January this year, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities wrote to all of the Parliament&#8217;s EU reporters identifying changes to public procurement rules and other EU limitations to shared services, and emphasised that that should be a key focus for local government. Tomorrow I shall propose to the committee that, as part of our public services reform inquiry, we write to COSLA seeking further information on the potential impact on local government of new EU public procurement rules and shared services limitations.</p><p>I look forward to discussions with and, I hope, the support of my colleagues on the Local Government and Regeneration Committee on determining our EU priorities for 2013, and to considering important aspects of EU policy throughout the committee&#8217;s current inquiries.

The issue is not the structure but what our constituents require. Structures have been discussed today, but our constituents do not really care where services come from&#8212;they just want to know that the services will be delivered.</p><p>The inquiry highlighted the fact that benchmarking has many definitions. We need a standard definition on which everyone can agree and buy-in from the organisations&#8212;and their staff&#8212;that provide public services. If we do not have that, no one will agree on what is to be measured or on what the measures mean, and the value of the process will be lost.</p><p>We have heard about the buy-in from COSLA, which is welcome. Like my committee colleagues, I look forward to the publication of the benchmarking report in the next few weeks.</p><p>The use of benchmarking should not result in identikit services; there should still be room for legitimate variations between councils that are based on their needs and preferences&#8212;Councillor Cook touched on that point in his evidence to the committee. We must balance the fear of the postcode lottery of services with the need to allow local democracy still to develop.</p><p>We must remember that benchmarking is not by itself the sole solution to improving public services, as Dr Grace pointed out in relation to strand 2. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Benchmarking is an arrow in the quiver of public services improvement&#8221;.</p><p>It is a tool among others to help to identify and improve public services.</p><p>We must keep an open mind in reforming public services. I was pleased that some initial responses for strand 3 came up with alternatives. It is too easy to develop a top-down model&#8212;I hope to touch on that later&#8212;that outlines key performance indicators, targets and even benchmarks, with the result that politicians, managers and organisations are chasing targets rather than meeting our service users&#8217; needs.</p><p>One respondent to strand 3 highlighted the approach of systems thinking&#8212;of putting service users&#8217; needs at the centre of any reform&#8212;which has appeared to succeed in a variety of Scottish organisations, including the City of Edinburgh Council and Glasgow Housing Association. That might be something that we should investigate further.</p><p>Reform should focus on delivering better public services for all and not simply on attempting to impose a one-size-fits-all approach. However, I do not suggest that benchmarking will impose such an approach; I do not believe that it will. I think that benchmarking will provide the opportunity for councils of similar sizes and with similar backgrounds to examine what is going on across the country and&#8212;I hope&#8212;to implement best practice.</p><p>The SNP Scottish Government has already taken significant steps in the reform of Scottish public services. Following the Christie commission, the Scottish Government moved towards a decisive shift to prevention; greater integration of public services locally, driven by better partnership, collaboration and effective local delivery; greater investment in the people who deliver services, through enhanced workforce development and effective leadership; and a sharp focus on improving performance.</p><p>The Scottish Government is also committed to preventative spending in early years and for the elderly. Although a difficult choice, it represents a new approach to the delivery of some services. It is not only a better approach for Government that ensures that more people living in Scotland can achieve their full potential in life; it also offers better value for money for the taxpayer in the long term.</p><p>The use of change funds has supported public services in their decisive shift towards prevention. For instance, the short-term savings from investing in early years services and support from pre-birth to age five could be up to &#163;37,400 a year per child in the most severe cases.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684930", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Services Reform (Developing New Ways of Delivering Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I joined the Local Government and Regeneration Committee last September, when strand 2&#8212;on benchmarking and performance management&#8212;started, I will focus on benchmarking.

I want to put on record my appreciation and thanks to my former colleagues on the committee and to the members of the clerking team for their efforts. I also thank everyone who provided evidence to the committee.</p><p>As we know, Scotland has the potential to be a world leader in renewable energy, and it is in that context that we must look at the achievability of the ambitious targets that have been set by the Scottish Government. The committee&#8217;s report is positive and highlights that the targets are within our reach, even if we have some issues to iron out.</p><p>One of those issues, which has been discussed already today, is the planning system. There was a concern that the pressure on the planning system is due in part to the high number of renewable energy applications. However, the Scottish Government has taken measures to address that, including a commitment to provide more funding to planning authorities.</p><p>I welcome the idea within the report of potentially increasing the planning fees that are charged for larger-scale applications, as long as they do not disadvantage community developers. That additional finance could be used to boost resources in individual planning departments where necessary. I also welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s announcement of the planning fees increase, which Murdo Fraser and the minister talked about earlier.</p><p>There should be greater clarity on environmental impact assessments. The Scottish Government and local authorities should come together to address that issue, providing greater standardisation and guidance on matters such as visualisation standards and noise assessments. The report touched on those points.</p><p>I support the benefits of community-generated renewable energy and I agree with the report that the Scottish Government should consider making adjustments to planning policy that would include clearer consideration of the local economic benefit of projects through the planning system.</p><p>The generation of energy by local authorities came up during the discussion about RPP2 in yesterday&#8217;s meeting of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee. Local authorities have the power to generate energy, if they want to do so. Start-up costs are high, but in some post-industrial areas there might be infrastructure that could be invested in and brought back into use. There is certainly potential in relation to hydro schemes across the country.</p><p>I welcome the letter from the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism and the Minister for Local Government and Planning to COSLA and Heads of Planning Scotland, which set out the Scottish Government&#8217;s requirement for spatial frameworks to be part of local development plans. There is concern about local authorities&#8217; rates of progress in producing spatial frameworks. The timely development of local spatial development plans that are agreed locally in an open, transparent and democratic process, with due regard to national targets, can reduce the costly and inefficient disputes about renewable energy developments that take place throughout Scotland. Greater clarity on the type of development that is likely to be permitted and where such developments are likely to be permitted in a local authority area can give citizens and developers more certainty about the planning process.</p><p>Local authorities must ensure that local development plans are consistent with national objectives and targets. Every planning authority has its own plans and policies, but there should be consistency for developers, who should expect a broadly similar service, regardless of where they make an application. As we know, the Scottish Government&#8217;s planning policy is under review. I look forward to seeing what comes out of the process.</p><p>We heard from Liam McArthur, the member for Orkney. I was one of the members who went to Orkney. It was a fascinating trip and I learned a great deal. A key point for me was that the people there appreciate the tremendous opportunity that they have and that Scotland has. The enthusiasm with which they are trying to develop that opportunity is outstanding. They are building expertise daily, which will help not just Orkney but all Scotland.</p><p>I tried to intervene during Mary Scanlon&#8217;s speech, but I was unsuccessful. I wanted to make the point that I am not aware that tourist numbers in Orkney have decreased as a result of the location of wind turbines there.</p><p>Renewable energy presents an opportunity for Scotland, which we must grab with both hands.

The issue is important not only for members but to the Scottish public, as we can see if we look at the wide extent of capital projects from broadband improvements, to national health service buildings, schools and transport infrastructure. As well as creating jobs in the economy now, those projects create a better, stronger infrastructure for Scotland&#8217;s future and lay the foundations for long-term success.</p><p>I note that the Conservative motion seems to accept the Scottish Government&#8217;s figure of 1,400 jobs being created from every &#163;100 million of capital investment. If that is the case, perhaps the Scottish Conservatives can highlight it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and encourage the coalition to change its policies to support the economy rather than attempting to hamper it.</p><p>Perhaps Gavin Brown could also confirm whether he, like David Mundell MP, believes that Scotland was extinguished after the treaty of union. It seems strange to discuss the capital expenditure of a country that, in the eyes of the Tories, has been extinguished and has ceased to be&#8212;a country that is no more. Perhaps they took their lines from Monty Python. It is another strange situation from the Scottish Conservatives.</p><p>Yet again, we are discussing a Conservative motion on Scotland&#8217;s&#8212;or North Britain&#8217;s&#8212;capital projects. It is a motion from a party that, not content with having the double cross on its emblem, is foisting the bedroom tax upon Scotland. Where will all the one-bedroom properties come from before 1 April? Where is the Conservatives&#8217; capital plan for new public sector house building?</p><p>During the recent budget debate, we heard more rhetoric from the Labour Party with little reasoning and little suggestion of where the money would come from to build the one-bedroom properties before 1 April. Today&#8217;s debate seems to highlight that the Tories are of the same mind. &#8220;Better together,&#8221; they say.</p><p>The updated infrastructure investment plan demonstrates exactly how the Scottish Government has invested, and will invest, in capital projects that will benefit communities throughout Scotland despite the 26 per cent cuts in its capital budgets. Various projects have already been delivered in my West Scotland region. The Renfrew and Barrhead health centres have been completed, as have the Paisley rail corridor improvements, and the first of two hybrid ferries has been launched at Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd in Port Glasgow. Those are a few examples of investment that the Scottish Government has already made.</p><p>Infrastructure investment is fundamental to delivering sustainable economic growth by supporting jobs through the construction phase and then, once the infrastructure is in use, enabling businesses to grow.</p><p>When we consider the role of the NPD model, it is important to remind ourselves of where we came from: the disastrous PFI schemes that were initially developed by the Conservatives and taken to the extreme by Labour. In local government alone, PFI debts have reached the staggering figure of more than &#163;13 billion&#8212;more than the annual funding allocation to local councils. In Inverclyde, we see schools to the capital value of &#163;80 million costing &#163;312 million, while in neighbouring Renfrewshire schools with a capital value of &#163;110 million have been transformed into a debt of &#163;538 million.</p><p>Even Labour MPs such as Margaret Hodge are now realising their mistake, stating:</p><p>&#8220;The irony is that we privatised the buildings but nationalised the debts. It&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;</p><p>Is that sentiment shared by the Tories&#8217; not-so-secret weapon in Scotland&#8212;their friends in the Scottish Labour Party&#8212;or is Scottish Labour too busy providing the human shield for the Tories, who are determined to keep Scotland constrained within its current powers? Judging by John Swinney&#8217;s intervention on Richard Baker earlier, that certainly still seems to be the case.</p><p>With a yes vote in 2014 and the full powers of independence, we could do much more. We would not have to rely on the block grants from London, which are being cut.

If a project or any area of the public sector is really successful, I am only too happy for that work to take place. I hope that Renfrewshire Council will provide information to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, which is undertaking an inquiry into public sector reform. It is entering phase 3 of the inquiry and it would be very useful if the council gave it some information on this subject.</p><p>The street stuff project is a youth diversionary scheme that is very popular in Renfrewshire. It combines the resources, skills and experience of a number of partners who all work towards a common aim. As we heard from Annabel Goldie, the project consists of the youth bus, the gym bus, mobile football pitches and the box, which is a converted transport container that provides an area for dance mat sessions, DJ sessions and chill-out zones. The project attracts more than 20,000 young people a year and, as we know, has led to youth disorder dropping by between 18 and 15 per cent in each area in which it operates. That is an important point that MSPs could highlight in areas that they represent.</p><p>All too often we hear negative stories about young people&#8212;about youth disorder and so on&#8212;and it is important that MSPs, councillors and MPs in the areas that they represent highlight the positive things that go on.

Since Arriva was taken over by McGill&#8217;s Bus Service, the buses have had a makeover and are now back on the road, providing a wider range of diversionary activities to young people across Renfrewshire. The support of McGill&#8217;s adds to the partnership approach inherent in the street stuff project.</p><p>Street stuff was launched in 2009 under the investing in the future initiative by the then Scottish National Party-led Renfrewshire Council. The project was established because evidence showed that some young people were committing acts of antisocial behaviour and violence, partly through gang-related behaviour and partly&#8212;allegedly&#8212;through boredom. A number of hotspot areas where the project could make the biggest difference were identified. Street stuff engages with disaffected and hard-to-reach young people through a host of diversionary activities such as football, electronic gaming and dance.</p><p>I am conscious of the time, Presiding Officer.</p><p>To date, the street stuff initiative has won 12 awards, including the Scottish Premier League best community initiative award two years in a row with St Mirren Football Club. Some members will know that I am a great Morton fan, so it takes a lot for me to give any credit to St Mirren, but they deserve it in this case. The project has been cited as a model of best practice by the Scottish Government and the street stuff co-ordinator won the role model/mentor of the year at the national youth worker of the year awards in 2012.</p><p>Those awards highlight the street stuff project&#8217;s success and I pay tribute to everyone involved in it. As I said, the project was established in 2009 by the SNP-led Renfrewshire Council. It has gone from strength to strength and I hope that it continues to do so.

I, too, want to express my thanks to Mark McDonald MSP for bringing the bill to Parliament, and to the Scottish Government for its extensive work prior to the introduction of the bill, and for working with Mark McDonald to assist him in its introduction.</p><p>When I was elected in 2007, I knew that high hedges was an issue that had been around for some time and to which people had tried to bring some type of resolution through Parliament. Unfortunately, previous attempts to introduce legislation did not succeed, but I am thankful that we are here now and I hope that we can pass the bill.</p><p>The bill has not come about overnight and I welcome its introduction, but it will not, as currently drafted, with the narrow definition of a high hedge, solve every issue that confronts MSPs. I am sure that if the scope of the bill were to be extended to include deciduous trees and single trees, it would still not solve every issue. My task, as an MSP who has constituents who are dealing with issues relating to the aforementioned categories, is to ensure that legislation is workable, affordable, enforceable and easily understood.</p><p>As members will know, I was the sole committee member who dissented from the definition in the bill. The definition is narrow and focuses purely on high hedges. If the definition were to be altered to include other categories, it is reasonable to assume that the bill would have to be altered. However, it is possible that such an alteration would be too great and would thereby, as Christine Grahame said, render the bill a vastly different document from what has been introduced.</p><p>As we know, the bill, which follows on from the legislation that is in use in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, focuses on high hedges. As we have also heard, the Isle of Man&#8217;s Trees and High Hedges Act 2005 is different in that it encompasses trees in the title and throughout the act.</p><p>My reasoning in dissenting from the definition in the stage 1 report was simple. I could have accepted the narrow definition, while knowing that there would be some unsatisfied constituents of mine, and of all colleagues&#8212;apart from Stewart Stevenson&#8212;or I could look to work with Mark McDonald to amend the bill, where possible. I do not get the impression&#8212;certainly from discussions that I have had with MSPs outside the chamber and committee members&#8212;that there is an appetite to increase the scope of the bill. Although all bills are amended in some shape or form, I do not think that any proposals to amend the definition will progress through the committee, although that is entirely up to committee members to decide.</p><p>The bill can be used as a platform when reviewing the act in the future. I therefore thank Mark McDonald for accepting my amendment that called for a review of the legislation within five years of commencement of the system, which is something that the committee recommended, too. Sarah Boyack talked about the importance of the definition. That is why a review is important; having it written into the legislation will ensure that outstanding issues will not be forgotten and that the legislation can be refined and amended, as required. The review will also achieve something that all members know we do not always manage to achieve: post-legislative scrutiny. We are usually caught up in issues of the day and post-legislative scrutiny sometimes takes a back seat.</p><p>I am conscious of the time, Presiding Officer, so I will make one final point. I welcome COSLA&#8217;s desire to implement the bill, and I welcome its collaborative approach thus far, which I am sure will continue. I am sure that when the bill&#8212;in whatever shape or form it takes&#8212;is passed, local authorities will be able to manage the work well and work well with others. High hedges might be an area for a possible future shared service, once the initial excess of cases is dealt with by local authorities.</p><p>I welcome Mark McDonald&#8217;s bill and the assistance that the Government has provided on it.

This is a very important issue, and I congratulate Drew Smith on bringing it to the chamber.</p><p>As members will know, I play the bagpipes, so I know how hard it is to learn an instrument. Years of hard work and dedication go in before someone becomes proficient in any instrument. I can fully appreciate the frustration that is felt by musicians when they are expected to play for free. For me, it is a hobby, not a profession. I always considered playing my instrument as a hobby and never as a profession for some point in the future.</p><p>As we have heard, the recent report from the Musicians Union highlights the fact that 56 per cent of the musicians who were surveyed earned less than &#163;20,000 per year. That is not a great deal of money, particularly for a professional musician. It is not a great reward for a career that has involved many years of training, rehearsals and dedication, not to mention the personal and financial sacrifices that are required to achieve the level of skill that enables someone to be a professional musician.</p><p>The motion highlights the fact that too many people seem to regard music as</p><p>&#8220;a hobby rather than a career&#8221;.</p><p>There have always been examples of musicians being asked to play and work for free for charity, as Drew Smith indicated. At the recent London Olympics there seemed to be a blanket policy of not paying for music. Recently, other organisations have started to do the same. That has had an impact on the work that is available for musicians. There are reports of some venues trawling around for open mic nights, looking for musicians who are just starting out and getting them to play at venues for free, rather than paying for professional musicians. I understand the arguments about the showcasing of new bands, singers and musicians wanting to break into the scene&#8212;I understand the idea of providing someone with the opportunity to play. However, there needs to be a balance if that is to take place, rather than what appears to be the norm now of getting musicians to play for free.</p><p>To be a top-class musician takes years and years of dedication and study. It is a full-time job. Although it is largely true that musicians enjoy their jobs, that does not mean that those jobs should have no value. It should be remembered that the enjoyable part of a musician&#8217;s job is often their time on the stage or in the studio. However, those enjoyable, creative times are short compared with the time devoted to work behind the scenes, including travelling, rehearsing and administration. A one-hour gig can be part of a musician&#8217;s 12-hour day.</p><p>I have played at many an event in the past. When I was younger, playing at weddings, the wedding might start at 3 o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, but our day would then be over&#8212;we did not do anything that day apart from going and playing our pipes at that wedding. When someone is being paid to go and do a job, it is not just for the time when they are performing&#8212;they are getting paid for the whole of their time that day. I suggest that that is how it should be.</p><p>Music is already a difficult career to sustain. Unless a musician makes it to the very top, it can be very poorly paid. Most of the Musicians Union&#8217;s 30,000 members have to do other jobs alongside music to make ends meet.</p><p>While we highlight the problems that are currently faced by working musicians, it is still necessary to provide support for the musicians of the future. We need to do what we can to ensure that the study of music is available to everyone who has the ability and who wants to do it. I therefore congratulate the Scottish Government on the additional &#163;1&#160;million of funding to provide schools with the means to buy musical instruments.</p><p>I also congratulate all local authorities in Scotland on the excellent music tuition that goes on across the country. A short time ago, the Parliament had a debate about the varying fees that local authorities apply but, in the main, local authorities do a tremendous job on music tuition and singing.</p><p>I welcome the debate and hope that it goes some way towards highlighting to the general public and the people who run venues the importance of music as a career and the reasons why professional musicians, like any other professional, deserve to be paid for their services.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683226", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Musicians Union Work not Play Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this afternoon&#8217;s debate.

We have heard that the enterprise minister has already written to the relevant UK minister to seek greater regulation of payday loans and to urge the UK Government to place a cap on interest rates for high-interest and payday lending. Where the Scottish Government can act, it will do so; as the enterprise minister said, he is already working on the matter.</p><p>As regards action by local authorities, Dundee City Council&#8217;s SNP administration is leading the way. It is banning access to payday loan companies from its computers, including the public access computers in local libraries. At the same time, it is promoting the role of the local credit union as a viable alternative to high-interest, short-term lenders.</p><p>I turn to the impact that welfare reform will have on those who rely on benefits. In contrast to Labour&#8217;s support for welfare cuts, with its cuts commission looking at removing free prescriptions or the concessionary bus pass from 1.2 million older and disabled people in Scotland, the Scottish Government is trying to protect families with its social wage policy, council tax freeze, free bus passes, free prescriptions and free personal care. That all adds up to vital support for families across Scotland against the background of the Westminster cuts. Our commitment to a social wage will deliver benefits for everyone in Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already shown that it will not stand by while Westminster cuts fall hardest on the poorest people in Scotland. An extra &#163;9 million was awarded to the Scottish welfare fund to reinstate the money lost through Westminster cuts, and more than &#163;5 million is being provided to help benefits advice groups cope with the increase in demand for help from hard-hit families.</p><p>Labour members might complain about welfare reforms, but unfortunately their position is not that simple. Despite what they say in press releases, leading Labour MPs at Westminster such as David Miliband agree with the reduction in welfare spending. The only thing that is clear about welfare reform is that a fairer welfare system in Scotland can be achieved only with independence.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already provided support to credit unions. It recognises the valuable role that they play in providing financial services to a wide range of customers. Through the third sector enterprise fund, it invested &#163;12 million in credit unions between 2008 and 2010, including &#163;10,000 for Dumbarton Credit Union and &#163;63,000 for Renfrewshire Wide Credit Union. That support underlines the support from the Scottish Government and the SNP for the credit union movement. We believe that credit unions are able to offer a viable alternative to high-interest, short-term lenders, and I urge all members to promote and support their local credit union.</p><p>The motion highlights Westminster&#8217;s austerity programme and welfare reforms. It highlights that there are things that Labour would prefer to see implemented on the people of Scotland, as opposed to the people of Scotland being able to decide on Scotland&#8217;s priorities through the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government. Labour acknowledges the impact of the austerity cuts and welfare reform, but it will not join the SNP in campaigning for the Scottish Parliament to have the powers to really deal with the welfare situation.</p><p>The Scottish Government is doing what it can with its limited powers under the current constitutional settlement to mitigate the excesses of the Westminster cuts agenda.

However, although I agree with the general thrust of Iain Gray&#8217;s motion, I am not too sure how the aims of Scotland on Sunday&#8217;s let the children play campaign can be fully implemented.</p><p>As members will know, I play the bagpipes. However, I was not taught them at school; I actually learned them as a member of 1st Port Glasgow Boys Brigade. Tuition was free, but we paid for it by playing at gala days and functions throughout the year.</p><p>Like many musical instruments, pipes are not cheap; in fact, they are pretty expensive. Members of pipe bands have to pay for their uniforms, their pipes, their drums, their drumskins, their drone reeds and their pipe reeds as well as for their transport and their accommodation when playing at a function. An important point that we will all take away from the debate is that the vast majority of parents, bands and schools do not have an unlimited pot of money to draw on. Although it is vital to ensure that music tuition is affordable, certainly for our younger people, it is also imperative to recognise that such tuition does not happen only in schools.</p><p>Before I talk about local authorities, I want to highlight an organisation that does a tremendous amount of work and which I believe I and Hanzala Malik have discussed in the past: the College of Piping in Glasgow. On average, the college takes more than 500 piping students a year, and on a Monday evening it provides free tuition. It supplies equipment such as pipes and drums, and some of the uniforms, for younger people who come from disadvantaged areas.</p><p>A further example of the college&#8217;s excellent work is that it paid for a set of pipes that cost approximately &#163;1,000 and gave them to a young boy to aid him in his piping efforts. A set of pipes is not cheap&#8212;in fact, that was a cheap set at &#163;1,000. We should all congratulate the college on the tremendous amount of work that it does for the piping community and for the local communities that it serves.</p><p>I will touch briefly on the work of local authorities. I congratulate the eight council areas that have no charge for music tuition&#8212;I warmly welcome that. I hope that the other 24 areas in Scotland can have a look at their charging regimes and see whether they can make the charges a bit smaller.</p><p>As members know, I stay in Inverclyde, where the council charges &#163;95 a year for tuition. That is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, but for some families it will be a lot. However, that is the lowest sum among the authorities that charge for tuition; in comparison, Aberdeen City Council charges approximately &#163;340.</p><p>My key point is that I do not believe that we can tell local authorities what to do. At a recent Local Government and Regeneration Committee meeting, Councillor Michael Cook, the vice-president of COSLA, was clear about our councils&#8217; powers and responsibilities. He stated:</p><p>&#8220;We need to recognise that when it comes to a whole range of factors, there is legitimate variation based on local democracy. It is up to councillors, who are the local democratic agents within councils, to make a policy judgment about some of those things ... It may also partly be a consequence of policy determinations that those elected members have made and that is absolutely right. Sometimes we hear complaints about the postcode lottery. Sometimes the postcode lottery is local democracy in action.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 31 October 2012; c 1343-44.]</p><p>That is a very powerful argument.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678449", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Music Tuition"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Iain Gray on securing this members&#8217; business debate.

In that regard, we cannot forget the current constitutional debate, which is certainly putting Scotland under the gaze of the wider world and is, I think, making Scotland a more interesting and fascinating place for people to come and visit.</p><p>We have already heard a number of the facts and statistics, so I will not go over all the ground again. However, it is important to highlight a couple of the points that we heard earlier. VisitScotland estimates that the MICE market brings in around &#163;870 million, which is 19 per cent of our overall business tourism figure, and that 28 per cent of all international association conferences that are held in the UK are held in Scotland.</p><p>Neil Brownlee, head of VisitScotland&#8217;s business tourism unit, said:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland has so much to offer delegates in terms of our world class venues, our spectacular scenes, our fantastic food and drink, our history, our golf and so much more.&#8221;</p><p>I could not have put it better myself. We have the product. We have some world-class establishments and have improving service provision at all levels. We also have the people with the drive and passion to continue to improve the tourism product, particularly the business tourism product, and certainly none more so than Stephen Leckie, who is the chair of the Scottish tourism leadership group and of the Scottish Tourism Alliance. His infectious desire is to make Scottish tourism the best&#8212;not just the best for a small country. His foreword to the refreshed Scottish tourism strategy&#8212;&#8220;Tourism Scotland 2020&#8221;&#8212;highlights the focus on the sector, stating that the strategy is</p><p>&#8220;for the industry, by the industry.&#8221;</p><p>Those comments are apt and highlight that it is a bottom-up strategy rather than a top-down one.</p><p>The tourism leadership group, which produced the refreshed strategy, and the Scottish Tourism Alliance, which will monitor the delivery of the strategy, are pivotal in driving Scotland&#8217;s offering forward. I am convinced that they will succeed and that, as a consequence, so will Scotland. They will have challenges and some ups and downs, but the challenge for politicians in this Parliament and elsewhere is to help them when it is required, not give them a public mauling.</p><p>The next two years are important for Scotland. The continuation of the winning years strategy will see two of the world&#8217;s top-class events coming to the country, which are huge opportunities. The Ryder cup will put Scotland in the driving seat&#8212;sorry for the pun&#8212;from a golfing perspective, and the Commonwealth games will put Glasgow on the front foot from a wider sporting perspective. Given that hundreds of millions of pounds are being invested in Glasgow by the Scottish Government in sporting infrastructure, accommodation, staffing and transport links to make the games a success, I am sure that, in their heart of hearts, those who claimed that Glasgow was being ripped off know that be to an inaccurate claim.</p><p>I warmly welcome the conference bid fund, which has had a tremendous amount of success so far. Glasgow has done well, and the thousands of additional people who have come to Scotland or who will come to Scotland in coming years are a huge boost to the Glasgow economy. The Scottish Government&#8217;s collaborative work with Glasgow City Council and the Glasgow City Marketing Bureau is an example that should be emulated.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677602", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Business Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been a consensual debate so far, which has sometimes been quite humorous.

Labour&#8217;s motion talks about</p><p>&#8220;confusion ... as to whether or not legal advice had been sought regarding an independent Scotland&#8217;s status in respect of EU membership&#8221;.</p><p>I omitted some words, although only 13, not 27. When the Labour Party embarked on this crusade after the failure of the previous five, surely it should have done some research beforehand. During the first parliamentary session, when Iain Gray and Jack McConnell were ministers, they provided clarity on the issue in written answers to parliamentary questions. Iain Gray said:</p><p>&#8220;Whether legal advice is sought by, or provided to, ministers on any subject is a confidential matter.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 8 November 2002; S1W-31067.]</p><p>Jack McConnell said:</p><p>&#8220;It is not the practice of the Scottish Executive to disclose whether they have taken legal advice on an issue, nor to disclose the nature of any legal advice received.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 3 July 2000; S1W-08098.]</p><p>I may be wrong, but it appears to me that, on the issue of legal advice, the Labour Party is doing two things. First, it is playing politics with the issue despite knowing full well that legal advice is neither confirmed nor denied&#8212;nor disclosed&#8212;unless permission to do so is granted by the law officers. Secondly, its main reason for doing so is, I believe, to provide a smokescreen for its own inadequacies in providing a positive vision for Scotland.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s cuts commission&#8212;it is cutting free personal care, the bus pass and eye tests and ending the council tax freeze, to name just a few things&#8212;is not something that it can crow about. No members on my side of the chamber agree with Labour&#8217;s cuts agenda, and I am sure that none of us could go out and sell it on the doorsteps as a positive vision for Scotland.</p><p>The smokescreen is an attempt to hide not only Labour&#8217;s inadequacies, but the party&#8217;s hand-in-glove coalition with the Tories in Scotland in the no campaign. That coalition&#8212;or partnership&#8212;with the Tories sticks in the craw of hundreds of thousands of people in Scotland who have not forgotten how Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s policies affected our communities.</p><p>With the Tories and the Lib Dems having embarked on a welfare cuts agenda that will once again hammer many communities and people in Scotland, I urge the Labour Party to think again about getting into bed with Cameron and Clegg. If the Prime Minister and the Tories are the masters in the coalition, that begs the question of who the puppets are.</p><p>Before I go on to discuss matters of real importance to the people of Scotland, and why Scotland&#8217;s future should be as a normal independent nation, I note that reading of Labour&#8217;s agenda was quite revealing. A Sunday newspaper reported that a Labour strategist admitted that, to get a no vote in the referendum, the tactic is to launch personal attacks on the First Minister.</p><p>I believe that the people of Scotland deserve better than that. They want politicians who will try to work together to improve the country not who spend their time cooking up new ways of attacking the First Minister. The people of Scotland want to know what Scotland will be like if they vote either yes or no, and the nonsense that is lobbed with regularity from Labour Party members does them and the people of Scotland a disservice.</p><p>I believe that an independent Scotland in the EU is the best option for the country. Last week, after giving evidence to the Westminster Parliament&#8217;s House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs, Liz Cameron, the chief executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said:</p><p>&#8220;I am delighted that my fellow panellists agreed with Scottish Chambers of Commerce that continued membership of the EU is of huge advantage to Scottish businesses. Whatever the outcome of the referendum, ensuring that this can continue is a priority.&#8221;</p><p>That is one of the important issues that the no campaign needs to address. Labour has been silent on EU membership, the Lib Dems are positively gushing about the EU and the Tories are trying to deal with a Eurosceptic wing to stave off the challenge from UKIP at the next European elections.</p><p>The Prime Minister&#8217;s comments to the effect of, &#8220;Vote for me in 2015 and I might just give you a referendum on EU membership&#8221; sound very familiar to us here in Scotland. Earlier in January, we heard, &#8220;Vote no and I will give you more powers&#8221;, but there was no mention of what those powers would be. The no campaign is all over the place on that particular issue.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s business community wants answers on EU membership so that it can plan accordingly. In the 14 minutes of Johann Lamont&#8217;s speech earlier today, and in previous debates on Scotland&#8217;s future, there has been a vacuum in respect of Labour&#8217;s vision for Scotland and its policy on Scotland&#8217;s place in the world.</p><p>I was going to conclude, Presiding Officer, but I see that I have a bit more time.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675104", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Future of Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members might imagine, I will not be voting for the Labour motion but will be supporting Nicola Sturgeon&#8217;s amendment.

Dyslexia is an issue about which Margaret Mitchell cares deeply, and I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.</p><p>I joined the cross-party group on dyslexia as a result of meeting positively dyslexic, which is the Inverclyde dyslexia support group. The group targets all adult learners with dyslexia, those who are affected by it or who work in the field, and anyone in Inverclyde who can help to raise awareness of the issues that surround dyslexia.</p><p>The group&#8217;s members work towards raising awareness of dyslexia and the surrounding issues, and they support those who have it and inform local adult learning provision through the community learning and development partnership. The group&#8217;s initial aim was to create awareness of dyslexia and to destigmatise it. It was challenging but inspirational to speak to some of the group&#8217;s members and to hear their stories about how they have adapted to deal with the condition.</p><p>The online dyslexia toolkit was not available for those members as they were growing up, and it would have been advantageous for them. The key to any learning tool is its implementation and those who teach it.</p><p>Through the cross-party group, we have heard about instances of a lack of understanding of dyslexia in some educational establishments. However, whenever the issue has arisen in my discussions with constituents, the opposite has&#8212;thankfully&#8212;been the case. There has tended to be a great deal of understanding, and teaching staff have worked tremendously hard to help their students.</p><p>I hope that that good practice is being shared among our local authorities. I am sure that we would all agree that no person in Scotland should be left behind because of ignorance and lack of understanding of dyslexia.</p><p>I applaud Dyslexia Scotland&#8217;s extraordinary efforts in ensuring that teachers, parents and students throughout Scotland are better able to address the needs of individuals with learning disabilities. Since its creation, Dyslexia Scotland has been committed to encouraging, enabling and inspiring individuals with dyslexia&#8212;regardless of their age or level of education&#8212;to reach their fullest potential, and it gives me great pleasure to see the organisation succeed in that goal once again.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell spoke about the book &#8220;Dyslexia and Us&#8221;. I have read it myself, and some of the stories are heartwarming, life changing and inspirational.</p><p>Two years ago&#8212;as we have heard&#8212;Dyslexia Scotland unveiled the online dyslexia toolkit for educators throughout the country, and last month the organisation released an updated version of that vital resource. The toolkit&#8217;s primary purpose is to help teachers and those who work with young children to identify early signs of dyslexia, and in that regard it has been enormously successful over the past two years.</p><p>The value of the programme to our teachers and communities is certainly evident, and as a result the Scottish Government has this year funded an extension project, which I warmly welcome. I have no doubt that the extension programme will have the same positive impact that we have seen as a result of the original toolkit, and I hope that even more resources will be released in the future to assist people with dyslexia.</p><p>Dyslexia is a growing trend in Scottish society, and it is important now more than ever that we are informed and prepared to address it. Today&#8212;as we have already heard&#8212;one in 10 young people in Scotland is diagnosed with dyslexia, and it is likely that even more exhibit many of the symptoms but have yet to be identified.</p><p>I could go on, Presiding Officer, but I am conscious of time. I say in conclusion that Dyslexia Scotland is a leader in bringing awareness and understanding of dyslexia to our teachers, parents and students, and the recent release of the updated online toolkit is but a small example of the organisation&#8217;s many successes.</p><p>I congratulate Dyslexia Scotland on that and on its years of great service to our communities.

I also congratulate the 5th Fife scout group and the winning team members who are in the public gallery.</p><p>I have tremendous respect for the scouting movement and for everyone who gives up their time to assist Scotland&#8217;s younger people. The Scout Association has a wonderful history, some of which we have already heard about. I am sure that it will be around for a long time after I have left this earth.</p><p>I was not in the scouts; I was in the Boys Brigade. I know that there is a small bit of friendly rivalry between the scouts and the Boys Brigade. That is healthy. Those organisations have immense mutual respect for each other, which is certainly to be commended and highlighted. Both provide younger people with opportunities that may not ordinarily be available to them, and I am delighted that so many young people take up those opportunities. We have already heard about the increasing numbers of younger people who have joined the scouting movement in recent years. That can only be a good thing.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I contacted the district commissioner for the Greenock and district scouts, David McCallum. Mr McCallum and his team are committed to the younger people of Inverclyde and Scotland. They have doubled the number of young people taking part in scouting in one area since 2007, which is a remarkable achievement for the team. There are now 17 groups, from beavers up to explorer scout units, and there are many personal and group achievements within the membership. That increase took place not by chance but because of a concerted and planned effort.</p><p>I will not go into all the successes of the Greenock and district scouts, but I will highlight a couple. Greenock and district scouts have forged a working arrangement with the Ocean Youth Trust Scotland to help young people earn their Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s award badges. I know how difficult it is to get a Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s award badge, not because I did it but because my sister did. I know how much time and effort she had to put in to get her badges.</p><p>I highlight my entry in the register of interests, as I am an ambassador for the Ocean Youth Trust Scotland. I know exactly the excellent work that it does and how it helps hundreds of people from across Scotland and a range of backgrounds every year. Its working partnership with the scouts is only one example of the Inverclyde community working together.</p><p>Another positive example of the Greenock and district scouts involves activities related to this year&#8217;s diamond jubilee celebrations&#8212;854 beavers, cubs, scouts, explorers and leaders held their annual parade and church service, which also became a celebration of the diamond jubilee. That was a wonderful achievement, which involved so many members.</p><p>The 60th Greenock and district group has 40 beavers and cub scouts at Glenburn school in Greenock, which is a school for pupils with additional support needs. The group, which operates on a Friday afternoon during school time, is operated by a dedicated team of individuals and offers a scouting opportunity to young people who would not ordinarily have that chance.</p><p>I congratulate the Greenock and district scouts on their decision to establish the group. I also congratulate Inverclyde Council on working in partnership with the Greenock and district scouts to make the group happen and on the other joint working that takes place between both organisations.</p><p>I could go on, but I would be here for a while. I have given a flavour of one or two of the things that take place within the Inverclyde area.</p><p>The part of David Torrance&#8217;s motion from</p><p>&#8220;considers that the Scout Association has been very successful&#8221;</p><p>to the end is so accurate. Hundreds of thousands of Scots have benefited greatly from the scouting movement during its 105-year history. I am sure that over the next 105 years many more will have the opportunity to benefit and will grab it with both hands.</p><p>As a former boys brigader, I commend the Scouting Association and wish it every success in the future.

During yesterday&#8217;s debate on Scotland&#8217;s future, I stated that when I was growing up, Inverclyde&#8217;s economic heart was being systematically dismantled by the Tory UK Government. That was at a time when all powers rested with Westminster. I do not believe for one minute that we want to go back to those dark days, when communities were ripped apart, families were split apart and lives were wrecked. That was the legacy of an uncaring Westminster Government that had little regard for Scotland.</p><p>Debates on employability are usually charged affairs, and rightly so. The younger generation are the future of the country, so if they are not being given opportunities, what hope will there be? I am thankful that the Scottish Government recognises their importance and has invested finance, energy and time in the issue. It also knows that the measures of past UK Governments, including the abandonment of apprenticeships and the introduction of schemes such as the youth training scheme, have left a legacy for the country to deal with now.</p><p>Time and again, the issue of skills shortages is raised in the Parliament and the Government is asked what it is going to do about the situation&#8212;we have heard that in today&#8217;s debate. I honestly cannot believe that the Scottish Government is being expected, in the space of one or two parliamentary sessions, to right the wrongs of years of failed policies for our younger people.</p><p>Further to that, when unemployment statistics are raised in the chamber, we have to accept that it is impossible to get everyone into work, for a variety of reasons. Every one of us will admit that unemployment is a huge challenge; no Government of any colour has fully dealt with it in the past.</p><p>I know that from my experience. After I graduated from university in 1997, I was unemployed for six months; I was overqualified and underexperienced. I obtained a job in a factory for six weeks in the run-up to Christmas, which helped me financially, but it also helped me to regain some of my lost self-esteem. I had a student loan, which was a debt that was always on my mind at the time, so I started to put aside money to pay it off. I am thankful that tuition fees had not been introduced, otherwise I would have had an additional debt, and that the SNP Government and the Scottish Parliament had the courage and the guts to be on the side of graduates when we abolished the dreaded tuition fees, irrespective of whether they were at the front end or the back end.</p><p>I will highlight a couple of firms from Inverclyde and their experiences. Stepper Technology and its sister company MES Marine &amp; Engineering Services have in the past year taken on 22 new employees, of whom 15 are under 24 years old. Many of those young people have come from welfare-to-work programmes, including get ready for work, which has helped 16 and 17-year-olds to achieve employment. The managing director&#8212;a guy called Tom Smith&#8212;told me that</p><p>&#8220;employers have a duty of care to take responsibility for the future of the young kids within their own community. They are the future, and we the business community have a social responsibility to ensure they are employed and well trained. Without these important elements, what future would the business community have, and Inverclyde too?&#8221;</p><p>That touches on the point that John Park made about employers&#8217; social responsibility. I congratulate Tom Smith on his positive outlook about employing young people and on his absolute commitment to his social responsibility.</p><p>The second firm that I will highlight is a bus company that is based in Inverclyde&#8212;McGill&#8217;s Bus Service Ltd. I have been told that it continually has vacancies&#8212;it currently has 17. It looks for a range of skills and many roles are for trained engineers and bus mechanics.</p><p>The skills shortage, which has been touched on, may be due to past Government and college decisions to cut back on particular training programmes. It is nigh on impossible to train bus apprentices fully in Scotland. To be fully trained, a bus apprentice must go to one of the hubs of excellence in England.

As a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, I anticipate having quite a busy year with the better regulation bill and the procurement reform bill. Both bills can make a positive difference to the communities that we serve as parliamentarians.</p><p>In the past, I have questioned the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth on the community benefit clauses. I know other members have also raised that issue. Although they can be used at the moment, I would like to think that the procurement reform bill will enhance them. However, we have to strike a balance between aiding communities and the legal requirements of the European Union. I do not want competition to be removed, as that would be disastrous, but I believe that there can be an enhanced method of procurement that helps people to work and keep their jobs within their areas, but which also provides further training opportunities.</p><p>During the summer, I met many organisations throughout the west of Scotland, including a number of businesses, and I was struck by their commitment to the areas in which they are based and their determination to succeed despite the current tough economic conditions. Their hope and optimism for the future were abundant. They all said a similar thing&#8212;that times are tough but that we have been in recessions before and that we will come out stronger at the end. We must not let go of that powerful message. If we really want to see our communities throughout Scotland improve, we need to have a sharp focus on improving the economic opportunities for all.</p><p>My summer visits were interesting&#8212;fascinating at times&#8212;and inspiring. I have only one disappointing comment to mention. A public sector employee raised with me a concern regarding community benefit clauses. The individual informed me that a senior official within their public body, when questioned on the use of such clauses, had apparently stated that they were illegal and could not be used. I have no proof that the allegation is true, but I have no reason to suggest that the employee was making it up. If the allegation is true, that organisation has been done a disservice by that senior official, as have those who are unemployed and looking for opportunities in the area. We can pass laws within the current limitations of this Parliament, but if they are not fully implemented on the ground there is a serious challenge ahead. I anticipate, however, that with the procurement reform bill such allegations can be consigned to the dustbin.</p><p>Regulation is an area that the business community wants to be improved at every level. I am sure that some businesses would like less regulation, but I know from my discussions this summer that an improved regulatory regime is something that will be closely examined and I am sure that common ground can be found between the business community and the Parliament when the better regulation bill is introduced.</p><p>In his speech a few moments ago, John Park talked about working to create further employment opportunities. That was a welcome contribution to the debate, but I hope that he will speak to his party leader about the matter. In her opening comments, she seemed to treat the better regulation bill with some disdain, but later on she called for more jobs. If we are going to have more jobs, we surely need businesses to create them, so I hope that John Park will speak to his party leader about that point.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland announced today that a record number of people are turning to charities to feed themselves and their families. I challenge every single MSP to stand up and be counted on the issue. Nobody in Scotland should be living with the indignity of having to resort to charities in order to eat. The reasons for people contacting the food banks are varied, but it comes as no surprise that the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reforms are one of them. If our citizens are struggling now, what will the situation be like when many more UK cuts are inflicted in the coming years?</p><p>In a country as rich as Scotland, nobody should have to live with the perpetual fear of wondering where the next meal is to come from. These are real people. Real lives are being consigned to daily misery and dread, and I for one want no part of living in a society that allows that to continue. While we remain part of a union that allows the welfare state to adversely affect our citizens, however, that will continue. While we remain part of a union that ensures that the gap between the rich and the poor increases, that will continue. While we remain part of the union, the choice of helping those who are less well off will always be a distant second to the replacement of the weapons of mass destruction on the Clyde.</p><p>I believe that, with independence, this Parliament will be better equipped to improve the lives of our citizens. Surely, as parliamentarians, we are here to make things better. We need the powers to tackle poverty in all its guises. Continuing with a union that is not fit for purpose is not the answer. It will not even begin to tackle the poverty that exists. Under the last Labour UK Government, when Gordon Brown was the Prime Minister, the gap between the rich and the poor increased. We know that the current Tory and Lib Dem coalition is out of touch&#8212;and no amount of deckchair shuffling today will improve that&#8212;but we also know that the Labour Government that was in power at Westminster last time round could not be trusted to deliver for the less well-off.</p><p>Only independence can deliver for Scotland and the people. I warmly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the referendum bill and I will campaign for a yes vote for a better Scotland.

I am delighted to close the debate on behalf of the Equal Opportunities Committee. The debate has been open, interesting and wide ranging, and it follows on from a debate last Thursday morning.</p><p>I will try to capture much of what has been said but, before doing that, I will make a couple of points. The committee&#8217;s discussion of women and work in February was an excellent way of opening up the issue. I am sure that every member finds it abhorrent that major issues affect women in the workplace. My opinion is that the worst issue has been the lack of equal pay. The legacy of women receiving less money than men for doing the same or similar jobs is shocking. Nothing that I can say today will fully reflect my disgust with that situation. The point might have been addressed now, but how much money has been wasted by organisations defending the indefensible?</p><p>My second point follows on from the debate that took place last Thursday morning. I am happy that today&#8217;s debate has not been a mirror image of that debate, but last week&#8217;s debate has helped to open up today&#8217;s debate. Some of the issues that were discussed last week are just part of the wider range of issues that the Parliament and the Equal Opportunities Committee need to look at. I am sure that we will do so in our future work.</p><p>I will touch upon some of the points that were raised today and at the beginning of the process. When Elaine Dougall of the STUC women&#8217;s committee gave evidence to the Equal Opportunities Committee, she made the powerful statement:</p><p>&#8220;Women bring diversity to an organisation.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 21 February 2012; c 247.]</p><p>I think of the strong women in my family and how powerful they have been in shaping how the family went through life. I would not be half the person that I am if it were not for my mother and the strong direction that I got from her. It is extremely important for organisations to realise that women bring a totally different perspective on how an organisation could run and its decision-making process. Elaine Dougall&#8217;s comment was extremely powerful and when the committee is going through its inquiry, it should remember that comment at all times.</p><p>Annabel Goldie&#8217;s contribution on the three reasons why she supports the inquiry tied in with that and I absolutely agree with her. When we do that piece of work, I am sure that the committee will be as one on many aspects of it.</p><p>Clare Adamson, who was a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee in February, made an extremely powerful comment about the wider issues when she spoke in last week&#8217;s debate. She said:</p><p>&#8220;It is far more fundamental and must involve us all embracing a cultural change in our society.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 14 June 2012; c 10067.]</p><p>That hits the nail right on the head and begs the question of how we forge a cultural change. Our society needs to take a genuine look at all the issues that have been raised today and more&#8212;working hours, stereotypes, childcare, the gender quota, women on the edge, as mentioned in Claudia Beamish&#8217;s powerful speech, welfare reform, working hours contracts&#8212;so that we can forge some type of cultural change. Various members touched upon working hours and contracts for flexible working. Clare Adamson mentioned that last week and at the committee meeting in February, and Margaret McDougall spoke about certain terms of equal pay. That is a very powerful argument and another issue that we need to look at.</p><p>Again, various members touched on occupational segregation. I am also a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. At the committee&#8217;s meeting this morning, Fergus Ewing touched on occupational segregation and modern apprenticeships in the renewables sector. That was quite interesting, because he said that the focus is not just on boys doing engineering and girls doing something else. There is a genuine understanding of the issues in that regard.</p><p>On Monday, I visited a school in Port Glasgow and had a lengthy chat on that issue with one of the teachers. Port Glasgow was traditionally a working-class area in the shipbuilding and engineering industries. We talked about how young people&#8217;s attitudes today are different from what they were 30, 40 or 50 years ago, as are the opportunities.</p><p>Sandra White talked about modern apprenticeships. I am sure that everyone will welcome the women&#8217;s summit that will take place in September.</p><p>Many members spoke about childcare. In evidence to the Equal Opportunities Committee, Anne-Marie Mackin of Play First (Scotland) Ltd made the powerful comment:</p><p>&#8220;If the childcare issues were dealt with so that care was available for longer hours, was more responsive to family needs, was provided in the right locations and was either free or relatively affordable, that would deal with many of the other issues.&#8221;</p><p>Obviously, there are positives. All members should warmly welcome the increase to 600 hours of free childcare a year under the forthcoming bill next year. I dare say that that measure will be welcomed, once it has been thoroughly scrutinised.</p><p>Another issue that was raised was about welfare reform. Once again, Anne-Marie Mackin made a comment that I thought was bang on the money when she said:</p><p>&#8220;I think that welfare reform might be the straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 21 February 2012; c 249, 261.]</p><p>All members understand that welfare reform will have a detrimental effect on hundreds of thousands of people in Scotland, both male and female. However, given the issues of working conditions and childcare, welfare reform will have more of an adverse effect on women than on men. I am sure that we will consider that in our inquiry.</p><p>There are positives. I warmly welcome the women&#8217;s summit in September and the proposed increase in nursery provision. The work on the living wage in Scotland is also welcome. However, I absolutely agree with Richard Lyle that we need to reassert our desire for improvement. As the father of two young daughters, I want them to grow up in a Scotland that is fair and equitable and in which they have exactly the same opportunities and chances as males. I want them to work hard, but I want them to have exactly the same chances and opportunities. I look forward to the inquiry with my colleagues on the Equal Opportunities Committee. I dare say that we will discuss the issue further in the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women and Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is my first summing-up speech in my five years in the Parliament.

However, the bill has been extremely interesting, in contrast to what Murdo Fraser said. I do not know whether he takes his view because he is a lawyer&#8212;the only lawyer on the committee. The bill has been extremely interesting and it is important, because it will bring an element of public and private life up to date.</p><p>A number of issues were raised during the bill process. I took a particular interest in the automated registration of title to land system and the use of information technology under part 10. In this day and age, there is absolutely no reason whatever why the use of electronic means&#8212;or, to coin a phrase, electronic wizardry&#8212;should not be increased.</p><p>In paragraph 103 of our stage 1 report, we suggested that the keeper should &#8220;consult and test widely&#8221; to get improved buy-in from the sector for e-registration. I am content that Registers of Scotland will undertake appropriate consultation and testing with stakeholders and end users in developing new or upgraded electronic registration systems. However, I reserve the right&#8212;I am sure that every member in the chamber would do the same&#8212;to challenge the Registers of Scotland if it does not undertake those actions.</p><p>We all understand that public consultations sometimes do not get full backing. In listening to some of the evidence throughout the bill process, it was clear that there was a level of scepticism towards the keeper, particularly with regard to consulting and listening to practitioners. I hope that the process of consultation and testing will continue once the bill is enacted. I am sure that an improved dialogue will take place, and I hope that the end user will obtain a better experience.</p><p>A key aim of the bill is to bring land registration into the 21st century. However, a further key aim is to use land registration as an economic driver, as the minister highlighted earlier. The SPICe briefing for today&#8217;s debate highlighted the challenge that we as a Parliament face in progressing registrations. There are 2.6 million units of property in Scotland, of which 55 per cent have switched to the land register, and 21 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s land mass is on the register. That has come about since the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 was passed.</p><p>The bill will have a positive effect on the number of registrations, and on the percentage of land mass that is registered. However, I hope that the Parliament will return to various land registration issues in the future. Patrick Harvie mentioned compulsory registration, which the minister indicated that he does not wish to include in the bill.</p><p>I agree with the minister&#8217;s comments on the economic potential of the bill and the economic driver theory behind it. However, future Governments will need to continue to scrutinise the progress of land registration. If that happens, the land register will indeed be completed. The Parliament has not undertaken much post-legislative scrutiny since it came back into being because it has had so many other issues to deal with. However, regular scrutiny would allow future Governments the opportunity to act swiftly if the bill&#8217;s aims were not being achieved.</p><p>I will back the bill tonight, and I thank my colleagues on the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee for the way in which they have scrutinised it. I also thank the clerking team, the SPICe team, the committee adviser and the witnesses who gave evidence to the committee.</p><p>I have enjoyed the bill process, and I have learned a tremendous amount. I am sure that when the bill is enacted, it will bring about an improved level of land registration.

My mother worked in school health for over 30 years before she retired. My father worked in the shipyards and then, after they closed, was unemployed for three years. He got back into work and worked in marine engineering until he passed away. My parents were traditional, working-class parents who never spoke languages, although they always encouraged me to. In third year, I picked German for my O-grade because my father was working in Germany at the time and I thought that I could help him with the language when he came home, every few weeks.</p><p>As a result of learning German, I took part in a German exchange trip&#8212;Claudia Beamish also talked about exchange trips. I was 15 and 16 when I took part in that. One year the kids from West Germany came to Scotland, and the second year we went to West Germany. The whole experience had a profound effect on me, particularly when we went on a day trip to East Berlin. The effect that had on me was to prove that communism did not work&#8212;although that is a debate for another day.</p><p>To have the opportunity to spend two weeks in a new country and pick up even more of the language was wonderful. The experience of waking up one morning after having a dream in German was one of those moments that helped to shape me as a person. I realised that I was good at the language, I understood a lot of it, and I appreciated, over that period, that the German people were just like me.

When I got a 1 for my O-grade German, I thought that I had an aptitude for the language&#8212;indeed, I did. However, my two hours of higher German on Friday afternoons was tough going and I struggled with it. I did not apply myself as much as I should have, and I failed it. Undeterred, I went on to college and university and completed my honours degree in European business management with languages&#8212;I studied French and German. I went on to obtain an MBA European. On both courses I had the opportunity to study abroad: in Toulouse&#8212;I will speak to Maureen Watt about Toulouse later&#8212;and Dortmund during the undergraduate degree, and in Angoul&#234;me and Ronneby, in Sweden, during the MBA.</p><p>The MBA course was all in English, so members may ask why it is relevant to this debate. It demonstrates precisely the reason why we need to improve our language skills and capabilities. How many lecturers in Scotland would teach a class&#8212;other than a language class&#8212;in another language? Probably very few would, yet that is exactly what happened in Sweden and in France, which, as you all know, is fiercely proud of its language and promotes and protects it in equal measures. The thing about Sweden that really impressed me was the ease with which the lecturers would switch from Swedish into English and back again. The students would read business textbooks in English so that nothing would be lost in translation, and the discussions and debates would also take place in English.</p><p>Marco Biagi spoke about speakers of other languages having a head start. That is exactly what we are talking about. When it comes to languages, other countries such as Sweden are a long way ahead of us. If we want to fully compete with other countries, we should look at models such as those in the Scandinavian countries.</p><p>I am conscious of time, but I want to give two real-life examples of why languages matter and are important to people. IBM in Greenock has an international customer call centre. Some years ago, I worked for IBM. Part of my job involved dealing with colleagues in that centre. People from all over the world worked there, including Scots, but when it came to languages, they were very much in a minority. There are language-related job opportunities in Scotland, not only with IBM but with many other companies.</p><p>My second example relates to football and it goes back to Kevin Stewart&#8217;s point. The Hearts team that won the Scottish cup on Saturday has a Portuguese manager. Rudi Sk&#225;cel, who scored two goals, is from the Czech Republic. In the old Czechoslovakia, Russian and German were taught rather than English. People come to this country to play football. For them, it is an opportunity to improve their language skills and to enhance their economic opportunities.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Absolutely&#8212;I could not agree more.

It is clear that energy generation is an integral part of Scotland&#8217;s economy and will become more so in the years ahead. Furthermore, the carbon emissions targets set by the Scottish Government, the UK Government and the EU mean that clear and distinct challenges lie ahead. I believe that we will be successful in achieving the targets, but we need to give ourselves every opportunity to do so.</p><p>The current charging regime is clearly not fit for purpose&#8212;a phrase that I am not prone to using very often, as Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee members know. The current charging regime has been used for some time and electricity generation has advanced and changed from the traditional generating methods. More renewable energy is generated and consumed and more is in the pipeline. The current infrastructure is in need of investment to ensure that it can deal with increased supply.</p><p>In order for Scotland to fully capitalise on that required investment while creating more employment opportunities and reducing its carbon emissions, it needs to use every opportunity at its disposal.</p><p>We currently operate in a GB market and cross-border working is something that will continue when Scotland achieves its independence.</p><p>Given the targets that have been set, and bearing in mind that Westminster needs Scotland to deliver more than our per-head-of-population share for the UK Government to reach its overall target, it should be inconceivable that a new mechanism may well be introduced that continues to make that challenge even greater.</p><p>That is not to say that Ofgem has not moved ground; it clearly has, and I welcome that progress. I fully appreciate that those who work in Ofgem have a difficult task and may well feel at times as if they are getting battered from all sides, but the role that they have to play is crucial.</p><p>Ofgem appears to have ruled out the postage stamp approach across GB by saying that it would add an extra &#163;25 to &#163;30 to consumer bills in Scotland. With fuel poverty on the rise due to various factors, including energy prices, the last thing that anyone wants to do is force more people into fuel poverty. However, the debate about location versus usage is changing as a result of the proposals that have been made so far. Ofgem&#8217;s preferred proposal of an improved ICRP has certainly not been rejected by Scottish Power or Scottish Renewables, although they preferred the postage stamp model of operation. They could work with Ofgem&#8217;s proposal, although improvements would still need to be made.</p><p>On the specific point regarding the different solution that is proposed for islands in the north of Scotland, I note from the Scottish Renewables briefing that members were sent in advance of the debate that the organisation queries the Ofgem proposal&#8217;s consistency with the renewable energy directive. I have sympathy with the argument from an equality perspective. I urge Scottish Renewables and any other interested organisation to examine the equality legislation, if they have not already done so, as I believe that the proposals for the islands will certainly not generate a level playing field for generators or for those who are seeking opportunities in the industry.</p><p>Scottish Renewables reported that, under the ICRP model, proposed renewable electricity developments on Scottish islands would become uneconomic. It suggests that 1.2GW of projects&#8212;a frightening figure&#8212;would not proceed.</p><p>I firmly believe that any other country that had the massive potential that Scotland has would be bending over backwards to develop it. The economic boon&#8212;not to mention the positive environmental impact&#8212;would be a tremendous boost in these times. Ofgem is moving in the right direction as progress appears to have been made, but there is still some way to go.</p><p>I urge every member to work to ensure that Scotland obtains the full economic boost&#8212;not to mention the clean energy and the reduction in carbon emissions&#8212;that renewables can bring.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Project Transmit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have heard how important energy transmission is and will continue to be for Scotland&#8217;s economy.

That jam tomorrow or on-a-promise suggestion from the Prime Minister is just incredible. Those who were involved in the 1970s devolution campaign will remember the promise then from Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who promised a better deal if Scots voted no to devolution. What Scotland obtained was certainly not a better deal: 18 years of Tory misrule that decimated shipbuilding, mining, engineering and steel communities the length and breadth of Scotland.</p><p>David Cameron made a very interesting statement in his speech of 16 February this year when he was up in Edinburgh:</p><p>&#8220;When the referendum on independence is over, I am open to looking at how the devolved settlement can be improved further. And yes, that means considering what further powers would be devolved.&#8221;</p><p>It was disappointing that the Prime Minister did not provide any further details on that suggestion. After questioning, he seemed to backtrack immediately by saying that the independence issue needed to be dealt with before how</p><p>&#8220;to improve the devolved settlement&#8221;</p><p>could be considered and discussed. It was not that that was going to happen, but that it could happen. The Prime Minister&#8217;s Tory on-a-promise suggestion may not happen at all.</p><p>The people of Scotland will not be hoodwinked in 2014, but I am sure that they will welcome the further powers that are coming to Scotland through the Scotland Bill. Not only are the borrowing powers that are coming to Scotland additional powers for the Scottish Government, they will provide it with the flexibility to deal with employment and infrastructure opportunities.</p><p>However, the bill is a missed opportunity for a variety of reasons, one of which involves the Crown estate. As there is a members&#8217; business debate on that issue after this debate, I do not intend to say too much about it. I have no doubt that the next debate will cover a lot, but we should consider the wider support for the devolution of the Crown estate from, for example, the Scottish Affairs Committee in the Westminster Parliament, the Lib Dems, who proposed a related amendment to the Scotland Bill in 1998, the Calman commission and both the Scotland Bill Committees of this Parliament. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to regard the Scotland Bill as a missed opportunity for the devolution of the Crown estate.</p><p>Earlier this afternoon we debated project transmit, and some wider energy issues were touched on during that debate. We all know and understand the huge economic opportunity that energy policy presents for Scotland. We also know that offshore developments will play a major part in achieving the renewables targets of Scotland, the UK and the EU. The Crown estate plays a crucial role in that regard. I commend the Scottish Affairs Committee for its report in which it highlighted that rights to the sea bed and out to 200 nautical miles should go to Marine Scotland. The report stated that that body should oversee the management and use of the sea bed. It is just a shame that the UK coalition Government of Lib Dems and Tories did not see the need to transfer those powers to the Scottish Parliament, despite the fact that they have supported that proposal.</p><p>I am proud to be an SNP member of this Parliament and I look forward to our agreeing to the LCM tonight, not because it is the end of the process but because it is a step closer to our destination of independence.</p><p>So far, the debate has been typical. Mr McLetchie is not here at the moment, but he said in his usual Tory fashion that he wanted to limit Scotland&#8217;s ambition and opportunities. We heard the total hypocrisy of the Lib Dems and their long, drawn-out home rule process&#8212;whatever that will be and whenever it will happen. Labour has managed to make a positive advance for the Parliament appear to be a retrograde step.</p><p>The bill will be out of date by the time that it receives royal assent. The people of Scotland will not be fooled again by the Tory Prime Minister offering jam tomorrow without telling us what the ingredients are. By autumn 2014, the people of Scotland will have the opportunity to decide for themselves exactly what they want for their nation&#8212;continued limitation of ambition in the union or responsibilities and being a normal independent nation.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is quite rich coming from a Labour Party member who earlier talked about socialism and all his socialist ideals.

Now we have the debate over the Lochboisdale to Mallaig route which, as we have heard, was abolished in 2001 by the Labour-Lib Dem Scottish Executive.</p><p>Although I am greatly interested in the economic arguments that have been made this morning, I believe that Scotland needs to get to grips with its ferry network once and for all. I am not going to stand here and propose the perfect solution for our network or, more particularly, speak to the lack of a Lochboisdale to Mallaig route that is highlighted in the Labour motion. However, Scotland needs a sustainable, robust and affordable network&#8212;which does not necessarily mean that there should be no subsidy&#8212;and I am confident in the approach that was taken by the Scottish Government in the ferries review in 2009 and that the draft plan, which was published in December and is still out for consultation, is correct and should continue.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly that MSPs&#8212;constituency and regional&#8212;have a right to campaign on behalf of their constituents&#8212;after all, that is why we are here. It is imperative, particularly during a consultation period, that we lobby on behalf of constituents and communities and that we put forward a strong and balanced case.</p><p>The motion mentions the &#8220;economic need&#8221; for a new Lochboisdale to Mallaig ferry service. I do not doubt the ability of MSPs from all sides of the chamber to progress economic arguments for many things, nor do I doubt the ability of outside bodies to do the same, but I know from experience&#8212;I am sure that others do, too&#8212;that the economic argument can be the hardest part of a case to make, regardless of what the issue is. For rural and smaller communities, the economic argument can be that bit harder to make. When it comes down to a business decision, the numbers need to stack up.</p><p>We all have projects that we think, for a number of reasons, it is vital to progress, but ensuring that the numbers work is key to getting to the next stage. I stress that I do not for one minute dispute the economic argument that has been pursued this morning but, as we know, our belts have been tightened as a result of budget cuts from Westminster. Those cuts have put added responsibility on ministers and the Scottish Government to ensure that they get the best economic returns for their expenditure.</p><p>I am sure that, across the chamber, we all wish that we had more money to spend on projects. I know that the demands that have come from some quarters in the recent past would require more than &#163;1&#160;billion of extra expenditure, but no indication has been given of where that money would come from. The Government and Parliament need to deal with the reality that less money is coming to us.</p><p>I am sure that the Labour Party or individual Labour MSPs will have contributed to the consultation exercises that have been held so far. If they have not, they still have time to contribute to the consultation on the draft ferries plan before it closes at the end of next week. I am sure that they, along with others, wish for a comprehensive ferries strategy that covers the country.</p><p>From a West Scotland perspective, I hope that more shipbuilding work will come to Port Glasgow, and I will certainly lobby the Government for that to happen. The recent announcement of the &#163;20&#160;million order for the world&#8217;s first two hybrid ferries for Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd was excellent news, which will help employment prospects in Inverclyde. The draft ferries plan shows an exciting future for the ferry network, with newer ferries being required to replace older vessels, as well as the prospect of new routes. That opens up further opportunities in Inverclyde which, as we all know, builds first-class vessels of which all Scotland can be proud. After the loss of orders in the past&#8212;before 2007&#8212;for Scottish fisheries protection vessels and for some CalMac ferries, I am glad that the tide has begun to turn. I am sorry for the pun.</p><p>It has been an interesting debate and I commend Labour for bringing it to the chamber, but I support the Scottish Government&#8217;s amendment, because we need a robust ferries review and a more robust network around Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663711", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare that my wife works part-time for Caledonian MacBrayne, but is permanently based in Gourock.

He and other members touched on the issues that are highlighted in the committee&#8217;s report. I am sure that the constructive approach that we have seen so far in the committee will continue.</p><p>The bill is welcome because it will update the land registration process. I agree with Murdo Fraser&#8217;s comments on those who have participated in the bill process, and all who have assisted the committee. I particularly thank Ken Reid, the committee&#8217;s adviser, who managed to put some technical terms into layman&#8217;s terms for the benefit of the non-lawyers on the committee.</p><p>One area of the current system in which deficiencies have been highlighted is the automated registration of title to land system. We were told in both written and oral evidence that that system is clunky, is deemed to be inefficient and difficult to use, and is not well used. Given that the purpose of the bill is to ensure that more of Scotland is on the land register, the technical issue with the ARTL system needs to be resolved.</p><p>The committee whole-heartedly supports the proposal to allow e-registration as that should make registration easier and more accessible. However, if the ARTL system is not improved, the policy will face technical difficulties. The sector has already bought into the idea of e-registration despite the fact that there has not been much take-up. To ensure that the buy-in is carried through, the keeper needs to carry out widespread consultation and testing.</p><p>As someone who worked in the information technology sector for a time some years ago, I understand that technology and software rapidly become out of date when they leave the factory. As a result, futureproofing any IT system is a tough challenge, irrespective of the sector for which it is designed. It is imperative that systems are designed with input from those who will use them, and that is particularly true in the area that we are discussing today. Furthermore, I am sure that the financial benefits of such a system will help both the sector and the end customer&#8212;the individual who is buying or selling a property.</p><p>I have focused my contribution on the issue of the ARTL system because of my background in the IT sector, which meant that I could understand it easily, and because of the importance of e-technology to the Scottish economy.

We have heard some excellent contributions from members on all sides of the chamber, and the debate has highlighted that we can unite as one from time to time. That does not preclude members from highlighting particular issues in their own area, which is the reason that we are here. As we all know, this is Scottish tourism week, and it is an ideal opportunity to highlight what we have in the areas that we represent.</p><p>I will put in a plug for the area that I stay in: Inverclyde. Most&#8212;if not all&#8212;members in the chamber will have visited Inverclyde last June, and will have seen how beautiful an area it is. The location is perfect: it is a gateway to Argyll, the airport is just 15 minutes up the road, the largest city in the country is just half an hour up the road and Ayrshire is just down the coast. Inverclyde is truly blessed.</p><p>About three years ago, a group called Discover Inverclyde was established to start to market Inverclyde, because so little had been done in the past. The economic situation has helped no one in the country, but if members, people who are in the public gallery or any readers of today&#8217;s Official Report are interested or want to find out more about Inverclyde, they can go online at discoverinverclyde.com.</p><p>I will also mention water-based activities. I chair the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on recreational boating and marine tourism and was delighted that the minister mentioned sailing in his opening speech. I urge members to contact me and I will send them a report that the cross-party group in the previous session of the Parliament published 12 months ago when it was being closed prior to the election.</p><p>The report highlights many things, but one that members may not be fully aware of is the economic value of marine-based activities to Scotland. In 2008, Sail Scotland published a document that estimated that recreational boating and marine tourism provided an economic benefit in excess of &#163;250&#160;million per annum, supported more than 1,800 full-time equivalent jobs and indirectly supported another 7,900 jobs. Much of that activity will be small businesses in urban and rural settings. That means that the sector is rich, diverse and assists our communities, particularly small communities.</p><p>In the previous session of the Parliament, three Government reports were published that provided an indication of how important our coastline is from a tourism and employment perspective.</p><p>In July 2009, the Scottish Government published a report entitled &#8220;Technical Report: Economic Impact of Recreational Sea Angling in Scotland&#8221;&#8212;the Scottish Sea Angling Conservation Network is a member of the cross-party group. The report indicated that sea angling contributes some &#163;140.8&#160;million to the economy and provides 3,148 full-time equivalent jobs, which is estimated to represent some &#163;70&#160;million in wages. Sea angling can, and does, take place across the country. Those who are involved in it travel, sometimes stay overnight and even drink in bars and restaurants. That is not to mention the cost of getting there and of the equipment that they use. Not having sea angling would hamper many smaller communities in the country.</p><p>The second report was &#8220;The Economic Impact of Wildlife Tourism in Scotland&#8221;. It was published by the Government in May 2010 and gives us a flavour of the economic impact. I will give members a few of the key points from it. The net economic impact of wildlife tourism is around &#163;65&#160;million and it supports around 2,760 full-time equivalent jobs. It is estimated that &#163;276&#160;million is spent on the 1.12 million trips that are made each year to, or within, Scotland to view wildlife, with 75 per cent of that money being from tourists from within the UK.</p><p>The third and final report is &#8220;Sailing Tourism in Scotland&#8221;, which was published by Scottish Enterprise and HIE in February 2010. The sector greatly appreciated that report, as it was the first time that official statistics on it had been collated or produced. Some key information from the report is that sailing tourism accounts for &#163;101&#160;million and supports 2,700 full-time equivalent jobs throughout the country. Non-Scottish boat owners contribute a total of &#163;27&#160;million. The sector has grown over the past 15 years, and new marinas are opening. For example, the James Watt dock marina opened last year in Greenock and hosted the Greenock leg of the tall ships race. There is also investment from the MalinWaters programme.</p><p>Those reports highlight only part of the massive economic impact that the sector has in Scotland.</p><p>The marine-based activities that I have mentioned are not the only ones. There are also subsea activities, canal boating, windsurfing, canoeing, kayaking and waterskiing to name only a few. That is not to mention the huge influx of cruise ships, which Tavish Scott spoke about a few moments ago. He mentioned the 36,500 passengers who dock at Lerwick. That represents &#163;1.3&#160;million to that economy. This year, Greenock expects a 13 per cent increase on last year&#8217;s cruise ship passenger numbers. So far, 41 ships are booked, with a staggering 65,500 passengers coming to Inverclyde. It is estimated that one third of them will stay in the area; that has a massive impact on that economy</p><p>I will lavish a wee bit of praise on a voluntary group called the Inverclyde tourist group. It has been in existence for 10 years and not one person from the group takes a penny. I organised a round-table event earlier this year with the Scottish Government, VisitScotland, Scottish Enterprise, Historic Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage. If it was not for the Inverclyde tourist group, the folk who come off the cruise liners in Inverclyde would not see the benefits of the area. That group&#8212;and others like it throughout the country&#8212;deserves massive praise.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662888", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that members will all be surprised that it took George Adam 20 seconds to mention Paisley.

I am sure that he knows that every member is with him and his family.</p><p>I apologise for being unable to stay for the full debate.</p><p>Eating disorders are serious health issues that affect people from all walks of life. They are often misunderstood, are increasingly common, and are found more and more in demographics with which they are not traditionally associated. Their increasing incidence is accompanied by ever-improving understanding of them and rising rates of diagnosis, but there is still more that can and should be done.</p><p>To establish some context, I will present some data on the prevalence of eating disorders in Scotland over the past few years. The information was provided to me as a result of parliamentary questions that I lodged last year.</p><p>The figures that were given in response to written question S4W-02313, which was lodged last September, show that the estimated number of patients who consulted a GP or nurse regarding a potential eating disorder or related issue did not change much between 2003-04 and 2009-10. The number moved from 3,210 to 3,270. However, if the figures are broken down by age, we see that the most substantial increase in eating disorder consultations has been among Scotland&#8217;s young people. In fact, there was a 15 per cent increase in the number of patients aged 14 and under who sought help from a doctor and a 12 per cent increase among those aged between 15 and 25. On the face of it, that apparent rise in the incidence of eating disorders is concerning, but I am heartened by the fact that, more than ever, people are open to seeking and receiving the help that they need. In the past, the condition may have gone undiagnosed and the patient may have gone untreated.</p><p>In large part, the long-term risks that are posed by eating disorders stem from the difficulties that sufferers and their families face in recognising and accepting the existence of a problem and seeking the appropriate help. It is worth noting that, in a recent study by the eating disorder charity Beat, more than half of the people who were asked said that they did not tell anyone about their eating disorder because they did not know how to talk about it. I hope that our participation in the debate demonstrates the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s commitment to helping to break the silence, so that when people with eating disorders find the courage to confide in someone, they feel understood and supported.</p><p>Today, we are debating the motion that Dennis Robertson lodged. A couple of days beforehand, however, I lodged a similar motion, following which I got an e-mail from a Labour MSP&#8217;s researcher congratulating me on lodging the motion and on raising the issue in the Parliament and saying that it was something that should have been done a long time ago. I am happy that we are debating Dennis Robertson&#8217;s motion.</p><p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has seen a noticeable rise recently in the treatment of eating disorders across the healthcare spectrum. Charities such as Beat and the Scottish eating disorder interest group act as a vital link between sufferers, their friends and family, and the treatment that they require. Information from the parliamentary questions that I submitted showed that there was an increase in eating disorder patients being treated at all hospital types in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area between 2003 and 2010.</p><p>That said, because of the veil of silence that still remains, eating disorders represent an area of health policy debate that does not receive as much attention as other areas, which is something that we hope to redress through eating disorder awareness week. To that end, understanding is key, and we can already see a growing awareness of symptoms, conditions and treatments in families, schools and the workplace, as well as an erosion of the stigma that, for too long, has been associated with eating disorders.</p><p>I am confident that we will see support from members across the chamber for the various treatment centres and support organisations across Scotland. Indeed, I am sure that colleagues in the chamber would echo the thanks that I express to the national health service, the Scottish Government and the various eating disorder charities and support groups that continue to be perceptive of the needs of individuals and families affected by eating disorders. However, more still needs to be done.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661460", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Eating Disorders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have just heard a speech of great courage and strength from Dennis Robertson.

Listening to Liz Smith this morning, the message that I received was that the FE cuts in Scotland should be proportionate. She later mentioned the fear of future cuts. We also heard from her that the way to ensure that there are no further cuts is for students to pay instead of having free education in Scotland.</p><p>I looked at the funding figures for the college sector going back to 1999. Then, &#163;213 million and &#163;4 million was spent on the resource and capital allocations respectively. In 2006-07, that had increased to &#163;510 million and &#163;88 million. Since 2007-08, the figures have increased until this year. However, as we all know, even though there were increases, that was never going to be enough for some in the chamber. Year after year, we heard and read of the complaints from some parties that the college sector was being short-changed, even though its funding allocation was increasing.</p><p>The commitment to maintain student numbers should be welcomed across the chamber.</p><p>The economic conditions in Scotland, across the UK and around the world, are difficult and, as a result, it is imperative that students who wish to attend colleges have that opportunity to improve their education, skills and employability.</p><p>At the same time as maintaining student places, we have a welcome opportunity for college reform. I understand that change can be frightening to some, as they are unsure of what will happen. However, the current college sector was established some 30 years ago, under the then Conservative Government with the aim of creating more competition within the sector. That had the inevitable effect of creating duplication. It also created institutions where there has been a level of strife between management and the lecturers, with the result being that students do not always obtain the level of education that they deserve. The history of James Watt College in Greenock over the past 10 years bears that out.</p><p>I remember taking part in a march and rally prior to the 2005 election in support of James Watt College and its students. Things settled down when the principal at that time left but, in recent weeks, lecturers have once again been on the picket lines and students have suffered. The strike has been suspended for two weeks for further talks, but the situation is one of great confusion and apprehension.</p><p>I am conscious of time, Presiding Officer.</p><p>The students and lecturers who have contacted me are raising issues not about the funding to the college but about how their college is being managed.</p><p>James Watt College is one of the colleges that have reached a no compulsory redundancy agreement, as was mentioned by Anne McTaggart. That was signed last May and is due to expire in June. I have been informed that management sent out a letter in October, indicating that 29 senior lecturers will lose their positions, with 15 learning enhancement lecturer positions being created instead, obviously on reduced terms.</p><p>Whether the issue is the funds that are going to colleges&#8217; budgets or the money that colleges have themselves, we in the chamber should agree on how that money is managed.

Unfortunately, they are not here to defend themselves.</p><p>The creation of the Scottish cities alliance is long overdue. As a non-city dweller, one thing that has really annoyed and disappointed me over the years is the constant bickering between those who have led Glasgow and those who have led Edinburgh about which city is better. I am sure that there are arguments on both sides, but as a non-city dweller I found the discussion boring and tedious. It also belittled those two marvellous cities.</p><p>I am delighted by the creation of the strategy and the Scottish cities alliance, and I welcome the fact that the six cities&#8212;not just the two&#8212;can work together to make their economies better and help Scotland to become better. As I said, the constant attacks detracted from Glasgow and Edinburgh&#8217;s successes and opportunities. I accept that some of that might have been a bit of banter between the two cities, but we have grown up and I welcome that. A successful Scotland needs its two largest cities to work together.</p><p>I will talk about how the west of Scotland can benefit from the strategy, but first I want to talk about Dundee. I studied in Dundee, which is a marvellous city. Before I went, I had the impression that it was dour, drab and dreich, but I found it to be a wonderful city. The people are tremendous and very similar to the folk in Inverclyde, where I am from, and there is a range of things to do. Many people have come to live, work and study in Dundee, and it is a wonderful melting pot. I hope that the strategy will benefit the city.</p><p>The cabinet secretary talked about the wider regional benefits of the strategy and touched on the question that Willie Coffey asked in Parliament last week. When she appeared before the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, Chic Brodie, Angus MacDonald and I made the point that we do not represent cities. We asked her how the strategy will affect the areas that we represent and whether funding for our areas will be reduced. The cabinet secretary gave an assurance, as she did today, that funding to our areas will not be reduced. I am happy to accept that. There are challenges to do with deprivation and poverty in the west of Scotland that are similar to the challenges in our cities. It is vital that the strategy is a success for the west of Scotland, and if Glasgow is a success, the west of Scotland can also be a success.</p><p>I stay in Inverclyde, which many members visited in June. Many people from Inverclyde commute to Glasgow and elsewhere for employment. If there is more investment and collaborative working, I anticipate that there will be greater opportunities for people in Inverclyde, if not elsewhere in the west of Scotland. The strategy presents opportunities for the area. There has been huge investment in Glasgow during the past four years and more investment is planned, so I stress that business opportunities for the wider region should be actively promoted by the relevant Government agencies. However wonderful our cities are, not everyone wants to live in or put their business in a city.</p><p>Members who visited Inverclyde last year will have appreciated the beauty and splendour of our area. Mark McDonald talked to me about the area and said that he thought that Inverclyde must have a massive tourism industry. That is unfortunately not the case, because there has been a lack of vision from many people who have led in Inverclyde over the years. I am glad to say that things are moving forward, but opportunities have been missed in the past.</p><p>Inverclyde was decimated by the Tories when they were last in power and we have lost 20,000 people, who moved to find employment. However, many people have not given up. The people who stayed still have hope and aspire to make Inverclyde better. I recognised much of what John Park said in his excellent and thoughtful speech, because similar things have happened to the area in which I live.</p><p>Drew Smith said that the Scottish Wildlife Trust talks about a &#8220;missed opportunity&#8221; in its briefing. I studied in Sweden and spent a lot of time in Stockholm, which is a stunning city. The Swedes are proud of the mix of green and built-up areas in the city. I gently remind Mr Smith that the Scottish National Party is not yet in power in Glasgow, so if he is questioning the lack of green space and parks in the city, he needs to look a bit closer to home.</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree with what Sandra White and John Park said about community-benefit clauses, because we must ensure that there is community buy-in.</p><p>Neil Findlay talked about a socialist Government. It appears that he has not read the memo from his current leader, Ed Miliband, who talks about responsible capitalism. If Mr Findlay wants to put in a bid, I am sure that the trade unions are listening.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agenda for Cities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome today&#8217;s debate and the publication of the new cities strategy.

It is important to state that the Tele&#8212;the shortened name for the newspaper&#8212;did not launch the campaign because it wants petrol and diesel to be cheaper in Inverclyde than anywhere else, but because it believes that there is inequality in the pricing of petrol and diesel in Inverclyde and in nearby towns.</p><p>This week, the newspaper is reporting that the average price of unleaded petrol is 132.9p a litre, and that the average price of diesel is 141.9p. It uses a couple of petrol stations outside Inverclyde to make daily comparisons, and the prices at those stations are regularly lower than those in Inverclyde. I know people who have stopped putting fuel in their cars in Inverclyde because they know that, if they buy it elsewhere, it will be that bit cheaper. That has a knock-on effect on the local Inverclyde economy, because those people purchase other products and services outside the area.</p><p>In previous correspondence with companies that supply fuel, they have responded that they are pricing the fuel to be competitive in the local market. In studying economics, we are always told that competition works to reduce prices, and that if there are more suppliers, there is a better chance of the customer getting a better deal. I accept that theory, but it is not working for motorists in Inverclyde. Competition in fuel pricing does not appear to be working.</p><p>I can understand when members who represent rural communities highlight the high price of fuel in their constituencies. I contacted some of my colleagues this week to ask for examples of fuel prices in their areas. Mike MacKenzie responded, telling me that a petrol station on the Isle of Coll is charging &#163;1.71 for a litre of unleaded petrol, and &#163;1.72 for a litre of diesel. I fully appreciate that the price of fuel in Inverclyde and other parts of West Scotland is not as high as it is in the Western Isles, Orkney, Shetland and parts of the Highlands. There remains an issue, however, with regard to the inequality of the prices.</p><p>The Greenock Telegraph online reported on 22 July that fuel was 7p a litre cheaper in Ayr than in Inverclyde. I congratulate the people of Ayr on getting their fuel 7p a litre cheaper&#8212;well done to them&#8212;but that highlights yet again how flimsy the local-competition argument actually is. Within the past week, I have purchased fuel from two garages outwith Inverclyde. The first occasion was at Tesco in Helensburgh last Friday, and the second was at the Esso garage in Paisley yesterday, when I was on my way to Parliament. I noticed that the diesel in the Esso garage was 5p a litre cheaper than in Inverclyde, and that petrol was 3p a litre cheaper.</p><p>Any purely economic explanation of those irregularities falls down. Scotland is an oil-rich nation, yet Scots are now paying among the highest fuel prices in Europe, and more than ever before. Rising oil prices are putting extra revenue into the United Kingdom Treasury. It is bad enough that Scotland does not see the benefit of its rich natural resources, but we also lack a structure to ensure fairness in relation to fuel duty. It is high time that some of the money that the Treasury rakes in was used to bring down and stabilise fuel prices in Scotland. This situation, more than anything, underlines the need for the fuel duty regulator for which the people of Scotland and the Scottish National Party have long campaigned.</p><p>Last week, during our debate on the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8217;s autumn statement, I mentioned the delay in introducing the 3p per litre increase that had been due in January. I welcomed the chancellor&#8217;s decision not to introduce the increase, and I do so again today. However, he has delayed it only until next August, so I encourage him not to introduce it then, either. Murdo Fraser also touched on that in his contribution to the debate last week. The 3p increase would be a retrograde step, whether it was done in January or August. We know that the economic conditions are not great and, in the light of today&#8217;s announcement of the latest unemployment statistics, I hope that the chancellor will realise that high fuel prices play a part in such figures.</p><p>Inverclyde faces particular challenges. In an environment in which there is high unemployment, people can ill afford increased fuel bills, especially when the bills could hinder their trade or their route back into work. This morning&#8217;s announcement highlighted that there are 3,500 unemployed people in Inverclyde. That just goes to show the economic challenges that the area faces.</p><p>Although the SNP Government is working to lower bills through the council tax freeze, the small business bonus scheme and the abolition of prescription charges, as well as trying to create opportunities to stimulate the economy and creating modern apprenticeships, Inverclyde motorists feel as if they are being ripped off at the fuel pump. There are knock-on effects on the wider Inverclyde economy.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657340", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Prices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the members who signed the motion, including Murdo Fraser, without whom the debate would not be taking place, as he was the first and only member from the Opposition parties to sign the motion.

Rising fuel and food prices are constantly on the minds of businesses and households alike. Last year, the Greenock Telegraph started its petrol and diesel watch campaign, which provides a great service to Inverclyde and the surrounding communities by printing the price of fuel at filling stations throughout Inverclyde and the neighbouring towns on a daily basis. As members will know, I have lodged a motion on this issue and, following the vote tonight, I am hoping to have a member&#8217;s business debate on it next week.</p><p>Last week&#8217;s decision not to introduce the 3p increase on fuel duty was welcome. However, the chancellor is still committed to introducing it next August, and there is much more to be done to encourage him not to do so. Welcome though the delayed introduction&#8212;and, I hope, postponement&#8212;of the fuel duty increase is, it represents a short-term fix in an area that requires fundamental restructuring. People in Scotland have long campaigned for a fairer fuel duty regime, and the SNP has led calls for the establishment of a fuel duty regulator. Unfortunately, those calls have been rejected time and again in Westminster.</p><p>We all know that the European economic situation is not in good shape. We read and hear daily of the increasing difficulties facing the European economies. Last week&#8217;s downgrading by the OBR of growth forecasts over the coming three years made it clear that the UK Government&#8217;s actions so far are just not working. Capital projects help to stimulate jobs and economies, but the chancellor&#8217;s autumn statement last week was a missed opportunity for Scotland. An expanded &#163;2 billion of capital infrastructure expenditure in Scotland to help offset the 32 per cent real-terms cut to Scotland&#8217;s capital budget would have provided a good opportunity for the chancellor. As the cabinet secretary said, every &#163;100 million invested in capital generates &#163;160 million and 1,400 jobs in the wider economy. That kind of investment is even more vital in the current economic climate.</p><p>A theme is now well established, however. When action is required, the UK Government is lethargic, and when it sees fit to act, it does so using broad strokes that are ill tailored to Scotland.

Until the people of Scotland have full control of their own affairs, we will be forced to await such announcements from the chancellor with more than a little trepidation, year after year, knowing that despite the Scottish Government&#8217;s best efforts, Westminster can continue to ignore and undermine proposals that are in the best interests of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656625", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autumn Budget Statement and the Scottish Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In households in the west of Scotland, and across Scotland, budgets are being squeezed more than ever, especially at this time of year.

His initial comments about the erosion of confidence, hope and bravado were absolutely correct and I know exactly what he was talking about when he said that, despite being polite and courteous, young people are still receiving rejection after rejection. In 1997, when I graduated from university with my second degree, I applied for well over 200 jobs and either did not get an interview or simply did not hear anything back from the workplace in question.</p><p>Anne McTaggart referred to the challenge of putting together a CV and some of the online assistance that young people can access. Of course, the option of online support was not really open to people in 1997; instead, I was sent on a five-day course that could have been done in a day and a half. It was simply a means of getting people out of the way and was an absolute waste of time. Thankfully, things have moved on a bit since then. Eventually, I managed to secure short-term employment, which helped me to regain some of my self-belief, confidence and hope and allowed me to refocus my attention. Within a couple of months, I managed to get a position in IBM and remained there for two and a half years.</p><p>I agree with many members that a great deal more needs to be done to tackle youth unemployment. However, it is not a new issue; it was an issue five years ago and it was an issue not only in 1997 under the UK Labour Government but during the 18 years of the Tories&#8217; attempts to decry society. This challenge has been around for many years and I am sure that it will still be a challenge in 15 or 20 years&#8217; time.</p><p>Given the many valid points raised in Iain Gray&#8217;s motion, I hope that the Labour Party fully engages and tries to work with the Scottish Government on this year&#8217;s budget. The experience of last year&#8217;s budget was appalling. Even though Labour members were offered what they wanted, they voted against the budget and could not bring themselves to vote for the 25,000 modern apprenticeship places each year over the five-year period of the parliamentary session.</p><p>Liz Smith spoke about the comments in the Willy Roe report and from businesspeople about young people not having the correct attitude. Last week, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee had a focus session on the tourism industry in Scotland, during which we once again heard that claim. Gavin Ellis from the Knockomie hotel&#8212;I hope that I pronounced that correctly&#8212;in Moray and Norman Springford from the Apex Hotels chain stated their belief that there is an issue with young people not having the correct attitude.</p><p>Before Jenny Marra goes on the attack, I point out that I believe that young people want to work. With additional guidance and careers advice, some young people might have improved options and opportunities. If I had received additional guidance and assistance in 1997&#8212;and before that, when I was in school&#8212;I might have taken a different path in life. If businesses say that there is a problem, it is imperative that the Government, the new minister for youth employment&#8212;I welcome the announcement of that position&#8212;and public agencies discuss those concerns, find out whether there truly is an issue and, if so, deal with it.</p><p>It is important to highlight the issue of apprenticeships. The Scottish Government is writing a requirement for apprenticeships into agreements so that funding creates employment. We have heard examples of that from the First Minister and other members, but I will mention another. A few weeks ago, the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment announced a &#163;20 million order for Ferguson Shipbuilders in Port Glasgow to build the world&#8217;s first two hybrid ferries for Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd. The order will safeguard 75 jobs and create up to 100 more, including 20 new apprenticeships. The ships will be the first to be built by Ferguson&#8217;s in more than four and a half years. The order has been warmly welcomed in Inverclyde, and particularly because of the apprenticeships. I firmly believe that the order provides Ferguson&#8217;s with a wonderful opportunity to make progress and I am sure that it will do so with great relish. I look forward to there being even more apprenticeships if Ferguson&#8217;s gets more orders.</p><p>I will touch on funding for colleges. The NUS briefing highlights the importance of our colleges, as they provide a second or third chance and a route to more opportunities for people to help themselves. I know that that is the case because, although I worked hard at school, I could not study when it came to exams so, after school, I went to college and was there for three years before going to university. I know exactly the opportunities that colleges provide. I chose to study in Glasgow rather than at James Watt College in Greenock or Reid Kerr College in Paisley, which were closer to where I stayed. That was purely a life choice, as I wanted to meet people outside Inverclyde.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Unemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was right to choose this topic for debate and I thank Iain Gray for bringing it to the chamber.

This week, campaigners for the Clyde maritime rescue co-ordination centre at Greenock heard the news that they and the Inverclyde community have been dreading: the Greenock base is to close.</p><p>Parliament has debated the coastguard modernisation proposals on two separate occasions. The first time was a members&#8217; debate led by Alasdair Allan in January, and the second was my members&#8217; debate in June. I am glad that every party and every MSP who spoke supported maintaining coastguard facilities across Scotland. We all realised the folly of the proposals, because the coastline and Scotland&#8217;s internal waters are of paramount importance to the Scottish economy. More than that, we all know that no one can put a price on the saving of a life. I welcomed that unanimous support from Parliament and I hope that, come 5pm today, we can still speak with one voice to let Mr Penning and his department know that this Parliament values safety over coastguard cuts.</p><p>I whole-heartedly support the 31 men and women who work in Greenock to deliver the full range of coastguard services. Their skill, expertise, understanding and local knowledge that cover 2,500 miles of Scottish coastline will be hard to replicate. It is vital to maintain the local knowledge of the men and women who serve at MRCC Clyde. Not until one considers the area and the population that MRCC Clyde serves does one realise how indispensable a first-hand understanding of the region and its coastline is to effective co-ordination.</p><p>Some key facts need to be highlighted about the Clyde base: it covers some 2,500 miles of coastline in the west of Scotland; the area that it covers includes the UK&#8217;s busiest ferry routes, which carry 6.4 million passengers every year; it is on the flight paths for two of Scotland&#8217;s major airports, not to mention those of many smaller ones; and it covers the UK&#8217;s nuclear submarine fleet and weapons, which are based on the Clyde. MRCC Clyde is the busiest coastguard station in Scotland and the third busiest in the UK.</p><p>Given that the nuclear submarine fleet is based on the Clyde, and given the growing number of cruise liners, which bring thousands of visitors to the west of Scotland every year, and the increase in the number of onshore and offshore renewables projects, added to the fact that approximately half the marinas in Scotland are located in the area that is covered by MRCC Clyde, we can only assume that the trend of rapid expansion in river traffic is set to continue.</p><p>To render MRCC Clyde inactive would leave Scotland and, indeed, the UK without a mainland maritime rescue co-ordination centre between Holyhead and Aberdeen, with responsibility for the vast distance in between being distributed between Belfast and Stornoway. I welcome the fact that the Belfast and Stornoway centres will remain, as there were legitimate arguments for that, but I cannot understand why the Clyde base is to close.</p><p>After listening to Mike Penning&#8217;s statement and his answers to questions on Tuesday, I was of the impression that he was totally out of touch with Scotland. Given that the Tories have only one member of Parliament for Scotland, he may think that he does not have much to lose in Scotland, and very little to lose in the north-west of England from the closure of the Liverpool centre. I would like to be wrong in making that assumption, and I hope to be persuaded that that is the case. I have listened to what has been said so far, and I will continue to listen.</p><p>My support for the saving of MRCC Clyde has been resolute. I sent in a submission to the consultation, I attended the public meetings in Greenock and, at the march and rally in Greenock, I shared a public platform with the leader of Inverclyde Council, the newly elected MP for Inverclyde and a member of the Clyde coastguard staff who is a Public and Commercial Services Union member. Along with Duncan McNeil MSP, I met the First Minister and Greenock MRCC workers. In addition, I wrote to the First Minister of Northern Ireland to seek his support for the Clyde centre.</p><p>The Northern Irish First Minister and our First Minister cannot both be wrong. They fully understand the importance of local knowledge and understanding in dealing with this vital public service. Saving MRCC Clyde and saving MRCC Belfast are not, in my opinion, mutually exclusive. The arguments to save both are absolutely sound. The additional burden that will be placed on the staff in Belfast will pose massive challenges, and I have every sympathy for them. They have not asked to be put in a near impossible position, but I believe that that is what they will find themselves in. I do not believe that the people of Northern Ireland, let alone the people of the west of Scotland, will receive the same quality of service that is currently provided.</p><p>The dangers of the proposed closures are clear: they threaten to leave us with too few co-ordination centres, too few staff and a lot less local knowledge. In straitened times, certain cutbacks can be explained, but there is no reason to compromise safety and people&#8217;s lives unnecessarily. This Scottish Government has prioritised front-line services, wherever possible, above all else, and I am astounded that the London Government will not support a similar course of action.</p><p>Ensuring the safety of our coastline and our inland waters is of paramount importance to save lives and to provide a strategic economic direction. Mr Penning&#8217;s decision underlines the fact that the UK Government does not consider our coastline to be of strategic importance, and it is now imperative that responsibility for the coastguard services is devolved to the Scottish Parliament with immediate effect. That way, we can work to provide the safety of Scotland&#8217;s people and its coastline that is required.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655473", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Maritime Safety and Coastguards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak in this debate with a heavy heart.

The NHS needs to change, and reducing its senior management by 25 per cent over this session of Parliament will be a welcome change.

I know that there are financial difficulties across the UK. This Parliament received a &#163;500 million cut to the budget from the previous Labour Government and a &#163;1.3 billion cut to the budget from the current Tory-Lib Dem UK Government. So, with less money coming to Scotland, the funding allocated to the NHS in Scotland by this SNP Government is actually a good deal.</p><p>I know that Labour does not appreciate the issue of balancing the books. The situation that the UK Government&#8212;and the whole of the UK&#8212;is in is not all the fault of the banks, but Labour does not understand that. At least Alistair Darling had the decency towards the end of his term in ministerial office to be honest by telling us that the cuts that he would initiate would be tougher and deeper than those of Thatcher. Labour members might not want to hear that unfortunate truth about Alistair Darling. I hope that they are not proud, but ashamed, about what we have heard this morning about the NHS in England.</p><p>The cabinet secretary spoke about the first moves to privatise NHS facilities down south. Unfortunately, there is no Lib Dem in the chamber this morning, which just shows what they think about the NHS. Labour needs to accept that the Tories and the Lib Dems are moving on, at pace, the project of privatising the NHS, which was started by the previous Labour Government.</p><p>I firmly believe that the NHS should remain free at the point of need. Of the range of public services over which this Parliament has control, our NHS is, for me, the jewel in the crown. Every member should be proud of what the men and women in the NHS deliver for us on a daily basis.</p><p>Some of their achievements need to be highlighted again. Waiting times are at record lows; cancer waiting times are being met for the first time; day case rates are at an all-time record high; and the length of stay in hospitals is at a record low.</p><p>I said at the beginning of my speech that the NHS is not perfect&#8212;no organisation is. The NHS can still improve, because there is always room for improvement. Unfortunately, in their speeches today Labour members provided no suggestions for how to improve the NHS, apart from the usual mantra of &#8220;more money&#8221;. I mentioned Hanzala Malik&#8217;s speech in my opening comments; his was the exception.</p><p>Every person in Scotland and the UK is now suffering on a daily basis as a result of the profligacy of Labour colleagues in the previous Government in London. Throwing money at an organisation is not always the answer. I know that the NHS in Scotland is safe in the hands of Nicola Sturgeon. I also know that the population in Scotland trust Nicola Sturgeon to safeguard the NHS. Yes there are challenges, but nobody outside this Parliament wants to go back to the dark days of Labour in control not delivering for the benefit of Scotland and not delivering the NHS that Scotland needs.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654312", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protecting Scotland&#8217;s NHS"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been somewhat disappointing so far&#8212;apart from Hanzala Malik&#8217;s speech.

We have already heard about various aspects of how Scotland can contribute while having a massive economic advantage. I will not go over all the points that have been raised, but I will touch on a couple of the issues.</p><p>It is relevant to highlight the launch of the Scottish Government&#8217;s new economic strategy and to welcome the commitment that it shows by setting the low-carbon economy as a new strategic priority. It sends out a powerful message not only to Scotland but to the wider world that the country is open for business. A number of large-scale investments have already brought high-quality jobs to Scotland in recent months. Page 51 of the strategy sets the criteria that I find optimistic. It reflects on that new priority and says that we have</p><p>&#8220;the opportunity to place Scotland in an advantageous position within the global economy and ensure that the benefits of this transformational change are shared across the economy and all our communities.&#8221;</p><p>With that in mind, I will discuss the transmission charging regime. My colleague Aileen McLeod questioned the First Minister on that earlier this afternoon and my colleague Maureen Watt touched on it in her speech. We all know that it has been a long-running saga. One of the reasons why the upgrading of the infrastructure is so important is that we need to ensure that our communities, irrespective of where they are, have the opportunity to benefit from the electricity that they generate and put on to the grid. I understand the argument for the system that we currently have and the points about the costs of transporting energy from a rural part of Scotland to somewhere in the central belt, but it is not fair. The current regime is a barrier to renewable energy generation in Scotland.</p><p>My second point is about the more localised matter of the national renewables infrastructure fund, what it can do and how it can best be used to provide sustainable economic growth. Last week, in the debate on the economic strategy, I proposed tying the NRIF in with one of the new enterprise zones. I used the example of Inverclyde, because it has been an enterprise zone in the past. Some would suggest that it should not be in the running again, and some criticise the whole idea altogether&#8212;we heard some sceptical comments about enterprise zones from the Labour members during question time. However, I am happy to reiterate what I said last week. The last time that Inverclyde had enterprise zone status, the Tories were in power at Westminster and Labour was in power in Inverclyde Council. It was not a success. In fact, it was a 10-year opportunity wasted.</p><p>We now have the urban regeneration company Riverside Inverclyde, which is working hard to turn round years of declining population and hope. As with everywhere else, there are massive challenges facing Riverside Inverclyde because of the economic situation. I would therefore be grateful if the minister would consider designating Inverclyde an enterprise zone, while linking it with the national renewables infrastructure fund. Inverclyde&#8217;s location and industrial expertise put it in a strong position to become an economic player in the renewables sector.</p><p>The workforce will come back to Inverclyde. Many of its people are dispersed across Scotland, the rest of the UK and the rest of the world. However, the skills base still exists and many people would like the opportunity to get back to work and contribute to society. Making Inverclyde an enterprise zone would be a good chance for them to do that. It is not inconceivable that the creation of a new enterprise zone with a focus on low-carbon manufacturing opportunities aligned with investment from the NRIF would provide Inverclyde or a similar area in the west of Scotland with a sustainable economic future. Employment would increase, including more modern apprenticeships, which would help to increase manufacturing output and assist the Scottish economy. More money would be in the local economy, and that would help to sustain businesses and traders. Commercial traffic on the Clyde would increase as manufactured products were transported.</p><p>Those are just some of the potential sustainable outcomes that could benefit an area such as Inverclyde, if it was fortunate enough to get the opportunity. I raised the matter at question time before this debate and was pleased that the minister agreed to meet me so that we can discuss the proposal further. Whether it is in west Scotland or in the whole of Scotland, we have a wonderful opportunity to make a long-lasting and positive difference to the country and the population.</p><p>I am pleased to see that Alex Johnstone has come back into the chamber. I always enjoy his contributions. I might not always agree with him, but he tends to bring a bit of humour to the debate, whether he means it or not, and he always gets a wee laugh. However, I was a wee bit lost when he was talking about the investment in renewable energy only surviving because of public interventions. I might be wrong about this, but surely there have been public interventions over the years to create the nuclear power stations that exist in the UK. If he is going to use that argument, he must be consistent and apply it to nuclear power as well.</p><p>I am conscious of the time. I am happy to support the motion in the minister&#8217;s name. I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651783", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Low-carbon Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Everyone in the Parliament knows that Scotland has the potential to be a major player in the low-carbon economy.

With the UK Government now cutting public spending too far and too fast&#8212;including an &#163;800&#160;million cash cut to the Scottish Government capital budget this year alone&#8212;the lack of a plan B from the chancellor is frightening to say the least.</p><p>No one can deny that the UK public finances are in a shocking mess. That is largely due to the ineptitude of Labour prior to the last Westminster election, as well as the crash, but the earth-scorching policies that the Tory chancellor&#8212;aided and abetted by his Lib Dem chief secretary&#8212;is inflicting on public sector spending are causing alarm throughout Scotland.</p><p>The new Scottish Government strategy is to be welcomed, although I invite members to think how much more could be done if the Parliament had more powers than the limited competence that we have. This week, Reform Scotland published its submission to the Scotland Bill Committee. It highlights clearly the funding anomaly that exists between Holyrood and Westminster. Currently, Holyrood has devolved responsibility for nearly 60 per cent of Scottish public expenditure. However, it has control over raising only 6.4 per cent of the funding for that expenditure.</p><p>Some people might say that it is tremendously generous of Westminster to save the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government the time, bother and money that are necessary to collect the taxes, but that is an irrelevant argument. I suggest that Scotland be given control of key taxes&#8212;such as income tax or corporation tax&#8212;that could be used to influence the direction of the Scottish economy as part of a wider economic strategy. Those are not my words, but the words of David Steel in the Steel commission&#8217;s report. If John Swinney had those levers, he would have more flexibility and more tools in the box with which to do an even better job than he currently does.</p><p>The strategy has many positive points that, I am sure, can be supported across the parties. I am particularly interested in the location of enterprise zones and whether they could be tied into other measures, such as the national renewables infrastructure fund.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary is aware, under the Tories at Westminster and with Labour in control of Inverclyde Council, Inverclyde became an enterprise zone. It is fair to say that that was not a success; in fact, it was a 10-year opportunity wasted. We now have the urban regeneration company Riverside Inverclyde, which is doing good work. However, with the slowdown in house purchasing and building, much of which is due to the lack of access to finance, the URC faces challenges. Similarly, every organisation that is in receipt of public money faces challenges.</p><p>Therefore, I would be grateful if the cabinet secretary would consider linking the aforementioned enterprise zones and the NRIF. That would aid Inverclyde&#8217;s potential to become a sustainable economic player in the renewables sector. Members should make no mistake: the workforce will come back to Inverclyde, as many people are currently dispersed not only throughout Scotland and the UK but throughout the world. The skills base exists. All that we request is the opportunity for people to come back.</p><p>It is not inconceivable that the creation of a new enterprise zone with a focus on low-carbon manufacturing opportunities, aligned to investment from the NRIF, would provide Inverclyde or a similar area in the west of Scotland with a sustainable economic future. Employment would increase&#8212;including more modern apprenticeships&#8212;which would help to increase manufacturing output and thus assist the Scottish economy. More money would be in the local economy, which would help to sustain businesses and traders. Commercial traffic on the Clyde would increase as the manufactured products were transported. That is not to mention the added interest in leisure activities that would occur as people took an interest in the manufacturing facilities by the coast.</p><p>Those are only some of the potential sustainable outcomes that could benefit an area such as Inverclyde if it is fortunate to have the opportunity.

First, the publication of the Transport Select Committee report at Westminster this morning has somewhat superseded the motion before us. It rejected the proposals and called on the United Kingdom coalition Government to withdraw them&#8212;I will return to that point shortly.</p><p>Secondly, I received a communication from the chief executive of the David MacBrayne Group in which the group highlighted its concerns with aspects of the motion and the potential misinterpretation of what the group had stated in its submission to the Transport Select Committee. I read the motion thoroughly a number of times after I received the e-mail, and I can see how the group might have interpreted it. The title of the motion was also mentioned. I appreciate that the David MacBrayne Group would not offer any political support on campaign issues, but its valid point of ensuring that any proposals should centre on saving lives and not saving money is in my opinion supportive of attempts to save the services.</p><p>My motion takes the usual format, and I did not in any way mean to cause either direct or indirect misinterpretation. The group&#8217;s reading of the motion was certainly different from mine, but I am happy to put on record my thanks to it for raising its concerns about the motion and for bringing them to my attention.</p><p>I will summarise a couple of the proposals that the UK Government has put forward. First, there is a proposal to reduce the number of maritime operation centres in the UK, leaving only two 24-hour centres: one in Aberdeen, and the other in Southampton or Plymouth. There would also be seven sub-centres, only one of which would be in Scotland&#8212;in either Shetland or Stornoway. The result of those proposals is that the five operation centres in Scotland would be reduced to two.</p><p>Along with other members, I have met coastguard representatives a few times. I am sure that everyone in the chamber will know that they are absolutely committed to the job that they do. They understand the areas that they cover, and it would be very difficult for people from other parts of Scotland or the UK to understand the nuances of the territory in different parts of the country.</p><p>We debated the issue back in January in a members&#8217; business debate secured by Alasdair Allan. He has given me his apologies that he could not make this debate, but he said that he still has the same concerns that he had in January and remains supportive of what the Parliament said then and what has been said recently.</p><p>In the debate in January, the political consensus was that the UK Government&#8217;s proposals were dangerous.

It is the UK&#8217;s second most popular area for such activity, coming behind the Solent, and our recreational boating sector is increasing year on year.

However, the one issue that my Government and every member will have to address has been constant for some time now: the need for job opportunities and to ensure that the economy can grow sustainably.</p><p>We all ran our campaigns and the electorate spoke. The population obviously liked the small business bonus scheme, the continuation of the creation of 100,000 training opportunities&#8212;including 25,000 apprenticeships&#8212;every year and the introduction of better funding methods for buildings and infrastructure, as well as the many other things that the SNP managed to achieve over the past four years and plans to do over the next five.</p><p>I want to touch on a number of issues, the first of which is the small business bonus scheme. I am sure that every member will have spoken to many in the small business community about the importance of that initiative&#8212;after all, that sector is the rock of the Scottish economy and it is vital that it not only survives but progresses. For many small businesses that I have spoken to, the scheme has, over the past few years, been essential in keeping their doors open to ensure that people are working and contributing to society. Understandably, the scheme was not seen as a handout to the small business sector, but neither was it seen as a handout to the wider population. I found that the wider population actually realised the importance of the initiative to Scotland and were happy to maintain it in this parliamentary session.</p><p>Another important issue for the sector, which came up on numerous occasions in my meetings with business representatives, relates to the procurement opportunities that are open to smaller businesses. Many businesses felt that they were too small to compete for larger contracts or that they did not have the expertise or knowledge to be able to spend time bidding for work. As a result, they perhaps thought that they were being left behind with some opportunities. Now and again, I heard comments that priority should be given to local businesses to take up local work opportunities. I understand and sympathise with comments that were made to me, but I also realise that there is EU legislation and that tendering and procurement must be open, transparent and available to all.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have been looking forward to taking part in this debate with my first speech in this new session.

It would be helpful if the minister provided a bit more information about that in his closing speech, if that is possible. I am sure that many members can put forward arguments about the environmental and sustainability benefits of awarding work to smaller local businesses compared with offering work to everyone. I am also sure that every member will know about new builds or refurbs in their constituencies or regions in respect of which outside labour has undertaken most of the work. Could local people have undertaken some of that labour? That approach would have a positive effect on our local communities.</p><p>The third issue that I want to touch on is exporting. I recommend that members across the chamber read the report on the internationalisation of business that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee produced in the previous parliamentary session. One way in which we can fully ensure that the Scottish economy drives forward is through making more things and selling them abroad. We need to bring more money and new money into Scotland.</p><p>I grew up in Inverclyde, and I stay there. I am sure that I will see quite a lot of members there over the coming weeks, and they are certainly very welcome there as political tourists. However, they will have an obligation to help the local economy when they visit. If they want ideas about places to visit or eat in, they should speak to me later.</p><p>Inverclyde is famous for making many things, including ships, engines, computers and sugar. There is still a manufacturing base there and things are still made there, although perhaps not in the same quantity as in the past. Can Inverclyde make more? Absolutely, provided that the conditions are right and people want to buy the products. Can Paisley, Glasgow and Aberdeen make more? Absolutely; Scotland can manufacture more. Given that the conditions for manufacturing in Scotland and the UK are less stringent than those in Germany, Sweden and France, where the cost of living is higher, wages are higher and labour laws are more stringent, we need to establish what we need to do to improve our exporting capabilities in Scotland. I therefore welcome the closer working partnership between the Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and SDI that the cabinet secretary mentioned earlier.</p><p>To conclude, during the election campaign the SNP campaigned on the reindustrialisation of the Scottish economy. I greatly look forward to that. Obviously, the focus of that reindustrialisation is on the green energy sector.

One local member told me that the campaign was very much community oriented and that the whole Inverclyde community rallied round. I was told that there was political and financial support from throughout the United Kingdom, which highlights the effect of the campaign not just on the population of Scotland but on that of the UK as a whole.</p><p>Jim Sillars told me a couple of things about the campaign.

I hope that the URC, Riverside Inverclyde, creates an opportunity for Inverclyde to move forward and for the URC to help to empower the whole community.</p><p>During stage 3 of the budget debate, John Swinney agreed to reinstate some of the money that was due to be removed from the URC budget. The &#163;6 million, in addition to the planned &#163;25 million, will certainly help the URCs; I know that it will help Riverside Inverclyde.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644826", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to take part in the debate and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the SNP&#8217;s excellent record on regeneration activities.

I do not intend to say much about the company as I am sure that my colleague Kenneth Gibson will do so later.

The committee ensured that a wide range of voices and opinions was heard, which was certainly advantageous to the inquiry.</p><p>The Equal Opportunities Committee has produced a piece of work that is helpful in relation to both the wider debate about migration in Scotland and the issue of trafficking.</p><p>In the short time that I have been a member of the committee it has proven to be a committee with very little in the way of party politics, and for that I commend every member. The report is testimony to the committee&#8217;s joined-up approach to establishing the facts behind serious issues for today&#8217;s world.</p><p>I am delighted that we have produced an evidence-based report that scotches the myths about migrants taking all the jobs and costing the taxpayer vast sums of money.</p><p>The report, which was agreed by all parties on the committee, recognises that migrants can and do play an important social and economic role in Scotland. From employment to education and many more areas within Scotland, migrants contribute vastly to our country.</p><p>One example that we did not touch on in the inquiry but which I want to highlight now is the importance of migrants in football. Most Scottish football teams either have had or do have players from outside Scotland. Celtic Football Club, Rangers FC and my own team, Greenock Morton, have all had players from other countries. Morton currently has a player from France and in the past we have had players from Finland. One thing about football is that we do not hear footballers being criticised for coming to this country to play football and nor should they be.</p><p>Being involved in this inquiry opened the eyes of all members to some of the erroneous language used in the media, such as &#8220;bogus asylum seekers&#8221; and &#8220;illegal immigrants&#8221;. The issue highlights the importance of the power of the media and how they can influence public opinion&#8212;that has already been mentioned.</p><p>The evidence that we received in the session with the minister was very direct and to the point, and I am sure that it struck a chord with not only parliamentarians in the chamber, but everyone outside the chamber who works with migrants and asylum seekers on a daily basis.</p><p>As other members have made clear, the evidence session that we held in Glasgow city chambers, in which we spoke to many people from a range of nationalities and backgrounds, was absolutely fascinating. I always feel that taking the Parliament out to people, particularly in the way in which that session was facilitated, ensures that we get to the nub of the matter and extract the issues directly with a minimum of filtering. That can be only a good thing for policy makers and I hope that we can all learn lessons and work to improve the lives of everyone who lives in Scotland.</p><p>The report has 159 pages and 700 paragraphs, and no member who speaks this afternoon has any chance whatsoever of doing its content any justice. Some members have already mentioned trafficking, and I am sure that we will hear more about it later. Clearly, more needs to be done to combat what is a disgusting and hideous practice but, as we will all appreciate, the task is not easy. The underworld is certainly intent on keeping this crime part of its empire but we parliamentarians and, indeed, everyone in the public sector must get to grips with the fact that lives are wrecked as a result of trafficking and must work to get those people back on track.</p><p>Time is short and I must apologise for concluding on a negative point. I am disappointed that the UK Government has not responded to our report until today. Given that the report touches on devolved and reserved issues, it was right that it provided a response, but I suggest that waiting until the day of this debate to do so is not in the spirit of the report and does not reflect the consensual manner in which we approached the topic.</p><p>Nevertheless, I am happy to say that we have produced a body of work that all members can rightly be proud of. This is just the start. The hard work of repairing broken lives and turning around the misconceptions held by many people starts now and we need to do more to deal with trafficking and to bring those responsible to justice.</p><p>I commend the report to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644739", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Migration and Trafficking"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, express my thanks to the clerking team for their hard work and dedication throughout the inquiry.

The population of Inverclyde and Ayrshire will be happy to learn that the SNP Government appreciates URCs and, in particular, the excellent work of Riverside Inverclyde, which will continue. Alf Young, the chairman of Riverside Inverclyde, said in the Greenock Telegraph on 24 January:</p><p>&#8220;I have always been told by the politicians and their officials this was a 10-year mission to take 20-odd years of dereliction and do something about it, and that they would back us&#8221;.</p><p>Today, John Swinney continues that progress and the work of turning around 20-odd years of dereliction in Inverclyde, as Alf Young highlighted.</p><p>The cabinet secretary knows of my genuine interest in safeguarding Riverside Inverclyde. I raised the issue with him in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee last week and met him last Thursday afternoon. In addition to that, I wrote to him and Alex Neil about it and raised it in the committee when Scottish Enterprise officials gave evidence on 19 January.</p><p>The future of Inverclyde&#8217;s economic success depends on our regeneration. Other parties and individuals have made representations on the URCs and Riverside Inverclyde in particular. However, I am content that John Swinney and the SNP Government have listened to the arguments.</p><p>On a different matter, I whole-heartedly welcome the increase in apprenticeship places to 25,000 for next year. That record number will provide new opportunities for our population. Those new modern apprenticeship starts will be welcomed throughout the west of Scotland and Scotland as a whole.</p><p>Other beneficial aspects of the budget include the freezing of the council tax for the fourth year in a row, as already mentioned, and the maintenance&#8212;indeed, the extension&#8212;of the concessionary travel scheme. I know many people who value the travel scheme, which not only helps people to get out and about in their communities but helps the tourism industry in Scotland.</p><p>Another welcome element concerns the health budget. Ensuring that the Barnett consequentials on health go to the NHS is a welcome addition to the budget. Many of my constituents warmly welcome it as they fully value the NHS and the services that it provides.</p><p>During the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8217;s budget scrutiny last year, I asked the panel of witnesses, which included Professor Brian Ashcroft and Alf Young:</p><p>&#8220;What one thing would you recommend be changed in the budget? Obviously, there would be knock-on effects, but if the Government was to change one thing, what should it be?&#8221;</p><p>Professor Ashcroft answered:</p><p>&#8220;Can I get in first? The Government should not ring fence spending on health.&#8221;</p><p>Alf Young&#8217;s response was:</p><p>&#8220;I would choose the same thing.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 24 November 2010; c 4367.]</p><p>There is much to welcome in the budget. I am sure that John Swinney would have preferred to have the additional &#163;500 million, &#163;1.3 billion and even the &#163;30 million from the retail levy. Think how much more John Swinney could deliver for Scotland if he had that money. If he had more, I am sure that it would be invested wisely.</p><p>The &#163;30 million retail levy was contentious in the Parliament. In recent weeks, I spoke to many people in the small business sector. They were disappointed with how the Parliament voted last week, but they realise who is on the side of the small business sector in Scotland.</p><p>John Swinney has proposed this Scottish budget to the Parliament in financially straitened times. However, I am sure that the Parliament can rise to the occasion and not only agree to the budget unanimously this evening but ensure that the Scottish people appreciate that it is a budget for Scotland in financially challenging times. I am sure that they will appreciate the hard work and effort that John Swinney has put into the budget.

I also met local west of Scotland coastguard staff this week to discuss the proposals further. I was impressed by their stance and the manner in which they have conducted themselves throughout the campaign. They have been extremely careful not to play one location off against another, as they know that that will only be divisive&#8212;as Charlie Gordon said, they know that the old adage of divide and conquer will only play into the hands of those who want to change the service.</p><p>The staff are not against change itself. They realise that the only constant in life is change, and they know that areas of the service can be improved. As a Greenock resident, with the River Clyde playing a major role in the local economy, I am fully aware of how important the local coastguard service is. The Clyde station is the fifth largest in the UK in terms of the number of incidents that it dealt with last year, and it has also dealt with the highest number of incidents in Scotland. Despite that, the staff realise that how they deliver the service needs to change.</p><p>One point that a few colleagues have mentioned this evening is safety. Safety is paramount. That point was raised last night at the cross-party group on recreational boating and marine tourism. The bottom line&#8212;which is what the bean counters understand&#8212;is what price a life has. Recreational boating and sailing are increasing, particularly on the west coast. Commercial traffic is increasing, whether from the cruise liner sector or for cargo. That is not to mention the nuclear submarines and missiles on the west coast, although that is a point for another day. Given the increase in traffic on the west coast, we must consider what the proposals will deliver, not just for the west coast but for the whole of Scotland.</p><p>Whatever solution emerges from the consultation, safety must not be compromised. Alasdair Allan spoke about the understanding of local knowledge, which is vital and is one reason why I am disappointed by the plan to cut to two the number of full-time maritime operation centres in the UK. If a telecoms issue arose, how robust would the two-centre approach be? Not very, I imagine. How would someone in the Solent understand the colloquial terms that many communities in Scotland use? We have heard about some of that.</p><p>I will raise an interesting point that was made last night and which has been touched on in the debate. What modelling did the UK Government undertake in preparing the proposals? What modelling has been undertaken for potential disasters, such as another Braer?

I found it extremely surprising that very few people took up those opportunities. I would have thought that it would have been clear that living abroad is a life-changing experience.</p><p>The benefits of education and foreign language learning were always clear to me, but they were solidified during our inquiry. Scotland&#8217;s history is one of trading and Scots travelling the world. My experience at university indicated that we had lost some of that zest for trading and travelling.</p><p>I was delighted that, at the outset of the inquiry, Dr Alison Hiley of Confluence Scotland highlighted the importance of language learning and translation services. Translation services are not cheap, and business translation activities go far beyond just being able to speak a language. Scotland faces a huge challenge in grabbing that bull by the horns and ensuring that foreign language education is fundamental in our education system. It is also vital that the public sector organisations that sell Scotland work towards ensuring that language skills are fundamental rather than just an add-on.</p><p>Internationalising the nation through foreign languages will not happen overnight or in a four-year parliamentary session. The key point is that public perception needs to change. If we look at smaller European countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, to name just a few, they realise that foreign languages are not just educationally beneficial, but are fundamental in business activities and selling their countries.</p><p>There was a report on &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; last night on the teaching of Mandarin in an elementary school in Carolina. Jeremy Purvis mentioned China. The fact that pupils in such schools are learning Mandarin from the age of five is the result of a realisation that the world is changing and that being able to speak other languages, particularly those of Brazil, Russia, India and China&#8212;the BRIC countries&#8212;will become even more vital.</p><p>My second point is about the SDI representatives who work for Scotland out in the field. It is welcome that when the report was written, Scotland had increased the number of such representatives from 51 in 2005 to 80.5. Having more people working to promote Scotland through SDI should provide greater rewards to our economy, but the extent to which SDI staff should have flexibility was highlighted in the report. Should they work in fixed locations or should they cover more countries? That issue has already been mentioned.</p><p>Given that we will have limited and, indeed, shrinking resources in coming years, it will always be a case of prioritising those resources. We must ensure that we have effective cover in the target nations while ensuring that we do not spread ourselves too thinly or, conversely, fail to target enough countries.</p><p>Other countries and regions have their own models, which we can look at and learn from. As one of the committee members who met representatives and, indeed, the President of Catalonia, I found it interesting to hear about what they perceived was the best way to promote Catalonia internationally. Closer to home, the Welsh Assembly Government brought its model in house to a department instead of having arm&#8217;s-length bodies undertaking the work. We need to find a Scottish solution rather than just replicate arrangements elsewhere. Our report indicates support for the current set-up of SDI, but we must not rest on our laurels.</p><p>We can always strive for something better, although I am sure that the mess that is the global economy will provide some serious challenges for SDI, as will things that are outwith SDI&#8217;s control, such as the rising cost of raw materials leading to increased costs for exporting products that are made in Scotland. There are also the current issues of VAT increases, and increasing fuel costs leading to higher distribution costs and higher costs for the consumer, as well as potentially higher interest rates.</p><p>It is clear that SDI is serving Scotland well but it has, and will have in the future, serious challenges to face. I look forward to the rest of the debate and the minister&#8217;s summing up. I hope that we can give unanimous support to the greater internationalisation of Scotland. Our economy needs to grow and we already have major iconic brands and industries. We are in a good position to weather the current economic storm but we must remain focused on the job.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642741", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Report on the public sector&#8217;s support for exporters, international trade and the attraction of inward investment&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Maybe later.

I welcome the tone of the debate so far. In a few moments, I will focus on the fossil fuel levy, which the minister and my colleague Rob Gibson have touched on already.</p><p>First, it is important to state that the related Ofgem review of the transmission charging regime, which is already under way, presents a wonderful opportunity to fully open up and harness the renewables potential that Scotland possesses. I am sure that all members, irrespective of party affiliation, want Scotland to enhance its credentials as a leading light&#8212;no pun intended&#8212;in renewables technology. I just hope that we do not miss the boat, certainly in the sense of financial benefit, as we have done since the 1970s, when oil and gas were found in the North Sea. I hope that we can work together in the Parliament to ensure that history does not repeat itself.</p><p>The issue of the fossil fuel levy lies within the wider energy debate. It has been spoken about today and many other times in the chamber and in the Parliament's committees. Yesterday the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee had the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Chris Huhne MP, answering questions on UK energy policy. For my part, I thought that it was an extremely useful and worthwhile session, and it was a shame that it lasted for only an hour or so&#8212;a point that I made to the convener at the end of the meeting, as I thought that we could have discussed energy policy with the secretary of state for three hours or even longer. As members would expect, Mr Huhne promoted the UK Government's energy policy proposals extremely well, but he was open to other suggestions, which I thought was very useful.</p><p>One issue that I am sure the secretary of state did not expect to be brought up in our discussion on energy policy is the thorny issue of bankers' bonuses, but I raised it with him yesterday. I appreciated Mr Huhne's honesty in his response, but I am left wondering about the green investment bank and the fossil fuel levy, which will be used to capitalise it. As I said yesterday, there is widespread political support for a green investment bank and it would be ideal for it to be established here in Scotland, as there is the financial expertise here&#8212;as well as Scotland's position in renewables. If the institution is to be established as a normal bank, as is the wish of Mr Huhne, issues of bail-outs and bankers' bonuses must be addressed at the very outset. If they are ignored, public support for such an institution will not be guaranteed. I would go as far as to say that in these times of austerity the public will never support the creation of any institution that might pay out obscene bonuses to even more bankers.<place-holder colnum=\"32231\"/></p><p>The direct link to this debate lies in the capitalisation of such an institution, with &#163;250 million from the fossil fuel levy. Currently, Scotland's fossil fuel levy stands at more than &#163;190 million, which, as we all know, can be taken at the expense of the Scottish block grant. However, the proposal from the UK Government is to forgo that money so as to be guaranteed &#163;250 million from the GIB for 2013-14. If the fossil fuel levy were to be invested now, that could open up even more possibilities in my region. One prime example is that of Inverclyde, which narrowly missed out against more developed locations on resources from the national renewables infrastructure fund. I was disappointed that it missed out&#8212;but it was against other areas that were more developed.</p><p>Who can say that if some of the fossil fuel levy were to come to Scotland now and find its way to Inverclyde, the area could not be helped to become the renewables hub that it has the potential to be? We have the core facilities and, with a bit of investment in the waterfront, Inverclyde could be on the cusp of a renewables boom.</p><p>After yesterday, how can any politician sell to the people of Inverclyde and Scotland the idea that we should wait for a few years for the green investment bank to be established with capitalisation of &#163;1 billion and guaranteed investment for Scotland of &#163;250 million, when the bankers might well be paid obscene bonuses and the bank might have to go back to the taxpayer for a bail-out if it fails?</p><p>I stress that I support the concept of a green investment bank, but we should not build it up to be a panacea. It might not be the answer to all our prayers. It goes without saying that the UK Government needs to work closely with the Scottish Government on electricity market reform and many other issues. The last thing that Scotland or any current investor in Scotland wants is the unintended consequence of lost investment and employment opportunities.</p><p>Scotland can grasp the renewables opportunity and we are on our way. Electricity market reform by the UK Government, however well intentioned it is, must not hamper our growth and opportunities. The debate has been interesting and consensual&#8212;up to now; some members might disagree with what I just said. I hope that the Parliament will speak with a strong voice today.

Like other cross-party groups in the Parliament, it provides a valuable interface between the Parliament and members of the public, not to mention organisations such as RNIB Scotland and Guide Dogs. Robert Brown also mentioned Haggeye&#8212;RNIB Scotland's youth group&#8212;which is awe inspiring in what it achieves. That interface can only be a good thing in helping MSPs to understand the issues that affect the country.</p><p>I do not intend to go over all the ground that has been laid out by Robert Brown, but I will touch on a couple of issues. Before I do so, it is important to stress the major strides that have been taken by the current Government and the previous Executive in eye care. The introduction of free eye tests has been a policy of which the Parliament and Scotland can be proud. It has followed the prevention model of intervention, which should be used more widely across the public sector. Prevention is always better than cure and tends to be cheaper in the long run. In these straitened times for the public sector, Scotland needs to work more on the prevention model.</p><p>With neovascular age-related macular degeneration&#8212;AMD&#8212;accounting for more than half of all registered blindness in Scotland, there is obviously a problem to be dealt with. Wet AMD, which is the more aggressive of the two forms, <place-holder colnum=\"31893\"/> affects only 10 per cent of patients, but can be treated early. Saving the vision of one person is a gift that society can offer, but the value of saving the eyesight of potentially many more is incalculable. The issue highlights the importance of the NHS in Scotland as well as the importance that Scottish society places on dealing with sight loss.</p><p>In 2009, there were 1,225 people throughout Scotland with wet AMD who required treatment. Although tremendous progress has been made in the NHS, there remain a number of challenges that need to be addressed. In any walk of life, nothing is perfect and there can always be improvements. Why should eye care be any different, particularly as such a low base was in existence until the free eye test was introduced? I cannot touch on all the challenges, but a couple of them are the regional inequalities in treatment and criteria, which Robert Brown touched on, and the need for improved services for follow-up patients&#8212;for example, patient counselling is deemed to be below the adequate standard.</p><p>Through the cross-party group and, indeed, constituents, I have heard examples from life of how people were told that they were going to lose their sight. Obviously, their first reaction was utter shock, but one issue that has come up time and again is the lack of counselling or signposting to counsellors. There is no doubt that people who receive such devastating news require support&#8212;exactly the same applies to people who are told that they have cancer&#8212;and counselling is absolutely vital.</p><p>I hope that Parliament will continue its good record on such matters. We should not beat ourselves up about not having the right solution at the moment; the truth is that we are nowhere near the summit in dealing with sight loss, including wet AMD, and with every day that passes our constituents are presented with life-changing experiences, which is bound only to increase with an ever-ageing population.</p><p>I welcome the debate and the fact that the issue has been raised in Parliament.

Unquestionably, citizens in this country should be able to go about their daily lives and work in the knowledge that the law will protect them. The bill highlights the fact that existing legislation covers every citizen, but there is clearly an issue that affects public-facing workers.</p><p>We had to ask ourselves in the committee, first, whether the bill would provide further protection and effective action to reduce verbal and physical attacks on public-facing workers; and, secondly, who qualifies as a public-facing worker. On the first point, if the bill is enacted as drafted, nothing new will be introduced and no extra protection will be created. Part 2 of the bill, which deals with penalties, suggests imprisonment of up to 12 months, or a fine, or both. That currently exists in legislation. The penalty of a sentence of up to 12 months is exactly the same as in the 2005 act, as we have heard, and in the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007. We therefore had to ask ourselves whether the bill would bring something new to the statute book.</p><p>On the second point, I was not convinced by some of the arguments that were made about who qualifies as a public-facing worker. It is clear that shop workers, bar and restaurant workers and many others, as highlighted by Hugh Henry in his speech earlier, would qualify. However, I had concerns that people who work in factories on the shop floor would not be covered, while the management would at times be covered if they were out representing the business. I found it difficult to understand how people who work in shipyards and call centres would not be covered, while the management would be covered when they were out representing those companies.</p><p>Paragraphs 65 to 71 of the report highlight the difficulty in defining who should be covered under the bill. The bill, like any other bill that comes before Parliament, would be subject to amendments, which was highlighted in the committee's evidence taking. However, if the bill was greatly extended to cover the examples that I have highlighted and other categories of worker throughout the country, it would lose the focus on what it is attempting to do.</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree that more can always be done to protect all workers in Scotland. I do not think that the bill is the answer at this time, but I encourage the Scottish Government and the Parliament to work to address that important issue.

I am afraid that some of what has been said is political opportunism, but some of the comments have been valid and legitimate.</p><p>One thing is certain: last week's weather can only be described as appalling. However, it needs to be put in context. Last winter was the worst that I could remember, but this year the snow has arrived that much earlier. For many years, we have mainly had wet winters with a few days of snow. From my recollection, the few days of snow provided some challenges, but they could be overcome quite easily.</p><p>I grew up in Port Glasgow. For any member who does not know the topography of Port Glasgow or Inverclyde, I say that it can be challenging to walk up the hill from the town centre even when the weather is fair. I know that the Presiding Officer knows the conditions of Port Glasgow very well, and she will be aware that walking up the hill in the snow and ice provides an even greater challenge. I no longer stay in that part of Inverclyde, but I was speaking to some friends who still stay up at the top of the hill and they were shocked by the conditions and the poor response of the local authority. However, they understood that the snow was extremely severe.</p><p>Growing up in Port Glasgow, we could always tell the severity of the weather by how much snow lay down in the town centre. If there was a lot of snow there, we could guarantee that it would be <place-holder colnum=\"31672\"/> five times worse at the top of the hill. Unfortunately, last week's weather in Port Glasgow and across the central belt proved to be that bad. The higher ground suffered much more than the lower ground, but the lower ground was caught out by the severe weather conditions as well.</p><p>I will give an example of the conditions in Inverclyde last week. Last Monday, a member of my staff travelled down from Glasgow to accompany me to the Greenock sorting office to learn about the activities of the Royal Mail staff in the run-up to Christmas. We arrived at 5 minutes past 8. It was raining outside and practically all the snow and ice from the previous few days had gone. When I left the house, it was snowing but, as I travelled down the hill to the sorting office, the snow turned to rain. When we came out of the sorting office at 20 past 9, there was approximately 1in of snow on the ground. While we were inside speaking to the staff and management, a few postmen came in with their heavy coats on and explained the conditions to one of the managers. Their coats had a fair amount of snow on them, which proved to me that they were telling the truth.</p><p>I do not know which weather forecast Inverclyde Council was looking at, but it was clearly caught out by the conditions just as authorities across the central belt were. I could have played party politics and called for the resignation of the relevant councillor in charge of the roads, but I did not want to stoop to those depths. Could they have been better prepared? The answer is clearly yes, but to have councillors resign from councils throughout Scotland would not provide a correct solution.</p><p>It is clear that there were failings in many parts of the country last week, and the former transport minister said that lessons had to be learned.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145235", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will support the amendment in the name of John Swinney this afternoon.

I commend him for his efforts and determination thus far.</p><p>Members will be aware of my interest in damages issues and my involvement as a member of the Justice Committee when it examined the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill earlier in the session. Although I am not a member of the committee any more, I signed the proposal for Bill Butler's bill after meeting him some months ago, and I have been keeping an eye on the bill's progress through the committee. I am keen to ensure that members of the public can have confidence in the Parliament and its course of action in dealing with damages issues. In my opinion, the Parliament has dealt with the issues fairly and justly, and thankfully previous bills have succeeded. I am, of course, referring particularly to the asbestos-related legislation in the current and previous sessions.</p><p>The committee has recommended that the bill should proceed to stage 2, but members have spoken about a few issues that need to be resolved. I do not intend to go over old ground, but I will touch on one issue that I found of interest in the committee's report. With every paragraph, I was becoming more convinced that the 25 per cent compensation payment was the way forward, but then I got to the arguments against, and I thought that they were also logical and correct. I can therefore understand why the committee has recommended that Bill Butler and the Scottish Government should meet and attempt to resolve that vital issue. I was happy to hear Bill Butler's comments on the matter earlier in the debate.</p><p>For me, this important aspect of the bill comes down to a couple of key points. The first is that we need to ensure that the claimant obtains their damages with as little delay as possible while also ensuring that they obtain a fair and equitable result. Secondly, we need to ensure that the fair and equitable damages award is just that for those who have to pay out. People might ask&#8212;I do not <place-holder colnum=\"31561\"/> know whether the issue was raised in the private sessions&#8212;whether it would be such a bad thing if the surviving relative or family was overcompensated by a small margin. After all, they have lost a loved one, and no amount of money will ever replace them, especially when they have been taken tragically through a wrongful death, but a slight overcompensation might not be a bad thing.</p><p>There are various other issues in the bill that I would like to discuss, but time constraints prevent me from doing so.</p><p>I fully appreciate that the bill, although short in page numbers, is not short in terms of the issues that it highlights and the questions that it raises for the committee, the Government, the Parliament and wider Scotland.</p><p>I do not think that I am speaking out of turn when I say that every party in the Parliament wants to ensure that damages legislation is robust in order to protect our citizens. It could be argued that all three Scottish Law Commission reports on damages should be rolled up into one larger bill, and who knows what will happen post the election in May? However, the here and now dictates that the bill is trying to provide some solutions. It is clear that there are issues that require to be addressed, and I am sure that Bill Butler will have been working on them in anticipation that the bill will move on to stage 2. I will vote for the bill to proceed but, for the good of the bill and what it aims to do, it needs to address the many points and questions that the committee has raised.

We have also had Mr McNulty speaking about Wile E Coyote and blackmail and Robert Brown speaking about</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the slaughter of SNP sacred cows\".</p><p>Earlier in his speech, Robert Brown said that the people of Scotland would appreciate the finance minister and the First Minister telling the people how things are. As we face cuts of 6.3 per cent, 1 per cent, 2.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent, that is how things will be in the coming years. I am sure that Mr Brown knows that because he will have looked at the CSR. Every one of us in the chamber is aware of the state of the UK public finances and we are all aware of the CSR that was produced recently by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition Government in London. We are also aware of the effects that the CSR is having on the Scottish budget&#8212;a cut of &#163;1.3 billion for next year, which equates to a 6.3 per cent cut. The challenge for the Scottish Government and the Parliament is how we deal with that.</p><p>I will touch on other budget issues in a moment, but first I want to discuss one particular area. The Labour motion talks about the uncertainty that the presentation of a one-year budget will create. That would be a legitimate argument if it were the first time that such a budget has been undertaken but, as we know, the Parliament only ever produces a one-year budget. Further years are indicative and subject to change.

Many small business owners to whom I have spoken in recent years have benefited from the introduction of the small business bonus scheme. They were delighted that the SNP introduced the scheme, particularly given the timing. It has helped them through the recession and, in some instances, has helped their businesses to survive. Furthermore, even the Liberal Democrats should welcome the extension of the small business bonus scheme this year, which involves abolishing business rates for some businesses, halving them for others and reducing them by a quarter for others.</p><p>However, in this Parliament, the Lib Dems have not been in the business of working together&#8212;well, not with the SNP Government, anyway. They are good at coalitions, right enough, either with Labour up here or with the Tories down in Westminster. Mr Kerr spoke earlier about alliances in the Parliament, but he obviously forgot about the five Labour-Conservative local authority alliances in Scotland, including two in the West of Scotland region, in Inverclyde Council and East Dunbartonshire Council.</p><p>The motion highlights the Lib Dems' concerns about the business rates revaluation. In a perfect world, everyone would be a winner, but we do not live in a perfect world. The Lib Dems and their Tory masters in London proved that last week by introducing savage cuts to Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. The Con-Dem cuts of last week will force just under half a million public sector workers on to the dole, with the private sector expected to pick up the pieces. The small business sector is the backbone of the Scottish economy, but how many small businesses here will be able to take on additional staff?</p><p>I do not know the answer to that, but I know that if the small business bonus scheme and the extension had not happened and if the rates revaluation did not benefit the small business sector, there would be fewer small businesses in Scotland. As a consequence, fewer small businesses would have the opportunity to take people on to help with the recovery from the wreckage of the tougher and deeper cuts of Mr <place-holder colnum=\"29705\"/> Purvis's party and his Tory colleagues in Westminster.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21041291", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Support for Business"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate John and Elizabeth on the birth of Matthew.

I could say something about all the proposed bills, but I will not do that as much has already been said about some of them. Instead, I will focus on a couple. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from Opposition members, but there are a couple of points that it is important to highlight. First, I wanted to remind Mike Rumbles, who is unfortunately not in the chamber at the moment, that the SNP has already delivered 77 of its 90 manifesto commitments. Secondly, with the SNP Government being a minority Administration, it is a testament to the Government that it has worked together with COSLA, the STUC, the police and the National Union of Students. That can be compared with the approach that was taken in the past&#8212;an approach of working in silos. We discussed that point this morning at the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. Such work has been a positive step by the SNP Government.</p><p>One of the proposed bills that I want to touch on is the reservoir safety bill. Members will be aware that one of the campaigns that I have undertaken during the past three and a half years concerns flooding in Inverclyde. I stay in Inverclyde. I grew up in Port Glasgow and I now stay in Greenock. Over the years, Inverclyde has been blighted by flooding year after year. I am not talking just about the past three years or 10 years. The problem has gone on for decades, but nothing was done about it until 2008, when the SNP Government introduced the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill. When I was growing up, the Blackstone roundabout in Port Glasgow was a big swimming pool when the autumn came, and further down the road at Ladyburn on the A8 there is still a bit of a swimming pool when the weather is bad. Part of the problem is the reservoirs at the top of Inverclyde, so I warmly and whole-heartedly welcome the proposed bill and the fact that the Government wants to deal with the problem.<place-holder colnum=\"28295\"/></p><p>I also welcome the announcement today that the Scottish Government is to provide &#163;63,000 of funding to the Scottish flood forum. Over the past three and half years, the Scottish Government has established a record of trying to tackle flooding problems. Things will not change overnight and the problems will not be fully fixed overnight, but the Government has started to do the work and the bill will certainly continue that.</p><p>I have dealt with many constituents as a result of flooding in Inverclyde, including constituents who worked for Scottish Water in whatever form, who raised many problems with reservoirs and their effect on the Inverclyde community over the years. I look forward to considering the bill.</p><p>A bill that marries well with the reservoir safety bill is the water bill. It is logical to assume that both bills will result in renewable energy benefits for our communities and local economies. The water bill will also go some way to try to meet our climate change targets.</p><p>I turn to the health (certification of death) bill. I am the co-convener of the cross-party group on funerals and bereavement, hence my touching on the bill. I welcome Jackie Baillie's comments on the bill. Des McNulty is not in the chamber to hear this, but I was slightly disappointed in his comments. I look forward to the bill coming on to the agenda of the cross-party group over the coming months. It is an important bill. We have only to consider its application to every member in the chamber and everyone in the public gallery. Every person has to die at some point.

If the units had closed, more staff would have been made redundant under Labour.</p><p>Let us consider maternity units, particularly in the West of Scotland. The removal of consultant-led services at the IRH and the Vale of Leven hospital and the centralisation of services at RAH in Paisley during the previous session of Parliament had an effect on delivery of care. Pregnant women might well have been sceptical about the services that were available locally while they were being directed to go elsewhere, which left a question about the viability of services. I am thankful that Nicola Sturgeon agreed to instigate an independent scrutiny panel to consider the future of community midwife units. Recently, there was a record number of deliveries in the CMU at <place-holder colnum=\"26915\"/> the IRH, which proves that keeping the unit at the IRH was the correct decision.</p><p>Labour seems to have forgotten about the services that were under threat when it was in power. It might also have escaped Labour members' memories that Labour attacked the programme to make and then to reinvest 2 per cent efficiency savings. The former Labour leader in the Scottish Parliament, Wendy Alexander, said that 2 per cent was not an ambitious enough target and that the target should be 3 per cent.</p><p>During the Labour campaign in 2007, Jack McConnell said that education would get investment but other budgets would need to \"cut their cloth\". How can Labour seriously claim that the NHS in Scotland would have been in a better position under Labour? Labour's position on the NHS is somewhat opportunistic and typifies the negativity of which much of Labour politics reeks.</p><p>No element of the public service is perfect&#8212;there is always room for improvement and greater efficiency. The taxpayer wants to know that they will get the services that they require and that service delivery will improve.</p><p>There are three central points about the SNP Government's delivery of health services. First, we have 10,000 more NHS staff members than we inherited from the Labour-Lib Dem Administration. Secondly, funding for the NHS in Scotland is at record levels and, thirdly, the cabinet secretary has given a commitment that there will be no compulsory redundancies.</p><p>Service redesign is happening across a range of public services, and more joined-up working is taking place, instead of the silo approach of the past.

Canada proposed the concept on 8 June 1992 at the earth summit in Rio de Janeiro and the day was celebrated unofficially every year until it was internationally recognised in 2009, when the United Nations declared officially that 8 June every year was to be recognised as world oceans day.</p><p>Oceans provide most of the oxygen that we breathe and much of the food that we eat and help to create many of the medicines that we use to stay healthy. Oceans also provide us with incredible opportunities for recreational activities such as boating, diving and fishing. As we know, waters cover two thirds of the planet's surface.</p><p>It is unfortunate that humans sometimes take the oceans and the seas for granted. As members from one of the most progressive countries in the world, it is our responsibility to recognise the ecological impact that we have on our oceans and to realise the vital role that they play in our lives. I am encouraged by Scotland's awareness of the situation and I congratulate the Scottish Government on, and commend every member of the Parliament for, the passage of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. I also congratulate the members of the UK Parliament in Westminster on passing their Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. Those acts are major steps towards helping us to protect the coastal waters of the UK and <place-holder colnum=\"26858\"/> Scotland. The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 has provided a framework to manage Scotland's seas and enforce the laws that are associated with the sustainable development of our waters.</p><p>World oceans day encourages groups throughout the world to engage in events to celebrate the world's oceans and help to increase awareness of the role that our oceans play in everyday life. This year, events that are being held in Scotland to celebrate the day and increase awareness of it include those by the Macduff Marine Aquarium and the Solway Firth Partnership. I hope that an even bigger effort will be made next year to support world oceans day all over the country.</p><p>World oceans day encourages sustainable and enjoyable practices for the environment and the oceans in particular. As the Presiding Officer might recall, I initiated in November 2008 the first members' business debate&#8212;and the first debate in the chamber&#8212;on the potential economic impact of recreational boating and marine tourism on the Scottish economy. That growing sector of our economy depends almost exclusively on the wellbeing of the world's oceans and people taking care of them, so Scotland must view world oceans day seriously. It would be prudent for Scotland to support the day zealously, as it strives to protect a vital element of the Scottish economy.</p><p>Sailing and responsible recreational boating are some of the most environmentally friendly activities that one can enjoy. A sailboat does not use much fuel and certainly provides an entertaining way to enjoy our waters.</p><p>Another wonderful activity to enjoy in our oceans is diving and snorkelling. Five years ago, on a trip to Australia, I went snorkelling off the coast near Cairns. The ocean there was stunning. Members should believe me when I say, after witnessing its beauty in person, that there is no high-definition television on the planet that can do the great barrier reef justice.</p><p>World oceans day promotes awareness of what our oceans do for us and encourages us to show them respect. We need to call into question the practices that we as a people undertake, and how we react to man-made disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that is currently wreaking havoc in the Caribbean, releasing a reported 1,600 to 13,600 tonnes of oil per day.</p><p>It is not the first time that we have inadvertently done serious damage to our planet's oceans and ocean fauna in accidental oil incidents. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez tanker ran into a reef and spilled an estimated 35,000 tonnes of oil into the waters around Alaska. Although that spill was well down the list of the largest spills, its remote location made it extremely difficult to clean up and it <place-holder colnum=\"26859\"/> adversely affected all manner of wildlife, resulting in the deaths of thousands of sea creatures in the vicinity.</p><p>In a significantly larger incident off the coast of Scotland, the MV Braer ran aground off the coast of the Shetland Islands in 1993, leaking 85,000 tonnes of oil into local waters. Quick action by volunteers in the Shetlands to walk the beaches and collect oiled animals, in combination with extremely stormy weather in the Shetlands at the time, helped to minimise the spill's impacts. The Braer was also carrying Norwegian Gullfaks crude oil, which is lighter and more biodegradable than typical North Sea oil. Those factors luckily prevented an even bigger disaster from occurring. Given the circumstances, Scotland can consider itself lucky that the ecological impacts were not worse than they were.</p><p>The Braer spill is dwarfed by the gargantuan Ixtoc 1 oil spill in 1979 and 1980, which released nearly 500,000 tonnes of oil into the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico and took nearly a year to clean up. It is unfortunate that this year's world oceans day will be celebrated during the largest oil incident in the past 20 years, and one of the most devastating disasters for the ocean and neighbouring ecosystems in recorded history. Millions of people have had their lives affected by the spill, and billions of organisms have been either killed or chased from their native habitat due to its magnitude. As the oil seeps inland into the marshes of the southern United States, it throws off the balance of that delicate ecosystem, which may never be the same.</p><p>Such man-made disasters should highlight the importance of world oceans day. Hopefully, they will bring concern for the oceans to the forefront of our attention. We as a people need to be much more responsible in the way in which we interact with our surroundings. Oceans are a most precious resource, naturally beautiful and full of bounty. It is imperative that we treat them with the respect that they deserve.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20816822", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World Oceans Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members who have stayed behind for the debate and the members who signed my motion.

He explained to me his business banking experiences and how they have changed. The saddest point is that although he has banked with a particular institution for some 20 years, had a great working relationship with it and never had to go to it for any additional services, his charges&#8212;even for the basic services that he requires&#8212;have risen out of all proportion and decision making appears to have been removed from the high street branch to some faceless superior at headquarters. The personal touch appears to have been lost, and that is impacting on the livelihoods of some of our small business owners.</p><p>The second issue that I will touch on, which follows on from the first and from the massive rise in charges, is high street competition. A person does not need to be a derivatives expert to realise the folly of past business practices. As banks bought up competitors over the years, it was only a matter of time before the shortage of high street competition would come back to bite us. We live in a market economy in which competition is vital to ensuring that the customer gets the best deal. How can the customer and Scotland get the best deal when more than 70 per cent of banking goes through two institutions: RBS and Lloyds Banking Group? For those of us in the chamber who follow football, it is the same as the old firm winning everything year in, year out, with the odd exception when someone else gets a chance, such as Dundee United winning the Scottish cup this year.</p><p>As Bill Shankly once said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.\"</p><p>Banking is far more important than football. A failing banking system can mean the life or death <place-holder colnum=\"26824\"/> of a business and therefore of individuals'&#8212;our constituents'&#8212;employment.</p><p>Our report highlighted the lack of competition as a major issue that will need to be addressed. However, regulatory functions for the sector lie in London, not here. I welcome the FSA's response to the report, which has been mentioned. In it, it highlights the fact that it will increase the size of its Edinburgh office to supervise the large retail firms that are headquartered in Scotland, with a view to expansion in the future.</p><p>The final point that I want to highlight centres on bonuses. Earlier, I made a rather flippant remark about banking executives' bonuses. In most walks of life, there is a culture of giving bonuses for excellent work that is over and above what is expected of people. However, I find it pretty disgusting that, when the banking crisis was in full sway, some high-ranking executives were being awarded ludicrous sums of money through bonuses, while those on the shop floor, primarily those who worked in high street banks, were wondering whether they would still have a job.</p><p>Worse still is the uncertainty over the divestment strategy, as instructed by the European Union, and how it will affect individuals including, once again, our constituents. I agree whole-heartedly that our constituents should be paid a fair salary but, for someone working in the high street or a call centre, a bonus might mean the difference between having a special treat or not. It might mean a deposit for a new car, or it might go towards assisting their offspring with a deposit to buy their first home, or even a deposit for rented accommodation if their child is moving out of the family home to study or to work. Therefore, I found the union Unite's arguments on bonuses bizarre to say the least when it campaigned to scrap them. That appeared to me to be inconsistent with its approach to the British Airways strike, which is not yet resolved.</p><p>As I said, six minutes was never going to be enough time, but I have touched on a few issues that are important for the future of banking in Scotland and which will have a knock-on effect throughout the UK.

There is also the small matter of having fun, through fantastic experiences and building up camaraderie, which helps younger people to develop.</p><p>I was never a member of the cadet movement, although I was in the Boys Brigade. I am sure that cadets' experiences are sometimes more exotic than the experiences of members of other organisations. When I was researching the matter for today's debate, I read that there is an opportunity for cadets to go to Lesotho.</p><p>In my previous job, when I worked for an MSP, we had a great deal of contact with the west lowland battalion A company detachment at Port Glasgow. The young people were a credit to themselves, their families and the company. They had won the award for best detachment for about four years in a row and the officers were rightly proud of them. They were invited to the Parliament <place-holder colnum=\"24931\"/> and they thoroughly enjoyed their day out. I was struck by their discipline. Every young person was impeccably behaved and respectful towards the officers and the Parliament.</p><p>I had a similar experience earlier this afternoon, when I had the pleasure of meeting cadets from Mid Scotland and Fife, which is not my region. Once again, I was taken by the cadets' manners and discipline. One cadet, who has been a member for four years, started as a bass drummer in the pipe band and is now the drum major. His experience and leadership role will stand him in good stead in future. I am a piper myself, so I know only too well the demands that are placed on bass drummers and drum majors. I have every respect for what that young man is doing. The remarkable thing about him is his maturity. He is still only 16 years old, but his maturity is well beyond his 16 years.</p><p>I am also very jealous of him. We chatted about some events that he has played at, and he told me about his experience of playing at the Edinburgh Military Tattoo at Edinburgh castle. My experience as a civilian piper in a Territorial Army band did not stretch to playing at the castle. I could not afford the four weeks off to rehearse and play all the time. Unfortunately, the way the tattoo is organised, people have to be there for the full four weeks; they cannot just do a week here and there. So I am extremely jealous that he, as a 16-year-old, has achieved something that I have not been able to achieve in my 37 years. That young man and others will have similar wonderful experiences with the armed forces cadet movement.</p><p>I wonder how many people in the past 150 years have gone through the cadets and on to great things. I also wonder how many have gone through the cadets and, due to receiving a little bit of discipline, have managed to keep themselves on the straight and narrow and thus have not had an impact on other elements of the public sector.</p><p>All in all, I whole-heartedly welcome the 150 years of the armed forces cadet movement, and I sincerely wish it every success in future.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20720641", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Forces Cadet Movement"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Elizabeth Smith on securing the debate and I welcome the Combined Cadet Force representatives to the public gallery.

I am pleased that the SNP government has brought tourism into the finance and sustainable growth portfolio, which reflects the importance of tourism to the Scottish economy.</p><p>We all know the main contributors to Scotland's vast tourism industry: some of the usual suspects, such as golf, have been mentioned this afternoon. Others include whisky, tartan and&#8212;my own personal favourite&#8212;bagpiping. There are four months of piping competitions every year from May to the end of August. Some competitions bring together 50 bands while others feature as <place-holder colnum=\"24634\"/> many as 160 to 200 bands, and not all of those bands come from Scotland&#8212;many travel here from across the world. However, I would like to concentrate on an often unrecognised contributor to the Scottish tourism economy: recreational boating and marine tourism.</p><p>I have been delighted with the response to the establishment of the cross-party group on recreational boating and marine tourism, which I chair. I am only too happy to give the industry the recognition that it deserves. Recreational boating has been estimated to boost the Scottish economy by &#163;250 million a year, and just before Christmas the Scottish Government-sponsored report on sea angling estimated that it brings around &#163;141 million into the nation's economy and sustains more than 3,100 jobs. However, when we consider that recreational boating and marine tourism covers a host of participants, including surfers, kayakers, canoeists, divers and many more, we can start to appreciate the substantial benefits to the Scottish economy that the use of our marine resource brings. Using that resource in sporting and recreational activities provides a massive boost to our tourism sector.</p><p>Last week, the cross-party group set out its immediate agenda to establish, as best we can, the current economic impact of marine tourism, broken down by sector, across the country. If we can gain an understanding of the current position, the cross-party group&#8212;as well as the country&#8212;will be in a better place to make suggestions to help make things even more successful as we work towards the target of a 50 per cent increase in tourism by 2015.</p><p>This morning, in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, we heard about the benefits that whisky brings to the Scottish economy. Many have greatly underestimated the success of whisky tourism: more than 1.23 million people toured a distillery in 2008, which brought in more than &#163;25 million for local economies and was tremendously important for rural economies. Furthermore, 23 per cent of Scotland's five-star visitor facilities are distilleries, which assists in promoting the image of Scotland and the image of whisky as a quality product.</p><p>The most important thing that I have learned from the cross-party group is that the marine tourism sector in Scotland is vastly underrecognised. We in the Parliament must assist the marine tourism industry in promoting Scotland internally and internationally as a marine destination. The knock-on effects of marine tourists visiting Scotland hugely benefit us all. As I said a moment ago, yachting, canal-boating, kayaking, surfing and many other such activities have a base in Scotland, and it would be a shame if we did not make the most of that.<place-holder colnum=\"24635\"/></p><p>I have touched on the issue of whisky. If we can increase the links between marine tourism, the food and drink sector and other related industries, we will see even more improvement in the marketing of Scotland as a brand. With that input, the current boating landscape could be increased. I will give a few examples from the west of Scotland: Largs yacht haven has more than 700 pontoon berths, Kip marina has 620 and Troon yacht haven has 500.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20699969", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I commend the minister for his work on promoting tourism in Scotland since the Scottish National Party came to power, and I welcome the reiteration of his position in this debate.

Between our six flats, we decided to club together and get some basic maintenance tasks undertaken. That was fine&#8212;the process was not too onerous, but there was still the issue of approaching the neighbours and asking them to contribute money. If we had had a factor, things would have been much easier for everyone who stayed in the block. That would have involved taking major decisions about how to proceed with selecting a factor, and there would eventually have been the added cost burden of employing one, but a benefit of the factor system is that the factor organisation is charged with collecting any <place-holder colnum=\"24249\"/> moneys that are due, which was not the case in the situation that I was in a few years ago.</p><p>I rent a flat here in Edinburgh. Recently, residents and owners decided to change the development's property factor&#8212;I think that they were sick and tired of the fact that although bills would come in and the costs would increase continually, they saw little in the way of upkeep of the development. The process of change appeared to take quite a long time. Many things happened&#8212;various meetings were held, letters kept coming through the door and one night I got a visit from one of the folk involved, who wanted to progress matters. I am a tenant, so I passed on all the information that I received to the landlord, because it is the landlord who receives the bills and pays the factoring charges. The process appeared to be fairly seamless, but at the same time it was quite drawn out. I am aware that that situation will not be replicated across the country, and I will return to the issue of changing a factor. However, I am quite confident that the owners of those flats will have a better outcome in due course.</p><p>The number of tenement properties and flatted developments in Scotland means that property factors are essential.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20666033", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Factoring Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate.

I am sure that members of all parties agree that both options have merits and must be considered fully. As far as the legislative approach is concerned, it is difficult to consider what could happen and what the consequences could be without seeing the detail of Patricia Ferguson's proposals.

The easy option and sometimes the greatest political hit is to call on the Government of the day to introduce legislation. I am not for one minute suggesting that Patricia Ferguson has taken that route. The fact that Ms Ferguson held a consultation in October 2007 shows that this is a genuine attempt to solve a problem, and she should be commended for that.</p><p>I feel that legislation can sometimes be a blunt instrument and that every possible option should be considered and introduced, when justified, before legislation. Both the OFT report and the Consumer Focus Scotland briefing are interesting, and two points in the OFT report stand out for me. The first is that one third of consumers feel that they do not get good value for money, and the second is that there are low levels of switching. I gave the example of the flat that I rent here in Edinburgh. I am confident that switching will prove to be beneficial, but it was a long and drawn-out process. There may be people who do not want to participate in such a process, so I can understand why there has been a low level of switching in the past.</p><p>If we consider the economic situation and the uncertainty about future budgets coming to the Parliament and the subsequent knock-on effects to wider Scotland, I hope that those two points&#8212;the lack of value for money and the low level of switching&#8212;will change in the coming months.

The bully-boy tactics of new Labour are unfortunately alive and well, and hell mend anyone who goes against it.

In Inverclyde, where I stay, the <em>Greenock Telegraph </em> is an institution. It has a large daily readership; the <em>Tele</em> is the main oracle in the area. Over the years, other papers have tried unsuccessfully to break into the Inverclyde market, but times have changed. We now have an online publication, inverclydenow.com. It is popular with those who read it, particularly those who commute to work outside Inverclyde, as it gives them a chance to read the news online before returning home.</p><p>The national picture mirrors Inverclyde but, obviously, on a larger scale. Times have changed, for better or for worse. For journalists, information gathering is vastly different from what it was even 10 years ago. Similarly, the way in which we receive our news has also changed. Studies have repeatedly shown that newspaper circulation figures are in decline. Indeed, the trends state that they have been in decline for some years.</p><p>Let us take the example of our main daily newspapers here in Scotland. Between 2008 and 2009, <em>The Herald</em> and <em>The Scotsman</em> circulation decreased almost by 10 per cent. The once staple newspaper diet&#8212;the Sunday papers&#8212;is also in decline. In the same period, the <em>Sunday Herald</em> circulation dipped over 12 per cent. Quite a few people tell me that they no longer buy any national paper&#8212;daily or Sunday&#8212;because they no longer trust anything that is written in them. They say that, although they are sceptical about their local papers, more often than not they buy them.</p><p>Karen Whitefield spoke about the declining newspaper readership. Surely that means that fewer people have the opportunity to read public information notices.</p><p>During its term in office, the Scottish Government has engaged consistently with all areas of the print media industry. In line with the concordat, that engagement involves consulting the local authorities. Indeed, it was COSLA that requested that ministers introduce the consultation that is the subject of the debate. Yesterday, every member received the letter from councillor Pat Watters, the COSLA president, in which he stated <place-holder colnum=\"23216\"/> that COSLA supports the proposals. COSLA recognises that there is a potential saving of at least &#163;2.5 million to the taxpayer that can be invested in front-line services. COSLA also recognises that the consultation&#8212;and it is merely a consultation&#8212;will not prohibit councils from advertising in their local newspapers. I would be astonished if any council across Scotland stopped all public information notices from going into their local media.</p><p>If the end result of the consultation is that the proposal proceeds, the local authorities that spend the money and that have the final say would then make a decision on what they advertise and where. Ultimately, we are talking about devolving more responsibility to local authorities. Local authorities want that; that is why the concordat has been a success.</p><p>I have two points to highlight. First, research on public attitudes to broadcasting, undertaken by the Scottish Broadcasting Commission, found that fewer than 50 per cent of Scots trust their local newspaper. Secondly, if the figure is looked at alongside the Directgov figure that 50 per cent of people prefer to access Government and local authority information online, we see a much broader picture than that proposed by new Labour. Indeed, new Labour members have said much this morning to dismiss the proposal. I am glad that Ken Macintosh is in the chamber, as I want to quote a question that he put at the meeting of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee on 20 January. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For example, Trinity Mirror paid substantial sums of money to its top executives at the same time as it laid off dozens of journalists. The real dilemma for people in the public sector is this: we want to retain the journalists' jobs and local papers, but&#8212;</p><p>and this is the key point&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"should local authorities not be allowed to make savings? Should public policy be skewed in a way that boosts the profits of big companies?\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 20 January 2010; c 3076.]</p><p>Those were legitimate questions; I am glad that the member asked them.</p><p>I am afraid to say that not all members of the public are totally interested in the work of government&#8212;local, national, UK or European. Election turnouts prove that. Not everyone reads public information notices&#8212;the figure of 2 per cent has already been cited. People who buy newspapers say that they do so to find out about a range of issues, not to read public information notices.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20534437", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Newspaper Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like many members in the chamber, I grew up having a local newspaper in the house and I still do.

What would they scrap to reintroduce the project? As the Parliament's committees are undertaking the budget scrutiny process, I look forward to reading how supporters of the GARL project would reintroduce it and by what means they would fund it. If GARL goes ahead, how many communities the length and breadth of Scotland will suffer as their funding is cut to pay for it? GARL supporters need to remember that, and they should also prepare their explanations of why they have cut local projects to fund a scheme that will transport a mere 11 passengers per train.</p><p>The costs of GARL were increasing long before the SNP came to power&#8212;from &#163;140 million to about &#163;160 million, then to the figure that Tavish Scott gave in an answer to the Parliament, when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Glasgow airport rail link is on target to cost &#163;170 million to &#163;210 million\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 16 March 2006; c 24050.]</p><p>It is obvious that the costs of the project were wholly underestimated from the outset and, as a result, were not sustainable.</p><p>Some constituents have told me that they welcome the decision because they do not want another Parliament building fiasco to take place. I do not want that either, as it would do nothing to build confidence in the people of Scotland.</p><p>Glasgow has consistently done well from the Parliament. In 2009-10, Glasgow City Council received from the SNP Government the highest share of funding per head of population of any mainland council. Its share was 22 per cent above the Scottish average. Glasgow received more than &#163;2,500 per head compared with the Scottish average of just over &#163;2,000 per head. Aberdeen and Edinburgh receive just over &#163;1,700 per head and Dundee receives just over &#163;2,200. Glasgow is doing tremendously well from this SNP Government. I should also mention the money for the M74 extension; the Commonwealth games; the M80 upgrade; the new &#163;842 million southern general hospital; which will be built with money from the public purse, not from the shameful public-private partnership and private finance initiative system; and the &#163;1.164 billion for the Glasgow to Edinburgh railway improvements programme. I could go on, but I do not have the time.</p><p>Glasgow has done and is doing very well from this Parliament and this SNP Government.

I commend the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee for its valuable report and congratulate the Scottish Government on bringing the Marine (Scotland) Bill to the Parliament in the first place. I am delighted that legislation dealing with one of Scotland's major resources&#8212;the most important resource, of course, is its people&#8212;is being considered by the Parliament. I am sure <place-holder colnum=\"20652\"/> that, whatever the outcome by the end of stage 3, Scotland will have a legislative environment in which our marine resource will be cherished for the long term.</p><p>As a west of Scotland MSP, I do not have to look far to see water. I grew up in Inverclyde and I still stay there. I honestly do not believe that everyone in Inverclyde, including me for a while, has fully appreciated the beauty of the Clyde as well as its positive economic impact on the communities both north and south of the river, and the recreational benefits that the river brings. As a result, I will focus some comments on the River Clyde. Much of the river's shipbuilding industry has been decimated, for reasons that include the UK Government policy that nationalised and then privatised the industry, and the lower Clyde being designated for oil platforms just as the bottom fell out of platform construction. The death warrant for yards, with thousands of men being placed on the dole queue, was sealed by the Tories in the 1980s. The river has therefore had a chequered history, to say the least. Thankfully, there is still a yard left on the lower Clyde&#8212;Ferguson's in Port Glasgow&#8212;but it does not seem to build many ships these days. It is clear that the river must not only be utilised in a different manner, but protected.</p><p>My members' business debate in November 2008 on sailing and recreational boating was the first debate on that issue in the Parliament. I was stunned that it took nine and a half years to have such a debate, particularly given that the Scottish coastline is more than 13,000km long and therefore of substantial interest to many of Scotland's communities. Since that debate, I have established the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on recreational boating and marine tourism to ensure that a voice can be provided for everyone who uses the Scottish marine resource. Next month, the group will discuss the Marine (Scotland) Bill and I look forward to representatives of Marine Scotland coming along to the meeting.</p><p>I fully welcome the bill for three reasons. First, it aims to simplify legislation by consolidating some 80 pieces of legislation. Secondly, the collaborative working relationship between the Scottish and Westminster Governments is to be commended. Thirdly, the Scottish Government's open approach during the consultation on \"Sustainable Seas for All: a consultation on Scotland's first marine bill\" was warmly welcomed outside this chamber. A representative of the Scottish boating alliance told me that asking the SBA for its views and opinions was an extremely positive approach that showed the Scottish Government's willingness to get stakeholders to participate in Scotland's legislative process. It also <place-holder colnum=\"20653\"/> showed that the Scottish Government wanted the bill to be the best that it could be from the outset.</p><p>Having read the submissions from the SBA and the Royal Yachting Association Scotland, I know that those organisations have issues with aspects of the bill. I am sure that those issues will be discussed with Marine Scotland at next month's meeting of the cross-party group. Given the massive economic benefits&#8212;some &#163;270 million&#8212;that recreational boating brings to the Scottish economy, not to mention the sporting and health-related benefits that it also brings, the Scottish Government should consider fully the input from the SBA and the RYAS. Further, as others have discussed, we learned recently that the Scottish Federation of Sea Anglers, which is a member of the SBA, estimates that sea angling brings in some &#163;150 million to the Scottish economy. If we can get the bill correct, there is no reason why those substantial sums of money should not increase, thus benefiting communities the length and breadth of Scotland.</p><p>I return to the subject of the Clyde. The <em>Stornoway Gazette</em> is not a publication that I read very often&#8212;we do not really get it in Greenock&#8212;but an article in the paper was brought to my attention as I prepared for the debate. The article&#8212;\"First Class Facilities for Yachties Make the Clyde Attractive\"&#8212;encapsulated what is excellent about the River Clyde and some of the facilities that it offers. I do not sail, but having had three opportunities in my life to do so, I have learned that one does not need to be an oil oligarch to enjoy the pastime. In fact, recently I met constituents from a community-based sailing club who reiterated that point. However, I do not know whether we fully appreciate what we have on our doorstep. The article highlighted the excellent facilities at Troon and at the Largs yacht haven, the latter of which I can vouch for. However, if one considers facilities such as the Kip marina in Inverkip, the Fairlie quay marina and Ardrossan marina, to name just a few, it is clear that we have an abundance of top-quality, successful marina developments, which have set the standard for the rest of the country.</p><p>I am sure that the Marine (Scotland) Bill can and will deliver for the whole country. I look forward to it complementing the fantastic facilities that we have in place on the River Clyde. I am sure that they can raise the bar across the rest of the country.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20275168", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to take part in the debate, not as a member of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee or as a scientist, but as someone with an interest in promoting Scotland&#8212;internally, and to the wider world&#8212;as a marine centre of excellence.

The motion states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the charter of rights is based on internationally agreed human rights and is intended to promote the respect, protection and fulfilment of all human rights of people with dementia and their carers\".</p><p>It highlights exactly what this is all about and I do not see how anyone can disagree with it.</p><p>In June 2009, I was asked to open a conference that the Inverclyde Alzheimer's group held in Greenock. The aim of the conference was to highlight ways of living positively with dementia. In my speech, I noted that approximately 940 people in Inverclyde had dementia. However, the recent briefing from Alzheimer Scotland states that that figure has now risen to 1,155. That rise, over a short period of time, shows that this is a massive issue that we must all work to deal with.</p><p>Living positively with dementia does not mean warehousing people, which Cathy Jamieson highlighted during the debate in September. The conference that I attended highlighted what people can do to live positively with dementia, and how they can deal with the situation.</p><p>During the conference there was a role-play session, a question-and-answer session and workshops. The role-play session really took people into the zone&#8212;as they say in football&#8212;and enabled them to understand and tune in to what life is like for anyone who has a family member with dementia. It made me think of my grandmother, who had dementia and stayed with my family when I was in my early teens. I remember the stages that she went through and the strains and stresses that were placed on the family. The role-play session was extremely powerful, and the conference was a tremendous event in which to take part.</p><p>I have waffled quite a lot, so I will have to skip a few things that I had intended to say.</p><p>The debate and the announcement of the charter are timely for me because the Alzheimer's group in Greenock has invited me to visit its Alzheimer's cafe tomorrow.

Unfortunately, we will not hear what the Liberal Democrats think of Scottish culture.</p><p>The motion congratulates the pipe band of Simon Fraser University in Canada on winning this year's world pipe band championships. To win the top prize in any competition requires hard work and dedication. I am a piper, so I appreciate the band's achievements. It is good that a pipe band from another country can win the world championships, because that demonstrates the internationalism of piping, but I look forward to the title returning home in the near future.</p><p>The motion also mentions the Strathclyde Police pipe band and considers its future. I have the utmost respect and admiration for the pipers and drummers of the pipe band and for the band's history.</p><p>I stress that I fully support the hierarchy of Strathclyde Police and the force's initiative to get more officers on the streets and away from their desks. It is imperative that as many police officers as possible are on the streets and that the increased police presence should be visible to the public. Constituents have told me that they have noticed a higher police presence on the streets. I wanted to get that on the record.</p><p>The Strathclyde Police pipe band formed in 1883 as the burgh of Govan pipe band. It became <place-holder colnum=\"20282\"/> the city of Glasgow pipe band in 1912 and then Strathclyde Police pipe band in 1975, after reorganisation. As the Strathclyde Police pipe band, the band has won 12 world championship titles&#8212;most recently in 1991&#8212;including six in a row from 1981 to 1986. When I was growing up and learning the chanter and the pipes, I remember that every year the question was who would come second in the championships, because the Strathclyde Police pipe band was so good and always won.</p><p>This summer, the band finished in fourth place at the world pipe band championships. Indeed, it finished in fourth place in all five majors: the Scottish pipe band championships, the British pipe band championships, the European pipe band championships, the Cowal pipe band championships at the Highland gathering and the world pipe band championships. After all the championships, the band was ranked as the fourth best band in the world&#8212;I repeat, the fourth best band in the world. That is a marvellous achievement by anyone's standards, but the band is also ranked as the best Scottish and British band. As members will easily understand, we are talking about a group of individuals who perform and compete on the world stage at the highest level.</p><p>The band's results in 2008 were slightly lower than its results this year and its achievements this year have been all the more remarkable given the internal pressures that have been placed on it as a result of reorganisation within the force. The band is based in A division in Glasgow. Band members are on different shifts, which means that they have less time to practise together. Numerous grievance procedures have been lodged against the divisional commander&#8212;of course I will not comment on those. The band has been forced to scale back its community activities and allegations have been levelled at it, such as that its members spend too much time practising together and not enough time out on the streets doing police work. As members can imagine, that has not been a barrel of laughs for the players in this world-class band. Their achievements this year are therefore even more admirable and astonishing.</p><p>I do not have time to go into much detail on all the points that I have mentioned, but I will delve into a couple of them. Of the 40 band members, only 13&#8212;less than a third&#8212;are serving police officers, so it is disingenuous of opponents of the band to claim that all 40 members should spend more time on the streets. Of the 13 serving police officers, three played in their own time 100 per cent of the time; the other 10 played when their police duties allowed. The serving officers operate at a ratio of 86 per cent of time spent on the street to 14 per cent spent on piping activities.<place-holder colnum=\"20283\"/></p><p>The pipe band is more than just its title. Its members are musical and cultural ambassadors. They have a community policing role when they are out on the streets. They also act as a recruiting tool. I have been informed that the band's existence has been the deciding factor for people who were considering which police force to join. There can be a greater return for Strathclyde Police on investment in the band than some people perceive to be the case.</p><p>Members might have noticed that there are very few people in the public gallery. I have been told that some band members wanted to come to hear the debate but were fearful that there would be recriminations if they supported the motion. I have spoken off the record to a number of police officers, and almost to an officer they whole-heartedly support the band and realise what it contributes.</p><p>Why is the future of a Scottish institution being threatened in the year of homecoming? How embarrassing is that for the police and for Scotland? What does it say to the rest of the world about how public bodies value Scottish culture and identity? The band can be compared to Chelsea Football Club. Chelsea is not the best club in the world&#8212;neither is Strathclyde Police&#8212;but it is not far from it. Nobody in their right mind would disband Chelsea, so why disband the Strathclyde Police pipe band? I have said that to a few people and they accept the point.</p><p>Papers released for this week's Strathclyde police authority meeting highlight the costs of the band. I have information to dispute some of the figures in those papers. It is stated that the band earned &#163;5,000 last year, but I have been told that it earned &#163;23,000. There is no denying that costs for the band have decreased dramatically. It is not possible to run any pipe band on a just-in-time inventory system&#8212;that is not feasible at all&#8212;so the senior management should just accept the point.</p><p>The College of Piping ran a campaign earlier this year and handed a petition with more than 3,000 signatures to the chief constable. The piping world is watching. I have written to Chief Constable House on a number of occasions asking to meet him to explain the importance of the resource that he has at his disposal. Unfortunately, to date, he has rejected every request. I make the offer once again.</p><p>I fully understand that the minister will say that he cannot intervene because the issue concerns operational matters. I respect that position and cannot disagree with it, but I hope that he will undertake to raise the matter with the chief constable from a cultural perspective, so that the Scottish Government is not embarrassed by the actions of a public body.<place-holder colnum=\"20284\"/></p><p>I look forward to hearing other members' speeches and the minister's response.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20201037", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World Pipe Band Championships"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members from the Scottish National Party and the Conservative and Labour parties who supported the motion and therefore allowed me to bring this members' business debate to the chamber.

I was previously not too aware of what the organisation did, but I was impressed to learn of its activities. Only the week before, I had been contacted by a constituent who had a suggestion for a community energy scheme, and I was in the process of investigating the matter on his behalf. The committee meeting was timely to say the least, and the knowledge that such an organisation exists to assist local groups with energy proposals is vital, as it ensures that normal people can play their part in Scotland's renewable future.</p><p>Paragraph 128 of the committee's report concerns the fossil fuel levy. I whole-heartedly agree with our recommendation, which calls on the Scottish and UK Governments to work together to release the &#163;164 million that is currently held with Ofgem. However, there really is no point in this Parliament getting all or even some of that money if the resultant knock-on effect is a reduction in the Scottish consolidated fund. The &#163;164 million would be a massive injection in renewable projects, which would allow Scotland and the UK to go some way towards reaching renewable targets. I was content that the committee did not divide over that issue&#8212;I am sure we all agree that Scotland can provide so much more in the way of renewable projects and that, as such, the fossil fuel levy should not be used as a political football.</p><p>Paragraph 131 is an important section of the report, as it considers planning applications and the level of consent refusals. In two years, the Scottish Government has approved 26 applications, which are worth 1.8GW of capacity in <place-holder colnum=\"20099\"/> total, and another 33 applications are being considered. Those figures are significant.</p><p>The Scottish Government response that it recognises the need for more renewables projects to be given consent is telling, but the point that stands out is that consent should not be at any price. Our local communities will not thank us, or any elected representative, if projects go ahead on a whim while local concerns are disregarded, irrespective of what the project is. I echo the Scottish Government's response that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the best applications are those that ... take care to resolve environmental and other concerns in advance.\"</p><p>As is the case with other issues that we consider in the chamber, prevention is always better than cure, and I do not see how any party can argue against that response.</p><p>I will touch on the carbon capture and storage section in paragraph 140.

I look forward to reading the carbon capture and storage road map when it is published in the autumn.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, a delegation from the committee went to Berlin towards the end of the series of evidence sessions. The primary aim of the visit was to look at the CCS demonstration plant at Schwarze Pumpe. The site visit was fascinating, and all the visits during the two days were extremely interesting and worth while. I came away with a better appreciation of CCS technology and a better understanding of how the authorities in Germany have been tackling and plan to tackle energy issues.</p><p>It is obvious that we can no longer allow carbon pollution to continue. All of us, irrespective of political party, must ensure that the legacy that we leave for future generations is far better than that which has been left to us. In effect, we are attempting to clean up the mess that we have inherited.</p><p>I commend the report to Parliament for several reasons. First, it is a massive piece of work that has involved pulling together a whole host of information and attempting to break it down for public consumption. Secondly, although I know that the report is not a blueprint for a 100 per cent renewable energy future, I hope that it can be considered to be a framework for what should be possible.

I have a high volume of correspondence from constituents in the West of Scotland highlighting their concerns about the speed of cars, infrastructure and the lack of adequate road signage, which shows that road safety is not a seasonal issue.</p><p>I have been looking closely at the issue of road safety in my constituency of the West of Scotland, with particular emphasis on the A78 running past Inverkip and Wemyss Bay. The minister is aware of that, as we have had a lot of correspondence about it. In early 2008, I was contacted by a number of constituents who were concerned about the section of road at Inverkip. Since that initial correspondence, I have undertaken a consultation on road safety, which I have highlighted to the minister and to the Parliament. Recently, I undertook another consultation, because Scottish Power is considering selling the Inverkip power station site for 780 new homes.</p><p>Both those consultations highlighted the strong local feeling on the issue of road safety and the need for vital improvements on the A78. I had an overwhelming 41 per cent response rate to my consultation on the A78, and I have received 721 responses to my current consultation on the Inverkip power station.</p><p>It is clear that the A78 will struggle to cope with even more vehicles using it at peak times.</p><p>In my current campaign to improve road safety on the A78, I have had numerous dealings with the Inverkip and Wemyss Bay community council. I also met Transport Scotland, along with Councillor Innes Nelson, which resulted in a safety review being undertaken by Transport Scotland and in planned upgrades to the Bankfoot roundabout at Inverkip. I thank Transport Scotland for commissioning the review; the papers arrived at my office this morning, so I am currently going through them.</p><p>I was happy that Transport Scotland took on board all the concerns that were highlighted to it and has taken steps to examine the concerns further. However, as residents in Wemyss Bay and Inverkip know, this is not the end of the matter; I <place-holder colnum=\"19779\"/> will continue to fight for road improvements to secure a safer future for pedestrians and motorists in the area.</p><p>It is vital to implement the recommendations of the road safety framework in seeking to influence young people's attitudes to road safety and increase awareness of the benefits of lower-speed driving in relation to health and road safety.</p><p>It is well known that one in five young drivers are likely to be involved in an accident within a year of passing their test. That needs to change, and with it the attitudes of all drivers, however experienced.</p><p>I have highlighted just a few of the commitments that are given in the framework, but having 90 pledges from the Scottish Government is a positive step to encourage people in our communities to do their bit to ensure that our roads are safer.</p><p>The framework will ultimately allow existing funding streams from the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland, local authorities, the police and many others to be used in a more cohesive fashion. By working together, all parties can play a part in reducing the horrific death toll on our roads.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20194125", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Road Safety Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I fully support Scotland's road safety framework to 2020&#8212;Scotland's first road safety framework&#8212;  and I am delighted that the Scottish Government is implementing an ambitious road casualty reduction target.

It is my first official outing to speak on a bill that is going through the committee, and I am sure that it will not be my last. I thank the committee clerks: since I became a member of the committee, only a few months ago, their help and assistance has been invaluable.</p><p>As we have heard, there was a debate about which committee was to examine the bill. I will not go over that ground, apart from saying that we are <place-holder colnum=\"18971\"/> where we are, and we have to deal with it. I am sure that I am not being unkind to my committee colleagues in saying that none of us, apart from Gavin Brown, are experts on the existing arbitration laws. Gavin Brown's legal expertise proved invaluable during the evidence sessions, and allowed those mere mortals with no legal background to understand the bill in more detail, so I thank him for that.</p><p>Before I move on to the issues around the bill, it is important to note that the committee acknowledged that the Scottish Government conducted a transparent and accessible consultation. We were satisfied that the Scottish Government had sought to engage with as many stakeholders as possible in developing the bill.</p><p>With regard to the economic benefits of the bill, I am a great believer in the KISS&#8212;keep it simple, stupid&#8212;management method, but I fully appreciate that that will not always be possible; it will not always be an option; and it will not always be wanted by those who have vested interests. However, in the case of this bill, it is possible, it is an option and the legal profession appears to want it.</p><p>The evidence that the committee has received shows that there is consensus that a new consolidated arbitration bill may provide economic benefits. Increased economic activity is welcome, and will hopefully lead to Scotland becoming a commensurate player in arbitration. It will be difficult for Scotland to compete directly with the established arbitration centres of London, New York and Geneva, but I am sure that there will be increased opportunities for arbitration in Scotland.</p><p>The committee suggests that it will be difficult to quantify the value of the potential arbitration business. We also suggest that it is important that the Scottish Government does not overstate the economic possibilities of the bill and, as has already been mentioned, we question the figures that relate to London in the financial memorandum. The figure of &#163;3 billion in the financial memorandum can be compared with the figure of &#163;250 million that the committee received in evidence. Those figures are obviously slightly different, and we must have clarity from the Government about which is the more accurate.</p><p>It is important that the marketing of Scotland as an arbitration centre is fully established. We took the view that the Scottish Government should re-examine its position on the marketing of arbitration. Once the bill has passed through the Parliament, in whatever shape or form, it should be incumbent on all the stakeholders to market the improved service. I appreciate that the judiciary and the legal system are totally independent from the Parliament and from political interference, but as the bill is about business opportunities, the <place-holder colnum=\"18972\"/> Scottish Government could look at marketing for the next stages of the bill.</p><p>Another issue centres on rule 24 and the general duties of the parties. Rule 24 is a mandatory rule that calls for the parties to arbitration to deal with it \"without unnecessary delay\" or \"unnecessary expense\". Those are laudable aims, and I am sure that the committee members agree with them in principle, but we have some questions about how realistic those duties are. We heard contrasting evidence about time limits and their worth and the realistic&#8212;or unrealistic&#8212;possibility of their being enforced. Personally, I have some sympathy with the arguments for enforcing time limits, particularly if they can reduce the cost of arbitration. However, I fully appreciate the arguments of those who say that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. Every arbitration case will be different, and the parties involved will be of differing sizes and financial status, so there is a legitimate argument for time limits not to be introduced. Paragraph 79 of our report highlights our position quite clearly and our final point therein legitimately queries how those duties can be enforced. I look forward to the Government's response on that in due course.</p><p>I have enjoyed my short time on the committee and the collegial way in which we have dealt with issues. I have been in the Parliament for only two years, but I have enjoyed that approach on the three committees on which I have served and I hope that that will continue to be the case. However, I was a touch disappointed with one aspect of our deliberations. Paragraph 128 of our report states that the bill is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"not yet fit for purpose\".</p><p>There was a division in the committee about that paragraph. At the time, I argued that almost every bill that has gone through the Parliament has been amended at some point&#8212;yesterday, we spent a whole day in the chamber dealing with amendments to the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill&#8212;and I am sure that that will continue to be the case, even in the distant future when the Scottish National Party is no longer in power. Bills will continue to need to be amended, whether substantially or not. I suggest that saying that a bill is not fit for purpose creates a dangerous precedent and downplays the Parliament more than the Government of the day.</p><p>In this morning's debate about the future of the Parliament, all parties said that they want it to have more powers. However, with more powers comes added responsibility&#8212;that applies to MSPs as well. I gently suggest that MSPs should watch their language from time to time, and I think that having that phrase in the report is quite dangerous. Everyone on the committee appreciated that the bill needs to be significantly <place-holder colnum=\"18973\"/> amended, and we were unanimous on that in our report. However, we should be careful about our language, particularly when we are dealing with a bill that is not, as Wendy Alexander and Lewis Macdonald have already mentioned, party political.</p><p>With that, I commend the committee's report to Parliament.

In her opening speech, the cabinet secretary highlighted the case of the individual who is in the Victoria hospital in Glasgow, and people are still being diagnosed in Scotland and elsewhere. I am pleased that the Scottish Government has not opted to overplay or underplay any of the dangers surrounding swine flu.</p><p>We have been able to cope admirably so far because we have had a pandemic flu framework in place since November 2007. The swine flu outbreak has been a test of that framework, which has proven to be successful so far. I am one of the co-conveners of the cross-party group on funerals and bereavement; the other co-convener, Nanette Milne, is also in the chamber. The membership of the group was grateful to the previous Scottish Executive and the current Scottish Government for their work on the framework, which is important, and was content that the funeral services industry had an input into it.</p><p>The swift action of working together with the UK Government and at European Union level appears to have allowed the Scottish response to be prompt and extremely efficient&#8212;so much so that <place-holder colnum=\"17861\"/> the Scottish Government has been able to make just fewer than 1.5 million surgical face-masks available to England and Wales to cover the shortfall there. There are obvious public concerns, some of which have been touched on, about the possible resurgence of flu-like symptoms in autumn and over winter. However, the calm way in which all of us&#8212;especially the cabinet secretary and her officials&#8212;have conducted ourselves should be commended.

As we have heard, the vaccine can be expected by December, but perhaps as early as September. We know that it will be offered on a voluntary basis in addition to the normal seasonal flu vaccination. All of us are now well aware that the symptoms of swine flu are no more dangerous than those of common flu.</p><p>As I said earlier, like Ross Finnie, I live in Greenock.

I acknowledge the hard work and determination of the Scottish Government in introducing the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill and of members who have taken part in the debate.</p><p>Many aspects of the bill have been discussed, so I will not attempt to cover too much old ground. I will focus my contribution on how a recent visit to Berlin by a delegation from the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee relates to the bill. The purpose of the visit was to learn more about energy policy and usage in Berlin and in Germany as a whole.</p><p>The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee has been undertaking an energy inquiry for some months. It started formally last September, before I became a member of the committee. We are now at the inquiry's tail-end, and a report is due to be completed by the summer. As a new member of the committee, I have found the debate extremely informative. It has got me thinking even more about my own energy usage and my contribution to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as well as those of the country as a whole. I was particularly interested to hear <place-holder colnum=\"17272\"/> the contribution of Peter Peacock, who is unfortunately not here at the moment.</p><p>The trip to Berlin ties in well with the bill. I will highlight two meetings and their relevance to the bill, particularly to section 48, which is on the duty of ministers to promote energy efficiency. Our programme of events included a meeting with two members of the German Bundestag: Dr Axel Berg, the SPD spokesman on energy; and Herr Laurenz Meyer, the CDU/CSU spokesman on the economy. While discussing the effects of energy consumption and energy loss in domestic properties, both Bundestag members acknowledged that there are major problems with German buildings and that it is up to the state to provide solutions.</p><p>We were informed that approximately 60 per cent of the current housing stock in Germany is rented, which will facilitate a domestic property improvement programme. In Scotland, however, 76 per cent of the housing stock is privately owned and 24 per cent is rented. It will therefore be a bit more challenging to have such a programme in Scotland. I said to Dr Berg that it was refreshing that there was an acknowledgment of the housing problem and that it was being examined. However, Germany appears to have acknowledged the problem some years ago. It was obvious to me that Scotland and the UK are some years behind Germany. I stated to Dr Berg that very little had been done in Scotland or, indeed, the UK to tackle this domestic problem. Dr Berg replied with a most startling response, \"Sir, you must be a very poor country.\" As everyone in the chamber knows, however, Scotland and the UK are not very poor countries&#8212;far from it. However, there appears to have been little drive to promote energy efficiency in the past. Many buildings throughout Scotland that are energy inefficient can and must be improved. Providing resources to deal with that is obviously vital, as is promoting energy efficiency plans, for which section 48 provides.</p><p>We had a meeting with the German energy agency and were informed that Germany plans to retrofit 50 per cent of buildings within the next 20 years. Given that 75 per cent of buildings in Germany were built before 1978, it is easy to understand that the retrofit will be a massive undertaking. Even if the 50 per cent retrofit is achieved, the target of a 2.5 per cent reduction in emissions will not be met, because it is currently calculated at 1.7 per cent. Even with retrofitting, there will therefore still be challenges for Germany, but at least it will be moving in the right direction.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14967296", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to take part in this important debate.

I will touch on a few, leaving Glasgow city centre to other members who I am sure will raise it.</p><p>The potential for transport infrastructure in the west of Scotland is limitless. We have heard on a number of occasions about the issues and projects that could be taken forward. One suggestion that could be put into the mix is the greater use of the River Clyde. I am thinking of river taxis from Braehead to Glasgow city centre and a river boat from the tail of the bank to the city centre. Another suggestion is for more trains on the Wemyss Bay to Glasgow line. At the moment, one train runs per hour, despite a massive westward shift in population in the Inverclyde area. I have raised the issue with the minister. Also, the Gourock to Dunoon Caledonian MacBrayne ferry saga must be finalised, one way or another.</p><p>The road infrastructure could be improved, with Transport Scotland adopting some roads in the East Dunbartonshire area where there are no trunk roads at the moment. If Transport Scotland adopted some roads in the area, it would aid investment and relieve pressure on the local authority. Also, consideration could be given to a bypass around Inverkip and Wemyss Bay to address the traffic chaos in the area. There is also the saga that is the Gourock interchange project, about which the minister knows a great deal.</p><p>Those are only some of the issues that have been a problem for many years and which the present Scottish Government inherited on coming into office in 2007. If Government ministers solved all of the issues in four years, they would be miracle workers. That is even more the case following the Chancellor of the Exchequer's budget yesterday and the cuts that are coming Scotland's way in the near future.</p><p>Some time ago, numerous constituents contacted me about the Inverkip situation. I conducted a survey in the Inverkip and Wemyss Bay villages on the danger of trying to cross the A78 at Inverkip. Delay in crossing the road is bad <place-holder colnum=\"16689\"/> enough, but at peak times&#8212;particularly in the morning and evening&#8212;the manoeuvre can be akin to taking a chance with one's life. I mailed out 2,150 survey forms, and the response rate was a massive 41 per cent. With 41 per cent of the population having taken the time to voice their concerns, the issue cannot be ignored.</p><p>After a disappointing initial response, I persisted in contacting Transport Scotland. As of this week, Transport Scotland has agreed to undertake a three-month survey and to let me know its results at the end of the summer. Two junctions lead from the A78&#8212;one to Inverkip village and one to Kip marina. The amount of traffic that zooms up from North Ayrshire in the morning and from the villages to Greenock is one important issue, but we must also consider the safety element. The local authority has built a new secondary school, with approximately 900 pupils, only 2 miles up the road. Because of the amount of traffic that uses the road, it is dangerous for pupils to go on to it. I am delighted by the action that Transport Scotland plans to take, which is a step forward. I look forward to seeing the results of the survey.</p><p>There are many reasons why investment in road infrastructure is vital. I have already mentioned safety. I highlight to the minister and to the chamber the tremendous shift in population to the western part of Inverclyde. Many more properties are being built in Inverkip and Wemyss Bay, and there now seems to be a shortage of people in the eastern part of the district, compared with the west. That is a really important issue. The minister and I have spoken about it before, and I am sure that we will speak about it again; no doubt it will be discussed later this morning.</p><p>A further issue that exacerbates gridlock is the lack of investment by the proper authorities in flood prevention measures. As you know, Presiding Officer, when there are heavy rains in Inverclyde, floods can block off part of the district, especially at the Newark roundabout in Port Glasgow. As Inverclyde royal hospital no longer has consultant services, ambulances must take people to the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley or the Southern general. Sometimes every second counts, so it is important that the whole transport infrastructure and flood prevention measures are taken fully into account.</p><p>I could go on, but I am running out of time and must close.

I expect the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) (Bill) to be passed by the Parliament, which will once again send a message to Scotland and elsewhere that the Scottish Parliament is prepared to act in the interests of the people of this country.</p><p>I will take particular pleasure in casting my vote this evening because I have been involved in moving the campaign and the bill forward since before the bill was introduced to Parliament. Shortly after I was elected, Councillor Kenny MacLaren of Renfrewshire Council arranged for me to meet Phyllis Craig of Clydeside Action on Asbestos. The impending House of Lords decision and its ramifications for sufferers of pleural plaques was explained to me and I was asked to assist. With the help of Councillor MacLaren, we started to put the wheels in motion.</p><p>I offered to introduce the draft bill as a member's bill, but we agreed to try first to convince the Scottish Government to introduce the bill, as that would guarantee it speedier progress through the <place-holder colnum=\"15635\"/> Parliament. Thankfully, the meetings between Clydeside Action on Asbestos, Frank Maguire of Thompsons Solicitors and the Scottish Government were successful. Gil Paterson, Bill Kidd and I invited Phyllis Craig and Frank Maguire to the Scottish National Party conference in 2007 to lobby all and sundry. I do not think that many SNP MSPs left the conference without meeting them and realising what pleural plaques were and what the implications of the House of Lords decision would be. When I was informed that the Scottish Government was to introduce the bill, I was delighted, but I realised that there was still a lot more to do.</p><p>During the early stages of the bill, when I was a member of the Justice Committee, it was obvious that there was unanimous cross-party support for the bill. It was also obvious that there was a sense of injustice, and that the committee could do something about it. I am proud of the scrutiny that we gave the bill and of the report that we published.</p><p>At this point, I pay tribute to the members of the Justice Committee for their work in scrutinising the bill. I was, of course, disappointed to hear Bill Aitken's comments. I respect the fact that he queried the financial aspects of the bill throughout the committee process, but I take this opportunity to urge the Conservatives to change their decision. I advise them not to paint themselves as they were in the 1980s, which is what they will do if they vote against the bill this evening.</p><p>I was born in Barrow-in-Furness in England, but I grew up in Port Glasgow, as my parents decided to return to the town. My father was a coppersmith and worked in the shipyards, as did many other family members. Health and safety conditions in the yards were not as stringent as they are now, and some of the raw materials that were used then would not be used now&#8212;the main one, obviously, being asbestos.</p><p>If I were given a pound for every story that I have heard about the white mice&#8212;not only in the past but since I have been involved in campaigning with Clydeside Action on Asbestos&#8212;I would be a wealthy man. The stories shocked me, but I was shocked even more by those about women contracting asbestos-related conditions as a result of shaking their husbands' overalls before washing them. That brought home to me just how potent and dangerous asbestos is, and how indiscriminate it can be. It can affect the whole population.</p><p>I am pleased that the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament have listened to the arguments. I am sure that the vast majority of the people of Scotland will support the decision that we make on the bill. I know that they will support us in doing the right thing tonight, just as they <place-holder colnum=\"15636\"/> supported us when we did the right thing two weeks ago and voted for Jackie Baillie's Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>During Bill Kidd's recent members' business debate on action mesothelioma day, I urged the insurance industry to work in tandem with organisations such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos and the Clydebank Asbestos Group, instead of fighting claims at every single turn. Today, I again ask the insurance industry to be proactive in moving this issue forward and not to challenge the will of the Parliament in the courts, as the media has reported might happen. If we pass the bill, there is no reason whatsoever for the insurance industry to mount a legal challenge to the will of the Parliament.</p><p>Before I close, I welcome to the public gallery representatives of Clydeside Action on Asbestos, particularly Phyllis Craig, who is a rock for the charity; Frank Maguire of Thompsons Solicitors; representatives of Clydebank Asbestos Group; and Councillor Kenny MacLaren. Their hard work will be rewarded. More important, I want to welcome all those in the public gallery who suffer from pleural plaques and other asbestos-related conditions. Today is about allowing them the opportunity to obtain an apology for their condition&#8212;a condition that was contracted because they went to work and someone else neglected health and safety regulations. Today is about them being able to move on with their lives. Most important, today is about them obtaining justice&#8212;justice that they deserve. Part of Scotland's industrial legacy will be put right today.</p><p>I urge the Parliament to vote with one voice and unanimously back this bill.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14794129", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I expect an element of justice to be reinstated for the people of Scotland shortly after 5 pm this evening.

However, we must thank the French for giving us the pasteurisation process by Louis Pasteur, the stethoscope by Ren&#233; La&#1105;nnec&#8212;forgive my pronunciation&#8212;and, of course, Braille, as we know it today.</p><p>It is testament to Louis Braille that his communication system has lasted as the most effective tool for blind people. As Robert Brown said, the Braille method revolutionised communication for blind people. Without it, many would lead an extremely isolated existence.</p><p>Blind from the age of 4, Louis Braille would have appreciated the difficulties of day-to-day living with no sight. As well as that, he experienced difficult social conditions and suffered severe illness for most of his life, which makes it all the more important to recognise his achievements.</p><p>The freedom and independence that the Braille system can give people with sight problems is extremely important to them. The young musicians <place-holder colnum=\"15425\"/> who will be playing at the reception this evening, who use Braille to read their music, are a fine example of that. As a musician, I can only imagine how difficult it would be for someone who is blind or has a visual impairment to learn an instrument. That is difficult enough for people who have sight, but it must be so much more difficult for people who are blind or visually impaired. I recognise fully that someone who is blind or visually impaired and can play an instrument has a talent that is extremely welcome.</p><p>It is difficult for many of us to imagine the everyday difficulties that blind and visually impaired people encounter. We are lucky enough to be able to access with ease the information that we require when we require it. That is not always possible for many people in Scotland today.</p><p>The effective system that Louis Braille developed has not changed much over the years, but new technologies have kept Braille evolving with various software developments. The advent of the digital age has provided more flexibility for Braille users.</p><p>It is my view&#8212;and that of many others&#8212;that education is a basic human right for everyone, regardless of whether they are sighted, blind or visually impaired. On that basis, it is incumbent on all Governments to ensure that everyone's rights are upheld.</p><p>I know that RNIB Scotland and the Scottish Government have been working together to improve educational facilities&#8212;campaigns are on-going. There have been improvements in materials for blind and visually impaired people, but, as everyone in the chamber will be aware, there is still much to do.

During the current session of Parliament, members on all sides of the chamber have been working closely with Clydeside Action on Asbestos. Bill Kidd, Gil Paterson and I have worked with the group on a range of issues over the past 22 months.<place-holder colnum=\"15354\"/></p><p>The Parliament has a history of bringing justice to people who have been affected by asbestos-related conditions. Tomorrow is action mesothelioma day, which is a reminder to everyone in the chamber&#8212;and, more important, to those outside the chamber&#8212;of the industrial legacy that still affects many people and their families throughout Scotland. Action mesothelioma day is, of course, not taking place solely in Scotland&#8212;events are taking place in other nations in the UK, and I wish them success tomorrow.</p><p>We have heard what mesothelioma is, and I do not want to repeat what has been said, but it is important to reiterate that mesothelioma is a cancer that affects the lining of the lung, the lining of the abdominal cavity and the lining around the heart. Mesothelioma is not something that anyone would wish upon their worst enemy, never mind a work colleague. Thankfully, Parliament has a history of taking action to help the victims of mesothelioma, so we should give credit where it is due. Petition PE336 ultimately led to the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Act 2007, which the previous Scottish Executive introduced. That action shows that Parliament values victims of asbestos-related illnesses and is prepared to act accordingly. I would very much like other places to consider the issue fully, to act accordingly and to give credit where it is due.</p><p>As we know, asbestos-related conditions are varied and mesothelioma is just one example of such a condition. With the support of members of all parties, the Scottish Government is taking action on the Clydeside Action on Asbestos campaign to provide justice for victims of pleural plaques. The Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill will be considered at stage 3 on 11 March, and I hope that the cross-party support for the bill continues.</p><p>I am grateful for the Government's response to the Justice Committee's request for further information on the financial estimates relating to the bill and its expression of concern about the statement of funding issue. I will read the response with a keen eye over the next few days.</p><p>It is clear that victims must get justice. On 7 November 2007, I led a members' business debate on the back of the shameful House of Lords ruling that overturned the previous position, whereby victims of pleural plaques had been entitled to justice. Like all MSPs, I was disappointed by that ruling but, thankfully in Scotland at least, we are on the cusp of overturning it. I am sure that if the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill is passed, the pressure on the Westminster Parliament to overturn the decision by the House of Lords, so that victims in other nations of the UK <place-holder colnum=\"15355\"/> can get justice, will increase. All sufferers deserve justice.</p><p>An aspect of the continual campaign for justice that disappoints me is the insurance industry's apparent reluctance to work in tandem with groups such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos, which would allow victims to obtain speedy outcomes. I fully accept that the insurance industry cannot hand out money on a whim&#8212;no member would expect that to happen&#8212;but I am convinced that its practice of continually fighting cases and lodging appeals, thus delaying payments to victims, leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I respectfully suggest that the insurance industry should take a different approach and try to work with organisations such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos instead of fighting claims at every turn.</p><p>People with asbestos-related conditions did not ask to have the illness. They went to work and did a hard day's honest graft. They do not deserve to suffer the ill health that has befallen them. Groups such Clydeside Action on Asbestos are invaluable in providing assistance, and action mesothelioma day is vital in keeping in the public eye the industrial legacy that has affected many people in our society.

As I was perusing its pages in preparation for the debate, all the memories came flooding back. Once again, the Justice Committee has produced an important piece of work that will aid both Parliament and external bodies. Members do not have to agree with every word in the report, but it provides a firm foundation on which to build future policy decisions.</p><p>As has been highlighted, the Justice Committee's inquiry into community policing emanated from its work on the roles and responsibilities of the police. During that earlier inquiry, it became apparent that community policing is a somewhat strange beast, given its <place-holder colnum=\"15159\"/> various titles and the various nuances of what it means, so the committee decided to look into the matter and try to clarify it. Visits were arranged to Dundee, the Borders and Motherwell, and the committee held evidence sessions, including a session via satellite with Professor Wesley Skogan from Chicago. I can only say that the committee examined the issue in great detail and came to its conclusions in an informed manner.</p><p>As well going on the committee's visits, I spent some time going out with Strathclyde Police in Greenock and East Dunbartonshire and with community wardens in Inverclyde. I also met the community partnership team in East Dunbartonshire. Those additional visits allowed me to have more detailed discussions with the officers and wardens, and they certainly helped me during the inquiry.</p><p>It became apparent early on that there is no one-size-fits-all definition of community policing. Communities and their needs differ, as does the geography of Scotland. What might be good for Greenock or Motherwell may well be inadequate for Peebles or Arran. That was highlighted to the committee by Chief Superintendent Val McHoull of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, who made it clear that she is not convinced that imposing a nationally defined model is the most effective way in which to move the community policing structure forward. As she pointed out, community police officers are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there to understand their community\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice Committee</em>, 3 June 2008; c 854.]</p><p>If they are to do that competently, it is essential that they have some flexibility within their area.</p><p>Paddy Tomkins, Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary for Scotland, takes a similar view. Unconvinced by the neighbourhood policing model in England and Wales, he appreciates the diversity in Scotland and the merits of developing a less uniform model. I echo those sentiments in my thoughts about any future community policing model in Scotland.</p><p>Regardless of whether we were discussing rural or urban areas, we heard about two issues loud and clear: abstraction rates and the tenure of community police officers. It became clear that abstractions are commonplace. In some instances, there is a feeling that community police officers are not as valued as other officers and that they are therefore the first to be called from their duties to perform other tasks. I suggest that community policing is actually one of the most important aspects of policing because it allows the police force to have a public face in communities and to build up links, trust and&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;even friendships. Witnessing the rapport that community police officers have with members of <place-holder colnum=\"15160\"/> the public proved to me that the simple activity of talking to the public can play a vital role in community relations. Furthermore, the more trust that can be built between the police and communities, the more mutual assistance can be provided.</p><p>There will of course be occasions when abstractions from front-line community policing cannot be helped. There may be a major disaster or even a terrorist attack. However, abstractions should be the exception rather than the rule. Paragraph 159 of the report notes Strathclyde Police's approach, with the red-circling of community police officers. That is an important development, but it will be some time before it is fully implemented and we can say whether it works. However, I believe that the will and the desire for red-circling exist, and I expect that this new approach will be beneficial in Strathclyde Police's area. I am sure that problems will arise and that it will not be all plain sailing, but in time the change of mindset will benefit our communities.</p><p>The second issue of note that I will touch on is the tenure of community police officers. I was surprised that there appears to be no rhyme nor reason for the time that a police officer spends in the community. Furthermore, community policing appears to be the first step on the ladder in the police force. It became apparent that if community policing is to work, then a standard approach to tenure is needed.</p><p>I appreciate that an officer's tenure is an operational matter and that the power to change the current approach lies outwith Parliament. That is quite right, but it would be remiss of members not to highlight in our inquiry areas of note or concern for other people to consider. The committee's recommendations that there should be training at national level and that there should be a minimum tenure of two years in community policing are based on all the evidence that we heard, and their aim is to offer a solution on a matter that we all regard as being an important part of policing in Scotland.</p><p>I have no doubt that community policing benefits everyone. To judge from the visits that I have made in the West of Scotland region, the approach works. As is the case with other initiatives, stumbling blocks will be ironed out in due course, to create an enhanced service that brings about the safer Scotland that we all want.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14734068", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Policing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It seems a long time since the Justice Committee published its report, but it was only last October.

I concur with the convener's comments about the way in which the committee dealt with the sensitive issues that the bill throws up for everyone. I am sure that the committee and all members will continue to act accordingly as the bill proceeds in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>As others have said, the bill was originated by the previous Labour and Lib Dem Scottish Executive. I pay tribute to it for doing so. I am sure that colleagues know that I do not usually praise the previous Executive. However, I give praise where it is due: its instruction to the Scottish Law Commission to examine the law relating to rape and other sexual offences was certainly a worthwhile action. When the bill is passed, as I hope it will be, Scotland will possess a piece of legislation that provides greater protection for all of society.</p><p>I congratulate the Scottish Government on continuing with the process that was set in motion by the previous Executive. I am sure that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice will be hoping that the end result of the bill will profit the nation.</p><p>I will not be able to discuss all the issues that I think are important within the time that has been allotted to me, but I will touch on a few of them. First, I have to say that listening to and reading the evidence has taken me on a personal journey. Previously, I had a personal view on one issue in particular, but our stage 1 scrutiny of the bill altered my view. I believed that anyone under 16 who participates in sexual activity should be charged automatically and that legal proceedings should follow. Whether they became pregnant or not was irrelevant. As 16 was and will remain the legal age of consent, why should those under-16s who break the law be protected? I was aware that the children's hearings system deals with the vast majority of those cases and that the Lord Advocate can prosecute at her discretion, if appropriate. My opinion was that there were not enough prosecutions. Thankfully, my view has changed, not because I have become more liberal <place-holder colnum=\"15063\"/> or less pious, but because the evidence that was presented was extremely strong.</p><p>Paragraph 273 of the Justice Committee's report supports the use of the children's hearings system for the vast majority of cases, with the Lord Advocate retaining her discretion in that regard. I think that that recommendation will benefit society.</p><p>The last thing that I want to see is a number of people in our society becoming saddled with a criminal record when a more appropriate way of dealing with them would be beneficial. I also came to the conclusion that if a girl aged under 16 becomes pregnant, the last thing that she needs is to be marched into a courtroom, with all the pressures that that involves. She will need some other mechanism to assist her and the baby.</p><p>Another aspect of the bill that I welcome&#8212;as did the committee&#8212;relates to gender neutrality. Paragraph 279 of the committee report was quite clear in its support for compliance with the ECHR, while noting the important evidence from the Lord Advocate that a different path from the one in the bill could be taken if that was justified.</p><p>I am sure that committee members will debate further the Scottish Government's response to paragraphs 280 and 281 as the bill proceeds&#8212;Bill Butler touched on that earlier. Having read the Government's response, I am keen to hear the cabinet secretary address those paragraphs today. I was intrigued by the written response that he provided, but I stand by the recommendation</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that the Scottish Government gives further consideration to the provisions of section 27 of the Bill.\"</p><p>Widening the definition of rape is an important aspect of the bill. The committee recommended that there should be a separate offence of rape with an object. I welcome the cabinet secretary's response to the recommendation and his intention to have further discussion with the committee and to lodge amendments at stage 2. The important point for me is that an object could cause more damage to a person than a body part could. I accept that a sexual offence would still have been committed, but, given the even greater physical damage, as well as the psychological damage, that would be done, I find it difficult not to believe that the strongest possible label should be given to those who perpetrate such acts.</p><p>I want to introduce a personal thought into the debate. Life imprisonment seems to be a sentence of approximately 15 years, whether for a rape or for some other act. I would like that tariff to be increased for those convicted of rape. Violating a person's body must be the most despicable thing that one person can do to another and, as such, it deserves to be punished by means of a long prison sentence.<place-holder colnum=\"15064\"/></p><p>Having sat through all the oral evidence sessions and read the paperwork on the bill, I am in no doubt that the bill should proceed through the Parliament. I am also in no doubt about the difficulties that all members in the chamber will have to deal with concerning some of the issues that the bill raises.</p><p>I remind myself of a few key points when I think about the bill. First, I want justice to be done, and to be seen to be done, for victims of rape and other sexual offences. Secondly, I do not want to criminalise every young person who starts to experiment as they go through the growing-up process, but I do not want them to think that it is okay to indulge in underage sexual activities. Thirdly, I want young people to have sex education, via schools or health professionals. There has to be an understanding of the consequences of sexual activity: child parents, for example, sexually transmitted infections and law breaking. Fourthly, with rights come responsibilities. If adults cannot act responsibly, their right to liberty should be removed. Therefore, are the proposed sentences really high enough? Given that research from Children 1<sup>st</sup> shows that around 30 per cent of Scots have sex before the age of 16, I have to query why society is failing in its responsibilities in that regard. I agree with the Catholic Parliamentary Office that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the sexualisation of young people in our society is a problem\".</p><p>I am sure that the bill will go some way towards achieving a better and safer Scotland.

The first is the proposal for a community payback sentence, which will shorten the time within which an offender must undertake payback from 12 months to six months. That is evidence of a speedier response. The second is the plan to legislate to make clear that sentences of less than six months should not be imposed unless no other option is suitable. That should enable work to be undertaken with offenders to tackle their issues and reoffending capabilities. The third is to end the existing arbitrary early release system that the Tories introduced, so that there is an effective end-to-end sentence management system. The fourth is the plan to abolish the sending of under-16s to prison and instead to provide them with more appropriate secure accommodation, which should be welcomed throughout the chamber. I could go on to list the many other positive aspects <place-holder colnum=\"13862\"/> of the document that will ensure that Scotland becomes a safer and more just country, but I will focus on the community payback sentence and on sentences of six months or less.</p><p>Prison should be used to get dangerous people off the streets, to make our streets safer and to ensure that work can be carried out with offenders to turn their lives around. It should not be used as a free bed-and-board hotel to satisfy the Tories or the Labour Party, who appear to be having a competition to see which of them can be the more right wing. Bill Aitken has suggested that old hospitals or Royal Air Force bases could be used as prisons, while Richard Baker wants those who are on community payback projects to wear high-visibility jackets. In fact, Labour should just go the whole hog and seek the reintroduction of prison suits with arrows or of stocks in town centres. If Labour members want to humiliate rather than rehabilitate people, they should keep going as they are. Thankfully, if media reports are correct, Mr Baker does not have his own party's unanimous support for his proposals.</p><p>I have to say that I fully agree with comments that Cathy Jamieson made in the past.

Under the Government's proposals, that guy would be able to do more community service on his five days off to get the sentence out of the way more quickly and to show that he is doing the work that he is supposed to be doing. The proposals will ensure that future offenders can carry out their community payback sentences in a shorter time, that the payback is relevant to the community and that the work is visible.

At present, Scotland has a vibrant media&#8212;albeit that there are signs of contraction&#8212;but the threat against the three Newsquest titles will surely send shock waves through all media organisations in Scotland. <em>The Herald</em> and the <em>Evening Times</em> are institutions in Scotland, and the <em>Sunday Herald</em> has proved in the past decade to be a quality addition to the newspaper stands. The more quality publications we have, the better, as far as I am concerned.</p><p>There is another vital issue, which I suggest is probably the most important thing to be considered&#8212;the staff.

Some will be lucky enough to get their jobs back, albeit on worse conditions, but what will be their fate in the medium term, never mind the long term?</p><p>From what I have been led to believe, communication from management to the staff has been practically non-existent, which has created even more uncertainty and apprehension among the staff. I have been informed that those who are taken back will work for all three titles. As the publications have different sets of working hours, will that mean that the staff will work from 6 am to 12 midnight in order to cover shifts? David Whitton said that the shift will probably start at 10 am, but I have been informed that it will start at 6 am, which just emphasises the lack of information and communication from management to staff. Also, will the staff work six or seven days a week to ensure that the publications are covered? Those <place-holder colnum=\"13741\"/> questions might seem ridiculous, but I assure members that they are legitimate concerns that have been put to me by staff who do not have a clue about what the future holds for them at Newsquest. It could be said that those questions are not exclusive to Newsquest and the three titles&#8212;I accept that&#8212;but as this evening's debate is about the future of the titles and the staff, it is legitimate to highlight the questions.</p><p>As things stand, it might seem to the naked eye that the management's actions are the actions of a drive to cut costs and increase profits. I do not know whether that is the case, and I am not suggesting that it is, but it could be suggested that such a strategy is under way. I hope that a profit maximisation strategy is not under way. The Newsquest products are quality products that target different markets and have the right to an equal place in the competitive media.</p><p>In various sectors of the industry, competition can occasionally be positive, stimulating improvements and leading to better products. Scotland's written media is one such sector; the greater the range of available written publications, the better served Scotland will be. Indeed, the more that interest in on-line versions of newspapers increases, the wider the range of publications that will be available throughout the world.</p><p>Newsquest has three different quality products that provide huge benefits to Scotland and ensure competition in the industry. The threat to the future of the titles and the staff is worrying and will concern everyone involved in the Scottish media. I urge Newsquest management to think again about its proposals, to communicate with its staff, to provide genuine assurances about the future of the publications and to invest in the publications. Increased investment will reap greater moral and financial rewards, while short-term cuts will simply devastate morale, the quality of the product, their readership, advertising and&#8212;ultimately&#8212;the publications themselves.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551348", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Newsquest (Herald and Times) Ltd (Job Cuts)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sandra White on securing this important debate, and all the MSPs who signed the motion.

That is in addition to the 96 positions that were cut earlier this year. If the BBC wanted to make job cuts, it should have done the decent thing recently and sacked two people as opposed to the fudge that it came up with. That would have saved the licence fee payer millions of pounds that <place-holder colnum=\"13042\"/> could have been reinvested to maintain jobs, talent and skills in the corporation.</p><p>The debate is about broadcasting and competition in Scotland and the role of STV, which I will come back to in a moment. However it would be remiss of me not to mention yesterday's other shocking announcement by Newsquest that it is sacking its employees and asking them to apply for their positions, with up to 40 not being filled. That was a disastrous announcement for the media in Scotland. However, I wonder to what extent the announcement was another element of the hangover from when STV, under the Scottish Media Group, owned the Newsquest titles.</p><p>Referring directly to the motion, having received the Scottish Broadcasting Commission's conclusions, and looking forward to the Ofcom report, I am pleased that broadcasting is being taken seriously in this chamber. In these tough economic times, competition is largely put aside while survival is uppermost in the minds of most businesses. With the recent events in Scottish broadcasting, survival might well be the appropriate word.</p><p>It could be argued that there is internal competition between STV and ITV around public service broadcasting provision. However, I am concerned about the future of commercial public service broadcasting in Scotland because of the potential lack of competition for the BBC.</p><p>I am pleased that the Scottish Government's submission to the Ofcom review states that the Scottish Government shares Ofcom's view that the BBC should not be the sole provider of public service content. The stage 1 findings of the Ofcom review, which show the importance that audiences place on the continued availability of high-quality, original content that meets public service purposes, came as no surprise. Stage 2 of the review attempts to take forward the choices that are available to give audiences the tailored local output that they ultimately desire. John Lamont discussed that. It is ironic that the Scottish Broadcasting Commission reported in October that a substantial increase in investment in Scotland by the UK public service broadcasters is required. Yesterday's announcement and Michael Grade's comments about STV being subsidised highlight that that view is not being paid attention to or that there is no commitment to ensure that what has been proposed will be carried out.</p><p>Broadcasting is vital to Scotland's economic, cultural and democratic health, and, as I am sure members of all parties agree, more high-quality content should be produced here. Unfortunately, the recent report by the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television&#8212;PACT&#8212;revealed that independent network television production in Scotland fell dramatically in 2007. A mere two <place-holder colnum=\"13043\"/> hours of independently produced drama were produced in Scotland for broadcast to the whole of the UK, which is worrying for the Scottish broadcasting industry. That enhances the Scottish Broadcasting Commission's case for a Scottish digital channel. It is time for London-centric broadcasting to come to an end and to allow Scotland to shine with the talent that is on offer here.</p><p>An interesting piece of information emerged with the damp squib that was this week's Calman commission report: the agreement with the Scottish Broadcasting Commission that there should be a greater focus on broadcasting in Scotland. The Calman commission went further in stating that the Scottish Parliament and ministers should take a more active role in considering the broadcasting industry. As a nationalist, I welcome any support to bring more&#8212;indeed, ultimately all&#8212;powers to the Parliament. Normal self-respecting nations have such a right.</p><p>In conclusion, I stress that the principle of competition between public service broadcasters creates a healthier industry for audiences as well as for broadcasters.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14289814", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadcasting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate is timely, especially after yesterday's announcement that BBC Scotland is set to lose 20 posts from news and current affairs, as well as another 54 positions, including producers, assistant producers, directors and researchers.

I welcome members of sail Clyde and representatives of the sailing community from the west and other parts of Scotland to the public gallery and the first ever debate on sailing, boating and the marine leisure industry in Scotland in the Scottish Parliament. I hope that this debate will, first, be a starting point for recognising the importance of the marine leisure industry and what it brings to Scotland's economy, and secondly, highlight the growth potential that can have a positive impact on the Scottish economy. It is apt that the debate is taking place on the same day as the annual general meetings of Sail Scotland and the British Marine Federation in Edinburgh. The parliamentary business managers deserve a wee bit of credit for perfect scheduling.</p><p>First, I have to hold my hands up and state that I do not have a sailing background and do not own a boat. I went sailing twice years ago and went river canoeing some years ago as well. I did both at the Ardentinny outdoor education centre, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but my hobby as a youngster was bagpiping, so that took priority. It could therefore be asked why I have taken an interest in the marine leisure industry. As a west of Scotland MSP who has spent most of his life in Inverclyde, I see the Clyde every day. I know <place-holder colnum=\"12783\"/> that it is still a working river as well as a river for leisure. Each year, when the sailing regatta takes place off the esplanade in Greenock, the river is a wonderful sight.</p><p>Only recently, the river was once again a sea of colour and splendour, when the Queen Elizabeth II left its birthplace and spiritual home for the last time. It was a delight to see so many yachts, boats, canoes, dinghies and jet-skis on the river throughout the afternoon to have one last look at the pride of the Clyde. Not everyone who attended on that day would have come from Inverclyde, so the increase in tourism to Greenock would have been advantageous. With tourists come money, which helps local economies. The QE II event was not a typical event by any means, but such one-off events have a place as economic generators for local areas. As the leisure marine industry continues to expand throughout Scotland, such events will make huge contributions to local economies.</p><p>As the motion states, Scotland's leisure marine industry has a turnover of &#163;98.9 million a year. Furthermore, the economic benefit of recreational boating in Scotland is estimated to be in excess of &#163;250 million. As we heard only a few months ago, when the Parliament considered the Scottish Register of Tartans Bill&#8212;which is now an act&#8212;golf brings in some &#163;300 million to the Scottish economy. Quite rightly, golf is considered to be a major economic player for Scotland. The sailing, boating and leisure marine industry is not too far behind golf, but the industry's contribution to Scotland's economy has not been recognised. The industry's representatives will be the first to admit that they may not have stated their case in the past, but that will surely change in future.</p><p>Prior to the summer recess, I was introduced to Mike Balmforth from the British Marine Federation. During the recess, he took me to visit the Kip marina in Inverkip, Largs yacht haven, Fairlie quay and Ardrossan marina. Only a few weeks later, I took part in the launch of the sail Clyde strategy document at Largs yacht haven. Only last week, I attended the official opening of the new, impressive Euroyachts showroom at Largs yacht haven. My Scottish National Party colleague Kenneth Gibson, who is the constituency MSP, did the honours in officially opening the showroom, so I will not say too much about that event in case he wants to speak about it in his speech.</p><p>I have learned a great deal about boating, sailing and the leisure marine industry in recent months, but one key point that has stuck in my mind is that one does not need to be a millionaire to take part. Yes, yachts worth hundreds of thousands of pounds are available for sale, but the leisure marine industry caters for more than that category of person. Someone with a canoe, <place-holder colnum=\"12784\"/> people on a barging holiday or a person with a rowing-boat can also be involved.</p><p>Scotland has 11,800km of coastline&#8212;13,115km if all the islands are included&#8212;as well as 220km of canal network originally built between 1768 and 1822, so there is plenty of space for anyone who wants to participate in the leisure marine industry. Another interesting fact that I remembered while preparing for today is that Ellen McArthur, who broke the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe in 2005, came from land-locked Derbyshire. That proves that one does not need to live beside the water to get involved in water pursuits.</p><p>As the motion highlights, the leisure marine industry employs 1,816 full-time equivalent staff and provides some 7,900 jobs indirectly. By any industry's standards, that is impressive. I am sure that many people outwith the Parliament are not aware of those important statistics.</p><p>As well as providing economic benefit to Scotland, leisure marine activities benefit local communities. Members will have received information highlighting the activities of leisure marine organisations throughout the country. I found the information from the Moray Firth Partnership particularly interesting, because it highlights the investment that has been made to increase the number of berths. When completed, the development will provide 250 extra berths in five harbour areas. That will have a beneficial effect on local economies. For example, Inverness marina already has advance bookings from people from France, Norway, Holland, Denmark and Sweden. That proves that marina developments can increase tourism.</p><p>The sail Clyde strategy that I mentioned earlier highlights that the Clyde currently has 3,200 marina berths and that the figure is expected to reach some 6,000. That increase will provide a massive boost to the leisure marine industry and will undoubtedly lead to more tourism opportunities. I am informed that the Clyde is the second most popular sailing destination in the United Kingdom, behind the Solent. Many people already fly up to Scotland from south of the border to do their weekend sailing from Scottish marinas. We should never forget that important market. The strategy also highlights that, at present, 30 per cent of the boats on the Clyde are not Scottish owned and that that proportion has increased by 50 per cent since 1996. Next year's homecoming 2009 is an ideal opportunity to establish longer-term roots within the marine leisure community.</p><p>It has been suggested that the industry has not been taken seriously enough in the past, and I hope to improve that. I am keen to establish a new cross-party group on the leisure marine industry in <place-holder colnum=\"12785\"/> the Parliament, so if any member is interested, they should get in touch with me later.</p><p>Three key issues need to be considered from the point of view of the industry. The first is the lack of skills and training, the second is the shortage of infrastructure, and the third is tourism, which I have already spoken about.</p><p>I accept that infrastructure developments are taking place throughout Scotland and that they are being funded by marinas, but I am sure that there is scope for public money to be included. There would be benefits for local and national Government. That could be debated at cross-party-group level.</p><p>Without all stakeholders making a concerted effort on skills and training, the leisure marine industry will face difficulties. As Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are on the cusp of a recession, I suggest that now is the time to plan ahead and put in place a strategy that will facilitate the industry.</p><p>I must also stress the positives. It has been acknowledged that, in the past year, progress has been made on the environmental impact of the leisure marine industry. The inclusion of the industry in consultations by the sustainable seas task force and the likelihood of its being consulted on the proposed Scottish marine bill should be commended. Industry representatives told me that they are delighted that they have been included in such discussions for the first time since devolution, and they commended the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment for bringing that about.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I know that I have gone over my time; I am about to conclude. I have not begun to go into the detail of the importance of the industry to Scotland; I have really just skimmed the surface.</p><p>Scotland already has golf, tartan, bagpipes and whisky as iconic and world-renowned brands. I would like the leisure marine industry to join that elite group. I accept that there is some way to go, but it is important to have that target. I hope that this evening's debate will be the first step towards it.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271318", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sailing and Boating"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members who signed my motion and all the members in the chamber this evening.

Coincidentally, today's debate takes place in the same week one year on from that members' business debate, which was attended by 24 MSPs of all parties. I was grateful for their support and for the speeches that they made. The fact that the debate had to be extended because so many members wanted to contribute shows the importance of the issue to the Parliament.</p><p>I am delighted that the Scottish Government introduced the bill after listening to the arguments that were put forward by campaign groups such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos, whose members, along with other campaigners, I welcome to the public gallery today. Their campaign for justice has been on the stocks for some time because they were aware of the impending outcome of the House of Lords ruling. The ruling was issued on 17 October last year, but targeted campaigning had taken place in preparation for that decision which, unfortunately, favoured the insurance companies over sufferers from pleural plaques.</p><p>I have had meetings with Clydeside Action on Asbestos on several occasions. At one of those meetings, I agreed with colleagues Gil Paterson MSP, Bill Kidd MSP and Councillor Kenny McLaren to take the issue to last year's Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"12029\"/> National Party conference. At the conference, I proposed a resolution&#8212;it was seconded by Gil Paterson and passed by acclaim&#8212;to highlight to the Scottish Government that the SNP is full-square behind justice for pleural plaques sufferers.</p><p>The bill will do something remarkable, in that it will not effect change but keep the status quo. It does not ask for a change in the law. For 20 years, pleural plaques sufferers were able to claim for damages, but the insurance companies fought that in the courts. Unfortunately, last year, the House of Lords agreed with the insurance companies and they won their case. That prevented others from claiming damages. Although the House of Lords decision is not binding in Scotland, it is persuasive enough that it will be adhered to, as has already been the case.</p><p>I am delighted that Kenny MacAskill and Fergus Ewing have listened to the arguments and agree that justice should be upheld. For that, they will always have my gratitude.</p><p>The stage 1 report is unequivocal in its support of the general principles of the bill; that is stated in paragraphs 153 and 155. Some issues still need to be addressed, but the committee was unanimous in its support for the principle that those who suffer from pleural plaques should have access to justice. The written and verbal evidence that the committee received was of great assistance. It also provided a confusing picture at times, particularly when it came to the financial aspects. I do not think that I am speaking out of turn to say that there was a heavy dose of scepticism when the committee was presented with financial evidence from the insurance industry about the projected costs of the bill. That was probably also the case with the information that we got from the United Kingdom Ministry of Justice.</p><p>There were also questions about how accurate an estimate the financial memorandum to the bill is&#8212;if there can be such a thing as an accurate estimate. The committee has tasked the Scottish Government with providing further clarification on the financial memorandum, and that has already been discussed today. It is only right and proper that any legislation that passes through this or any other Parliament should have information about its costs that is as accurate as possible. Earlier, the minister said that the Government is looking into that in more detail and will provide more information in due course. I look forward to seeing that.</p><p>I think that the statement of funding policy will continue to be debated between the Scottish Government and the UK Government, judging by the correspondence to date. Unfortunately, that has some way to run before the issue is fully resolved.<place-holder colnum=\"12030\"/></p><p>The committee also commented on the consultation process that the Scottish Government used; Bill Aitken mentioned that. Our recommendations about the consultation are in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17. There is no doubt that consultation on any bill is vital, and this bill is no different. However, some of the consultation responses are disappointing. I was disappointed that North Lanarkshire Council and Angus Council did not back the proposals.</p><p>During the evidence session on 2 September, it was said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"plaques are a good thing and do not cause harm.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice Committee</em>, 2 September 2008; c 1025.]</p><p>The thud of committee members' jaws hitting the table was thunderous. The witness continued with a further explanation of that statement, but by that time the genie was out of the bottle. Pleural plaques are markers of exposure to asbestos and they are scarring on the pleura. Furthermore, they signify an increased risk for developing mesothelioma, as we have already heard today. That does not tell me that pleural plaques are \"a good thing\".</p><p>Asbestos-related illnesses affect the whole of Scotland. They affect people who have worked in heavy industry such as shipbuilding on the Clyde and house building throughout the country. However, they also affect family members who have inhaled asbestos particles from overalls. I have met a lady who suffers from pleural plaques because of that.</p><p>I welcome the bill and the Justice Committee's report on the bill. The Parliament has a chance to ensure that people in Scotland have a right to justice, and the Scottish Government should be commended for that. I hope that the UK Government gets on board and follows the lead to ensure justice down south as well. I support the bill and look forward to its becoming law at some point in the future.</p><p>Finally, once again, I commend the campaigners, including Clydeside Action on Asbestos, for their tireless work in highlighting asbestos-related injustices, and I commend the Scottish Government for introducing the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14206682", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to take part in the debate both as a member of the Justice Committee and as the member whose motion on pleural plaques was considered in the members' business debate last year to which others have referred.

Only this week, a poll found that 72 per cent of families are finding it more difficult to pay bills compared with this time last year. That being the case, and given that prices have increased dramatically in the past year, it is reasonable to suggest that the Lib Dems should have backed the SNP's proposal for a fuel duty regulator during the most recent budget process at Westminster. At that time, unfortunately, they did not understand the logic of the proposal or the need to put money into people's pockets. It is good to acknowledge that even the Tories now realise that the fuel duty regulator is a worthwhile policy, despite their having voted against it at the time.</p><p>The motion proposes that all parties should work towards a 2p tax cut using the Parliament's tax-varying powers. That is a laudable aim, I suggest, but have the Lib Dems thought through the implications of their policy? The debate about whether the cut would cost &#163;400 million or &#163;800 million will continue long after this morning, but it is legitimate to ask how many people would be forced into the dole queues by the &#163;800 million cut. How would it be funded? It would certainly increase unemployment, but would it also lead to cuts in the central heating scheme or prevent the Scottish Government from investing &#163;100 million in affordable housing? Would it be funded through the demutualisation of Scottish Water, which would probably result in increased charges for customers? Would it be funded through the scrapping of drug and alcohol programmes? The potential for the Lib Dem cuts to adversely affect the Scottish population is staggering. I am sure that people will not be duped by such utter nonsense.</p><p>The UK leader of the Lib Dems also wants a 4p tax cut, so in Scotland we would have a 6p cut in <place-holder colnum=\"11861\"/> income tax. Our public services would be absolutely decimated. Iain Gray is trying to take the food out of children's mouths, but the Liberal Democrats seem intent on increasing poverty and deprivation and on starving the public sector. Within the limited powers of this Parliament, the SNP Government has already put money back into people's pockets, with a council tax freeze, the phasing out of prescription charges, the scrapping of bridge tolls and the introduction of a small business bonus scheme.</p><p>Of course, further action is needed. A reduction in the cost of energy and fuel prices would certainly help. Energy prices have increased by 38 per cent in 2008 alone and the price of petrol has risen by 22 per cent over the past year, although I accept that the prices at the pump have decreased somewhat in the past couple of weeks.</p><p>If the Lib Dems want to help hard-pressed families in Scotland, they need to put pressure on the UK Government to work for lower energy prices, lower petrol prices and lower food prices and to back measures such as the fuel duty regulator.

I am delighted that the SNP Government has been happy to support him and his bill. As a proud Scot and a piper, I am keen to see a future secured for this part of our well-recognised national heritage.</p><p>Tartan has a massive global significance, and it is synonymous with Scotland. That being the case, I was surprised that there was no national register of tartan in the first place. I am sure that many members were not previously aware that there was none. I find it surprising that previous Governments, pre and post devolution, did not rectify that. Passing the bill and establishing the public repository of tartan rectifies the previous position. The benefits of a single national tartans register are clear for all to see. It will bring economic benefits and enhance tourism. In the future, members of the public will be able to access it with ease.</p><p>Tartan provides more than 7,000 jobs and about &#163;350 million for Scotland's economy. It is a major Scottish industry with a global appeal and we <place-holder colnum=\"11745\"/> should be proud of it. During the stage 1 debate&#8212;as well as today&#8212;the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism highlighted the claims of the management consultant, Professor Michael Porter. As the minister said previously,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Professor Michael Porter ... noted that Scotland is one of only 15 or 16 countries on the planet that has a truly vivid national brand and a high standing that it owes, in great part, to tartan. Along with whisky and golf, tartan accounts for the fact that Scotland means something to 98 per cent of the world's population.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2008-06-19.10058.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 19 June 2008; c 10059.]</citation></p><p>As a piper, I politely suggest to the minister and Professor Porter that the great Highland bagpipe has been omitted from that 98 per cent. The great Highland bagpipe is also a fantastic global and national brand. We have some wonderful global brands for a country of just 5 million people, but we have not fully exploited them across the world. Tartan, piping, whisky, golf and&#8212;dare I say&#8212;the delicacy that is haggis are five brands that highlight Scottishness.</p><p>At another time, I will argue for sailing and the vast input into the Scottish economy that it brings. I would like sailing to be a global Scottish brand. It brings around &#163;250 million into Scotland&#8212;&#163;80 million from the Clyde alone. However, I will take that up another day.</p><p>The introduction of the new role of the keeper of the Scottish register of tartans to oversee the register is a positive aspect of the bill. The keeper will provide a single focal point for tartan, which will enhance the marketing of tartan globally. That can only be beneficial to the industry. An official definition of tartan, together with a keeper who will consider new designs against a range of criteria, will help to deepen people's knowledge of tartan and encourage innovation in design.</p><p>I am sure that the bill will prove to be beneficial not just to tartan and to Scotland but to the Scottish global brand.

The overcrowding problems have obvious implications for preparing prisoners for release&#8212;an overcrowded prison does not lend itself to working on rehabilitation programmes, nor does it help work on assisting prisoners who are about to be released. That should be obvious to everyone. A payback scheme will allow us to ensure that less serious offenders give something back to the community that they have damaged. It will ease overcrowding and facilitate more effective rehabilitation, with the longer-term aim of cutting reoffending rates.</p><p>The type of payback and the cost implications will be matters for further discussion, but the fundamental aspect of the initiative is key to the future of our prison estate. Earlier this week, the cabinet secretary highlighted working on building sites as an option for payback. I would like less serious offenders to give something back, for instance by fixing and painting fences, cutting grass for elderly people or collecting litter and rubbish from the sides of railways and motorways. Those are all practical and, above all, useful ways of punishing offenders for their crimes, and they will remove the free-bed-and-board culture that afflicts the prison estate and costs it dearly financially. The Scottish Prison Service says that its costs are more than &#163;40,000 per prisoner per year. I would prefer that the money was spent&#8212;not squandered&#8212;on payback schemes and on trying to rehabilitate serious offenders in prison.</p><p>I am sure that many people listen to debates such as this and automatically call for public floggings, capital punishment and other extremes. I do not advocate such measures, and I agree with human rights. Everyone should have rights, even prisoners. There are two key points, however. First, with rights come responsibilities: if a person commits a serious crime, their right to roam the streets as a free person should be removed. Secondly, prisoners deserve a basic level of rights.</p><p>I am more concerned, however, with the human rights of the innocent victims who have been wronged. My main concern is for the elderly lady who has been mugged or beaten up, and who is now too petrified to go out. She might also be scared to switch on her heating because of soaring energy bills, whereas prisoners live in warm cells and have three square meals a day. I am also more concerned about the human rights of a child who has been the victim of a sexual offence.</p><p>The Scottish Prisons Commission's report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland will not have a world-leading prison service ... until we reduce the unnecessary, costly, damaging and dangerous overuse of custody.\"<place-holder colnum=\"10780\"/></p><p>I am pleased to see that the SPC's recommendations include one for a sentencing council, which is also a commitment of the SNP.

I look forward to further developments on the sentencing council in due course.</p><p>I have been keen to track the issue of mandatory sentencing for knife crime, of which everyone in the chamber is aware. When Damien Muir was murdered in Greenock in July last year, his family immediately took on the immense challenge not only of introducing mandatory sentencing but of safeguarding the future of our streets. As Damien's father John pointed out to the Public Petitions Committee this week, Scotland is one of the most successful countries for things such as engineering and medicine, so why do we have more knife crime per capita than anywhere else in Europe?

Many valid points have been raised, especially by Nigel Don, whose speech I enjoyed, and by Frank McAveety.</p><p>I have no intention of reiterating all the points that have already been made, but I will touch on a couple. For many, obesity is a matter of embarrassment rather one that they do not care about. The obesity action plan that the Scottish Government launched in June is therefore a welcome step in tackling the problem in Scotland.</p><p>The action plan is a long-term practical strategy, and the most appropriate way to move forward. With &#163;56 million of funding over the next three years, the SNP Government is helping to create a healthier Scotland. By tackling obesity in Scotland, we are striving to alleviate some of the strain on <place-holder colnum=\"10563\"/> the NHS caused by chronic illnesses and the associated costs of treating the consequences of obesity.</p><p>We have already heard that the estimated cost of obesity to the NHS in 2003 was &#163;171 million, a sum that I am sure every member in the chamber agrees could be easily redistributed to other areas of the health service. It is a positive move, therefore, that the Government is devoting &#163;19 million&#8212;nearly half the available resources&#8212;to the early years. We cannot ignore the importance of education in forming our opinions and mindset when it comes to a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>In my adult years, I have been careful about what I eat. I still enjoy a fish supper or a burger from time to time, but I have never succumbed to the joy of a deep-fried Mars bar or a deep-fried pizza in batter&#8212;the thought is quite revolting. In the run-up to becoming a father, I became even more aware about the food that my wife and I ate. That awareness has continued since then, as we want to ensure that we and our daughter are as healthy as we possibly can be.</p><p>The early years programme to improve the nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas will have longer-term benefits for people's health as well as the health of the NHS in Scotland. Improving nutrition and educating people about the benefits of healthier eating, particularly for pregnant women and children under five, will be successful in the longer term. By promoting healthy living from an early age, in relation to both alternative food choices and fitness options, we hope that the future of Scotland will be heading in the right direction.</p><p>A further curse of obesity is diabetes. Last night, I attended the launch of the \"Scottish Vision Strategy\"&#8212;the document that I have here&#8212;at the meeting of the cross-party group on visual impairment. Shona Robison and James Kelly were also there. The strategy has been developed by a wide alliance of health and social care bodies, voluntary organisations, eye care professionals, Government representatives and service users. I encourage all members in the chamber to obtain a copy of the document from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, because it is interesting reading. The strategy is important because diabetes can lead to sight loss. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"our rate for type 1 or 2 diabetes is increasing by roughly 7% annually\".</p><p>That is an alarming rate. Thankfully, following its eye care review, the Scottish Government has given &#163;2.6 million to health boards and partners to implement the key recommendations. That will, I hope, catch anyone with diabetes at an earlier <place-holder colnum=\"10564\"/> stage, help them keep their sight and turn around their general health.</p><p>I mentioned the embarrassment of obesity. To be second in the world to the USA&#8212;to have a silver medal in obesity&#8212;is an embarrassment to Scotland, especially as we are a wealthy nation. The action plan is an opportunity to tackle the problem head on, and I am sure that there will be improvements in the future. Tackling obesity is a much wider issue, and has much greater benefits for people's wellbeing, than just getting someone to shed a few pounds, stones or kilos. The steps that the Government is taking are extremely welcome, and I fully endorse the obesity action plan.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Obesity Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I appreciate that obesity is an issue that people do not like to talk about, but this afternoon's debate has been extremely interesting.

I was there in 2000 as part of an InterRail trip to eastern Europe. I will come back to that in a moment. Auschwitz is approximately an hour from Krak&#243;w, which is a major city and the cultural capital of Poland. There were three camps at Auschwitz. In June 1940, the Auschwitz concentration camp was established, when the Nazis took it over; in October 1941, Birkenau was established; and in 1942, the Monowitz concentration camp, which was a munitions factory, was established.</p><p>Thankfully, in 1947, the new Polish Government decided to create the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Everyone who has been to Auschwitz will recognise that that was an important decision and an important landmark in teaching people about the history of that location. Auschwitz receives about 500,000 visitors every year and it is free to enter, which is vital, because it ensures that more people have the opportunity to see for themselves the atrocities that happened.</p><p>As I mentioned a moment ago, I have been to Auschwitz and also the Birkenau camp. The strangest thing for me was walking through the gates under the sign \"Arbeit macht frei\". The first accent that I heard was a German accent. It did not freak me out, but I was a wee bit taken aback, then within half a second I was delighted it was a <place-holder colnum=\"9497\"/> German accent. Some German kids were there to learn about the atrocities that happened.</p><p>We have already heard this evening about the atrocities, and I will not repeat what has been said, but I am sure that members who have visited Auschwitz-Birkenau will agree with what I am about to say. The first thing that people notice when they walk about the two camps is the silence, and the second thing that they notice is the terrible atmosphere. Cathy Jamieson mentioned people who swagger as they go in and are in tears when they are there&#8212;I fully agree with that observation.</p><p>The worst part of the visit for me was the gas chamber&#8212;going into it and seeing how people died in such a cruel and callous way. I do not think that anyone could forgive the Nazis for what they did there.</p><p>I encourage people to go to Auschwitz, Dachau or any of the other camps that still exist. It is important that not only this generation but future generations learn about what happened in the past and about how cruel and callous the human race can be when people have total control over others. Everyone in Europe should go there. I welcome the money that the United Kingdom provided earlier this year.

On behalf of all who have seen <place-holder colnum=\"9291\"/> loved ones succumb to the traumatic lifestyle associated with drugs, I also thank the Government for promoting its strategy.</p><p>As the minister has pointed out, 421 people in Scotland lost their lives to drugs in 2006. That number is not only worrying but a sad reflection of the society in which we live. Add to that the estimated 52,000 people with drug problems, and the 46,000 children who, not through choice, are affected by parental drug use, and we have a seriously distressing situation.</p><p>In 1995, everyone was shocked at the images of 18-year-old Leah Betts in hospital, attached to a life-support machine and fighting for her life, after taking ecstasy. In 2002, her parents&#8212;Paul, an ex-police officer, and Janet, a nurse&#8212;and her younger brother undertook a tour of schools in Scotland, telling the story of the time following Leah's death. However, there are not enough members of the Betts family to go round every pupil in Scotland to warn them of the dangers of drugs. That is why a comprehensive educational programme is vital to saving lives. It should not be up to the families of drugs victims to educate our young people on the issue.</p><p>Sadly, the cost of drugs is measured not only in lives but in the size of the burden on Scotland's finances. An estimated &#163;2.6 billion a year is the cost of Scotland's drug problem. That equates to &#163;238 a week to feed a heroin addiction.</p><p>The strategy focuses on assisting drug users in their aim of living a drug-free life. As has been said throughout today's debate, we should not underestimate the immense task that those people face. Therefore, it is imperative that we support the Government's move to provide resources and support to people faced with that situation.</p><p>Before the election last year, I visited the haven project in Kilmacolm; and earlier this year, I visited the moving on project in Greenock. The projects are totally different, but their ultimate aim is to ensure that people get off drugs, thus making their lives a lot better, and making the life of the community a bit better as well.</p><p>I am delighted that we have the support of the Tories on the issue of rehabilitation; I am also delighted that Margaret Smith has said that the Lib Dems will back the Government's motion.</p><p>Some members have already spoken about methadone. Methadone does not lead to recovery for the majority of users; 90 per cent of addicts are still taking methadone after five years. However, methadone still has an important role in helping to stabilise people, as the moving on project in Greenock has shown.</p><p>If we look at the figures, we see that only 3 per cent of methadone users are completely clean <place-holder colnum=\"9292\"/> after three years, compared with 30 per cent of those treated in rehab, so the benefits of focusing on rehabilitation are obvious.</p><p>The road to recovery for drug users is difficult and must be taken in small steps.

There should be no doubt that those officers will be utilised in an effective capacity, whether they are on the beat in Greenock or Govan, Lerwick or Linlithgow or are on some other duty. I am sure that the chief constables will use the extra resources effectively.</p><p>The SNP Government may be lambasted by Labour members for many things, but it would be a cold heart that would deny the benefits of the increase in free personal care payments. The increase to &#163;149, and to &#163;67 for nursing care, will benefit more than 9,000 older people in care homes.</p><p>I have no doubt that our elderly population would be even better served if the attendance allowance were to be reinstated, so I am pleased that East Dunbartonshire Council recently voted unanimously to encourage the UK Government to reinstate payments for Scotland. That is somewhat surprising, given that the council is a Labour-Tory coalition, but perhaps the councillors' Labour colleagues in Parliament could take note: do not be afraid to contradict Gordon Brown's thoughts on the matter. That does not seem to bother the Labour leader in Scotland.</p><p>I like to think that we are all committed in our own way to creating a fairer, healthier, greener and smarter Scotland. The way in which the First Minister set out on 14 May what the SNP <place-holder colnum=\"9210\"/></p><p>Government is doing to further that cause should therefore be welcomed. Measuring the success of creating such a Scotland by introducing the Scotland performs framework is an idea that has the potential to be rolled out further. The idea of accountability appears to frighten some, but the SNP Government is content to show the people of Scotland exactly what it is doing for them.</p><p>The announcement of the Scottish university for sporting excellence, to be based at the University of Stirling, and of the annual &#163;2 million saltire innovation fund are only two examples of how the SNP is providing the basis for a healthier and smarter Scotland.</p><p>Alongside those initiatives, there will be a full and meaningful legislative programme. One piece of legislation that I will be particularly delighted to see being introduced in the coming year is the asbestos claims bill. I have campaigned on the pleural plaques issue since being elected last year. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice's bill, which will reverse the House of Lords judgment on pleural plaques, will be a massive boost to those who suffer from the condition and wish to pursue an action for damages. I have met quite a few people who suffer from pleural plaques and I have had dealings with the campaign groups. I assure members that those people are delighted that the bill will be brought forward in this Parliament.</p><p>The Scottish Prisons Commission's report is due. Henry McLeish has been reported a lot recently, speaking if not in outright support of the SNP, definitely in support of our many achievements, even though he is not yet convinced of the benefits of independence. I trust that the commission, which he leads, will give the Government a sound indication of the best way in which to deliver an effective prison system. I hope that the problems that have been caused by massive overcrowding and high rates of reoffending as a result of the lack of action by previous Administrations, including the Tories, will be addressed in the commission's findings.</p><p>The past year in the Parliament has undoubtedly been a fascinating one for the people of Scotland to watch. The electorate seem happy with the fact that a minority Government is ruling in Scotland, which means that decisions must be won on their own merits. That situation is new in the politics of Scotland and the UK. It is a fresh approach, with which SNP members of the Scottish Parliament are content.

While the bill covers many aspects of the current and prospective justice systems, I want to start with an issue that has been on all our minds over the past week: independence&#8212;however not the national question, but the independence of the judiciary, which has the potential to be contentious.</p><p>The recent World's End pub murder trial has been cited as evidence for having more extensive judicial independence. Indeed, the Law Society of Scotland and the Society of Solicitor Advocates have gone on record to state that they are in favour of more extensive judicial independence. It is widely acknowledged, too, that in order for our judiciary to gain a higher state of independence, an appropriate management structure must be put in place.</p><p>Part 1 of the bill deals with judicial independence. Its provisions will create for the first time in Scotland a statutory statement of judicial independence. While it is widely thought in court circles that there is&#8212;or should be&#8212;judicial independence, stating it in statutory form is surely more favourable than having an informal arrangement. In keeping with the fair and democratic practices to which we have become accustomed, courts should have as much judicial independence as possible. I am pleased, therefore, that the Lord President, Lord Hamilton, has stated that he strongly supports part 1.</p><p>The Justice Committee asked the Government in our stage 1 report to reassess whether the judicial independence section of the bill is too narrowly drawn. In his response, the cabinet secretary agreed to consider that and lodge an amendment at stage 2, which I am sure will be welcomed.</p><p>The bill addresses the responsibilities of various affiliated parties, including ministers, the Lord President and the Lord Advocate. The current situation places the Lord Advocate in a position of responsibility, alongside ministers, for the organisation of the supreme courts. However, it is not unreasonable for the Lord President to gain statutory responsibility for administrative activities in the current court structure, which the bill will implement&#8212;indeed, the Lord President and his colleagues currently undertake many of those activities. I concur with the view that those responsibilities should come under a statutory agreement, in order to create clear and official boundaries for all concerned in the running of the court services.</p><p>The Justice Committee raised concerns about committing more judicial time to administrative activities, therefore I welcome the cabinet secretary's decision to request an independent review by Douglas Osler of the measures that deal <place-holder colnum=\"8566\"/> with administrative activities. I look forward to reading the outcome of the review and to our making an informed decision on the issue at stage 2.</p><p>A further area of interest is the Justice Committee's recommendation that judicial training should be mandatory. There was debate about that, to which Paul Martin alluded. I am sure that the issue will be raised again in the debate. The Justice Committee's report is clear that the Lord President should have responsibility for making and maintaining training arrangements for judicial office-holders. The committee also recommended that such training should be mandatory, to improve confidence in the judiciary. The cabinet secretary's response to the committee's report says that all training should be up to the Lord President. I am sure that we will discuss that during stages 2 and 3.</p><p>My final point is about statistical data in the Scottish Court Service. I recently had an enlightening meeting with representatives of Children 1<sup>st</sup>, at which we discussed the lack of statistical data collected by the Scottish Court Service about children. I will lodge questions later today about that, so I do not expect an immediate reply. In this technological age, statistics are vital to inform future decisions. I am therefore sure that such evidence would enable the Scottish Court Service to plan with greater confidence.</p><p>I am pleased to support the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13658477", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I concur with earlier comments about the work of the Justice Committee clerks and their assistants during the evidence sessions on the bill.

In my capacity as deputy convener of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on visual impairment, I have spoken with the organisation at length. I was also in contact with RNIB Scotland quite a few times in my previous capacity, before being elected to Parliament.</p><p>The right to read campaign has rightly gained support from all quarters, and I was privileged to chair, on behalf of RNIB Scotland, a successful fringe meeting on the campaign at the recent Scottish National Party spring conference. George McLaughlin was one of the guest speakers at that meeting, and I must agree with what Alison McInnes said. George is a very impressive and intelligent young man.</p><p>I was delighted that the Minister for Schools and Skills was able to attend that fringe meeting and answer people's questions about RNIB Scotland's campaign. I was also delighted that she agreed to meet RNIB Scotland to discuss the campaign and other relevant issues further.</p><p>As we have heard, the campaign seeks to create a national educational transcription service to enable blind and partially sighted children to have access to the learning aids that they require. Children can find school days tough enough without being at a distinct disadvantage due to a lack of adequate materials. That is especially true for someone with a disability.</p><p>Research by RNIB Scotland shows that almost 1,400 pupils across Scotland require specialist learning materials. Research also shows some discrepancies among local authorities, which are responsible for the provision of such materials. As can be expected, some areas of the country are better equipped than others. RNIB Scotland has stated that the current system lacks a cohesive national strategy and that many of the materials used in schools around Scotland could be introduced in others. Although local authorities should still be encouraged to take responsibility for provision and distribution in their area, a centralised system would still be appropriate. I therefore support any initiative to introduce a centralised system for use throughout the country, to enable blind and partially sighted children to have access to electronic copies of the textbooks that they require.</p><p>One of the key issues that RNIB Scotland has highlighted to me is that, although reformatted <place-holder colnum=\"8522\"/> textbooks are occasionally available, the time delay in getting them is detrimental to the people who are in need of such assistance. As suggested by RNIB Scotland, if access to textbooks was delayed for sighted children, the issue would be highlighted more prominently.</p><p>RNIB Scotland also states that publishers have already shown interest in supporting such an initiative. That news should be welcomed. Indeed, at last summer's Edinburgh book festival, Robert Brown and I attended the launch of a multi-format text book.</p><p>The foundations of this positive move are definitely in place: specialists and publishers are on board and there is widespread public support. I have no doubt that we can provide a national education transcription service and that, with the correct input from organisations such as RNIB Scotland and experienced individuals, we are not too far away from implementing it across Scotland.</p><p>More than 75 per cent of blind and partially sighted adults in Scotland are unemployed, often because of a lack of skills and training. That can obviously be traced back to the lack of learning materials. We must uphold the fact that education is a right not a privilege, no matter whether a person is fully sighted or otherwise.</p><p>This debate has been worth while and important, and I am sure that there will continue to be cross-party support on the issue.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13649096", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Right to Read Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Alison McInnes for bringing this important members' business debate to the Parliament, and I congratulate her on securing what is her first members' business debate.

I thank Bill Aitken. More important, I thank the committee staff, who have been extremely helpful, particularly to new members of the committee.</p><p>As a member of the Justice Committee, I am grateful for this opportunity to talk about the recommendations in our report. The witnesses from whom we heard and the submissions that we received made for some not-so-light reading. That was unfortunate, but it demonstrated the strength of feeling about policing in Scotland. As we compiled the report we had a responsibility to consider all the views that we heard. I hope that the debate does the issue justice&#8212;pardon the pun.</p><p>During this parliamentary session and in this debate, much has been made of police numbers. However, we are debating a report about the effective use of police resources. We should not get hung up on the numbers; we should consider what is done with the resources that police authorities have. Every Government department can always use more resources, irrespective of the parliamentary session that we are in. However, the budget is finite and departments must act with the resources that they are given. The committee report welcomed the Government's commitment to provide sufficient funds to recruit 500 additional officers and I welcome the Cabinet Secretary for Justice's confirmation that the Government's budget will provide for the much-talked-about 1,000 additional officers.</p><p>There is no doubt that we face a tough challenge, as a result of inherited problems with police numbers. High retirement figures and the low level of planned recruitment mean that we must work harder to keep Scotland safe. It is clear that the Government relishes the challenge and is not only managing to meet the manifesto pledge on the recruitment of 1,000 more officers, but is going beyond that. The additional officers will be crucial to the future of policing in Scotland and will be essential to the smooth operation of forces throughout the country. The cabinet secretary told us that 150 police recruits passed through Tulliallan before the end of the previous financial year, under the Scottish National Party Government.</p><p>The SPF, in its response to the committee report, said that the term \"community policing\" began to be used in Scotland in the 1970s. Community policing is an issue of great interest not only to the committee and the Parliament, but to wider Scotland. I am delighted that the <place-holder colnum=\"7575\"/> committee will look into community policing in the next stage of its inquiry. From its response, I am aware that the SPF thinks that it will be \"almost impossible\" to provide a definition of community policing.</p><p>Given that many people are unsure about the meaning of the term \"community policing\", they are therefore unsure about the workings of the system. The committee picked up on that point, as is evident in our report. The recommendation that a clear definition of community policing should be created as a matter of priority should be welcomed. Understandably, having one approach to community policing throughout Scotland may not be ideal, but that can be overcome. Input from every force will be necessary and, if we are to get the best out of the system, co-operation from all will be required.</p><p>That said, I return to my earlier point on the SPF's response that it may be \"almost impossible\" to provide a definition of community policing. I am therefore heartened by the cabinet secretary's response to the recommendation. Work has begun on attempting to define community policing. A sub-group of the additional capacity programme board is looking into the issue, and I look forward to reading its report. As the cabinet secretary pointed out, we must ensure that recommendations on measuring the policing of communities are reflected in the Scottish policing performance framework. I trust that he will ensure that that will happen.</p><p>In order for that to happen, a comprehensive review of police roles and responsibilities must be undertaken. The committee report suggests that an independent review of the roles and responsibilities of the police should be undertaken, and due consideration should be given to that finding. I was astounded to hear that no review had been made of the role and responsibilities of the police for more than 40 years. As a new member of the Scottish Parliament, I could not get over that. I thought that such reviews were undertaken fairly regularly&#8212;after all, times change and people and situations move on. It therefore interests me that the cabinet secretary, in his response to the report, said that the Government is considering the recommendation. I will watch with interest to see the steps that are taken on the recommendation.</p><p>The role of community wardens is an interesting issue, to say the least, partly because of the lack of clarity about the work that they undertake. For example, what powers do community wardens have and how highly are they trained? The committee backed the community warden scheme. Wherever they are deployed, community wardens appear to make a positive difference. That is to be welcomed.<place-holder colnum=\"7576\"/></p><p>The issues surrounding policing are never to be taken lightly.

During the parliamentary debate on HDC a couple of weeks ago, I said that there was no logic to not extending the scheme and that proposing a sunset clause was tantamount to faffing around. I accept that on occasions sunset clauses have a legitimate place, but given that the cabinet secretary has offered a widespread review&#8212;not a repeal&#8212;of HDC when Addiewell prison opens, a sunset clause is not relevant in this instance. I could have considered a sunset clause if there had been no other offer on the table.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has outlined the strict guidelines around the extension of HDC and has given details of measures to allow prisoners to make a safe transition back to society, which include statutory exclusions, preventing certain categories of offenders, such as sex offenders, from being released on HDC, and a robust risk assessment process, which is undertaken by the SPS and takes into account a prisoner's previous history of violence, for example.<place-holder colnum=\"7390\"/></p><p>The primary aim of HDC was to ease the reintegration of prisoners into the community, while restricting their movements, which creates a better environment for all concerned.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary pointed out during the previous debate on HDC, prisoner numbers in Scotland have reached record levels. Prisons are operating over capacity by about 1,000 places. What kind of environment is that for prisoners and prison staff? It has been established that the situation is due in no small part to years of neglect by the Tories and a lack of investment by the previous Administration.</p><p>The Labour Party is on record as saying in the Justice Committee that it is not against HDC per se. I would not expect Labour to oppose HDC, given that it was part of the previous Administration, which introduced the scheme. I am sure that Labour and Lib Dem members of the previous Executive viewed HDC as an important part of justice policy.</p><p>I am also sure that Labour members are aware that when HDC was introduced by the United Kingdom Parliament in 1999 the system was intended for prisoners who were serving sentences of between three months and four years. HDC was then brought in for up to two months at the end of a sentence. Since then, HDC has been extended twice: first in 2002, when presumptive HDC was introduced for prisoners who were serving sentences of between three and 12 months; and secondly in July 2003, when the maximum curfew was increased to 135 days. I would not suggest that Labour members are opposing the SNP Government's plans for the sake of it, but they know that Labour ministers in London have extended HDC&#8212;and that that has happened without mention of sunset clauses.</p><p>In a recent interview with Jack Straw it was said that the prisons estate in England and Wales is only 70 places short of capacity and emergency measures might have to be taken. Who knows what the future will bring on HDC in England and Wales? In Scotland we have an opportunity to help prison officers and to help prisoners to reintegrate into the community. It is in everyone's interests that prisoners not only do their time but have a chance to be rehabilitated. I am sure that all members&#8212;even the Tories&#8212;agree on that.</p><p>There is no doubt that HDC should be extended.

I welcomed that suggestion, as did other people, but the board rejected it and still intends to remove vital services from the IRH and the Vale of Leven hospital. Two important points arise from that experience: the strength and status of independent scrutiny panels; and the continuing lack of public confidence in health boards. Ross Finnie talked about that in detail.</p><p>I agree with Ian McKee that the provision of evidence in consultations is vital. The public might not always agree with the outcome, but it will help if people can be taken along in the process. Independent scrutiny panels will provide a useful mechanism for holding health boards and the Government of the day to account. I hope that public confidence in health boards will improve as a result. If the public have no confidence in boards or other public service providers, we have major problems. It is imperative that the Government of the day get things right. I know from my experience in Inverclyde that public confidence is at a low ebb.</p><p>Independent scrutiny panels must fully consider comparative models in other health board areas. When the independent scrutiny panel considered NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's proposals for maternity services, I put forward information about NHS Tayside and the CMUs in Montrose and Arbroath. The information had not been brought to the panel's attention until then, so it was important that it was provided.</p><p>I agree with the presumption against centralisation. Services should remain as local as possible, provided that they are safe and viable. I am sure that the establishment of independent scrutiny panels will go some way towards ensuring that that happens.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400232", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Independent Scrutiny"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate and the introduction of independent scrutiny panels.

There is no doubt that the Commonwealth games will benefit Scotland as a whole. I am sure that a positive effect will be felt in the West of Scotland region. I welcome the games to Scotland, and I am certain that the Scottish people will be model hosts. However, there are obvious concerns in staging a world-class event.</p><p>The bill contributes towards the Scottish Government's aim of making the games safe and enjoyable for all. In turn, the games will create a long-lasting legacy for Glasgow and Scotland. In debating the bill, we have the opportunity to ensure that Scotland gets the most out of hosting the games. However, some fears have been expressed that the loss of lottery funding to the London Olympics may adversely affect the legacy of the Commonwealth games. The escalating cost of the London Olympics means that Scotland could lose out on &#163;150 million of lottery funding over the next four years.</p><p>During the recess, a week or so ago, I was down south visiting some of my family. I spoke to a man who stays on the outskirts of London and works in the City of London. His take on the London Olympics was that they will benefit only the people of the east end of London, not people in London more generally, and certainly not people north of the Watford gap.</p><p>I return to the Commonwealth games. The Parliament has achieved cross-party support for the Scottish Government making a claim for more lottery funding for the games' legacy. The Government's generous agreement to provide 80 per cent of the net costs, with Glasgow City Council meeting the remainder, should be welcomed. That said, the agreement should not detract from the raw deal that we are getting in comparison with the funding for the London Olympics.</p><p>The fact that the London Olympics are unlikely to have much impact north of Watford&#8212;never mind in Scotland&#8212;proves that the SNP Government got it right in launching a public consultation on the Commonwealth games. The consultation will engage all those who will be involved in the games, from the ground up. Their views will be important in getting the games right, so that a legacy is created not only for Glasgow but for the whole of Scotland. With the views of those people duly taken into consideration, the bill should be allowed to proceed in line with the appropriate actions. The bill should also act as a guide for the Commonwealth games organisers and the public, so that they can enjoy the games and take pride in their country's hosting them.</p><p>I welcome the guidelines on ticket touting. The issue is not new, but it does catch people out unwittingly. I was fortunate to get a ticket for the <place-holder colnum=\"6355\"/> Scotland v Norway game in France in the 1998 world cup. What got my goat on the train journey to Bordeaux was the touts who were wandering up and down the train trying to sell tickets to genuine fans. My take on touts is that they are parasites on genuine fans, whether of the sporting or musical variety.</p><p>When someone is trying to obtain tickets for a large event, it is all too easy to become immersed in the sense of occasion. The bill addresses the need for the sale of tickets to be regulated. Cracking down on ticket touts was a key factor in the success of Glasgow's bid to host the games. Indeed, the host city's contract sets out that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the unauthorised sale of tickets should not be allowed\".</p><p>That view should gain wide support in the chamber. From the speeches that I have heard, that seems to be the case. I hope that the great number of people who will go to the games will not be adversely affected by ticket touting. As I said, ticket touting is not new; it appears during every major sporting or musical event. There is the potential for us to use the consultation findings to consider future ticket touting regulations.</p><p>The extensive infrastructure work that is to be undertaken for the games in Glasgow is to be commended. That infrastructure will not only create short-term sustainability for the city, it will be part of the games' legacy. During another vacation, in the summer of 2005, I went to Australia for three and a half weeks. I was based in Melbourne. The sporting legacy that that city gained from hosting the Olympics a few decades ago and from the Commonwealth games, which the city was about to host in 2006, was fantastic. The facilities that I saw were world class. Any country that hosts a major sporting event should consider that model.</p><p>As well as the sporting facilities, the legacy of the Glasgow games will have other aspects. I hope that the athletes village in the city and other contributions to the regeneration of the Clyde area will work towards the common legacy goal. Although efforts will be concentrated in Glasgow, the west of Scotland should benefit from the increase in trade and tourism that the Commonwealth games will attract. The Clyde will be the focus for many people. On lovely summer days&#8212;when we get them&#8212;trips on the Waverley down to Arran are first class.</p><p>I hope that, through implementing the bill, Glasgow and Scotland host an extremely successful Commonwealth games for the home and visiting athletes and spectators. Let us hope that we provide an atmosphere that befits a winning nation and encourages current Scottish athletes and those of the future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399029", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will add my thoughts and sentiments to those that   have been expressed thus far.

Following the cabinet secretary's announcement, I wrote to the health board to ask it specifically about traffic studies at the IRH, Vale of Leven hospital and the RAH in Paisley. One of my SNP colleagues, Councillor Kenny MacLaren from Paisley, had also written to the health board specifically about the RAH. The response is wonderful&#8212;it says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"No specific traffic study has been carried out at the RAH ...

When will the board get the message that parking charges are not needed at the IRH, the Vale of Leven hospital or the RAH?

I lodged a petition with the Public Petitions Committee during the previous session, and I had the privilege of attending my first meeting of any committee when I gave evidence to it. The petition was PE1026, and I know that it was discussed again at the Public Petitions Committee meeting on 23 October 2007.</p><p>On that matter, the committee convener Frank McAveety highlighted a couple of points that I would like to respond to, although unfortunately he is not present to hear it. First, yes&#8212;where am I now? Secondly, I am indeed a true believer. Over the years I have been to see some terrible football matches involving Scotland. I am sure that Frank McAveety will agree that it is good to see the national team do so well and the players play once again for the jersey&#8212;which I know Mr McAveety does when he plays for the parliamentary football team.</p><p>I was delighted that my petition was passed to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission, and I am sure that it will take cognisance of the motion that we debate today.</p><p>I find it ridiculous that there is no guarantee that every Scotland match will be broadcast live, or even that there will be a highlights package for it. When I gave evidence to the Public Petitions Committee on 17 January 2007, I said that many people in Scotland do not have Sky TV, do not&#8212;for various reasons&#8212;want to go to a pub or cannot go to a pub because of a disability. Indeed, it might be argued, particularly in view of the last point, that the relevant bodies&#8212;the DCMS, the SFA and the BBC&#8212;are involved in some kind of social exclusion. That might sound like an attack on the UK Government, but it is not. I am simply highlighting the fact that the DCMS does not fully <place-holder colnum=\"4855\"/> appreciate the cultural and sporting significance of football to Scotland.</p><p>Moreover, I am not suggesting for one minute that there is one rule for the English national team and another for Scotland. This is an area where the BBC must demonstrate its sense of responsibility. If it is prepared to spend hundreds of millions of pounds from its &#163;3-plus billion budget to cover the progress of the English national team, that is fine, but it should also consider the Scottish national team's importance to the Scottish public.</p><p>I also accept that, as the major footballing power in Scotland, the SFA needs to get the best deal possible to ensure that money is invested in the grass roots of the game&#8212;as well as used to get us a new manager. I am sure that the association fights hard to secure the best deal, but the question is whether it could try harder.</p><p>I lodged my petition because in the recent Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, Scotland's match against Lithuania was shown neither live nor in a highlights package. On the other hand, Northern Ireland's match was shown live on BBC Northern Ireland, Wales's match was shown live on BBC Wales and England's match was shown live on BBC1. As a licence fee payer, I was somewhat annoyed by the situation and felt that the BBC, as the public sector broadcaster, had a duty to supply relevant programmes to relevant parts of the current UK.</p><p>It will come as no surprise, therefore, that I fully agree with Keith Brown's motion and I look forward to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission's consideration of this issue and, I am sure, many others. I also agree that powers over broadcasting should be given to the Scottish Parliament to ensure that the Scottish Government of the day can act not only to safeguard the industry in Scotland but to create opportunities in it.

I also welcome the Scottish Government's creation of the serious organised crime task force.</p><p>As each member who has spoken thus far has said, organised crime has a daily impact on Scottish communities and individuals. It has a detrimental effect on Scottish life and our business community. The co-ordination of specialist expertise, skills and knowledge in the task force will help to reduce the amount of organised crime on our streets and send out a message that tackling serious organised crime is a priority for the Government.</p><p>I am confident that the task force will complement the work of the Serious Organised Crime Agency and address specific Scottish considerations and problems that are distinct to our communities. Scotland has a unique legal system and policing culture and needs a dedicated <place-holder colnum=\"4824\"/> task force to work alongside the SOCA. The Scottish Government is taking steps to ensure the safety of its individuals and communities. In that respect, the task force should be welcomed.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary, Pauline McNeill and Sandra White have said, one of the primary industries that criminal gangs exploit is the private hire taxi trade. Organised crime can prosper only if it has a respectable business as a front for criminal behaviour. Taxi companies are ideal fronts for criminal activity, as they can be presented as legitimate businesses. Concerns exist that the regulations that govern the licensing of private hire vehicles are too lenient and allow criminals to infiltrate the business as a cover for criminal activity and money laundering. We should make a distinction between private hire taxi firms and the black hackney cabs. The black cab or public hire taxi trade is regulated tightly by the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, but the private hire trade is not subject to those stringent regulations. We therefore need to tighten the regulations on the private hire trade.</p><p>Under the current regulatory regime, an individual can obtain a licence to run a private hire vehicle with relative ease. Applications can be made to the local authority on behalf of an individual or company, with a small application fee of about &#163;200. The local authority then forwards the application to the police, who perform a background check for criminal activity. Provided that the police check does not reveal any such activity, the local authority will then grant the licence, following a safety check of the vehicle, which costs only &#163;100. In short, for a relatively small amount of money, a criminal business can prosper easily. On passing the aforementioned safety check, the licence will be granted and thereafter the vehicle will be subject only to an ordinary MOT test, with no maximum age limit. Compare that to the regulation of the black cab industry, in which two thorough safety checks of vehicles are often required per year. The stricter regulations in the public hire industry make it significantly more difficult for criminals to infiltrate the industry, so the private hire industry must follow suit.</p><p>It is widely known that there is no limit on the number of private hire licences that councils can give out. The local authorities' inability to limit the number of private hire licences makes it difficult to control entry to the profession and thus easier for organised crime to operate on Scotland's streets. The situation damages the good name of legitimate and hard-working taxi firms and drivers throughout the county, who are in the majority. With the black cab industry, the 1982 act gives local authorities the power to limit the number of public hire taxi licences that are available annually. The number is based on an in-depth survey of <place-holder colnum=\"4825\"/> demand in the area and ensures that enough taxis are available to provide good customer service while allowing fair competition among local businesses. Importantly, the system makes it significantly more difficult for criminals to enter the trade.</p><p>The current lax regulatory regime for the private hire trade has made that part of the industry an open target for criminal gangs. It should be stressed that the fault does not lie with local authorities or the police, as they do not have the power to fight that lax regime. Legislation to allow local authorities to limit the number of private hire licences would offer protection to the taxi industry from criminal gangs and would control entry into the profession. Organised crime affects the lives of many hard-working and honest Scottish individuals and their families, so we need to crack down on it. It is apparent that more stringent regulations would be the first step in tackling the problems that taxi companies face. Too many criminal gangs use apparently legitimate businesses such as taxi companies as fronts for illegal activity. Steps should be taken to put them out of business and remove them from Scotland's streets.</p><p>I support fully the role of the newly established serious organised crime task force in bringing together all the major agencies and in spearheading a renewed drive and commitment to tackle such crime in Scotland. I ask those agencies to make the regulatory regime of the private hire trade a priority area on which action must be taken. I back the motion in the name of the cabinet secretary.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395119", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious Organised Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate.

Regrettably, the Inverclyde population is receiving a double whammy&#8212;the vast cost implications of PPP and the loss of football pitches to the local community.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Lib Dems are not alone in that respect. Four years ago, Renfrewshire Council, which was then Labour run, commissioned a report on the Apex centre in Paisley and was told that the centre needed &#163;400,000-worth of urgent repairs. The council refused to invest in the centre, which is now so dilapidated that repairing it would cost &#163;1 million. It is therefore now recommended that the centre should be closed. That is a prime example of Labour investment in community and sporting facilities. The most important obstacle to participation levels in sport in Scotland is a lack of quality facilities. It is well understood that our climate is not akin to that of Australia, which means that it may be difficult for us to encourage some outdoor activities. That emphasises the need for top-notch facilities.</p><p>The new generation of artificial grass offers an ideal remedy to the problems of traditional pitches, which are expensive and time-consuming to maintain. Such pitches have restricted use, and <place-holder colnum=\"4381\"/> tend to be less playable in the winter, particularly in the west of Scotland. Statistically, natural grass pitches can be used for 150 to 200 hours a year.

As all members will testify, the issue is rather technical. I am sure that, as a consequence, this debate will be somewhat tamer than this morning's debate on the Scottish constitutional issue.</p><p>There are various issues in summary justice reform that will be discussed, some of which have been highlighted already. I will focus my attention on the proceedings of summary justice.</p><p>According to the McInnes report, which was published in 2003, the percentage of cases that were disposed within 10 weeks of the date of the offence was a mere 6 per cent. Inversely, 98 per cent of cases were completed within 100 weeks. Some 500 work days were used to dispose of those cases. Simply put, a system that fails to dispose of more than half of all cases within six months of the date of the offence cannot truly be considered to be summary justice. Summary trials are generally shorter and much less likely to take place over more than a day. That means that the proportion of summary trials in which an accused will have the opportunity to abscond part way through the trial will be smaller than is the case in relation to solemn trials.</p><p>That is why, when we are considering the provision of summary justice, a main focus of concern should be the more efficient and effective delivery of that justice. Improving the speed at which summary justice operates is likely to deliver significant benefits to the victims and witnesses in at least two ways: earlier access to justice; and a reduction in wasted court appearances.</p><p>Summary justice not only benefits the victims and witnesses; it benefits the court system. Swifter judicial action is also likely to contribute to reducing reoffending and deterring criminals who might have benefited from the drawn-out judicial process. Certainly, there is little doubt that delays <place-holder colnum=\"4240\"/> in the system have allowed some offenders to believe that there is little to no effective sanction against their behaviour. On the other hand, with an increased efficiency in summary justice, disposals can be more appropriately tailored to fit the offending behaviour in a shorter timescale after the offence has been committed.</p><p>It has been suggested that a statutory time limit should be instituted for summary cases. Such an idea has many positive aspects. Setting a time limit of some months from when a person is charged with an offence within which the case must be brought to trial or dropped could be very effective at improving the speed of summary justice. Sub-targets could be presented within the overall target that relate to individual facets of the system, such as the time that is taken by the police to report cases to the procurator fiscal; the time that is taken by the procurator fiscal to get cases ready for court; and the ability of the court to accept such cases when they are ready. That would institute an idea of competition that would ideally propel each affected body to effectively and efficiently accomplish its course of action.</p><p>Although time limits could of course be extended for unique cases that demanded an extension, the negative aspects of the idea of time limits are quite obvious. The principal beneficiaries of a statutory time limit would be neither the victim nor the witnesses. It would be the accused person who managed to delay their case by taking advantage of systemic delays to have the case dropped. There would be widespread, and very justified, public concern if large numbers of cases fell because a time barrier had been passed.</p><p>There are several simple solutions to the delays in summary justice. Primarily, there should be greater and more effective communication between all levels of the judicial process. As the number of judges is limited, certain administrative proceedings could be more efficient if a judge's presence were not necessary. If a clerk were allowed to fix a date for trial in response to a written plea of not guilty, that would immediately lighten the load for the judges. To speed up the sentencing procedures for a convicted offender, the relevance of previous convictions could be taken into account to properly penalise the person in question.</p><p>To bring about further efficiency, a trial could be permitted to proceed in the absence of the accused, provided that the court was satisfied that the accused had been properly cited to appear and considered it to be in the interests of justice to proceed. Given that roughly 8 per cent of accused fail to appear on the day of their summary trial, which means that more than 4,000 hearings result in a warrant for the arrest of the accused, allowing <place-holder colnum=\"4241\"/> the court to proceed in absence would dramatically hasten summary trials.</p><p>It is intended to provide the courts with more extensive powers when a witness fails to appear for a court hearing, such as the power to release the witness on bail when they have been apprehended following a failure to appear. That provision, which was inserted into solemn procedure legislation in the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 by the 2007 act, would also assist in speeding up summary trials.</p><p>The overload of appeals in the High Court is increasingly a factor in preventing efficient summary justice. The High Court is under a severe burden from dealing with appeals. Given that all the appeals are dealt with at the High Court, the process becomes slower. The McInnes committee recommended that there could be a separate court to deal solely with summary justice appeals. That was not in the 2007 act and so has not been established&#8212;it might be something to be considered at some point in the future.</p><p>To adequately provide justice, the summary justice system should be fair to victims, witnesses and accused; effective in deterring, punishing and helping to rehabilitate offenders by taking action against an offender as quickly as possible, which maintains a link between the crime and consequence in the offender's mind; and, of course, efficient in the use of time and resources by ensuring that the flow of information between those involved in the system is streamlined. Considering the elements that have been put forward today and following those three principles will drastically facilitate a better summary justice system.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394129", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Summary Justice Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Summary justice reform is a matter of great significance to the running of an efficient judicial system, as we have heard, so it is important that the Parliament makes progress on it.

The focus on large cities and dense urban areas in England does not really apply to Scotland's geography and small-town communities, as has been highlighted by the cabinet secretary this morning. For example, England has a mass of legal services in Temple Bar in the west of London. That accumulation works well for the 7 million people in the London area, but what about the other 45 million people in the rest of that country?</p><p>Having said that, restraining legal firms would be counterproductive when we consider expansive legal services and their positive impact on the economy. Our challenge is to encourage the large firms in Scotland while ensuring that individuals who require legal services are not ignored. That is why I am happy that the Scottish Government will continue to work with the industry to develop a distinctly Scottish regulatory approach that recognises specific Scottish needs, while balancing the need for small communities to have access to justice and while enabling large firms to compete at the international level, much as the Royal Bank of Scotland Group is currently doing. Allowing the free market to have complete control of the legal services market would be devastating <place-holder colnum=\"3429\"/> to many organisations and individuals in our communities.</p><p>Access to justice means ensuring that those who live in Scotland can expect fair and equal access to independent legal advice, regardless of their ability to pay and their location. As the debate about centralising larger firms persists, we must always keep in mind what access to justice means.</p><p>Several organisations currently provide legal advice or services to individuals who seek assistance. Although citizens advice bureaux, welfare rights advisers and community law centres provide services and assistance, many Scots still miss out. The reasons why people do not use those organisations and services vary, but people's lack of exposure to them certainly persists. People may often be unaware of the services that are available to them until it is too late.</p><p>Ignorance of the organisations and services can, unfortunately, be at the root of many very sad stories. Just the other day, I dealt with a constituent who was about to be evicted from their home. Many problems surround the eviction, some of which appear to relate to the housing association. Although various reasons lie behind the impending eviction, one burning question remains: what would have been the situation had my constituent received accurate information and assistance much earlier in the process? Without even considering all the specifics, it is obvious that the situation would probably not be the same as it currently is. It is therefore extremely important that the current free legal services unit of the Faculty of Advocates&#8212;which provides free advice and representation through Citizens Advice Scotland&#8212;is widely known about, but that is not the case. Information simply was not available for my constituent.</p><p>I have never been about to be evicted from a property that I stayed in. I am sure that everyone in the chamber agrees that no one should have to endure that situation. If assistance is available, people should have the opportunity to receive proper legal advice, so that evictions can be prevented.</p><p>Let us assume that the constituent was a council tenant and had obtained early legal assistance from a community law centre, which had received funding from the local authority. The local authority would then be paying for the defence of the tenant who was threatened with eviction, while at the same time trying to evict that tenant. If such a case were to reach the courts, how would the local authority sort out the paradox?

However, we need to focus on raising awareness of such organisations. Helpful organisations are effectively stripped of their power to assist the public when individuals do not know that information and support exists.

In my submission to the review, I raised various issues. Some of them have been touched on, but I will go over them. Not every hospital car park is overflowing. Anyone who has been to a hospital for treatment or for a visit at whatever time of day will have seen that.</p><p>If a hospital is close to a housing estate or housing scheme, the people who stay there may suffer if people park in the streets outside their homes.</p><p>Deprivation is another issue. Not everyone can afford to pay to use a hospital car park.</p><p>At times, public transport to hospitals is lacking. Not every hospital is beside a train station. Buses go to hospitals, but not everyone wants to take a bus.</p><p>Not every hospital is in an easily accessed location&#8212;we have only to consider the example of the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley. For someone from Inverclyde, that hospital is difficult to access.</p><p>The parking charges are not proportionate. In my submission, I considered the figures. <place-holder colnum=\"3397\"/></p><p>Somebody who earns less than &#163;10,000 pays the same proportion of their wages as someone who earns &#163;80,000&#8212;0.006 per cent. In the middle band of charges, someone who earns &#163;12,000 pays 0.025 per cent of their wages, but someone who earns &#163;29,000, which is still in the middle band, pays 0.0165 per cent of their wages. I do not agree with charging at all, but the banding structure is also wrong.</p><p>Another aspect, as Patricia Ferguson highlighted, is safety and unsocial hours.

For my first members' business debate, I had hoped to speak about an issue of less importance and to be a touch more light-hearted. Unfortunately, that is not the case, but I am pleased that so many members from different parties are present.</p><p>I particularly welcome the people from Clydeside Action on Asbestos and Frank Maguire from Thompsons Solicitors who are in the public gallery to watch the debate. Today has been a busy day for everyone who is involved in the asbestos-related campaigns, and I hope that a positive outcome for sufferers of pleural plaques can be found soon.</p><p>I lodged my motion for two reasons. The first is to condemn the recent decision by the House of Lords to overturn the compensation that has been available to people with pleural plaques. The other is to show support to those with asbestos-related diseases, such as pleural plaques, as well as to organisations such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos, which campaigns on their behalf.</p><p>Pleural plaques are a scarring of the lung tissue. They are an indicator that exposure to asbestos has occurred in the past. A person who suffers from pleural plaques will probably require regular check-ups and chest scans throughout their lives. Although the problem might not always affect someone's lung function, it is recognised as damage that has been done to their body. The main concern of those with pleural plaques is that it highlights the fact that they have inhaled asbestos fibres and that they might go on to <place-holder colnum=\"3131\"/> develop a more debilitating or even fatal asbestos-related disease, such as asbestosis or the cancer mesothelioma. The House of Lords decision said that the condition of pleural plaques does not lead to other asbestos-related illnesses. However, I am sure that the House of Lords has been wrong before.</p><p>Those with pleural plaques obviously suffer a great deal of stress and anxiety, which is often heightened by their knowledge of former workmates and family members who have died from various asbestos-related illnesses. Each year in the United Kingdom, more than 3,000 people die because of an asbestos-related disease, and the number is predicted to rise to 10,000 by 2020.</p><p>For the past 30 years or so, people with pleural plaques have been able to claim compensation from the employers who exposed them to asbestos. In many cases where the employers are no longer in business, it is those companies' insurance firms that are taken to court for compensation claims. However, that process tends to be neither simple nor straightforward. It can take many months or even years before a settlement is made.</p><p>It is not only those who have worked in shipyards who have been affected by asbestos illnesses. People who have worked in construction or many other sectors of the economy were also exposed to asbestos, often recklessly, by their employers. They knew of the dangers of asbestos, but either did not inform their workers of the danger or did not provide adequate protection for them. Furthermore, it is not just the individuals who have worked with asbestos who have contracted asbestos-related diseases such as pleural plaques. Often, their families have come into contact with asbestos fibres, and they, too, have developed such conditions. Clydeside Action on Asbestos has numerous cases of wives and children of workers, who would shake the asbestos dust from their husbands' or fathers' overalls prior to washing them. They later developed asbestos-related diseases themselves.</p><p>Until recently, those with pleural plaques had the right to sue their former employers for compensation. That right was not given automatically, however. Each case had to be heard in court and the employers' liability in exposing their workers to asbestos had to be proven before any compensation was granted. That would take time, especially considering that the symptoms of asbestos-related diseases can take many years to develop&#8212;often 30, 40 or more years.</p><p>The decision by the law lords on 17 October now stops that. There was a question whether the ruling would apply in Scotland, but the ruling by Lord Uist on 23 October followed the law lords <place-holder colnum=\"3132\"/> ruling to the letter. That decision contradicts natural justice. It allows negligent employers to get away with poisoning their workers. It also contradicts a statement by a leading judge in a previous appeal case, who stated that pleural plaques are evidence of an injury to someone, and that such damage&#8212;even though it is internal&#8212;should not be treated any differently in law from external damage to the body, for which compensation is normally applicable.</p><p>Pleural plaques are recognised by medical experts as a sign of irreversible damage to the lining of the lung, caused by a history of exposure to asbestos, which carries with it an increased risk of malignant disease, such as the deadly cancer mesothelioma. Some studies suggest that someone with pleural plaques is 100 times more likely than the general population to develop a fatal asbestos illness. That includes mesothelioma, a cancer primarily of the lining of the lung, which often results in death within 14 months of diagnosis.</p><p>Not allowing someone to bring an earlier case for compensation for pleural plaques means that many people with asbestos-related diseases, including mesothelioma, will never see the end of their compensation case. By contrast, allowing them to bring an earlier case on pleural plaques would provide the background if someone was unfortunate enough to develop a further asbestos-related disease, and that would speed up the court process. That is a major reason for allowing those with pleural plaques to retain their right to seek compensation from their former employers.</p><p>I offer my support to Clydeside Action on Asbestos and the Clydebank Asbestos Group for their role in campaigning not only for people with pleural plaques but for all those with asbestos-related illnesses. They cover the whole of Scotland and have clients in the traditional shipbuilding communities of Greenock, Port Glasgow, Dumbarton and Clydebank, as well as Glasgow. Asbestos-related illnesses do not affect people only in the west of Scotland; they affect people in the whole of Scotland, although there is a particular concentration in the west, the east coast and the Highlands. Furthermore, asbestos-related illnesses are not exclusive to the shipbuilding industry; they also affect people in the building trade.</p><p>I commend the work of those who campaign for justice for sufferers of asbestos-related illnesses. I have met people from Clydeside Action on Asbestos on a number of occasions. I urge anyone who has been diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease to contact the group for advice and assistance.</p><p>My motion notes that a draft bill has been presented to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice <place-holder colnum=\"3133\"/> seeking a Scottish solution to the matter. I know that Clydeside Action on Asbestos and Frank Maguire met the cabinet secretary today and I hope that a way forward can be found as soon as possible to help those with pleural plaques.</p><p>Some people might think that this is a health matter, and in some ways it is. Others might regard it as a legal issue, and there are legal aspects to it. However, it is fundamentally a moral issue of allowing recompense to those who have been wronged. I therefore urge the cabinet secretary to ensure that the issue is given the importance that it deserves, which I believe has been the case until now, and to lodge a bill in the near future. In my discussions with Clydeside Action on Asbestos, I said that I would lodge a member's bill if necessary. However, I am sure that a Government bill would make speedier progress through the Parliament.</p><p>There is consensus on this matter throughout the chamber.

He said, \"Why not just take a big piece of wood with a nail in it and hammer people?\" When I questioned whether that was a metaphor for the approach that the Westminster Government used when introducing its housing stock transfer policy, that part of the conversation soon ended and we moved on to something else.</p><p>I certainly do not advocate the stick-and-nail approach and I am not sure that the three-sheets-of-paper approach would have great success, either. However, methods exist that can be used, particularly with neighbour and community issues. As has been discussed, mediation is one method that can be used as an alternative method of <place-holder colnum=\"2951\"/> dispute resolution. It can be used for a variety of problems that affect people, such as arguments with neighbours, antisocial behaviour and arguments in the family home. I will focus on disputes with neighbours. Every member will have cases that involve antisocial behaviour or complaints about one person's actions that have a negative effect on their neighbours' lives. The ideal solution would be a simple knock on the door and a friendly chat about the issue, which would, one hopes, sort out the problem. Unfortunately, times have changed and confrontation may well be the result of that type of action. No one wants confrontation, particularly with a neighbour, so other methods must be examined. Furthermore, the courts and legal action must be the last resort in resolution, as that process can be protracted, time consuming and costly.</p><p>Community and neighbour mediation is a way of resolving disputes between those who have issues. It operates with trained mediators who help both parties come to an agreement about the problem at hand and, thankfully, it has a high success rate of about 90 per cent. An independent mediator is present to facilitate the process of the two parties reaching an outcome. If a binding agreement is formed, the courts can, if necessary, ensure that a certain course of action is followed. However, people tend to comply with such agreements and thus do not need the courts at all.</p><p>If members looked at the advice on websites such as Shelter Scotland's, they could be forgiven for thinking that much of the information is common sense, such as the suggestions that people should introduce themselves to their neighbours when they move into a new house or ensure that they look after any pets properly, keep an eye on children and do not play music at excessive levels. The vast majority of the population live their lives using that commonsense approach. However, it takes only one person or family to make others' lives unpleasant, which is when mediation can play a part.</p><p>Research that the previous Executive undertook highlighted a few points. The largest category of disputes concerns complaints about noise from music systems, televisions and laminate flooring. The second major cause for complaint is the behaviour of children, including noise, arguing, littering, fighting and vandalism. The main referral route for most participants is via the local housing officer, who is often aware of the difficulties between neighbours. The research also showed that 61 per cent of cases that use the mediation service record a positive outcome, in that either the problem is resolved or the situation improves in some way and that, in 28 per cent of cases, agreement is reached on all the issues. People's view of the process is generally positive, although several participants stated that it was more <place-holder colnum=\"2952\"/> traumatic than expected. Although the research showed that the outcome is unsatisfactory in 39 per cent of cases, it showed that mediation is a useful and successful method of resolving disputes.</p><p>From a financial perspective, mediation is extremely cheap compared with going through the courts. The same Executive research found that the average cost of handling a case was &#163;121, which rose to &#163;204 when face-to-face mediation was involved. The average cost of the legal cases that were examined was &#163;3,546. The average cost of introducing antisocial behaviour orders was approximately &#163;2,250 and for repossession actions it was &#163;9,000. The research shows that mediation has a valuable role in sorting out disputes and that it is effective in keeping people away from the expensive and time-consuming legal system, as other members, including Bill Butler, have mentioned. That can only be good for those who are involved in disputes and for the legal system, which is already clogged up.</p><p>I was totally unaware that we have just had Scottish mediation week, which ran from 15 to 19 October. I am sure that, with greater publicity of that week and of debates such as this, politicians with no legal background and the public will have greater awareness of mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution, such as conciliation, ombudsmen, arbitration and adjudication, to name just some.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390615", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alternative Dispute Resolution"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last night, I told two friends that I would be speaking in this debate.

First, it recommends that the number of tsars should be cut&#8212;we currently have more than 40&#8212;and that we should have one complaints body instead. A second excellent recommendation is that the complaints handling system should be standardised, which would lead to consistency across all sectors and make the system easier for the population to use. That recommendation would lead to greater efficiencies and less duplication and could have an agreed and transparent timeframe. A similar point was considered by the Justice Committee yesterday, when we took evidence from the Scottish Police Services Authority.</p><p>Those two recommendations would greatly assist the public in their quest for improved public services and a reliable and robust complaints system, and would improve belief in our public services. The quid pro quo, however, is that even greater powers would be given to the SPSO. I am sure that many members, both past and present, have taken up cases on behalf of constituents&#8212;there is a great deal of uncertainty among the public about the SPSO and its effectiveness. Many people might wonder whether it is worth bothering to complain, bearing in mind the percentage of complaints that are upheld: 1.16 per cent in 2003-04; 0.58 per cent in 2004-05; 3.13 per cent in 2005-06; and 8 per cent in 2006-07. I for one do not believe that those figures represent a true account of legitimate complaints throughout Scotland; neither do I believe that 100 per cent of complaints are valid. However, the poor figures to date beg the question whether it would be wise to give the SPSO even more powers and responsibility.</p><p>Any external scrutiny must be guided by the five key principles of independence, public focus, proportionality, transparency and accountability. Without them, the scrutiny will not be worth the paper it is written on.</p><p>The Crerar review has one main recommendation that sets alarm bells ringing for me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the specific role of investigating front-line service failure should be devolved to service providers and scrutiny bodies\".</p><p>Let us use Inverclyde Council as an example. Only two years ago, Audit Scotland produced two reports that slated the running of that council and noted its poor leadership, lack of direction and poor service delivery. The report was a wake-up call to the Parliament and to Westminster, which had allowed the mismanagement of the authority to go on for many years without calling it to heel. The poor souls who lived in Inverclyde&#8212;I am one of them&#8212;knew that the council was a mess and a <place-holder colnum=\"2359\"/> shambles, but nobody would listen. Thankfully, Audit Scotland forced action.</p><p>I am delighted to say that the new corporate management team is turning the council around, and it deserves every credit for doing so. I might not always agree with its decisions, but at least I recognise that the team is working tremendously hard and that shoots of optimism are returning.</p><p>Let us imagine that Inverclyde&#8212;or any other authority&#8212;was in a mess and we gave it the power to investigate itself. If it did not know the direction in which it should be going and it was falling apart, the last thing that we should do would be to give it more powers. That would be failing on all five key principles. The actions taken to revive Inverclyde's fortunes appear to have been the correct ones, and they did not include giving those who failed more powers.</p><p>I am sure that one of the reasons why the Inverclyde situation came to a head was the school reorganisation proposals that members of the previous council put on the table. They created a mess of tremendous proportions that led to allegations of social re-engineering and keeping apart less well-off and wealthier families. I am convinced that that was the final straw for many people. Many and varied complaints were sent to Inverclyde Council and the SPSO, yet the SPSO refused to meet the complainants or to respond to aspects of the final report, which backed up Inverclyde Council.</p><p>I have spoken to members from different parts of the country and discovered that there is a significant lack of public confidence in the SPSO, so giving the SPSO more powers is not the correct way forward. Before there is any increase in the powers of the SPSO, fundamental questions that I would like to be answered include: whether the SPSO should accept undated documents; whether it should meet complainants; why so many people are deeply unhappy with the way in which the SPSO has investigated complaints; and whether the SPSO should consider best value when considering complaints about public services.</p><p>I welcome the Crerar review, which is a useful starting point for further consultation and for improving the complaints procedure in Scotland. However, I caution against giving the SPSO more powers. I also caution against giving service providers a self-regulatory role. Good service providers would deal with the role with great efficiency, but less successful ones could, in theory, use it to hide their failings. One has only to consider the annual number of audit reports about Scottish public bodies that emanated from Westminster pre-devolution to see how easy it was for such bodies to hide failings. Audit Scotland has ensured that public bodies in <place-holder colnum=\"2360\"/> Scotland are more accountable to the public purse, which is to be welcomed.</p><p>It is imperative not only that we consider the problems that might lie ahead if we gave the SPSO greater powers, but that we ask who would keep watch on it. If the SPSO is to be empowered in this way, we must have assurances that the organisation will be changed and improved and that we will not have the same problems that so many people have experienced. Indeed, Andy Kerr and Derek Brownlee have already alluded to that.</p><p>Today's motion leaves the debate open. The chamber will revisit the issue, and I am sure that many members will welcome the debates that we have on it. We must grasp this chance to improve complaints procedures in Scotland, because by improving them we will also improve the perception of public bodies, as the population will have greater confidence that they are being listened to.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crerar Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This important debate will ultimately, I am sure, lead to an improved complaints service being offered to everyone in Scotland.

I certainly hope that the new SNP Government can build a consensual approach to tackling the issue. The problem of drugs abuse is shocking.

Christine Grahame mentioned some of those figures earlier and the minister highlighted other statistics. The problem is vast. It is obvious that every stakeholder should get involved in the fight against drugs misuse.</p><p>To follow the consensual approach, I point out that I am not averse to some policies in the other parties' manifestos for the recent election. The Labour Party suggested providing a wider range of drug treatments that are tailored to the individual, making it easier to seize assets using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and reinvesting drug <place-holder colnum=\"1467\"/> dealers' money in the communities that are hardest hit by drugs. Labour also said that it would not shy away from taking children away from drug-misusing parents for their safety and well-being and that it wanted to take into account the wider family in rehabilitation programmes. Some of those proposals are laudable. I am also keen on the Conservative policy of putting &#163;100 million into tackling drugs.</p><p>Obviously, I stood on an SNP platform, with SNP policies such as developing a national drugs commission; increasing by 20 per cent the funding for drug treatment and rehabilitation programmes; increasing access to abstinence programmes; dedicating &#163;10 million to drugs education in schools; and increasing support services for the families of drug addicts and the families of those who misuse alcohol. I hope that some of those policies are included in our national strategy. I am happy to have a broader, non-partisan approach to continuing the struggle and, judging from what has been said so far in the debate, I think that that is true of other members.</p><p>In the run-up to the election, I visited the Haven rehabilitation centre in Kilmacolm, which opened my eyes. I was humbled by the success stories that I was told. Of the people who go to the Haven, 65 per cent come out rehabilitated and drug free. That success rate means that the blight on our communities from drug abuse is reduced and people go back into society to play an active and positive part in our communities. I was told one story that I am sure has been replicated throughout the country. The Haven has a graduation ceremony for those who go back into the community. When one individual who is now clean and back in the community attended the ceremony, his family, including his child, were there, which was the first time that he had seen his child in about eight years. When drug addicts become clean and get their lives and families back together, that is a major achievement for them and for our society and communities.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13386762", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members will have various experiences of the drugs problems in Scotland and in their local communities.

I am also sure that they will want to address the varying interpretations of \"care\" by local authorities that have been reported. I sincerely hope that any review of free personal care establishes recommendations that are workable and can be implemented.</p><p>Free personal care is about more than just providing a level of health care to people. For those who live in the community, it is about allowing senior citizens to have independence and freedom. It is about preserving dignity and providing assistance in equal measure. For those who live in care homes, it is about ensuring that the care that they receive meets their needs and enables them to live a comfortable and happy life. I, for one, believe that our senior citizens deserve the dignity and respect that the introduction of free personal care was meant to safeguard. It is important to ask why there has been a continual struggle by senior citizens to have their rights highlighted and brought into the public eye. They do not feel that they have been listened to or taken seriously.</p><p>Many activities have taken place that have helped our senior citizens, and those should be welcomed. However, providing pre-election gimmicks only exacerbates a delicate situation. The introduction of free personal care was lauded <place-holder colnum=\"815\"/> as a positive step towards reducing pensioner poverty, which is a reality in Scotland. Free personal care was never going to eradicate that problem, but it was seen as a major step in helping our senior citizens. We must ask ourselves what has gone wrong with the policy and how it can be fixed.</p><p>Every member will have received a policy briefing from Help the Aged, in which major concerns are highlighted. The use of waiting lists by local authorities is an issue that struck me. If local authorities have used waiting lists as has been reported, it is imperative that that is investigated. It must be examined whether not enough funding was given to local authorities; whether it was underestimated how many people would require free personal care; or whether money for free personal care was directed to other services by local authorities.</p><p>A further point that needs clarity is the charges for the preparation of food. I spoke to a couple of experienced SNP councillors about today's debate and asked them about the experiences that had been highlighted to them. Their main point concerned the preparation of food, which Keith Brown and David McLetchie have spoken about, and they stressed the need for clarification of the rules. Up to half of Scotland's local authorities have charged for that service, although some local authorities refunded the money that they had charged after they were challenged. That highlights to me the fact that there is a major problem with, and a lack of clarity about, the current rules.</p><p>I do not believe that local authorities have been duplicitous. I do not believe that any local authority wants to be classed as operating against the spirit of the legislation. I am sure that every local authority would welcome a clarification of the rules and further legislation if that is required.</p><p>A further issue that should be highlighted is the withdrawal of the attendance allowance. After the introduction of free personal care, &#163;30 million to &#163;40 million was withheld by Westminster. It is important that that issue is redressed. Devolution was established to allow the Scottish people and the Scottish Parliament to introduce domestic policies for Scottish issues. The introduction of free personal care was such a policy. I think it unfair, therefore, that people who receive free personal care have been punished because the Parliament introduced a policy with such a fine objective. I am sure that the current Westminster Government will be a bit prickly when the Scottish Government raises the matter with it.</p><p>I welcome the announcement of the review, which will be chaired by Lord Sutherland. I also welcome the increased payments for personal and nursing care in care homes from April 2008. We <place-holder colnum=\"816\"/> cannot allow the policy to continue under a cloud and expect the problems to go away.

I welcome an honest and open debate about Scottish independence. However, today's debate is about Scotland being wealthier and fairer.</p><p>I want to highlight issues that could make Scotland a wealthier and fairer nation for everyone. Scotland's devolved status clearly limits the improvements that we can make. However, people should not doubt that the new Scottish Government will continue to improve the lives of the people of Scotland. Today's debate should be welcomed by everyone in this Parliament.</p><p>I stay in Inverclyde, and I am sure that the 1,700 small businesses in the area would welcome the introduction of the small business bonus scheme, under which 1,300 small businesses in the area would pay no rates at all and the other 400 would pay less than they currently do. That would be a massive boost to those companies and the local economy. If those savings were reinvested by those companies, as some of them undoubtedly would be, how many more jobs and opportunities could be created?</p><p>Being wealthier and fairer covers many aspects of life, not just small business. A fairer method of paying for local services, with the scrapping of the unfair council tax and its replacement by a local income tax, will also improve the lives of many people. I am sure that that will be debated long after today's debate is over.</p><p>Education is a third and extremely important aspect of being wealthier and fairer. Wealth does not necessarily mean only financial benefits. A wealthy nation is a well-educated nation. The new Scottish Government must ensure that all children have access to a world-class education system. An education system that offers boundless opportunities for every child entering the school gates will repay Scotland a thousandfold. I am delighted to say that, in Scotland, I am not alone in that belief.<place-holder colnum=\"217\"/></p><p>Given that that is the case, I must highlight an issue that is of great importance to the community in which I live. The previous Liberal Democrat-run local authority proposed plans to invest in the fabric of Inverclyde schools. I am sure that I am correct when I say that most people were happy that those plans were produced, as Inverclyde schools had been bereft of funding for many years because of the decisions of the previous administration. However, the plans have proved to be explosive, not only because of the public-private partnership/private finance initiative funding element, but because of the reduction in the number of schools from eight to five. The proposals also mean that the new schools will have fewer facilities than the schools they replace and that the largest school will be built on the smallest site. Further, costs have risen from &#163;80 million to &#163;200 million. As if that is not bad enough, I must also point out that the inability of the new schools to cope with their school rolls will result in secondary school pupils being educated in huts.</p><p>I am sure that members agree that the points that I have just highlighted&#8212;and they are only the tip of the iceberg&#8212;are disappointing and require further scrutiny before the plans are accepted as being the way forward. It is, therefore, astounding that the previous Labour and Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive agreed to the proposals in April 2006. Public opinion is still massively against the proposals, and it is incumbent on the new council to engineer new proposals. It is also incumbent on MSPs representing Inverclyde to highlight the failings of the proposals to the new Scottish Government ministers.</p><p>Scotland needs a wealthier and fairer way forward for everyone. The damning statistics from Inverclyde prove why that is vital for future generations: 39 per cent of the Inverclyde population is economically inactive; 17 per cent of the working-age population claims income support; 22 per cent of people have a long-term illness, health problem or disability; and 21 per cent of children live in a household in which no one is in employment.
