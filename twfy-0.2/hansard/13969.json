The city is, understandably, celebrating the life of that remarkable woman, who introduced ground-breaking social and healthcare reform. One hundred years on, we have seen a huge change in the lives of working women. Women now work in every sector in Scotland&#8212;often at the top of their profession&#8212;or run their own businesses, and yet they still face barriers to and at work.</p><p>At last year&#8217;s women&#8217;s employment summit, which was held in partnership with the Scottish Trades Union Congress, delegates discussed the many barriers that women can face in the labour market. Since March this year, I have had support in monitoring progress since the summit from the strategic advisory group on women and work. I am grateful to the group for its passionate yet well-informed input to our wide-ranging mission. In addressing Parliament today, I hope that I am adequately reflecting its views and concerns.</p><p>Since the summit, we have had the timely report from the Equal Opportunities Committee on its inquiry into women and work, which considered childcare, occupational segregation and flexible working. However, although significant challenges remain for today&#8217;s women, I stress that we are not here to debate bad news.</p><p>I invite members to consider the wider picture. Women are doing well in the labour market. The latest statistics show that the female employment rate is 69.5 per cent in Scotland, which is an increase of 3.2 per cent in the past year. Over the year, the number of women in employment in Scotland has risen by 54,000, and female underemployment has also decreased by 2.9 per cent over the past year.</p><p>However, we know that problems still exist, and we need to find ways within our powers to tackle them. The cost and availability of childcare is often cited as the key problem for working parents and women in particular. That is why we are legislating now, via the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, to increase the level of funded early learning and childcare from 475 hours to 600 hours per year for three and four-year-olds and, from 2014, for the most vulnerable two-year-olds.</p><p>Our white paper, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future: Your Guide to an Independent Scotland&#8221;, which was published last week, set out our commitment, in an independent Scotland, to work towards a childcare system in which all children from age one to starting school would be entitled to 1,140 hours of childcare and early learning a year, which equates broadly to 30 hours a week, 38 weeks per year. That would be truly transformational and would enable more women to make greater choices about their working lives. In developing that commitment the Scottish Government is indebted to Professor Ailsa McKay, whose input has been invaluable, and I thank her for that.</p><p>Among the other topics that were discussed at the summit, occupational segregation is one of the most complex and challenging, but we must challenge it for the sake of our economy and of equality, including equal pay. Because the issues are so broad, the first recommendation from the summit on which we acted was the re-establishment of the Government&#8217;s cross-directorate working group. In addition to Scottish Government officials, the group calls on the expertise of our external partners in the STUC, Napier&#8217;s Scottish resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology, the close the gap project and the men in childcare initiative.</p><p>The group will oversee the work to progress the women&#8217;s employment summit recommendations, alongside the recommendations that the Royal Society of Edinburgh made in its report, &#8220;Tapping all our Talents: Women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics&#8212;a strategy for Scotland&#8221;</p><p>One action that is already under way is the implementation of careerwise, which is a &#163;250,000 fund to encourage girls and young women to consider careers in science, engineering and technology. Careerwise Scotland is being implemented by the Scottish resource centre. It will work collaboratively with employers, schools, colleges, universities and Skills Development Scotland to encourage and support young women into science, technology, engineering and maths learning and jobs.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that earlier this month, Prospect union launched the Prospect pledge to encourage the Government and employers to do more to help women into STEM jobs. I assure Parliament that I fully support that ambition. Early next year, I will hold an event with the information technology industry with an emphasis on how to attract young women into the sector, which I hope will also contribute to that work.</p><p>On the modern apprenticeship programme and vocational education training, Skills Development Scotland is pursuing a range of activities including working with Scottish union learning to better target underrepresented groups in the apprenticeship programme, be that young women, members of the black minority ethnic community or people with a disability. As members all know, we await the final report from the Wood commission.</p><p>However, we need to be clear that addressing occupational segregation is not just about getting more women into STEM jobs. Women are often drawn to particular sectors and types of jobs. It is crucial that we properly value all the work that women do&#8212;paid and unpaid&#8212;which contributes so much to Scottish society and to the Scottish economy.</p><p>Another topic of discussion at the summit was access to training for women of all ages. I recognise that women will need to access training at different stages of their lives and that those who are returning to the labour market may need to refresh existing skills or retrain in a new area.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22781811", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women and Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This year marks the 100th anniversary of the death of Mary Lily Walker, who was a native of Dundee.

However, as I said earlier, we do indeed want women to have access to opportunities in a variety of sectors, including those sectors in which women are currently underrepresented&#8212;sectors that can lead women to long careers and careers that will help to address equal pay issues, for example.</p><p>As regards women in enterprise, in Scotland only 21 per cent of small to medium-sized enterprise employers are women led. Following last year&#8217;s summit, we facilitated a series of workshops, which were chaired by Professor Sara Carter of the University of Strathclyde and Jackie Brierton of Women&#8217;s Enterprise Scotland.</p><p>A draft framework for action by the Scottish Government and its partners has been produced and we anticipate that it will be completed by the end of the year. Figures that Sara Carter has provided show that, if women in Scotland were to start businesses at the same rate as men, economic growth could be more than 5 per cent. That demonstrates the importance of addressing the enterprise gap.</p><p>The challenges for women in the workplace are many and varied. In the short time available, I have not been able to cover all the work that is under way by the Scottish Government and our partners. I hope that my colleague Shona Robison will address in her concluding remarks some of the wider equality issues and issues to do with women&#8217;s participation on boards and in broader public and corporate life. I have not had time to touch on the excellent research and analysis that has been led by Professor Patricia Findlay, but there are good papers on the employability in Scotland website.</p><p>To end on a personal note, I assure Parliament that, within the scope of the powers that we currently have, we are taking steps across all areas of Government to tackle the barriers to employment or progression that women face.

At the halfway point of its work, the commission has published an interim report, which has received widespread endorsement from the education and business communities and caught the imagination of many.</p><p>I welcome the interim report, the extent to which the commission has already made progress, the vision that it has set out on vocational education and the practical steps that it has outlined in its recommendations. Although it calls for a set of evolutionary steps, the report is, overall, hugely ambitious on behalf of all our young people. There are many exciting aspects of the report but, above all else, it lays out a realistic blueprint for how we might move to an education system that sets out clear and attractive pathways that can take young people from school into employment.</p><p>Scotland has a good recent record on addressing youth unemployment, but I want our long-term approach to boosting youth employment to be among the best in the world. We have been making progress on increasing attainment, but I want the opportunity gaps in our society to be eradicated. We have some well-developed and well-understood pathways for young people, but I want everyone to understand and hold in high regard all our educational and training pathways.</p><p>The report makes a significant contribution to achieving all those aspirations. It highlights a number of drivers that make the delivery of its recommendations possible. The flexibility of the senior phase of curriculum for excellence, the regionalisation of our college sector and the growth in modern apprenticeships are all clearly identified as important drivers for delivery.</p><p>Those are all reforms that the Government has undertaken. They build on the progress in Scottish education that the Parliament has delivered since devolution. That means that we have a platform to build a world-class vocational education and training system that we can proudly place alongside our world-class higher education system for the benefit of all our young people, our employers and, of course, Scotland&#8217;s economic wellbeing.</p><p>We can disagree at a political level about many issues but, across the Parliament, there is a consensus that our young people&#8217;s future should not be one of the issues that we dispute. We all want our young people to be able to make the most of their talents. We all want to benefit from the contribution that a highly skilled and well-motivated young workforce can make to our country&#8217;s success. We all want to avoid the situation in which young people suffer the long-term scars of unemployment at an early age.</p><p>That is why, as the Government considers the commission&#8217;s interim report, in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, I was keen to give Parliament an early opportunity to contribute to how the recommendations might be taken forward. That is a process that we can start today and one that I want to sustain, with all members, in the months ahead.</p><p>We are starting from a strong base here in Scotland, but there is much that we can learn from other countries. I recently visited Switzerland and Germany to see for myself how their vocational education and training systems help to drive low levels of youth unemployment. Both countries expose young people to the workplace at an early age and place great importance on well-understood, high-quality vocational pathways. In both countries, employers are seen as part of the education system and view themselves as such.</p><p>I was struck by the widely held understanding that educationists and industry need to work together to prepare young people for life after school. It was very apparent to me that there was a clear understanding of what it is like to be 16 and of the support that young people need to develop a whole host of attributes required to move successfully into adult life. In those countries, there was also a clear understanding that early exposure to the workplace helps to build those attributes among young people.</p><p>There is no doubt that we all have empathy towards our young people. We have all been there&#8212;admittedly, for some of us, that was longer ago than we would care to remember&#8212;and most of us have young people in our lives. I look forward with particular interest to the commission&#8217;s further recommendations on bringing employers much closer to the education system. There is an appetite among employers in Scotland to do more and I know that the commission will focus on how we can make that possible.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commission for Developing Scotland&#8217;s Young Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In January this year, the Government set up the independent commission for developing Scotland&#8217;s young workforce under the leadership of Sir Ian Wood.

Despite a global economic recession, countries such as Germany have seen youth unemployment fall, and there is great interest in how they have achieved that.</p><p>We need to build a system that ensures clearer progression for young people from school into work in the good times as well as the bad. We need a system that will be robust enough that whether the economy is up or down, our young people get the best start to their working lives.</p><p>It is not for me to pre-empt the work of the commission in its second phase. However, I have no doubt that it will look at many countries, including Germany, when it considers how we can proceed to a system in which, as Sir Ian Wood described it, employers are not just passive recipients but are integrally involved in the education and training of young people.</p><p>Given what I have said, I hope that it is clear that I am enthusiastic about the commission&#8217;s interim recommendations. Detailed consideration will have to be given to each recommendation and to the implementation challenges that may exist. However, I welcome the opportunity to work with COSLA on this and I also welcome the early engagement that leaders throughout the education sector are having with each other.</p><p>I will not go through all the recommendations, but I want to highlight some of them. The focus on informing young people about the opportunities throughout the world of work from an early stage of their secondary education is critical. I am particularly interested in the recommendations on science, technology, engineering and mathematics and the growth sectors in that regard. It is essential that we inspire young people around the opportunities to pursue careers in those parts of the economy in which their chance of a long-term, rewarding career is greatest.</p><p>That must involve teachers, careers advisers, employers, parents and guardians working together to inspire young people about the possibilities that lie ahead. That has to be underpinned by strong pathways that help young people reach for those opportunities.</p><p>At the launch of the commission&#8217;s interim report, Linda McKay, the vice-chair of the commission, spoke about the unique opportunity that the commission has had to look across schools, colleges and modern apprenticeships. By taking that approach, the commission has highlighted a number of possibilities to smooth transitions for young people and put all our young people in a better position to move confidently and ambitiously towards rewarding employment from the senior phase onwards.</p><p>Our college reform programme has, over the past two years, seen a remarkable transformation in the shape of the sector. Leaders in this new sector are continuing to realise the opportunities that regionalisation presents.</p><p>The commission is clear that colleges should focus on the employability of their learners through closer links with industry. That is a central principle of our regionalisation agenda. A little over two years ago, in &#8220;Putting Learners at the Centre: Delivering our Ambitions for Post-16 Education&#8221;, we proposed that the role of further education should be to provide people with the skills that they need to get a job, keep a job or get a better job and develop a good career, however near to or far from the labour market they are. This is the whole point: young people go to college and engage in education at least in part to enhance their career prospects. Employment outcomes are therefore a fundamental indicator not only of a college&#8217;s success, but of the success of the education system as a whole.</p><p>The commission has rightly identified the need to provide opportunities and support for all young people, irrespective of their background. The Government has asked the commission to place the equality agenda at the very heart of its work. I know that it is determined to make meaningful recommendations across education and employment in its final report to help address inequalities in employment outcomes.</p><p>The interim report highlights, for example, the success of activity agreements in supporting some of our most vulnerable and disadvantaged young people and calls for that approach to be extended where appropriate to those aged under 16. Although the commission helpfully makes recommendations to bring forward careers advice, it is important to recognise that the career modernisation programme aims to maintain universal support for all young people while providing more intensive support for those who need it most.</p><p>In the report&#8217;s forward, Sir Ian Wood refers to attainment for all. The Government has made improving attainment a central element of its education strategy. A number of the recommendations, if implemented well, will help us realise our ambition for Scotland to be the best place to go to school, where every young person can enjoy an education that encourages them to be the most successful they can be and provides them with a full passport to future opportunity.</p><p>It is very interesting that the report does not contain the term &#8220;parity of esteem.&#8221; There can be little doubt for anybody who has read the report that the commission members believe passionately in the importance of both vocational and higher education to our young people, our economy and our society. They state that clearly in the report and whenever they speak about their work. However, rather than simply calling for greater parity of esteem between vocational and academic education, as many others have done in the past, the commission has laid out a number of practical steps that it thinks will help bring that about. Ultimately, by delivering those well and demonstrating the enhanced employment outcomes of those who follow the vocational pathways that the commission outlines, we will start to see a shift in the outmoded culture to which the report quite rightly refers.</p><p>The commission&#8217;s work is only half finished. It will focus on employers and equality issues between now and early next year. However, I very much believe that we have to take this interim report seriously, so the work begins now to implement it. Working in partnership with COSLA, I plan to work with the commission to bring together leaders from across the education system and beyond to consider the recommendations and their implementation.</p><p>The national summit, which Sir Ian Wood will chair, will focus on the issues raised by the interim report. I invite members of this Parliament with an interest in this to attend the summit, which will take place at the turn of the year.</p><p>I very much look forward to today&#8217;s debate. I am sure that it will reflect the wide-ranging interest in the commission&#8217;s work. It will undoubtedly help inform the Government&#8217;s thinking on the interim report as we consider the recommendations, in partnership with COSLA, in advance of the commission&#8217;s final report next year.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament believes that schools should promote educational attainment and positive destinations for all pupils including those who wish to pursue vocational pathways; welcomes the interim report from the Commission for Developing Scotland&#8217;s Young Workforce; further welcomes the emphasis that it places on closer cooperation between schools, colleges and employers in providing vocational education; agrees that the report provides a sound basis for future policy decisions, and invites the Scottish Government to work in partnership with all parties, COSLA, local authorities and stakeholders to build a consensus based around the commission&#8217;s report, including ways to make early progress in developing the opportunities that young people have to improve their skills and employability.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commission for Developing Scotland&#8217;s Young Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the commission proceeds with the second phase of its work, it will perhaps consider some of those issues about statutory requirements.

Top marks go to Marco Biagi, the former researcher, for a very eloquent expos&#233; of the links between education and our economy and how we can gain more of the benefits of a first-class education system through having the full range of economic powers.</p><p>In addition, I very much enjoyed Duncan McNeil&#8217;s speech. I hope that he does not mind my saying that I found it to be uncharacteristically reflective and humorous in parts, although he covered some very serious issues.</p><p>The Scottish Government very much welcomes the committee&#8217;s report, so I hope that the committee&#8217;s members will find the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the report&#8217;s many recommendations very positive; we have responded positively in part or in full to all the recommendations. As the committee does, we have a desire to get into the guts of the issue and to seek more information. We have already published more information about older and disabled workers, but we will seek ways to improve our measurement tools in relation to the skills utilisation measurement framework and the national performance framework.</p><p>As members know, the economy is absolutely key and central to our endeavours. Recent economic and employment indicators are encouraging, but the Government very much recognises the ethos of what the committee has articulated, in that although a feature of the recession is lower unemployment rates than anticipated, we should not have a debate that is falsely framed as unemployment versus underemployment, because we must consider both issues as part of a continuum. The Scottish Government very much recognises the personal impact on health poverty and life chances of underemployment, as well as of unemployment.</p><p>We know that fuller participation in the labour market from better utilisation of skills and through enabling more people to fulfil their potential will not only grow our economy, but will help us to challenge inequality. Sustainable economic growth is essential and is very much the starting place. We must ensure that, when we get economic recovery, young people, women and other equalities groups get their fair share of opportunities. We know that there is an economic cost to young people, women and other equalities groups to their not being able to fulfil their full potential.</p><p>I believe that the Scottish Government can undertake a number of actions, so we are currently undertaking some actions to tackle the causes of long-term underemployment. Many of our measures through Skills Development Scotland are about co-investment, with employers, in flexible training opportunities, the low-carbon fund and the energy skills fund. Other work-based learning includes Scottish union learning, which is very important in reaching members of the workforce that other services find hard to reach and is especially important in improving literacy among workers. The Scottish Government funds that to the tune of &#163;1.422&#160;million every year.</p><p>On specific programmes, the Scottish Government is investing in graduate internship programmes&#8212;which is, in essence, paid work experience&#8212;which have been very successful. The outcomes of those programmes are leading to graduates getting into employment at a rate of between 70 and 75 per cent.</p><p>Very specific sectoral responses to skills shortages and underemployment such as skills investment plans and skills action plans are also crucial.</p><p>As Minister for Youth Employment, I am especially interested in the notion of matching older workers with younger workers. Some good examples of that are already happening in the private sector. That chimes with our make young people your business campaign, which is about changing hearts and minds and encouraging employers to see the benefits of workforce planning, investing in young people and growing their own talent, particularly in the light of our having an ageing workforce. We will discuss that issue and the range of issues in and around underemployment with the Scottish employability forum.</p><p>In my remaining time, I will touch on some very important infrastructure issues. At its very heart, post-16 education reform is about aligning the world of education with the world of work. I hope that the committee&#8217;s members welcome the additional investment in taught postgraduate places and undergraduate places that are targeted at key economic sectors.</p><p>In Scotland we know that we have yet to reap the full economic benefits of our first-class research. Much good work is under way in our innovation centres and knowledge-transfer partnerships. In the college sector, there is &#163;61&#160;million that is additional to planned budgets, much of which will be used to increase part-time provision for women returners. That is an opportunity to increase bursaries and childcare grants as well.</p><p>Margaret McDougall and Alison Johnstone, among others, mentioned childcare. The Government is taking a valuable step forward with the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill and the commitment to providing 600 hours of childcare and early learning. However, we have to be honest; we know that good-quality childcare cannot be done on the cheap. However, although the costs of childcare are high in Scotland, they are not the highest. The cost of nursery and childminding provision is higher in many parts of England and elsewhere. We have to recognise that the childcare workforce is primarily female; the committee rightly made the connections between the social care sector and underemployment. I know of one feminist economist who argues that only when we start to get more men into childcare will we see childcare salaries increase.</p><p>The solution is not about reducing the costs of childcare but about how we better compensate either providers or parents. I am very glad that the Council of Economic Advisers is looking at the economic benefits of a universal childcare system and is learning from the best in Europe. It is looking at models of delivery and funding and considering how we cold move to a sustainable and affordable universal system. Of course, to complete that journey we will indeed need the powers of independence, because the link between the labour market, tax and welfare is rather elementary.</p><p>In the minute that I have left, I want to make specific mention of zero-hours contracts, which many members from across the chamber have mentioned today. As John Swinney said, the Government wants to seek more information about the prevalence of zero-hours contracts and is considering what steps can be taken as part of the forthcoming procurement reform bill. We want to consider specifically how procurement procedures can take account of workforce matters, but we have to recognise that any action, even in the context of the procurement reform bill, must be consistent with employment law and with European procurement legislation.</p><p>I welcome in part Kezia Dugdale and Duncan McNeil&#8217;s contributions, in which they spoke about how we all have a responsibility to do absolutely everything that we can within our existing powers. I am very accepting of that. I hope that, in that spirit, members including Mr McNeil can also accept and open their eyes to the potential benefits of this Parliament&#8217;s having a full range of economic and employment law powers.</p><p>My final point is that the Scottish Government has worked in close partnership with the STUC for many years now, because we are very committed and publicly signed up to promoting equality in the workplace whenever and wherever we can.</p><p>I congratulate the committee on its thorough and interesting work.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Underemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a largely well-informed debate.

Young people are absolutely essential to our economy, today and tomorrow.</p><p>The monthly and quarterly publication cycle of the various labour market surveys gives politicians, economists and media commentators much to consider. Although statistics are always subject to interpretation and qualification, regardless of how we choose to interpret recent figures, a number of things are true: youth unemployment in Scotland has dropped in each of the past five months, and the latest annual population survey figures show a decrease in 2012 compared with 2011; Scotland&#8217;s youth unemployment rate is lower than the United Kingdom average and the rate in each of the other home nations; and only five countries in the European Union&#8212;Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Malta and Denmark&#8212;have a lower youth unemployment rate than Scotland does.</p><p>The relentless efforts across Scotland by councils, employers, voluntary organisations and others are testimony to our call for an all-Scotland approach to tackling youth unemployment. Those efforts are making a difference and need to continue.</p><p>Although the recent downward trend in the youth unemployment rate and level is welcome, there are still 65,000 young people in Scotland who want to work but have not been able to secure employment. For young people who are in work, underemployment is a growing concern. Last week&#8217;s research paper by Professor David Bell and Professor David Blanchflower reminds us that underemployment is particularly concentrated among the young and that, last year, 30 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds who had jobs wanted longer hours. That adds to the challenges that young people face in today&#8217;s labour market. I welcome the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8217;s report on underemployment, which was published last month, to which the Government will respond soon.</p><p>Although there has been a welcome decrease in the headline youth unemployment figures, the increase in long-term joblessness among young people is worrying. Schemes to support young people, such as the wage incentives of the youth contract and the work programme, are the responsibility of the UK Government. It is a source of deep frustration to me that I cannot be confident that the young people concerned are receiving the support that they need and that we do not have the ability to adapt those resources to better support young people who are in danger of being trapped in a cycle of long-term unemployment.</p><p>The latest youth employment report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development is called, &#8220;Employers are from Mars, young people are from Venus&#8221;. Based on research with employers, it highlights a mismatch between employers&#8217; expectations of young people during the recruitment process and young people&#8217;s understanding of what is expected of them. On the one hand, many young people are struggling to find their first job. On the other, some employers are finding it hard to get the skills that they need. We need to address that mismatch to reduce youth unemployment and ensure that businesses are equipped with the right talent for their immediate and future needs.</p><p>Making young people our business means changing the way in which we do business. For employers, that includes acknowledging what young employees bring to the workplace and adapting their recruitment methods so that they do not act against young people. For young people, it means gaining the skills that are valuable to employers and demonstrating how they can put them into practice. Government and others who support young people and employers need to help young people and employers to understand one another. We are making good progress on each of those fronts.</p><p>Last month, Gordon MacDonald MSP hosted a parliamentary reception for third sector employers and young people who are supported by our successful community jobs programme. In the past three years, more than 3,000 young people have had high-quality work-based training opportunities through the community jobs Scotland scheme. The young people and employers at that reception were definitely on the same planet and understood how to support one another&#8217;s aims.</p><p>Last week, at Cumbernauld College, I presented a number of young people with the new certificate of work readiness. What is different about that qualification is that half of the time required to complete it&#8212;around 190 hours&#8212;needs to be spent in the workplace and assessed by the employer. It is endorsed by business organisations such as the Scottish Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, as well as by employers such as Diageo, Scottish Power and Burn Stewart Distillers. Achieving the certificate will help young people to prove that they are ready for the world of work.</p><p>The reforms that are under way in the college sector will ensure that the skills that people develop at college help to grow the economy. Regional colleges and outcome agreements will make it easier for employers to influence learning provision. The commission for developing Scotland&#8217;s young workforce, led by Sir Ian Wood, will advise on what further improvements might be needed to our education and training system to make it even more responsive to the needs of the economy.</p><p>I want more employers to accept the business case for investing in young people and to look at how they can create new youth jobs, offer apprenticeships or offer high-quality work experience for young people. That is a big ask, but I know that there is a large appetite among employers to respond. In return, through modernising our careers service, preparing young people better to make the move from education into work, and making our education and skills system more responsive to industry needs, we will help to ensure that their workforce needs are better met.</p><p>In responding to the needs of key growth sectors, we are providing a wider and better mix of skills. One example of that is the energy skills action plan, which has led to significant collaboration with industry and Scotland&#8217;s colleges and universities, as well as other key delivery partners. Since 2010 the low-carbon skills fund has provided more than 2,000 training places for small businesses across Scotland. Last year, we supported a further 1,000 flexible training places in the energy and low-carbon sector by continuing that fund and introducing the new energy skills challenge fund. In addition, 500 modern apprenticeship places a year have been ring fenced for the sector.</p><p>My world of work includes a specific energy section that has attracted 5,000 internet hits in 18 months, helping to attract young people to the sector. Initiatives such as careerwise will improve collaboration between schools and businesses and encourage more girls into science and engineering careers.</p><p>As well as making our education and skills system more responsive to industry, we are supporting businesses to develop their own solutions to meet workforce needs. For example, the Nigg Skills Academy will provide general training for 3,000 by 2015. Building on all that, the Scottish energy skills academy will support our existing business base and attract further energy investment in Scotland.</p><p>Our approach to tackling youth unemployment is more in tune with the European countries that are introducing youth guarantees than with the UK Government.

It is about giving a guarantee of work, apprenticeship, education or training to every 16 to 24-year-old, or in European cases, 15 to 25-year-old, within four months of their either leaving education or becoming unemployed. That is a very progressive, significant commitment that we should implement in this country.</p><p>I discussed the European youth guarantee with UK Government ministers and I regret that they are not convinced by it.

I hope that Mr McArthur will look at the European youth guarantee.

Although this Government does not have the necessary powers over employment services, we are doing everything that we can to make progress. For example, in education we have prioritised college places and supported more higher education places for young people. We are offering high-quality paid traineeships and work experience opportunities through, for example, community jobs Scotland and the certificate of work readiness. We continue to achieve our target of 25,000 new modern apprenticeships each year, and 77 per cent of last year&#8217;s modern apprenticeships were taken up by 16 to 24-year-olds. Very soon, we will announce a package of financial support to help businesses create 10,000 jobs for young people.</p><p>I will continue to look at how other countries in Europe and elsewhere are tackling youth unemployment and learn from that good practice, which I will be glad to share with Parliament.

To me, the issues there are an example of why we should never abandon welfare powers to Westminster but, laying that political difference aside, I am of course more than happy to meet her, Royston at work and any others to discuss the issues. I will not make any promises, but I can give an undertaking to do my best to look for a solution. In that vein, I am also happy to accept Mr McDonald&#8217;s kind invitation to the young Scotland&#8217;s got talent event in Aberdeen.</p><p>As Ken Macintosh said, we have explored the labour market statistics. We must all recognise that there is a variety of statistics and that they are complex. We must all strive to get into the guts of the figures so that we understand as best we can what is working and not working and the trends ahead. I welcome the fact that members seem to agree that the youth unemployment rate is falling and is going in the right direction. I wish to emphasise the positive. We have nearly 30,000 fewer young unemployed Scots now than we had at this time last year, and youth unemployment is at its lowest level in three years.</p><p>In making that point, I am in no way complacent. I have many faults&#8212;too many to list here&#8212;but complacency is most certainly not one of them. We must emphasise the positive movement in the figures so that we increase the resolve to do more. Now is most certainly not the time to take our foot off the gas.</p><p>That is a real opportunity for us all to grasp. We can all use the positive movement&#8212;the drop in youth unemployment&#8212;to persuade more employers that they can and do make a difference and that our young people have an invaluable contribution to make to the economy.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that Scotland is outperforming the rest of the UK, with higher employment, lower unemployment and better activity levels. That, again, is not to be complacent in any way, but it is important to acknowledge that Scottish employers are more likely to recruit young people. That is evidenced by the UK Commission for Employability and Skills. It is also evidence that the distinctive Scottish Government policies&#8212;whether the modern apprenticeship programme, opportunities for all, reforms to the colleges or the modernisation of the careers programme&#8212;are having the right impact.</p><p>Let me also be clear that having better youth employment statistics than the UK is not the limit of my ambition. I look to other European countries large and small that, despite the global economic recession, have youth unemployment rates of less than 10 per cent. That is what our ambition needs to be.</p><p>I very much regret the fact that, as yet, the UK Government does not support the European youth guarantee. I say to Mr Macintosh that we will do everything that we can within the powers that we have. I point to community jobs Scotland and the employer recruitment incentive, which is the most ambitious employer recruitment incentive wage subsidy programme anywhere in the UK and will create up to 10,000 jobs.</p><p>One of the tasks that I hope to complete imminently is the signing off of grant letters to local authorities so that they can support small and medium-sized businesses in their areas in getting young people into work. Mr Macintosh should be reassured that the &#163;25 million of Scottish Government and European money will be well spent in partnership with local authorities and small to medium-sized businesses with a view to making a difference for our young people.</p><p>The challenge of youth unemployment is compounded by an economic downturn and structural changes to the labour market. To address the economic downturn, we need to reinvigorate the economy. We need economic growth. In that regard, I would prefer simply to have a Parliament with a full range of powers than a Parliament with limited powers.</p><p>On the structural changes in the labour market, we know that there are fewer entry-level jobs for young people. We also know that word of mouth is still the number 1 form of recruitment, which disadvantages young people. We know that young people are held back not by their lack of qualifications or a lack of talent but by their lack of experience. Their only crime is being young.</p><p>Therefore, we need to ask companies large and small to have youth policies&#8212;policies in which they go the extra mile to recruit young people. The small and medium-sized companies are our untapped potential. That is why the employer recruitment incentive, which will be delivered very soon, is important.</p><p>However, as well as making our ask of employers, we need to change how we deliver education, skills and training. That is what the reform of colleges and the modernisation of careers services are about.</p><p>We have achieved good outcomes. We have more young people in full-time college courses, higher retention rates and higher completion rates. That will improve job prospects, but the outcome of education is not, in itself, a qualification; the outcome for any education is jobs and whether our young people are in part-time jobs, full-time jobs or well-paid work. In that regard, it is not the length of courses that matters but the content of courses and the connectivity between the world of work and the world of education.</p><p>I welcome the change in tone from Labour members. I have often been more concerned that their focus is on knocking down solutions rather than building them up.</p><p>I will end with the words of Harry Burns. He often talks about how we all have to take the responsibility to nurture very young children and treasure babies.</p><p>Similarly, we all have a responsibility to ensure that our young people are supported, guided and nurtured, and that they are enabled to spread their wings and to become independent in the workplace. Instead of giving them just one helping hand, I and the Government want to help them with both hands. That is what having the powers of independence is all about&#8212;it is about being able to use absolutely everything that we have at our disposal, from tax to welfare. I again call on those who wish to abandon powers to Westminster to think again.

As we know, the legislative framework at the time meant that blacklisting was not illegal but, as Elaine Smith told us, the Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010, which were introduced by the UK Government in 2010, prohibit blacklisting.

I always think that the Parliament is at its best when its members bring to bear their expertise and knowledge from their previous lives, and it is important to note that nearly 40 members signed the motion.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm told us about the shopping that is available in Edinburgh; John Mason highlighted the facilities in Glasgow; and Elaine Murray spoke about the outlet village at Gretna. Over the years, I have frequented all of those as well as the shops and facilities in Livingston in my constituency. Like Richard Lyle, I believe that shopping is important.</p><p>Turning to a more serious issue than my own guilty pleasures, I am heartened by the cross-Parliament and cross-party recognition of the importance of the retail sector not only to our economy but in its investment in skills, jobs and, crucially, our communities. In my constituency, Morrisons runs a great programme that takes primary school children into the store and exposes them to a great learning environment where they can find out not only about food but about the range of jobs that support supermarkets. It is also a great example of the opportunities that are afforded by curriculum for excellence.</p><p>There is no doubt that retail makes a significant contribution to our economy and its health is a very visible barometer of the economic climate. Like other sectors, it has had its own challenges, difficulties and, indeed, successes. Unlike other areas, retail continued to grow in the early part of the recession in 2008-09. However, from 2010 onwards, growth was far more modest and, over the past year, it has very much flatlined and now lags behind other areas. That said, the fact that retail sales in December were 1.5 per cent higher than those the previous year will, I hope, give some grounds for optimism.</p><p>Retail employs 251,000 people&#8212;or 10.2 per cent of the employed population&#8212;if we include the owners of shops or retail outlets who actually work in their business. However, I have always been interested not only in the direct employment opportunities that are created by retail; in its briefing, Asda highlights the additional 10,000 jobs that it supports via its supply chain. We must feel heartened when we hear of the Asda store in Forfar that employs the previously long-term unemployed; in fact, 80 per cent of the staff who were recruited for that store had been unemployed.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm and others spoke of the opportunities that the retail sector affords young people and I certainly know that it is very often a young person&#8217;s first experience of work. I experienced it myself in my mid to late teens; indeed, I attribute my varicose veins to standing in a shop for many hours. However, we must recognise the range of jobs in the retail sector and the opportunities that are available from entry level right up to graduate level. It is heartening to find that the sector is recruiting on the basis of aptitude and attitude; it is very much a meritocracy, where people such as Andy Clark can rise from the shop floor to become the chief executive officer of a major supermarket.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that Aldi is recruiting 17 and 18-year-olds to train them up as store managers and that, in my capacity as Minister for Youth Employment, I have met representatives of these stores and visited Asda, Tesco, John Lewis and so on. Indeed, one young person whom I met in a major supermarket told me that, if I was serious about youth employment and boosting the economy, I would use the &#163;30 million of youth opportunities funding to build three supermarkets. However, such a suggestion would, to say the least, get me into hot water.</p><p>There is no doubt that retail has an important contribution to make as part of the make young people your business campaign. There is a positive business case for employing young people, and the retail sector demonstrates that well.</p><p>It is important to recognise that 96 per cent of retail businesses are small. For that reason, the employer recruitment incentive for small employers to employ young people, which will go live in April, is important. As a result of an earlier members&#8217; business debate, I gave a commitment to ensure that all members get good information on the make young people your business campaign and the employer recruitment incentive, in addition to information on other offers that are available locally and nationally, so that MSPs can go out and engage with businesses in their localities.</p><p>On the skills agenda, it is important to recognise the difficulties in the current climate. Members have mentioned HMV, Jessops, Blockbuster, Comet and so on. There is no doubt that, as shoppers, our habits are changing, and the fact that online sales have increased presents challenges to the high street. One facility that I would like to emphasise is the flexible training opportunities initiative, which can be used by small businesses for practically any training opportunity that can allow them to retrain their staff. There may well be a great opportunity for small retailers to train up their staff in things such as e-commerce.</p><p>However, there is a lot of work to do to regenerate our high streets. The proposed cross-party group on towns and town centres will, no doubt, be crucial in taking forward, among other things, dialogue with the Government on how we can continue to celebrate the successes and push for further success in retail but also reinvigorate our town centres.</p><p>13:07 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683977", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Retail Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Margaret McCulloch on securing this debate.

I say to all MSPs that I am always more than willing to support their endeavours in their constituencies.</p><p>In that vein, I know that Margaret McCulloch has done some interesting work with key sectors&#8212;I am thinking about hospitality&#8212;building on her past experience as a training provider. Kezia Dugdale is not here today, but the work that she does in offering a paid internship through her offices as an MSP is another important example of what we, as individuals, can do.</p><p>I acknowledge the contributions of all the speakers in tonight&#8217;s debate&#8212;David Torrance, Margaret McCulloch, Richard Lyle, Mary Scanlon and Linda Fabiani. The debate has been a mature and reflective one.</p><p>We all know that, to successfully tackle youth unemployment, we need a concerted effort on a number of levels. Action has to be rooted in the local and macro economies. We often have debates in the chamber about the need for economic growth, how to use capital investment and the austerity agenda, and we often have debates that touch on constitutional arguments and the powers that the Scottish Parliament does and does not have. Our response to youth unemployment cannot just be about responding to rising unemployment as a result of the recession; we need to address structural unemployment as well.</p><p>Despite the magnitude of the issues and the scale of the challenge, we must not underestimate the role that we can all play both as individuals and collectively. It is imperative that we have the support of members of the Scottish Parliament for the make young people your business campaign. I was heartened by the speeches that members made tonight, because we are all, in our own ways, agents of change. We all have networks and contacts in our constituencies and we have scope to make a difference at a local level. We heard about some of the ideas and the good work that is going on in that regard in the debate.</p><p>At its core, the motion is about combating the perceptions that sometimes exist about young people. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills is showing through its work that the vast majority of our young people are work ready, and they should not be shy about saying that. That does not mean that there are not some young people who need additional support on their journey towards and into work, but the vast majority are willing and able to work. What they lack is opportunity, not talent. Therefore, we must address the fact that only 25 per cent of businesses recruit directly from education and the fact that the proportion of young people in the workforce, in both the public and private sectors, has been declining since 2005.</p><p>David Torrance mentioned Pamela Scott from Diageo. She attended the national economic forum last February, which focused solely on youth unemployment, then went back to her employer at Diageo and went to work on their own youth employment plan. Indeed, Diageo now has a support package for that and has invested &#163;5 million of its own money in it.</p><p>At the heart of the make young people your business campaign is making a positive business case for employing a young person, which is not just the right thing but the smart thing to do. We have young people who are willing to work and ready to learn and who are, as Margaret McCulloch said, flexible and loyal. They are most certainly not a burden; indeed, they are an asset. Young people can make a contribution to any business and could have a positive impact on the bottom line.</p><p>Given the challenges that businesses of all sizes face, I accept that we must make it easier for businesses to employ young people and that we should provide them with information about the employer recruitment incentive, which will be live this April, and other information tools, such as the our skillsforce website. In that regard, James Dornan made an important suggestion about an information pack that could go to members of the Scottish Parliament, and Linda Fabiani was right to say that the information should be relevant at the local level. I will therefore go away and look at how we can devise an information pack for constituency and list MSPs that will actively assist them in their work in their own communities and constituencies if they are going on employer visits or visiting businesses or, indeed, going along to their local Rotary meeting to tell other people about the benefits of employing young people and what assistance is available.</p><p>Preparing that material will not be a small bit of work, and there is perhaps scope for the Government to look at having a paid internship for that piece of work. There could be an argument for employing a young person to take on the work, given the skills that they often have in communication and social media. We will go away and look at that, because I certainly want to do everything that I can to assist members of the Scottish Parliament in their constituency work, particularly if it will assist local businesses and help more of our young people to get into work.</p><p>There has been some discussion tonight about the importance of work experience. Of course, it is important, but it must be ethical, voluntary and high quality. Certainly, the Government&#8217;s provision in that regard&#8212;our work experience programmes and internships&#8212;are all paid. The issue of work experience also touches on Skills Development Scotland&#8217;s certificate of work readiness, which is now increasingly used in get ready for work training courses. It builds work experience into a training course, and the work experience is assessed by the employer. That means that, in effect, the certificate can act as a reference.</p><p>Like Margaret McCulloch, I pay tribute to Sir Willie Haughey and his youth with hope initiative, which is a very pragmatic initiative. I certainly wish it every success and I look forward to hearing how it develops. As Linda Fabiani said, we all have to be advocates for the young people in our communities.</p><p>For the second month in a row, the labour market statistics have been positive. It is important that we mark that we have had the largest-ever fall since those particular records began in 2006. I very much welcome the fact that we have 23,000 fewer young unemployed Scots now than we did at this time last year. However, one unemployed Scot is one too many for this Government. We still have 82,000 16 to 24-year-olds seeking work. We must all address that. Unemployment remains too high and now is most certainly not the time for us to take our foot off the gas in that regard. There is always more to do and we must always do more in challenging each other, because we cannot let ourselves or our young people become the victims of a cycle of despair. What Linda Fabiani said is worth repeating: we need to be advocates for young people.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:09.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682849", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Make Young People Your Business"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate James Dornan on securing this debate.

I was trying to say that, in comparison to the UK, we perform better on employment, inactivity and unemployment. However, Ms Scanlon is factually correct to say that there is a marginal reduction in the employment figure. From memory, I think that it was either 0.1 or 0.2 per cent.</p><p>The employability fund forms part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to supporting people towards and into work. It sits alongside a unique guarantee of a place in education or training for all 16 to 19-year-olds; at least 25,000 modern apprenticeship places in every year of this session of the Parliament; and the upcoming &#163;15 million employer recruitment incentive.</p><p>Colleges are key providers of employability provision, but they are delivering in a period of considerable change, so we are responding positively to their call for stability. That is why we have asked the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council to allocate &#163;18 million to colleges within the existing committed resources for 2013-14 in addition to the &#163;6 million that they will get from Skills Development Scotland. That money forms part of our &#163;500 million-plus commitment to colleges that was previously announced in the draft Scottish budget. It also reaffirms our support for the work that the sector does to help people to get jobs.</p><p>Central to our endeavours as we move forward in 2013 is making the business case to employers that young people can play a strong part in our economic recovery. That is highlighted in the make young people your business recruitment campaign for young people, which I launched just before the recess. That campaign is about changing hearts and minds. There are around 330,000 companies in Scotland of all shapes and sizes, and around 86,000 young people in Scotland are looking for opportunities to work. Between us, I am sure that we can find ways to mobilise our combined resources and shared appetite to help young people move towards and into employment, thereby giving them hope for their future.</p><p>In that work, we are not just responding to recession. The Government is undertaking a wide programme of reform. It is tackling structural issues to drive employment opportunities through reforms to the post-16 learning system and is delivering on the promises of curriculum for excellence to better prepare our young people for the jobs of the future. The scale of our ambition is not limited to achieving a return to pre-recession levels of youth unemployment. Prior to the recession, during a time of economic growth, rates of youth unemployment in Scotland were still around 14 per cent, which, to my mind, is far too high.</p><p>With that in mind, I recently visited Brussels and the Hague to investigate why a small cluster of northern European countries have continued to experience very low levels of youth unemployment during the economic downturn. I want to replicate that success for Scotland&#8217;s young people, because they deserve nothing less.</p><p>This Government is ambitious for all of Scotland&#8217;s young people. Action for jobs, our youth employment strategy, sets out short, medium and long-term actions to support young people. It is built on three strategic themes: adopting an all-Government, all-Scotland approach; enhancing our offer to and support for young people; and engaging with employers. Above all, it is a call to those who can effect change&#8212;those who can bring people together to provide better solutions for the young people who are out of work&#8212;to do so.</p><p>As part of our all-Government, all-Scotland approach, I have led a series of regional action forums, which have involved young people who are affected by unemployment in action-focused discussions with local employers, key stakeholders and many MSPs who are here today. I have also held a national rural skills summit and a women&#8217;s employment summit, and last month, in partnership with Young Scot and the Scottish Youth Parliament, I hosted a national employment summit for young people, which brought together more than 100 young people and gave them the opportunity to engage directly with a range of Government ministers and other senior stakeholders to identify what measures would be most effective in supporting them towards employment.</p><p>Those events have given me an opportunity to engage directly with young people and employers, both of whom have been clear on how we can help them to succeed. They have told me that we need a more joined-up skills and employment system and more support for employers to recruit young people; that young people want better careers guidance; and that young people have asked for more high-quality job opportunities and work experience.</p><p>In response to that, we are enhancing our offer to young people. Overall, we are harnessing additional resources across Government and our agencies up to the value of &#163;80 million to support some 23,000 young people towards and into work. We have made clear our unprecedented commitment to young people in Scotland through opportunities for all and have prioritised 16 to 19-year-olds in the 46,000 training places, including 25,000 modern apprenticeships, that will be available each year for the duration of the parliamentary session.</p><p>We are modernising the careers services by making them more flexible and responsive to the needs of our young people. Graduates, too, are being supported by the provision of high-quality, paid graduate placement programmes. We are piloting a scheme to offer recruitment incentives to small companies to take on an unemployed graduate. To support young entrepreneurs, the Scottish Investment Bank has allocated around &#163;1 million for 2012-13 to the revolving loan fund, which will support young people who are interested in starting or growing their business through access to loans. In the coming year, we will build on that work and will continue to respond to the needs of young people and employers.</p><p>I will continue to engage with employers of all sizes and in all sectors to identify and address the barriers that they face in employing young people. Yesterday, I visited Stepper Technology, which, in the past year, along with its sister company MES Marine &amp; Engineering Services, has taken on 22 new employees, of whom 15 are under 24. Stepper Technology feels that the business community has a social responsibility to ensure that young people are employed and well trained.</p><p>Bigger companies&#8212;such as Diageo, which is investing &#163;5 million of its own money in youth programmes&#8212;know that it makes sense to recruit young people. They are passionate about helping young people to grow and to realise their full potential, because they get it&#8212;they know that their success in the future will depend on the quality of the young people whom they attract now, so recruiting some of the best and brightest young people is a key part of their strategy. Through such practices, they can be safe in the knowledge that skills will be passed on to the next generation, which enables companies such as Diageo to remain world leaders in the highly competitive spirits industry.</p><p>We are responding to help employers to recruit young people. The employer recruitment incentive, which John Swinney announced in the draft budget, will support about 10,000 young people into work. The our skillsforce service, which draws together national and local services, will help employers to plan, recruit and develop skills for the workplace. That has been directly influenced by feedback that was received from employers during my series of action forums.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681238", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes, there was a marginal reduction in the employment figure.

The thinking behind the employer recruitment incentive is very much that it should enhance our offer to older young people, by whom I mean 18 to 24-year-olds.

We also want to ensure additionality from the use of public resource. We are working closely with colleagues in local government, trade unions and the Federation of Small Businesses on how, in addition to providing financial incentives, we can help small businesses and microbusinesses to recruit young people and on how we can help those businesses with practicalities.</p><p>There is demand from employers. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills employer perspectives survey report, which was published on 12 December, showed that employers in Scotland were more likely than those in the rest of the UK to have taken on someone who is under 25 in the 12 months that preceded the survey.</p><p>The public sector is rising to the challenge, too. I have asked public bodies and other agencies to create opportunities for our young people. I am heartened by the response so far but, as always, there is more to do. Perth and Kinross Council is committed to offering 50 modern apprenticeship places for the next three years, Scottish Enterprise recently recruited 20 new apprentices, with a view to doubling its young workforce, and NHS Tayside is developing a modern apprenticeship in care.</p><p>I will highlight a proposal from the European Commission, which suggests a European Council resolution to introduce a youth guarantee across European member states. That would seek to provide young people up to the age of 25 with an offer of employment, further education or training within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. I support that proposal, which is worthy of further debate and exploration. It is clear that public employment services are fundamental to the success of such a scheme. With that in mind, I have written to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to suggest an early discussion of an approach across the UK that will work for Scotland.</p><p>We are in the midst of a debate about the sort of country that we want to live in&#8212;I, for one, want to live in a nation with a Parliament that has the full range of job-creating powers&#8212;but, right now, we must all continue with our all-Scotland, all-Government approach. I include everybody in the Parliament in that.

I commend those efforts and I ask all members to do more for the young people in their constituencies. In the same way as members urge me and the Scottish Government to do more, I very much believe in a relationship of mutual challenge.</p><p>We each must play our part to make young people the business of all of us and to do all that we can to support them through the current difficult economic times.

I should emphasise that one reason why the Government funds the modern apprenticeship programme in every framework between the ages of 16 and 24 is, among other things, due to a recognition that quite often care leavers may not be ready to participate in a modern apprenticeship between the ages of 16 and 19 and may be in their 20s before they can do so.</p><p>As one of the children&#8217;s charities highlighted in its briefing paper&#8212;Alison Johnstone also raised this point&#8212;we need to do more to promote the modern apprenticeship programme among all children and young people. Members may be interested to know that the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration is a good public sector employer that leads by example in employing looked-after children, but I accept that much more needs to be done. As we go into 2013, as always we must seek to raise our game in terms of looked-after children. Yes, positive destinations for looked-after children have increased from 44 per cent to 55 per cent&#8212;those figures relate to sustained destinations&#8212;but that is still simply just not good enough.</p><p>Regarding Mr Macintosh&#8217;s speech, I say to him that I think that we agree on the scale of the problem. We know and understand the scarring or life-changing impact of youth unemployment that David Blanchflower has described. I also share Mr Macintosh&#8217;s concerns about long-term unemployment. That is why we have introduced, among other things, an employer recruitment incentive. I also share the concerns about underemployment, which is an issue for young people, is bad for our economy and is also an issue for women workers and for some graduates. Like others, I look forward to learning more about the issue from the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8217;s inquiry.</p><p>I also agree with Mr Macintosh on the importance of capital investment, given that every &#163;100 million of capital investment is estimated to support 1,400 jobs. Yes, the challenge is to ensure that, when we get economic growth, our young people are given the opportunity to benefit from that growth, and that is where procurement comes in. I began work with Mr Neil on the sustainable procurement bill&#8212;this is an all-Government approach&#8212;and, as part of our legislative programme, that work will continue with Ms Sturgeon.</p><p>On housing, which is mentioned in Mr Macintosh&#8217;s amendment although he did not say much about it in the debate, all that I will say is that our record is better than his. Perhaps, just now and again, Mr Macintosh and others could, with a bit more good grace, acknowledge the positives. We cannot allow ourselves to succumb to a cycle of despair. We must give out a strong and clear message that, whatever the scale of the challenge, we will strain every sinew to tackle the challenge. We must ensure that our young people receive a message of hope and not a message of despair.</p><p>I would have been more reassured if the Opposition had welcomed the recent drop in youth unemployment&#8212;25,000 fewer young people are unemployed now than were at this time last year. I know that this is no time for us to be taking our foot off the pedal, but that is a welcome step in the right direction.</p><p>Mr Macintosh talks about action. As part of our all-Government, all-Scotland response, we have identified an additional &#163;80 million to assist 23,000 young Scots towards and into work. He talks about evaluation, too. I agree that that is important; we had a debate about that on Tuesday. However, the Labour Party never says which programme is not working, which programme it wants to improve or which programme it would scrap. Our national training programmes deliver a good job, but they can do much better. That is one of the reasons why we are moving towards an employability fund and moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach, and why we are having pre-vocational and pre-employment training that meets the needs of young people&#8212;including those young people most disadvantaged and far removed&#8212;and local economies.</p><p>I would have hoped that there would be some cognisance of the record levels of modern apprenticeships, the employment recruitment initiative, initiatives such as community jobs Scotland and the third sector challenge fund. We are taking a plethora of action.</p><p>Bruce Crawford made the sensible point that the Opposition never says how it will pay for its proposals for additional expenditure. I very much believe in social democracy, but I also know that we have to be able to pay for that.</p><p>A good thing about the debate is that we have, in a consensual manner, articulated that there are three strands to tacking youth unemployment. First, there is what we can do as individuals. We have heard about the jobs fair. I had one in my constituency and James Dornan had a hugely successful one. Labour members have also organised activities in their constituencies with a view to addressing issues relevant to their local needs. I urge all members to get behind and promote, in their constituencies, opportunities for all and the helpline, our modern apprenticeship programme and the make young people your business campaign, and to promote the employer recruitment incentive among small business, because that is where it is targeted.</p><p>One change that has occurred over the past decade that has adversely affected young people in the labour market is the reduction of large business and the rise of small business. Small businesses invariably want to recruit those who are tried and tested. There are other structural changes in the labour market that have had an adverse impact on young people. We need to create more entry-level jobs&#8212;that ladder of opportunity has been taken away from many school leavers who have reasonable qualifications.</p><p>We need economic and structural change to tackle youth unemployment. There is a case for structural reforms in relation to the early years, curriculum for excellence, colleges and career guidance. We have to make tough decisions in response to Tory cuts and adversity. However, we are also reforming public services in terms of prevention and early intervention. I hope that all members will unite behind the European Commission&#8217;s call and support its proposal for a youth guarantee to all young people up to the age of 25 that, within four months of unemployment, they can secure a place in education, get a job or get further training. That is something positive that we could engage with the UK Government to achieve. I hope that I will receive members&#8217; support for that.</p><p>Change always happens. If we consider the NEET rate and youth unemployment at a time of economic growth, we see that we need change. Can any member look me in the face and say that it is not necessary? There are other countries in Europe that, despite the economic recession, have youth unemployment levels of less than 10 per cent.</p><p>I commend the good work that is taking place. We should celebrate the reduction in youth unemployment as a step in the right direction, but I assure the Parliament that we will most certainly not take our foot off the gas. We will, indeed, strive for a Parliament that has the full range of job-creating powers.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681238", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I have moved on.

I understand and very much share his concerns for the workers in his region and across Scotland.</p><p>Like all other banks in Scotland and beyond, the Clydesdale Bank faces significant pressures as a result of the financial crisis. As we have heard, in response to those difficulties, National Australia Bank&#8212;the owner of the Clydesdale Bank and the Yorkshire Bank&#8212;announced on 7 February that it would undertake a strategic review of its UK operations. That review was prompted by poor economic and trading conditions in the UK.</p><p>As Mr Smith said, jobs have been lost. Two business and private banking centres in Dunfermline and Paisley are to close and two satellite centres in Inverurie and Bearsden will also close. We heard from Mr Bibby about the community impact of closures, although I say to him that Renfrewshire receives opportunities for all funding in relation to youth employment.</p><p>The Clydesdale Bank reports that all bar 14 of the 51 people located in the four affected centres have transferred to new roles in the Clydesdale Bank or the National Australia Bank Group. Of those 14 people, seven applied for voluntary severance and seven were affected by compulsory redundancy. The Clydesdale Bank reports 104 redundancies in Scotland between October 2011 and September 2012, 84 of which were through voluntary severance. The bank&#8217;s figures state that, between October and December this year, a further 66 positions were to be made redundant. The number of redundancies is in excess of 170.</p><p>As Mr Smith said, we have heard about the new positions that will be created in Glasgow. The Clydesdale Bank&#8217;s stated position is that, over the review period, which takes us up to 2015, the net reduction in roles in Scotland will be fewer than 100. However, like Mr Smith, I think that any job loss must be regretted. We heard Richard Lyle&#8217;s personal account of being a financial services worker who experienced redundancy. James Kelly was correct to articulate the human costs of redundancy, which affect not just individuals but their families and communities.</p><p>The Clydesdale Bank has articulated its intention that, wherever possible, it is seeking to minimise the number of job losses and is striving to preserve the bank&#8217;s Scottish base. The bank has said that it will maintain its retail network of 149 Scottish branches and its retail front-line staffing levels.</p><p>According to the bank, compulsory redundancies will be made only as a last resort and so far the majority of job losses have been achieved through voluntary severance. Nevertheless, I recognise that every job lost creates enormous difficulty for the employees concerned, particularly at this time of year. There is never a good time for redundancy but it feels so much worse at Christmas, and all our thoughts are with those workers and their families.</p><p>I wish to reassure Mr Smith and to answer some of Mr Brown&#8217;s points with regard to this Government&#8217;s support and the contact that we have had with Unite the union and the Clydesdale Bank. This Government is doing&#8212;and will continue to do&#8212;all that it can to support those who are affected by redundancies and we are maintaining close contact with the Clydesdale Bank, particularly as the review progresses.</p><p>Both the First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth spoke to David Thorburn&#8212;the chief executive of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks&#8212;when the strategic review was first announced and they discussed the protection of employment in Scotland. In May, the First Minister, who chairs the Financial Services Advisory Board, had the opportunity at a FiSAB meeting to be with both David Thorburn and David Fleming from Unite the union. In October, the First Minister had his most recent biannual with the Scottish Trades Union Congress and Agnes Tolmie from Unite was part of that.</p><p>Yesterday, 19 December, the First Minister met representatives from Unite the union to discuss the situation. The First Minister has also now written to the Clydesdale Bank to seek reassurances that everything possible is being done to minimise compulsory redundancies and that there will be no branch closures as a result of the review. The First Minister&#8217;s letter is also supportive of Unite&#8217;s offer to work with the bank to make more training opportunities available to workers. In particular, there is the chartered banker professional standards foundation grade&#8212;Stewart Stevenson spoke of the importance of banking qualifications.</p><p>Members will be aware of the role and purpose of the finance sector jobs task force, which works directly with companies to co-ordinate public sector support where restructuring may result in reduction in employee numbers. The task force has offered support to the Clydesdale Bank and will continue to do so throughout the review period. In October, the chair of the task force, Jill Farrell from Scottish Enterprise, also met the Clydesdale Bank.</p><p>Importantly, the partnership action for continuing employment&#8212;PACE&#8212;initiative that provides extensive tailored help and support for employees anywhere in Scotland who are affected by redundancy, also stands ready to provide any support that is required. Where PACE can intervene early, even in these difficult economic times it has considerable success in supporting staff who experience redundancy on to further work.</p><p>I know that the National Australia Bank has appointed Penna PLC to support staff who are at risk of redundancy and PACE has continued to make an offer to Penna over and above what Penna is contracted to do. Penna has said that it will certainly refer to PACE as required. As the skills minister, I am happy to keep a watchful eye on that.</p><p>James Kelly touched on the important issue of skilled jobs. Of the financial services workforce, 38 per cent are graduates and 50 per cent are qualified at Scottish vocational qualification level 4 or above. One of the challenges for the economy right now is not just unemployment but underemployment, so sectors that employ skilled and qualified staff are very important.</p><p>We all know that this is a difficult time for the financial services sector in Scotland and globally.

All that I can say is, &#8220;Look at this face.&#8221; Every one of my 42 years&#8212;and more&#8212;shows. I am the Minister for Youth Employment, the mother of one child, I have 64,000 constituents, and I just do not have time to participate in playground politics. Never in my life as an MSP, a minister in the Government or a social worker have I walked around pretending that everything in life is all right. I wonder whether the Labour Party would spend as much time as it spends challenging the Government&#8212;something that I am quite comfortable with&#8212;in challenging our UK Government counterparts and arguing for more constitutional and economic powers for this Parliament, which would really enable us to tackle youth unemployment.</p><p>I am proud that, in my first year, I have managed to secure an additional &#163;80 million that will help 23,000 young folk towards and into work, but I have no illusions: there is much, much more to do. I have a vision of a Scotland that will learn from and match the best in Europe&#8212;countries such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, which, despite the global economic recession, have youth unemployment rates of less than 10 per cent. That is what we should be working towards.</p><p>As I said, I enjoyed the speeches from members from across the chamber&#8212;even some of the more idiosyncratic contributions. I was pleased to hear that Mary Scanlon was advised to be a social worker. I am told that Alasdair Allan was once advised to be an undertaker. [Laughter.]</p><p>However, in all seriousness, we are fortunate in Scotland to have professionally trained and qualified careers information, advice and guidance staff. We know that, south of the border, they have removed the funding altogether and placed a statutory responsibility on schools. I want to maximise the impact that those professionals can have on young lives by fully utilising the skills that careers staff possess.</p><p>At the Education and Culture Committee, one of the witnesses commented that they did not expect careers services to change lives. I have to tell the Parliament that I and the Government are in the business of changing lives, and the expectation that we must all have of each other as politicians and of anybody who has contact with and influence over young lives&#8212;be they careers staff, teachers, social workers or youth workers&#8212;is that we are all in the business of raising hopes and aspirations.</p><p>What an opportunity exists for our talented, skilled and professional careers guidance staff to work more intensively with some of our most disadvantaged young people. Those staff have the opportunity to improve life chances and indeed to change lives. To me, the issue is one of equality of opportunity, and we need to provide more support to those young people in need.</p><p>Yes, we will retain a universal baseline service with which we will provide careers guidance to 130,000 young people. I repeat that we are not replacing face-to-face contact with a sole reliance on web-based facilities. We are working with young people; we will work with them differently and we will work with more young people and groups. We need to use technology to not replace people but extend our reach and modernise the way that they work.</p><p>It genuinely saddens me that we do not recognise that the need to provide the most vulnerable with more support is a way to prevent young people from becoming NEET statistics, which is the point that Joan McAlpine made this afternoon.</p><p>The red, amber, green methodology is a framework for identifying and managing risk. As I am a former social worker who has worked with risky people and risky situations day in, day out, I know that no risk management tool ever replaces professional judgment. In SDS, ultimately I expect good professional judgment and common sense to prevail. However, we need a framework to work within, to try to prevent young people from slipping through the net and to ensure that no one is left behind.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Neil Findlay spoke of the need for evidence and I was glad that Ms Dugdale spoke of the evidence from the OECD in 2004. We have had evidence from the European Commission and the World Bank, and indeed the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, which has commissioners who are prominent trade members. The UKCES supports our direction of travel, as does the Smith group, which Joan McAlpine mentioned.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Careers Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much enjoyed the speeches that were made this afternoon by members from across the chamber and across the political divide.

The Government has boosted childcare funds by 42 per cent since 2006-07. We can stand firm and proud, given our record.

When workforce plus was launched six years ago, there was a focus on developing capacity in seven areas that faced the greatest employment challenges. Since then, I am pleased to say that local employability partnerships have voluntarily grown up in all 32 local authorities. Those partnerships, which are supported and often led by local authorities, include all the agencies with an interest in improving employability, ranging from Skills Development Scotland and the Department for Work and Pensions to health boards, colleges and, of course, the third sector. As such, they have been well placed to create more joined-up and effective services for people who are out of work.</p><p>At the same time, the Scottish Government has done some joining up of its own. For example, we created Skills Development Scotland out of four separate agencies to act as our national skills body. We have also improved the service for unemployed people by making clearer links between the work of Skills Development Scotland and that of the DWP through Jobcentre Plus. Last, but not least, our introduction of single outcome agreements has significantly strengthened the partnership between national and local government in Scotland.</p><p>I believe that those changes put us in a strong position to achieve the jobs and sustainable growth for which we aim. A lot has changed since the introduction of the original employability policy in 2006. Austerity cuts and the global economic downturn, combined with sweeping welfare reforms at United Kingdom level, have greatly changed the nature and scale of the challenge that we all face. Those factors emphasise the need for a fresh approach to employability&#8212;one in which the continuing challenge of helping people into work is matched by an equal determination to stimulate growth and hence the availability of jobs.</p><p>That is exactly the focus of &#8220;Working for Growth: A refresh of the employability framework for Scotland&#8221;. The document was launched only two weeks ago by my colleague John Swinney, when he addressed the welfare to work convention in Glasgow. As the title suggests, &#8220;Working for Growth&#8221; has a clear focus on jobs within the context of economic recovery. First and foremost, that means that we must simplify and enhance our offers to employers.</p><p>I understand the frustration that employers still often express about the difficulty of navigating our employment and skills system. I spoke to a range of employers at a business breakfast prior to the launch of the document, emphasising our desire to work closely with employers during these difficult times and beyond&#8212;in particular to harness the significant talents of our young people. That commitment is far reaching and is underpinned by our on-going development of skills investment plans for the key growth sectors in the economy.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674359", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am very grateful for the opportunity to open the debate on employability policy.

Importantly, the service will feature details of national and local offers. To complement that, we will look to employability partnerships to develop and enhance their own collaborative offers to employers.</p><p>We have a clear strategic focus on jobs within the context of economic recovery. The next step is to ensure clear and effective leadership in support of those goals. As we highlight in &#8220;Working for Growth&#8221;, working through the strategic forum and the economy board will be key to embedding employability more deeply into our efforts to revive the economy. The work of the reconstituted Scottish employability forum will also be key&#8212;it meets for the first time this month, and it will be chaired jointly by the Scottish and UK Governments and local government. The revised forum will exert much stronger political leadership than before and as such it will be well placed to set the national direction on employability in the coming years.</p><p>As those joint arrangements recognise, collaboration with the UK Government and its providers remains essential if we are to be effective in helping people into work. For example, the introduction of the work programme has been one of the biggest changes to the employment system in recent years and we will continue to monitor closely how that is being implemented in Scotland.</p><p>We also recognise that greater flexibility has been afforded to DWP districts recently and we see that as an opportunity for more effective integration of services at a local level. Of course, we are ultimately trying to help people&#8212;people who, even at the best of times, may struggle to find and sustain employment.

There is a range of equality issues that we need to take on board in discussion with our partners and stakeholders. This is work that I have already begun with stakeholders in terms of disability and race. It is not an easy nut to crack in the sense that, with some employers, we are trying to change cultures and attitudes within the workplace, but there is definitely more that we can do. Much will hinge on our raising employers&#8217; awareness of the programmes that the Government offers and making them aware that it is in their interest to have a diverse workforce. There is a positive business case for supporting diversity, whether in relation to young people, women or people with disabilities.</p><p>Mainstream employment is, of course, the ideal, and we will continue to promote the merits of the supported employment approach. However, we recognise that it may not be appropriate for all disabled people, so we recently commissioned a review of Scotland&#8217;s supported businesses, to be completed by next spring. The review will focus particularly on how the sustainability of such businesses can be improved in a difficult economic climate.</p><p>Finally, I highlight the continued importance of skills in helping people from all backgrounds to access and sustain employment. Evidence suggests that the possession of skills and qualifications is increasingly important in achieving employment of any kind. For that reason, we are not just maintaining but increasing our investment in skills during the current session of Parliament.</p><p>Those are just some of the ways in which we aim, with the help of our delivery partners, to improve people&#8217;s chances of gaining and sustaining employment.</p><p>Speaking of delivery partners, I confirm that local partnerships remain central to our goal of improving performance. That is why we launched &#8220;Working for Growth&#8221; in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. For example, we are well aware of the potential positive impact of community benefit causes. Increasingly, they are being used to good effect in public sector contracts to secure training and employment outcomes for local residents. In &#8220;Working for Growth&#8221;, we encourage local partnerships to share and learn from the examples of good practice that are available.</p><p>For our part, the Scottish Government will introduce a procurement reform bill, as announced in the legislative programme. Among other things, the bill will set an expectation that community benefit clauses be considered for all major contracts in the Scottish public sector. That is a major step forward.</p><p>&#8220;Working for Growth&#8221; sets out key ways in which we will target our national resources better and includes details of a new approach to employability funding that is better tailored to the needs of people and local labour markets. The new employability fund will from next year bring together our existing employability investments through Skills Development Scotland and the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council in a new partnership-led commissioning process. In developing the fund, we will learn from this year&#8217;s pilot scheme, through which SDS has commissioned job-focused learning from colleges.</p><p>There is much work to do, but we are well placed to achieve our goals. Alongside our youth employment strategy, &#8220;Working for Growth&#8221; is a vehicle through which we can maintain our focus on jobs and growth for Scotland in the coming months and years.

To be fair, Elaine Murray made an important speech, too, in making the link between housing and employability.

Yes, 10,000 more young people are in employment than this time last year, but youth unemployment has risen, as it is rising across Europe. The employment rate for women is higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, but women&#8217;s employment has fallen over the last quarter&#8212;although that is not the trend over the past year.

As John Park described, that response can sometimes be rather fractured and unhelpful, and we must always work hard to ensure that our citizens are not passed from pillar to post. If we are serious about economic growth, we must also be serious about tackling inequality and the barriers associated with age, gender and disability.</p><p>The debate&#8217;s largest theme was about the importance of employers.

I am not inclined to accept the Tory amendment. [Interruption.] Is that because of Mr Johnstone&#8217;s speech? There is a little bit more to it than that. It struck me that the amendment was just a bit mean-spirited and contained the implication that we were wasting money. As I intimated to Gavin Brown earlier, I report to Michael Russell and to John Swinney. Anyone who knows anything about John Swinney will know that it is necessary to be robust to get each penny of expenditure past him. I am just so glad that John Swinney is my boss and not my husband. [Laughter.] Mr Russell may laugh, but I spend so much time having to account to Mr Swinney on value for money and how I am spending my budget that, unlike Labour members, I have never had time to read Mr Russell&#8217;s books.</p><p>We have had an outbreak of consensus in the tone and substance of the debate but, as Bruce Crawford said, the Labour amendment is a bit of a moanfest of an amendment. I assure the whole chamber that this Government is not in denial. We are most certainly not in denial about Tory cuts, which are being made right now. We are making tough decisions and reforming public services such as colleges while maintaining our priorities.

Both the First Minister and Deputy First Minister addressed the 150 delegates, which clearly reflects the fact that women&#8217;s employment is an issue of national importance that is at the heart of this Government, and that women are crucial to economic recovery.</p><p>The other keynote speaker, Professor Ailsa McKay of the University of Strathclyde&#8212;a key member of the equality budget advisory group&#8212;set out in stark terms the challenge that lies before us, but she also set out the opportunity that we have to move forward from the summit in order to make a real difference to women&#8217;s lives.</p><p>Let me be clear that the event was not a one-off&#8212;the summit is a springboard for fresh impetus to identify action in the short, medium and longer terms, as a matter both of equality and economic necessity. I am committed to informing and involving Parliament every step of the way, as we develop a renewed and focused plan of action.</p><p>I was pleased to see members of the Equal Opportunities Committee attend the summit, and I hope that it was useful, given the committee&#8217;s upcoming inquiry into women and work. I want to record my thanks and appreciation to Agnes Tolmie, this year&#8217;s president of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, who chaired the summit. I am grateful to Agnes and to the STUC women&#8217;s committee for all their work in the lead-up to the summit and on the day.</p><p>I also want to thank Samantha Ritchie and Rachael Macleod, the two students who made the film that was shown at the summit. The film, which was completed as part of their internships with Unite the Union, was a great snapshot of working women in Scotland today. I also want to acknowledge the young engineering apprentice Jessica King, who talked eloquently about her experiences as a modern apprentice in a non-traditional occupation for women.</p><p>I will not be able to cover all the discussions from the day, but I will endeavour to give an overview of them. One of the overwhelming messages from the summit was the importance to working parents&#8212;working mothers, in particular&#8212;of flexible, accessible and affordable early learning and childcare. Childcare is an economic issue. It is a vital part of this country&#8217;s infrastructure, which can provide a route out of worklessness and can increase access to rewarding careers. We have already announced changes that will see parents in Scotland being able to access the highest overall level of Government-funded childcare and early learning provision anywhere in the UK.</p><p>The summit discussions will inform the sub-group of the early years task force that we have set up to help us to develop a long-term vision for family support, family centres and integrated early learning and childcare. It will take into account the many and varied childcare requirements of families today, which include the need for care for children in rural areas, out of school care, care in school holidays and care for children whose parents work shifts.</p><p>As well as a lack of suitable childcare, many women face other equally significant challenges in entering work. Those who face such challenges include women with disabilities, women from ethnic minority backgrounds, lone parents and ex-offenders. Women need to be supported to recognise their existing skills and talents and how best to build on them. Access to further skills and employment support is crucial. In addition, the strong view was expressed at the summit that money advice is key for many women.</p><p>It is clear that welfare reform is having a significant impact on women and their aspirations. This year&#8217;s report by the Fawcett Society, &#8220;The Impact of Austerity on Women&#8221;, concludes that the welfare reform changes, combined with the high cost of childcare, are forcing women to give up their jobs, as the cost of childcare outweighs the benefits of work. A survey that was conducted by Working Mums found that 24 per cent of mothers have had to give up work as a result of the changes.</p><p>For women who are looking for work, the requirement to claim jobseekers allowance means that many are finding it harder to access skills provision. Although the Scottish Government offers up to &#163;1,215 in lone-parent childcare grant to help lone parents who attend further or higher education, the changes to benefits legislation mean that fewer lone parents can now attend college without losing benefits.</p><p>For women who enter work, occupational segregation is an issue, as the group discussions highlighted. The reasons for occupational segregation are many and complex. A change in culture and attitudes is required, alongside a shift in policy and practice.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673754", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women&#8217;s Employment Summit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have this early opportunity to report back to Parliament on the women&#8217;s employment summit that was held on 12 September.

I am always willing to hear ideas and proposals about how the modern apprenticeship programme could play its part in addressing occupational segregation, but we must be realistic and be aware that we cannot tackle occupational segregation by focusing on one part of that system in isolation.</p><p>We have heard some rumblings about the council tax freeze, which is something that this Government is proud to support and to continue with, but there are credible economic arguments that state that putting and keeping money in women&#8217;s pockets is the best way to address things such as poverty and child poverty.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm made the point that our young women are outperforming our young men in their educational performance in terms of their attainment and the numbers that are going into further and higher education. That begs the question about what happens to women after they achieve high qualifications. What happens to women in particular sectors, whether that is oil and gas or the IT sectors, or the STEM professions? We must use the educational achievement of our young women as the platform for tackling occupational segregation; in no way should we turn back the clock by undermining progressive policies, such as tuition fees, when more young women are now going into further and higher education.</p><p>On skills shortages, it must be a quid pro quo. I am the first to say that we need to do more to recognise and support the needs of industry, but we must say to those who highlight skills shortages that half of the population&#8217;s talents and skills are being underutilised.</p><p>Last month&#8217;s summit gave us an opportunity to start a conversation with women from across Scotland and to seek their views on what should be done to make a real difference. In the coming months that conversation will, no doubt, continue through the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s inquiry and, of course, the STUC women&#8217;s conference in November. I am confident that those events and processes will very much influence the Scottish Government&#8217;s work.</p><p>In February next year, following a commitment to Parliament in June, the Scottish Government will hold an event to consider what more can be done to increase women&#8217;s representation in public life.

We need to be clear about where Government and employers have a responsibility, and where individuals can take advantage of further opportunities.

As well as having an obvious portfolio interest, like other members I have a wider political and personal commitment to ensuring that women have an equal opportunity to get into and progress in work. I welcome the upcoming Equal Opportunities Committee inquiry into women and work, and I look forward to the committee&#8217;s discussions and findings.</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises that women face barriers to not just getting into work, but sustaining jobs in certain sectors, as well as experiencing difficulties with the availability of flexible working and progression opportunities. The Parliament has rightly focused its attention on the rise in female unemployment in recent times. Although the female employment rate in Scotland remains higher than in the rest of the United Kingdom, it has, over the past year, dropped by around 1.2 per cent. The situation is particularly acute for young women. Unemployment is rising faster among young women than among their male counterparts and we are seeing a levelling-out of youth unemployment, with the gender split currently 60 per cent young men and 40 per cent young women whereas, historically, the proportion of unemployed young men has been much higher.</p><p>I hope that the committee will have the opportunity to consider some of the longer-term concerns in addition to the current labour market challenges. Women are still underrepresented in a number of business sectors. The most recent figures on the pay gap show that women are generally paid around 11 per cent less than their male counterparts, and, despite encouraging increases in recent years, far fewer women than men enter self-employment. The current wave of welfare reform that is being pushed through by the UK Government is also having a particularly detrimental effect on women, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies confirming that women will be more adversely affected than men.</p><p>However, in the face of those challenging statistics, we must recognise that some progress is being made on several fronts, especially regarding young women. In the past academic year, 90.3 per cent of young women leaving school went on to a positive destination. That is an increase from 86.7 per cent in 2005-06 and is higher than the rate among young men, which is currently 87.4 per cent. Although there are still real challenges around the types of professions that women seek, 56 per cent of new entrants to higher education in 2010-11 were women and a staggering 77.9 per cent of medical students are women.</p><p>Equality underpins the Government&#8217;s economic strategy, which recognises that we must create a fairer society, in which everyone can participate. While many of the powers to help women are reserved to Westminster, the equality and budget group is helping to ensure that we consider the impact of every penny that we spend on key groups, including women.</p><p>For example, we understand that childcare remains a real problem for many parents. In addition to funding that has been made available to support learning and childcare, we have announced a major medium-term step. The children and young people&#8217;s bill in 2013 will increase the current provision of 475 hours of pre-school education to 600 hours of early learning and childcare for three and four-year-olds and looked after two-year-olds, to be delivered flexibly from 2014.</p><p>Later this month, we will hold a national summit with business representatives to explore how we can promote more flexible working and family-friendly policies in the business sector.</p><p>I am delighted to note that in the face of a hugely challenging financial settlement last year, the Scottish Government&#8217;s equality budget has been maintained at the 2011-12 level&#8212;&#163;20.3 million&#8212;over the new spending review period, 2012-15.</p><p>We have increased spending on work to tackle gender inequality by nearly 30 per cent on the level that was allocated by the previous Administration, which I hope provides a clear signal that the Government gives a high priority to that work.</p><p>It is important to recognise, however, that there is no monopoly of wisdom or concern on this issue. We need to take expert opinion and listen to the views of women throughout Scotland on how we can help to move more of them into sustained work. I am therefore pleased to tell the Parliament that the women&#8217;s employment summit, announced by the First Minister in April, will take place on 12 September. The event will discuss issues such as childcare, workforce challenges, employability and welfare reform. We are working with the STUC to develop what we hope will be an inspiring event that generates a range of new policy recommendations for the Government and others to consider.

Getting more women into work and progressing in work is not just the right thing to do but the smart thing to do. We cannot continue to underutilise the talents and abilities of the majority of the population.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm was absolutely correct to mention the wonderful childcare centre in Pilton. I have had the opportunity to visit it, and it is an inspiring project. Claudia Beamish rightly mentioned that it is refugee week, and Richard Lyle touched on the fact that it is also carers week. There are fundamental employability issues to do with carers, refugees and women who are seeking to get into the labour market.</p><p>Mention has been made of the modern apprenticeship programme. I hope that it is accepted and welcomed that the number of women who participate in the programme has increased. In 2008-09, 2,857 participants in the programme were women; in 2011-12, that figure had increased to 11,383. That is not to say that I am complacent. I accept that if we were to scratch below the surface of those figures, we would see some significant gender differences, depending on the framework. Someone mentioned the very low participation rate of women in engineering.</p><p>I do not accept that the modern apprenticeship programme reinforces occupational segregation, but I accept that it reflects current occupational segregation in the workforce. I also accept that how we move forward in the modern apprenticeship programme will give us an opportunity to do things differently and to encourage more young women into growth sectors and more technical sectors. I accept that we have much to do on that, in conjunction with the careers information and advice that we give. Of course, we also have a job of work to do in convincing some parents of the merits of various occupations.</p><p>Maureen Watt, Jean Urquhart and Alison McInnes spoke about women who are in STEM-related professions and about the importance of the work of the Scottish resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology. The Scottish Government supports that centre&#8217;s work; we stepped in to fund it when it lost some funding from UK sources. We also heard about the seminal and important work by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, to which the Deputy First Minister will respond formally.</p><p>We need to be ahead of the game as a nation and as an economy and to take the opportunities that we are afforded by new and emerging sectors. That provides a great opportunity to tackle occupational segregation. It is important to note that an equality statement will sit alongside the renewables route map.</p><p>Employers and industry-led solutions are key to finding long-term and effective solutions to getting more women into work and making progress in work, particularly in the STEM-related industries, as well as in the energy and renewables sectors.</p><p>Welfare reform and childcare have been mentioned extensively. I do not want to get into a spat with Mr Macintosh, but I will say that the need for flexibility in how we plan to move forward and in how we deliver pre-school nursery provision is part of why we need primary legislation, although I understand the instinctive urge always to want to do more and do it more quickly. For older children, social enterprises and out-of-school care are an important part of the jigsaw.</p><p>As for last week&#8217;s debate, I understand that Shona Robison&#8217;s position was that she&#8212;along with others&#8212;wanted to meet the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland to discuss the pros and cons of quotas, so the door has most certainly not been shut.</p><p>At the start of the recession, men experienced 70 per cent of the job losses. However, we now know that joblessness disproportionately impacts on women. That will require us all to act and think differently. I am all for the advancement of women&#8217;s economic independence, whether that is through getting more women into work, dealing with occupational segregation and equal pay, getting more women into self-employment or getting more flexible working opportunities. I hope, and my aspiration is, that the women&#8217;s employment summit will be a turning point for long-term effective change.

We published our draft strategy for youth employment in January. Last month, we announced that we would direct &#163;25 million of European funds to youth employment.</p><p>Tackling youth unemployment needs short-term responses, medium-term action and a longer-term strategy, all of which we articulated in our youth employment strategy, the final version of which will be published at the end of this month.</p><p>In the longer term, our investment in the early years and early intervention, the curriculum for excellence and the reform of our post-16 education system will ensure that any systematic problems in preparing young people for adulthood and the world of work are addressed. Over the next few months, we will develop further measures for the increasing number of young people aged 18 to 24 who are unable to secure jobs because of depressed demand in the labour market. Our short-term focus has been on action for those most acutely affected by the recession.</p><p>I am pleased to say that there has been a hugely positive response to the draft youth employment strategy, which has prompted many into making commitments. I have spent the past four months meeting hundreds of individuals, businesses, social enterprises and others to discuss the translation of those commitments into actions.</p><p>As a direct outcome of the national economic forum, Scottish Enterprise published its own youth employment plan, outlining actions for supporting businesses and industry sectors to recruit young people. The Scottish Council for Development and Industry has arranged a series of meetings with large employers to explore how it can encourage companies and their supply chains to support the young unemployed.</p><p>To extend employer engagement and drive action at a local level, I initiated a series of action forum events, starting in Lanarkshire in May. The events bring together local employers, young people and key partners in action-focused discussions on how we can work more effectively across all sectors to support youth employment.</p><p>On Tuesday, more than 100 people attended the Glasgow action forum at Willie Haughey&#8217;s City Refrigeration premises. In the next two weeks, I will lead similar events in Dumfries and Edinburgh. More will follow later in the year as I work across Scotland to drive home the message about supporting young Scots into work.</p><p>The public sector remains a key employer. Following a meeting of public sector chief executives in March, I received around 100 pledges to take on apprentices, offer work experience and student placements, and increase the proportion of young employees in the public sector. For example, Scottish Enterprise will double the number of employees under the age of 25 in its workforce, Highlands and Islands Enterprise will increase its proportion of young employees to 10 per cent and Perth and Kinross Council will increase its young workforce from 170 to 450 over the next five years.</p><p>Public procurement projects are also supporting the creation of job and training opportunities for our young people. Of the 380 new jobs that are being created through the new south Glasgow hospitals project, more than 80 so far have gone to 16 to 24-year-olds. Further, 140 of the 180 work placements have been set up for young people, and 90 apprenticeships will also be created.</p><p>Recognising the distinctive role that social enterprises and the third sector play in helping to deliver our youth employment ambitions, we have invested nearly &#163;10 million to create employment opportunities in that sector through initiatives such as community jobs Scotland. In association with the Commonwealth games legacy fund, a further &#163;5 million will support jobs and other opportunities through major sporting events. That is in addition to the recent announcement by the First Minister of &#163;1 million for the Prince&#8217;s Trust to support young entrepreneurs and start-ups, which comes hot on the heels of the &#163;750,000 that was given to the same organisation to support more young people into jobs, education and training, which will benefit up to 7,000 young Scots.</p><p>To refer to such commitments as &#8220;pocket-money announcements&#8221; is an insult to the thousands of young people who will benefit from them, and to the organisations that are offering work opportunities.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last December, President Barroso, in response to growing unemployment across Europe, urged all member states to develop youth job plans, increase apprenticeship numbers, guarantee education or job opportunities for young people leaving school and redirect European funds to youth unemployment.

We know, as he should know, that young people are hit the hardest in a recession, and I think that we should welcome what organisations such as Perth and Kinross Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise are doing. We have to ensure that others follow them, in order to make sure that more opportunities are provided for young people and that the proportion of young people that such organisations employ is increased. I am clear that the public sector, including the Scottish Government, has to lead by example.</p><p>Much of the &#163;9 million that has been allocated to the local authority areas that are most affected by high youth unemployment rates and levels will support young people into sustainable jobs with local companies. That will support more young people such as Lauren, who attended my Lanarkshire action forum on youth employment last month. She was about to finish work experience with Serco but had no job to go to. The good news is that she started this week as an administration assistant with a local firm, Assure Alarms, which will receive a 50 per cent wage subsidy from South Lanarkshire Council. I am sure that we all agree that that is money well spent.</p><p>As I mentioned, we will use the &#163;25 million of European money to provide support to small businesses across Scotland that are willing to step up and offer unemployed young people a job.</p><p>Last month, the Commission for Employment and Skills published a report that showed that employers in Scotland reported higher levels of work readiness among school and college leavers than those elsewhere in the United Kingdom did. Around a quarter of employers said that they had recruited someone straight from education in the past two to three years, and the majority were satisfied with their work readiness. That demonstrates the positive impression that many young people are making on their first venture into work. However, it also tells us that three quarters of employers do not recruit young people straight from school, college and university, and I want to encourage more to do so.</p><p>The Scottish Government has confidence in the positive role that young people can play in supporting economic growth. We demonstrate that confidence with our &#163;72 million annual investment in modern apprenticeships, which enable young employees to develop valuable occupational skills in a range of industry sectors and give their employers the opportunity to demonstrate their confidence in them by investing &#163;7 for every &#163;1 of public money that is invested in apprenticeships.</p><p>Some employers have negative perceptions of young people and are reluctant to recruit anyone from that age group. Of course, there are some young people who do not possess the skills and aptitudes that are most valued by employers and I am committed to doing all that I can to ensure that we address that issue.</p><p>There are other reasons why some young people are not work ready. Lack of meaningful work experience presents a significant barrier to employment, so it is important that we persuade employers to offer high-quality work placements. To ensure that young people are ready for the workplace, we all need to help build their employability skills.</p><p>The employer-led certificate of work readiness, which is being developed by Skills Development Scotland, will recognise the work readiness of 16 to 19-year-olds. Central to the certificate will be 192 hours of work experience, which will be supervised in the workplace.</p><p>Wherever I go, I promote the business case for recruiting young people. Given the pressure on businesses in the current economic climate, recruiting young people might sound counterintuitive, but I have no doubt that companies need to invest in young people to achieve the business growth that will help them to thrive when the economy recovers.</p><p>I know from the many employers of all sizes that I have met over the past few months that there is a real appetite to support our youth employment agenda. I am determined, as is this Government, to take full advantage of that.</p><p>Investing in our young people brings returns to businesses in commitment and loyalty. Young people bring creativity, innovation and a willingness to learn, and their flexibility and adaptability help to enhance productivity.</p><p>I am driving that message home across Government and our agencies. I want us to lead by example and demonstrate the benefits of investing in young people. This year, the Scottish Government will offer young people more than 150 apprenticeship or work placement opportunities, and we are increasing our efforts to ensure that all public bodies do likewise.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Kenneth Macintosh knows, many organisations across the public sector are living with the reality of shrinking workforces.

He will have something to get his teeth into and we look forward to getting constructive feedback on maximising procurement opportunities.</p><p>Iain Gray and others also touched on the role of local government. In this all-government, all-Scotland approach to tackling rising youth unemployment, single outcome agreements and my on-going dialogue with local authorities are pivotal. Indeed, part of the reason for having local action forums on youth unemployment was to find local solutions rooted in local economies. The chamber may also be interested to know that Skills Development Scotland is devising youth employment plans with every local authority in Scotland.</p><p>I will not accept the amendments of the Labour and Tory parties for reasons that I hope become apparent.</p><p>The draft youth employment strategy was warmly welcomed, but I took on board the views that the Parliament expressed when we debated it a few months ago. I wanted to address, in a meaningful and considered way, some of the equality issues to do with women, young disabled people and young people from the black and minority ethnic community. We accepted that there was a need to sharpen our focus on diversity issues. I do not do such things in a tokenistic manner. I want those matters to be addressed in a meaningful and rich way.</p><p>I would like to encapsulate what the short, medium and long-term response of this Government is to youth unemployment. Surely the chamber must accept that we needed to act quickly. When I came into my post, we had to make a series of decisions, between December and March, about money that was available for year 1. Surely that was a commonsense approach. I assure members that although we do not need to waste time and effort in reinventing the wheel, we must ensure that every pound spent by the public purse adds value. I can give members that assurance. We needed to act quickly. Are people seriously suggesting that I should wait until we have a finalised youth employment strategy, with every dot and comma checked, before I can allocate much-needed resources to some of our communities in Scotland?</p><p>Members who criticise the decisions that have been made should say which decision should not have been made. Are they talking about the decision to give &#163;1.5 million to the employment recruitment incentive to support young care leavers into work? Are they talking about the provision of &#163;6 million for community jobs Scotland? I have heard many Labour members talk about the life-changing impact of community jobs Scotland on the young people on that programme, which is currently still in its first phase. We will, of course, be advertising soon, in a timely manner and in accordance with the requests of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, which has put forward a programme for its second phase. Are members criticising the allocation of &#163;2.5 million to the social enterprise challenge fund, the provision of &#163;5 million for the Commonwealth games legacy or the money that was given recently to the Prince&#8217;s Trust?</p><p>Mention has been made of pocket money. I came into this post with a budget of &#163;30 million. With the identification of &#163;25 million of European structural funds, that has nearly doubled. Crucially, that &#163;25 million has to be match-funded by another &#163;35 million. That rolls up to a budget of &#163;90 million over the next few years. I do not describe that as pocket money.</p><p>As far as the medium term is concerned, we need to do more, specifically on long-term unemployment, as Jenny Marra and others said. We have a good offering for 16 to 19-year-olds. There is no doubt that the claimant count among 18 to 24-year-olds is rising. Although we do not want to duplicate services that are provided by the Department for Work and Pensions, we must add to what is currently available to young people who are risk of long-term unemployment or who are in that position.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale rose&#8212;</p><p>I am in my final minute; the Presiding Officer is eyeing me up.</p><p>A lot has been said about the modern apprenticeship scheme. I make this point in all seriousness: this is Scotland&#8217;s Parliament, and our words have consequences. If members talk down the modern apprenticeship scheme, which is highly successful, they talk down Scotland&#8217;s young people. I will not stand by and let anyone talk down our young, talented and energetic Scots, who have their whole lives in front of them and for whom we must provide hope and opportunity.</p><p>Let us work together. My door is always open to people who have constructive ideas and suggestions&#8212;we began to hear a few of those today, for the first time, after a week of nonsense&#8212;but let us not talk down young Scots, because our young people are the future of this country and they will help us to grow our economy and to grow as a nation.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I appreciate that Mr Gray really wants to have an answer to that question.

In essence, that message is that, in today&#8217;s globalised world, learning other languages is more important than ever and that our commitment to our long-term ambition will maximise the opportunities for young people to learn languages.</p><p>As Stuart McMillan pointed out, multilingual youngsters have a competitive advantage. For example, I am acutely aware that many major international hotel groups are reluctant to recruit on to their trainee management programmes young people who are not multilingual, because they want to have the opportunity to deploy their young recruits in other parts of the world. I am aware that successive CBI surveys have pointed to the concerns that some employers have about the lack of language skills in the workforce.</p><p>The link between language skills, employability and the corresponding economic benefits is obvious.

To be absolutely clear, young people are the future of this country. They are part of the solution and not part of a problem. Our young people will help us to grow our economy and to grow as a nation. They have every right to expect an education system that will enable them to compete effectively at home and abroad. Liam McArthur is absolutely right on that point. Our young people should look at the learning of all languages as an entitlement and not just as an added extra. Many members have spoken about the economic cost to this county, of in excess of &#163;500 million, because we do not have suitable linguistic skills.</p><p>Many members have also rightly spoken about how learning a foreign language is complementary to understanding our own language better, and vice versa. Dave Thompson spoke eloquently about Gaelic-medium education and how that enables young people to be fleet of foot in learning many different languages. Marco Biagi and Claudia Beamish talked about how learning cannot be compartmentalised and how adults must lead by example. On that note, I encourage Graeme Dey and others and say that, despite their age, they too can lead by example. It is never too late to learn.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that all children have the opportunity to learn a language. Maureen Watt spoke well about that when she made the connection between language and football, particularly for boys. Recently I had the privilege of visiting Glencryan school in Cumbernauld, which is a school for children who have learning disabilities. Despite their difficulties, those children are also learning languages in the context of the world of work. As well as learning employability skills in the school&#8217;s restaurant, they are also learning some modern languages, which will enhance their employability in the local hospitality sector.</p><p>Linda Fabiani made a useful contribution during which she spoke about Scots being the world&#8217;s best diplomats. I might have been sitting in this chamber for too long but that is not something that I have previously been informed about.</p><p>I thank Kezia Dugdale for the information on European funding. She will know that the Government always takes an interest in European funding and that, recently, we have had some success in unearthing an additional &#163;25 million from the European social fund for young people.</p><p>Liam McArthur, Maureen Watt and Sandra White also spoke about further and higher education. They are absolutely correct that those sectors need to complement what is currently happening or will be happening in schools. We need that continuity to build on the curriculum for excellence. I assure Sandra White and Hanzala Malik that the Scottish funding council is monitoring language provision in the college and university sector. I am keen on us improving and getting more connectivity between the worlds of education and work if we are going to take advantage of the economic opportunities that lie ahead of us.</p><p>Dr Allan began the debate by saying that we need to create a cultural and educational environment in which multilingualism is the norm. We are right to be ambitious for our children and young people. We need to be bold and embrace the opportunity for change, and redress the situation in which our young people are losing out. We need to boost our children&#8217;s language skills over the next decade if we are to have any prospect of improving their life chances, as well as the economic performance of this country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Absolutely, and I hope that Mr Robertson welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to treat BSL as a language and not just as a mode of communication.

When I published the draft youth employment strategy last week at the specially convened national economic forum, I made it perfectly clear that I would bring the strategy to Parliament for debate and, of course, scrutiny.</p><p>The strategy encapsulates how the Government has prioritised youth unemployment since the economic downturn in 2008 and how we will continue to move forward, develop fresh impetus and ensure an all-Government and all-Scotland response to what is undoubtedly a massive national challenge.</p><p>I have no doubt that all members can bear witness to the pernicious impact of youth unemployment on families, on communities and on our country, and not least on the life chances of our young people. Our objectives are clear: we want to help young people to get into work, to sustain that work and to progress in the workplace. No young person should leave school, college or university simply to become an unemployment statistic.</p><p>In essence, the youth employment strategy will build and develop on our post-16 education and training. We are not starting from a standing start, nor are we reinventing the wheel, but there is room&#8212;as always&#8212;for innovation. The strategy outlines a whole-Government approach, as boosting youth employment is core Government business across all portfolios. It is my job to ensure that I knit all that together.</p><p>The strategy will demonstrate our commitment to work with all our partners, including the United Kingdom Government, and to marshal efforts across the public, private and voluntary sectors. We recognise that not all young people are the same and that we need a range of interventions to meet the needs of those young people who are furthest from and those who are nearest to the labour market.</p><p>Fundamentally, the draft youth employment strategy makes clear that the Government is committed to responding head-on to the challenge that we face. We will do so through an all-Government, all-Scotland approach that involves everyone who can make a difference.</p><p>Our investment of more than &#163;1.5 billion a year in post-16 education and training is critically important in helping our young people to develop the skills and attributes that they need. Our additional investment of &#163;30 million to boost youth employment will provide vital support.</p><p>However, that is only the start. The strategy outlines the ways in which I will focus my efforts, working hand in glove with other ministers. Those opportunities include working with Alex Neil to maximise the benefits of capital investment for young people; working with Derek Mackay and Fergus Ewing to galvanise the public and private sectors towards supporting young people into work; and working with Shona Robison to take advantage of large-scale events such as the Commonwealth games to provide our young people with meaningful experience to improve their prospects.</p><p>I reassure the Parliament that that is only the tip of the iceberg. I am absolutely committed to getting into the guts of all aspects of Government and more than willing to come back to Parliament to report on progress.</p><p>It is fair to say that, apart from young people themselves, employers are the single most important group. We need employers, large and small, to create opportunities&#8212;preferably work&#8212;for young people. There was significant employer representation at the best-ever-attended national economic forum last week. I have now had the opportunity to meet the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses and industry leaders groups. I will continue to work with employers on how we can make it easier for them to take on young people.</p><p>I will shortly lead a number of regional youth employment events, at which employer input is essential. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce has agreed to help to facilitate those events, which will ensure good participation from public, private and voluntary sectors at a local level.</p><p>I have made it a priority to consult young people themselves. Indeed, one young apprentice whom I met in Asda this morning suggested to me that I should use the &#163;30 million of opportunities for all funding to build three supermarkets. I told him that, although that was an interesting, innovative idea, I was not confident of full parliamentary support for it.</p><p>Since taking up post, I have had the great privilege of meeting a number of young apprentices, young people on national training programmes and young people who seek such opportunities. At last week&#8217;s meeting of the cross-party group on children and young people, a number of young people spoke eloquently about how volunteering can be life changing, as well as expressing their concerns about the impact of welfare reform. Earlier this week, I also met members of the Scottish Youth Parliament, who will, no doubt, be pleased at the good news about student support that was announced in yesterday&#8217;s budget.</p><p>Providing young people with the best start to their working lives is critical to Scotland&#8217;s future economic prosperity. Our policies are designed to support that aim. We have announced opportunities for all, which is an unprecedented offer to our young people. Through that programme, we will ensure that every 16 to 19-year-old who is not in work, education or training can secure a place in learning or training.</p><p>We are committed to creating 25,000 modern apprenticeship opportunities in every year of this session of Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hope that today&#8217;s debate is another critical step in the development of not only the Government&#8217;s but the Parliament&#8217;s&#8212;and indeed the nation&#8217;s&#8212;response to rising youth unemployment.

He will understand our obvious concern to prioritise the 16 to 19-year-old group. The majority of modern apprenticeship places are for that age group but, hot on the heels of that, we must consider older young people&#8212;the 20 to 24-year-old group&#8212;particularly care leavers, a group of young people who are close to my heart. We must also, particularly in certain sectors, ensure that there are all-age modern apprenticeship opportunities.</p><p>I am pleased to say that we have prioritised places for young people in colleges. We are also ensuring that young people who go to university can access a high-quality higher education without running up debts and having to pay for their education.</p><p>We will continue to modernise the careers services and work with local authorities to complete the national roll-out of activity agreements to support those who are furthest from the labour market.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is currently leading a reform of the post-16 education and training system. That reform is designed to ensure not only that all parts of the system are geared towards helping young people into sustainable employment and developing their careers but that they respond to the current and future workforce needs of our employers and economy.</p><p>In December, the First Minister announced an additional &#163;30 million to boost youth employment. I am determined to ensure that all of our investment in youth employment works as hard as possible. We already have strong support in place for our young people. I want to build on that and take forward the best elements of some of the programmes that we have introduced.</p><p>Community jobs Scotland draws on and improves on similar schemes such as the future jobs fund by providing employability training for participants. Although the scheme has been running only since August, it has already had a life-changing impact on a number of young people. It is important that we build on the success of the initial pilot of community jobs Scotland within the resources that we have available. That is why I plan to allocate &#163;6 million of the additional &#163;30 million to support a continuation of community jobs Scotland in 2012-13.</p><p>Beyond community jobs Scotland, our social enterprises and specialist third sector organisations are well placed to provide strong support into jobs for young people across the youth unemployment cohort. That is why I plan to launch a &#163;2.5 million challenge fund to support that type of innovative work. Organisations will be invited to submit proposals for 2012-13 in the weeks ahead. The key criteria for the fund will be a demonstrable track record of success, strong links with employers and innovative approaches that are not replicated elsewhere in the system.</p><p>Local authorities and community planning partnerships are at the forefront of supporting young people into work. I have seen a range of what is already happening across Scotland to connect young people directly to local labour markets. That is in addition to the work that is going on to support those who are at greatest risk of disengaging through more choices, more chances and the national roll-out of activity agreements. I have had positive discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and will continue to work with our partners in local government to identify how we can do more together to support young people.</p><p>The current economic conditions are extremely challenging. With stronger economic powers, the Parliament could do more to create the conditions for job creation that our young people need. Nonetheless, I assure Parliament that I will not lie idle but will maximise what powers we have at our disposal to ensure that every young person in Scotland gets the best start to their working life. Since taking on my current portfolio, I have been heartened, encouraged and, at times, overwhelmed by support from a wide range of people and organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors. There is a demonstrable will to make a difference, and it will only be by working with committed people across Scotland that we will reduce youth unemployment. Our young people deserve no less.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament believes that the all-government, all-Scotland approach at the centre of Scotland&#8217;s Youth Employment Strategy is vital to provide opportunities for Scotland&#8217;s young people to enter the workplace, and welcomes the allocation of &#163;30 million of additional investment over and above the Scottish Government&#8217;s annual investment of over &#163;1.5 billion in post-16 education and training.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "John Park has a keen interest in this area.

Maybe I did not agree with every word that every member uttered but, overall, every member who spoke did so positively. There have been many suggestions and many invitations for me to take members up on. I am glad that the regional events on youth employment have been welcomed, and I am keen to have member involvement in them.</p><p>I am never one to deny the breadth or depth of a problem. I think that the fact that 105,000 young Scots between the ages of 16 and 24 are unemployed speaks for itself&#8212;it shouts loudly. It is not possible to diminish or repackage that fact in any way. I reassure Kezia Dugdale that there are no hidden statistics. We capture the over-18s who do not present to the job centre, because our measures are based on the labour force survey, which relies on young people declaring that they are unemployed. That is why the unemployment rate for young people between the ages of 16 and 24 is 24.7 per cent, not the 6.6 per cent claimant count. I believe that Skills Development Scotland does a good job in tracking young people who do not find positive destinations.</p><p>I am clear about the fact that, if we are to overcome what I call a national challenge&#8212;others can call it a national crisis, but at the end of the day that is semantics&#8212;when we talk about young people and how we will overcome the challenges that they face and improve their prospects for the future, our narrative must be solution focused and positive. Therefore, I have difficulty with some of the language and the discourse around the idea of a lost generation. I will not lie down to the politics of despair because, fundamentally, I do not believe that there is any member of the Parliament, regardless of our political differences, who will stand by and allow there to be another lost generation. I know that across the chamber, regardless of party politics, there is a collective memory of the 1980s and I, for one, am not going back there.

The strategy is not a glossy document, nor is it &#8220;War and Peace&#8221;&#8212;that is deliberate.</p><p>The same is true of the Government&#8217;s motion. I deliberately penned a motion that was straight to the point, in the hope, I suppose, that members across the chamber would welcome that.

For the record, I could oblige by mentioning the 300,000 training opportunities that the Government has delivered, the 46,500 training opportunities that we will deliver year in, year out for the lifetime of the session and, not least, the 25,000 modern apprenticeships, the 14,500 training places and the 7,000 flexible training opportunities, as well as the opportunities that will be created by community jobs Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been a somewhat curious mix of the collegiate and the constructive, but it has inevitably dipped now and again into feisty exchanges.

Like many members, I am a parent&#8212;a parent first, and a politician second&#8212;and, like all parents, my first priority is to provide a secure, stable and nurturing home for my child. I understand the importance of that for his development and future attainment&#8212;in short, for his life chances. We might not always realise it but, in each of our interactions with our children, we lay the building blocks for their future and help them to attain their potential.</p><p>From the moment they are born, as well as the cornerstones of being safe, nurtured and healthy, children need real-life play to develop their physical co-ordination and control; a mum and dad to talk to them about everyday events to develop their language and social skills; and stories, rhymes and songs to lay the foundation for success at school. That is the focus of our work in the early years. However, not all children are as fortunate as ours. Last year, nearly 16,000 children and young people were looked after by our local authorities. Through no fault of their own, those children found themselves in a position in which their birth family could not care for them. They are Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable children and they are the responsibility of us all.</p><p>We should take our role as corporate parents as seriously as we take our responsibilities as birth parents.

Getting it right for looked-after children should not involve multiple placements. Getting it right for looked-after children means placing their needs, welfare and rights at the heart of every decision that is made, as we do for our own children.</p><p>Improving life chances for looked-after children is a priority of the Government. As the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning recently acknowledged, it has been a priority for every Administration. We have come a long way since devolution, which is evidence of the consensus in the Parliament on this important area of work, but there is still so much more to do. We have considered the processes and made improvements to secure permanence for children, but we must now address the time that those processes take so that we can secure placements more quickly.</p><p>In 2006, we considered the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill, which was brought to us by Peter Peacock, the then Minister for Education and Young People. Through that bill, we introduced a new flexible court order&#8212;the permanence order&#8212;that can be tailored to meet the individual needs of a child and to provide them with security, stability and greater predictability in their lives. The Scottish Government brought the legislation into effect in 2009. Along with it, we introduced legislation that for the first time provided recognition for kinship carers, who can also provide stability, security and predictability in the lives and experiences of looked-after children. Parliament has come together to debate the role of kinship carers and the support that they receive. We have discussed the work in which the Scottish Government is involved to secure access to benefits and support for such carers.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you for your generosity, Presiding Officer.

I am sure that we can all look at our family&#8217;s history and see examples of kinship care.</p><p>This Government has done more than anyone else to support kinship carers and we will continue to engage constructively with the Westminster Government, particularly on the issue of welfare reform.</p><p>No matter where we stand on these issues politically, we all agree that kinship care is another important option in providing permanent care for our children, which is made possible by the looked-after children regulations and permanence orders, both of which are unique to Scotland.</p><p>I very much cherish the consensus that we have on our looked-after children. I, for one, will not be using our most vulnerable children as a political football. However, if I need to ruffle a few feathers to make progress for our looked-after children, I will do so, because this Government believes that, in partnership, we have to support and challenge one another in this Parliament, in local and national Government and within the voluntary sector.</p><p>The children looked after statistics show that although fewer children are being received into care, they are coming into care younger and they are being looked after for much longer.

Across the system, we must remember that time is of the essence: our children grow and develop from the day that they are born and have only one childhood.</p><p>The SCRA report is important. I published the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to it on 21 June, outlining our plans to address the issues that it raised. Our aim is nothing less than a radical shift in care planning towards fewer placements for children, early permanence decisions for every child and a system that puts the child at the centre. That offers our children in care the best possible chance of securing an adoptive or permanent placement.</p><p>Our response lays the building blocks for the care system to provide every child with a safe, stable and nurturing home. A child&#8217;s journey through care starts with an assessment of parents&#8217; capacity to provide the consistent care that a child needs to attain their potential. Therefore, we recognise the need for more robust assessment tools to determine parental capacity and to identify the support that parents need to provide that care for their child.</p><p>Through the work that the early years framework supports, we are committed to identifying children who are at risk and to taking steps to prevent that risk from materialising. We are committed to taking effective action to help parents, families and communities to develop their own solutions, using accessible, high-quality public services&#8212;parenting classes; therapeutic support for parents who experience drug and alcohol problems; and support with health and disability issues, to name a few.</p><p>We want to support every child in their whole journey through care, the transitions that they experience and beyond. We need to ensure that appropriate decisions are made quickly and that support is in place to provide permanent care for children who cannot live with their birth parents.</p><p>Our response to the SCRA report highlights and shares current good practice. We plan to make extensive use of our new centre for excellence for looked-after children, which launched in September, to do that. We are asking the centre to work with our partners to improve the experiences and lives of all looked-after children, their families and care leavers. It will work to ensure that all those who are involved in the care of looked-after children have the appropriate skills, knowledge and support and that any decisions about looked-after children are well evidenced and always have the child&#8217;s welfare and rights as their paramount consideration.</p><p>The Government places great importance on working in partnership to deliver its ambitions for Scotland&#8217;s children. We are in a period of engagement with key stakeholders on how to translate the key areas of work into specific activities. I have written to local authorities seeking their involvement in that process.</p><p>The Scottish Government has started the work to create a more responsive system. I mentioned the centre for excellence, which will be instrumental in future work. We have also created Scotland&#8217;s first national adoption register, which is already providing greater opportunities for placing children in stable and permanent families. I urge all local authorities to make a commitment to use it by the end of this year.</p><p>I ask each one of us, as corporate parents, to challenge local authorities, health services and third sector organisations in our constituencies to engage with the work that is being undertaken. Every organisation that is involved in the lives of looked-after children will have examples of practice that works to promote the wellbeing of the children it serves. Each of us has a duty to help to identify and promote that good practice as widely as possible.</p><p>I also intend to increase the pace of change. I will ask all local authorities to provide me with their adoption service plans by April 2012.

I have sensed from members&#8217; contributions that there are some different perspectives on this very complex and emotive issue.</p><p>I enjoyed the contribution from Claudia Beamish, who brings to the chamber her experience of working with children on the front line. I say to Mary Fee that, as a former prison social worker, I am well versed in the issues that she raised on behalf of children who are affected by imprisonment. Nonetheless, I would be delighted to meet the cross-party group at a time of mutual convenience.</p><p>No member in the chamber today can fail to have been touched by the personal testimonies from Gil Paterson and Dick Lyle, who made poignant remarks that are very apt given that it is national adoption week.</p><p>I am glad that Kevin Stewart, among others, is taking seriously his corporate parenting responsibilities to several hundred Aberdeen children. However, I have news for him and for my other colleagues who continue to be local councillors: now that they are in Scotland&#8217;s Parliament, they are the corporate parents to 15,892 children. If that does not keep them awake at night, I do not know what will.</p><p>Annabel Ewing spoke about the need to strike an intricate balance between the rights of children and the rights of parents. In the complex world of legislation, we have competing obligations, but I come down unequivocally on the side of the rights of the child. In doing the right thing by the child, we will make the right decision at the right time for every child.</p><p>Anne McTaggart raised some important issues in relation to our proposed bill on young people&#8217;s rights. However, I say to her that we are starting that process by deliberately placing the responsibility on ministers to have due regard to the UNCRC so that we can lead by example. That is our preamble before we introduce our more expansive all-encompassing children&#8217;s services bill.</p><p>Although there is, as yet, no definitive list of what will be in&#8212;or out of&#8212;the bill, it gives us a timely opportunity to consider a wide range of measures that will have an impact on the lives of all looked-after children as well as on the lives of children who are not looked after.</p><p>I am aware of the issue that Liam McArthur raised about the number of children in foster care placements. We are actively looking at that just now.</p><p>The children&#8217;s services bill&#8212;if we call it that; we might just call it the children&#8217;s bill&#8212;will give us opportunities for sharing information, which is very important, particularly in the context of looked-after children and children with additional support needs or disabilities. We will also seek to place a duty on local authorities and health boards to work collaboratively.</p><p>Kevin Stewart talked about the need to take a whole-system approach. We can learn a lot from the work on a whole-system approach that has been undertaken in the youth justice system. The Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration report identifies the big issues as being in the making of decisions on permanence, but there are issues in the courts system relating to the timely production of reports, curators ad litem, reporters and all the rest of it. Although there is no substantive evidence of delays in the children&#8217;s hearings system, we can all provide anecdotal evidence&#8212;probably from our constituency case loads&#8212;of hearings being repeatedly delayed, often because parents do not turn up to them. We must focus on the whole system and we must be careful that, in repairing one part of it, we do not cause a problem in another.</p><p>Nevertheless, I make it clear that our immediate focus is on the making of decisions that lead to permanence. In England, there are lots of delays in the courts system, but the work that has been undertaken by the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration has debunked the myth that there are delays in the courts system in Scotland. There are comparatively few delays; the issue is how we make decisions and how we work with children.</p><p>I place on record my thanks to the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration for its report&#8212;it was remiss of me not to do so sooner. The report is a timely and credible piece of work. Although all 100 cases that it considered were completed under old legislation&#8212;the Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978 and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995&#8212;rather than our new legislation, it has given us some firm ideas of the time that it takes to make imperative decisions about the lives of some of our most vulnerable children.</p><p>For me, it is not acceptable that the majority of children wait more than four years for a permanency decision to be made, especially considering that 44 per cent of the children in the study were identified as being at risk from birth. Moreover, for every year of delay in the care system, the prospects of adoption and permanency reduce by 20 per cent. That significant piece of work was undertaken by Julie Selwyn at the University of Bristol. We know that the age of someone&#8217;s entry to care and the length of time that they spend in care are the greatest predictors of their future success.</p><p>I am glad that, across the chamber, there is recognition of the fact that the building blocks are now in place and that they were in place even prior to the publication of the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration report. The credit for that goes to Peter Peacock and Adam Ingram. The Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 modernised the adoption system, introducing permanence orders, and was implemented in 2009. Adam Ingram led the way on the looked-after children regulations, which crystallised the work on the children&#8217;s plan. In addition, 23 local authorities have signed up to the national adoption register. If members want to know whether their local authority has signed up, they can write to me and I will be happy to share that information.</p><p>A crucial part of our work to drive forward changes for looked-after children is the centre for excellence for looked-after children in Scotland&#8212;CELCIS. I will pick out a few aspects of its work that we detailed in our response to the SCRA. CELCIS will take forward best practice issues, which relate very much to thorough and timely parental capacity assessments, and the important work to develop a national risk assessment toolkit for child protection. As Stewart Maxwell said, the history of parents who have already had children taken into care is an important indicator of whether rehabilitation will succeed.</p><p>CELCIS will support, encourage and evaluate the twin-track assessment and parallel planning that Annabelle Ewing spoke about. Rehabilitation with birth families and permanency planning are not mutually exclusive. As best practice in the Glasgow infant and family team project has shown, we can do both activities in tandem, which is in children&#8217;s best interests.</p><p>We must ensure that at the heart of our policy and practice are attainment, child development and brain development. That is about children, their needs, their growth and their development; it is not about organisations, professionals or bureaucracies.</p><p>The Labour Party&#8217;s amendment focuses on timescales, which I will talk about. After careful consideration, I cannot accept the amendment. If I could have accepted it, I would have; I am sorry that I cannot. The amendment just is not on the money. However, I will try hard to address the issues that Labour members have raised, because I know that they have worked hard in collaboration with organisations such as Barnardo&#8217;s.</p><p>Part of the work that the centre for excellence is driving forward concerns the impact of introducing strict timescales for the decision-making process and the overall time that is taken to achieve permanency. That work will commence this December, and CELCIS and others will report to me by the end of next year. That will be timely in advance of the Government&#8217;s introduction of the children&#8217;s services bill in 2013-14.</p><p>On timescales, I am anxious to stress to the Parliament that I am a woman in a hurry. All the work in our response to the SCRA report has a sense of urgency and is to be done sooner rather than later, but it will take however long it takes. I am not interested in papering over the cracks in improving the lives of Scotland&#8217;s children.</p><p>The Conservatives said that measuring improvements is important. My one word of caution is that we are talking about children, not numbers. Adoption is not the appropriate answer for all children. Nonetheless, the national adoption register will give us important information about the demographics of the children for whom we seek to find a permanent home.</p><p>We will know that we have made considerable progress when our looked-after children have fewer placements, when we make better and earlier decisions on permanence and when our children are at the heart of our system. I want Scotland to be the best place in the world to grow up and I want us as corporate parents to have the same hopes, dreams and sleepless nights for our looked-after children as we have for our own children.</p><p>I assure the Parliament that I am interested in nothing less than a radical shift in care planning so that we make quicker and better decisions for our children. We will pick up the pace, because children have only one childhood. Our legislative programme gives us an ideal opportunity to make the right decisions at the right times for all Scotland&#8217;s looked-after children.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The tone of this afternoon&#8217;s debate has been uncharacteristically consensual, considered and thoughtful, but it has not been without its challenges or the frustrating sense that we can and must do more.

Apart from allowing me to outline the Government&#8217;s ambitions for all of our children and young people, it also gives me the opportunity to share a debate with Alasdair Allan for the first time in 20 years. I suppose that it is also the first time that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has let the two junior education ministers out to play.</p><p>The two core and inextricably linked aims of the education team in this term of government are to raise attainment and improve the life chances of Scotland&#8217;s children. At the heart of everything we do and of all our aspirations for our children is to ensure that we have happy healthy bairns who reach their full potential. The guiding principle for us all as parliamentarians in making decisions and expressing views should be that if something is not good enough for our own sons and daughters, it is not good enough for any child or young person growing up in Scotland. Educational attainment is the passport to social, cultural and economic prosperity and we are absolutely focused on the child&#8217;s needs throughout their learning journey from the early years to young adulthood.</p><p>I point out from the outset that in seeking to raise educational attainment we do not have a doom-and-gloom agenda. We have strengths and successes to build on. That said, I reassure the chamber that there is no room for complacency and when it comes to improving the life chances of our looked-after children I will not beat about the bush: the report card for all corporate parents at all levels of local and national Government says, &#8220;Can and must do better.&#8221; We also need to focus attention on reducing the gap between the lowest and highest attainers in education.</p><p>Although we can celebrate the fact that our education system performs well internationally; that we have excellence in higher education; that our 15-year-olds perform above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average for reading and science; that we have record levels of young people in further and higher education; that statistics and qualifications show that our young people are performing better than at any point in the past; and that&#8212;this is for Mr Macintosh, in particular&#8212;class sizes are at a record low, I reassert that there is still a job of work to do. That is why, among other things, the cabinet secretary Michael Russell has brought together a small group of headteachers with an excellent personal track record of raising attainment in their own schools across a range of circumstances. The group&#8217;s members will distil from their own real-life work experience what works to help our young citizens to be high attainers. It is crucial that we understand and share innovative practice and the group&#8217;s work will be concluded speedily.</p><p>I will also discuss the specific issue of looked-after children with the attainment group. Although I know that next week there will be a debate on permanence planning for looked-after children and that the Education and Culture Committee is holding a very welcome inquiry into the issue, I flag up to Parliament the learning hub. That is a strand of work that is being undertaken by the looked-after children strategic implementation group, which will oversee a variety of activities to boost and drive improvements in educational attainment.</p><p>Over and above our specific measures on attainment, how will we achieve systematic and radical change for our children, our country and our communities? For me, the starting point is the early years&#8212;the foundation years. When it comes to babies and very young children, including pre-birth, we will reap what we sow. If we are serious about giving our children the best start in life, we need to be serious about the fundamental shift both in philosophy and of resources into the early years, early intervention and preventative spend.</p><p>Apart from independence, preventative spend is the most radical and exciting agenda that the Government is pursuing. It cuts across all arms of Government, both local and national, and across universal and targeted services. This Scottish National Party Government has been brave and bold enough to grasp the agenda, despite the financial constraints that we are all living with.</p><p>I am currently finalising arrangements with local government and health partners in establishing the early years task force that will oversee a joint change fund of more than &#163;270 million. That will be used to transform the lives of children and communities and to begin to unlock the potential of our universal services, whether in education or health, in prevention as opposed to cure, implementing that transformational change at a local level as envisaged by the early years framework.</p><p>Our wider programme of reform, including our legislative ambitions, is central to improving attainment. In essence, our future children&#8217;s services bill is about how to get all agencies to work together better in making smarter and quicker decisions for all our children.</p><p>I was struck by recent comments by Professor Buchanan, director of the centre for research into parenting and children at the University of Oxford, when she said that the job of universal services is to grow brains. I could not agree more. GIRFEC&#8212;getting it right for every child&#8212;and attainment go hand in hand, and improving attainment cannot be divorced from ensuring that children are safe, loved, happy, healthy, included and nurtured, have opportunities to play and are valued and respected.</p><p>There is a strong synergy between GIRFEC, the curriculum for excellence and the personalisation of services.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Raising Attainment and Ambition (Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to open this morning&#8217;s debate.

That is simply not acceptable. Although this Government is not about micromanaging health boards and local authorities, it is unacceptable that there are uneven outcomes and that children have different prospects depending on the part of the country in which they live. That is why we have a commitment to a children&#8217;s services bill and the focus on preventative spend, which goes hand in hand with GIRFEC and the early years framework.</p><p>I stress that working with and supporting parents is imperative. Parents are the first teachers and the biggest single influence on a child&#8217;s educational aspirations and attainment. Continuing our play, talk, read campaign is crucial, as will be the development of a national parenting strategy and ensuring good parental involvement and engagement in the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>Curriculum for excellence is being successfully embedded and implemented. It is the biggest educational reform in a generation, and its focus on deep and connected learning and continuous improvement will equip our children and young people with the skills for life, learning and work. New qualifications are being developed on time, and a programme is in place to support the workforce and leadership.</p><p>The McCormac and Donaldson reviews have highlighted that the quality of teaching is central to improved attainment, and the development of a reflective teaching workforce that is ready to innovate and share successful practice is key. I want also to stress the contribution of other professionals to the curriculum for excellence, in particular the community learning and development workforce, which will make a valuable contribution to the post-16 agenda.</p><p>Sixteen to 19-year-olds are an absolute priority for this Government. As the First Minister said, no young person should go through school only to become an unemployment statistic at the age of 16, and we will not allow that to happen. That is why, through our opportunities for all initiative, all 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in work will be offered a learning opportunity or a training place. We recognise that staying in learning beyond the age of 16 is a young person&#8217;s best means of improving their long-term job prospects, and our policies are working to support that.</p><p>We are driving long-term, systematic improvement through curriculum for excellence, 16-plus learning choices and the transition planning model for the senior phase of curriculum for excellence. That will ensure that all our young people have the necessary personal, financial and career advice, guidance and support to access and sustain an appropriate place in post-16 learning.

I could quibble about some of the methodology, given that it is a UK-wide survey and I am not sure how representative the Scottish samples are, but I will not do that, because by nature I am not a pedant.</p><p>More fundamentally, anybody who has ears to listen and eyes to see will know that a significant proportion of families pay more for their childcare than they pay for their rent or mortgage. As all members who have spoken in the debate have demonstrated, there is an obvious connection, which stares us in the face, between the costs of childcare and leaving or staying in employment. I welcome the work that Save the Children has undertaken and will endeavour to respond to its report, as well as to the concerns that have been raised by members during the debate.</p><p>In the little time that I have, I will try very hard to demonstrate what the Government has done, what it will do and what it would like to do.</p><p>However, before I continue I would like to make one broad point. In doing so, I do not seek to be controversial or to disrupt the consensus that often&#8212;and rightly&#8212;exists in members&#8217; business debates, so I will choose my language carefully. If there was ever an issue that best crystallised the arguments for this Parliament having more powers, surely it has to be the need to provide for and support better our children and families. Let me be blunt; without control of taxation and the welfare benefits system, there will be no quick fix to ease the burden on, or the hardship that is faced by, hard-working parents or parents who wish to work. Nonetheless, I believe that we can do much more to ease that burden.</p><p>I will touch on welfare reform, which was mentioned by Jamie Hepburn and Malcolm Chisholm among others. The UK Government&#8217;s Welfare Reform Bill is substantial and will bring about&#8212;if I quote Jackie Baillie correctly from yesterday&#8212;&#8220;a seismic shift&#8221;. The Scottish Government supports benefits simplification and is considering the UK Government&#8217;s proposition as to what the universal credit will achieve, but we do not support welfare reform that will impact most greatly on the most vulnerable people. We do not yet know the full extent of the impact of the changes or the effect that there will be on devolved services. Nonetheless, we will continue to engage proactively on the subject with our colleagues at Westminster. Members will also wish to consider the part that they can play in that work. Bob Doris exercised his right to do that tonight.</p><p>For the moment we must work within our constraints. Liz Smith touched on an important point in referring to what we have managed to achieve collectively as a Parliament.

Malcolm Chisholm mentioned the North Edinburgh Childcare family centre. I have visited it twice and have been very impressed by the work that it does. Hugh Henry mentioned Cathkin nursery, which blew me away when I visited it to see the work that it does.</p><p>Many areas in Glasgow, Dundee and North Ayrshire are doing interesting work with vulnerable two-year-olds. I am aware of a pilot that was commissioned by the previous Scottish Executive that, interestingly enough, showed that extended provision did not have a huge impact on two-year-olds, but did have an impact on supporting parents and helping people to be better parents. That is a significant bit of evidence.</p><p>I am pleased that over the past four years the Government has increased entitlement of free pre-school education to 475 hours per annum. That amounts to 8&#160;million more hours.</p><p>More to the point, what are we now going to do? To answer Hugh Henry more substantively, I think that this Government is committed to making the decisive shift to preventative spending. We have an opportunity to be bold. We have created an early years change fund to lead the way on preventative spending, and we will take the work forward jointly with local authorities, the national health service and the third sector. We know that the investment in zero to eight-year-olds, and zero to three-year-olds in particular, pays back countless dividends. I personally will chair the early years task force, which will oversee early years activity, picking up on our priorities of childcare, family centres, play, early learning experiences and supporting parents.</p><p>I hope that members will be reassured that we are committed to expanding the capacity, range and flexibility of early learning and childcare. We will develop the steps that are needed to make early learning and childcare accessible and affordable to all&#8212;obviously within the constraints that I have outlined. I am committed to the fact that there are positives to be achieved, but the bigger prize to be gained for our children is for our Parliament to evolve into full adulthood and to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that go with it.</p><p>I will quickly say something about our third sector partners. Third sector organisations are crucial partners in delivery, and I am delighted at the allocation of &#163;6.8&#160;million to the early years action fund, which was announced today. That will support the expansion of innovative and exciting models of integrated learning, childcare and family support.</p><p>My final point is the one that Kenny Gibson raised about child poverty. Although I am pleased that, over the past 10 years, the level of child poverty has dropped from 28 per cent to 20 per cent, I must say that 20 per cent is still far too high. The Government is absolutely committed to doing everything in its powers to eradicate child poverty.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:50.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651853", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Affordable Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will resist&#8212;to save his blushes, never mind mine.

However, this discourse is much more than a debate on education: it is a debate about how we as a nation improve the short-term, medium-term and long-term prospects&#8212;the life chances, if you like&#8212;of all Scotland&#8217;s young people.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s challenge and promise are to translate words into actions. The challenge for the Parliament is to show leadership on what we will and will not tolerate for our children, our young people and their families in 21st century Scotland.</p><p>A number of maidens spoke, the first of whom was Gordon MacDonald. I know him well. He always tells it how it is, and I was struck by his speech on how free education had transformed his and his family&#8217;s prospects.</p><p>I was also struck by Anne McTaggart&#8217;s speech. I am sure that she will bring her skills as a former community education worker to the Parliament and I note her interest in widening access.</p><p>Jean Urquhart, our other maiden, spoke about education being more than what happens in schools. That is oh so true.</p><p>A variety of members from all parties sought answers or reassurance on a number of specific points. I will do my best to attend to those, but first I give Dennis Robertson my personal commitment to ensuring that the legislation on additional support for learning is fully implemented. He should also expect a decision on the schools in his constituency that he mentioned to be made next week.</p><p>John Park has always made an impassioned plea for the skills agenda. We agree with him that the focus has to be on 16 to 19-year-olds in the crucial transition from school to the world of work. However, I also reassure him that the Government has also asked Skills Development Scotland how we can target a proportion of modern apprenticeships on that age group.</p><p>If I had to answer all Sandra White&#8217;s questions, I would be here all day. I am assured that the cabinet secretary will write to her at length. However, on the most important issue that she raised, I say to members that the Government will continue to press the United Kingdom Government on the visa issue.</p><p>I welcome Stewart Maxwell to his new role as convener of the Education and Culture Committee. By way of a backhanded compliment to him, I reassure Claire Baker that I have no doubts that he will give the Government the appropriate amount of challenge.</p><p>I reassure Mr Maxwell that we have been working hard with the national parent forum on producing a range of material on the curriculum for excellence.

The first is curriculum for excellence, which has now been successfully implemented in every school in Scotland.</p><p>The second is financial stability. The Scottish Government has set up an independent review of teacher employment to be chaired by Professor Gerry McCormac, to provide us with recommendations in the summer. That review and the review of teacher education in Scotland will deal with closely related issues, and we will have to consider them together. The cabinet secretary&#8217;s appointment of Graham Donaldson to the review of teacher employment group will, I hope, facilitate that process.</p><p>The third pillar is the continued pursuit of excellence in teaching&#8212;the subject of today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Teaching Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; was published on 13 January. It is a groundbreaking piece of work. We believe that internationally it is the first to consider, as a single system, the full spectrum of teacher education and professional development. I therefore restate the Government&#8217;s thanks to Graham Donaldson and his team&#8212;I am pleased to note that Mr Donaldson is in the public gallery today. His report sets out a challenging agenda that the Scottish Government has no hesitation in accepting. We must now work to achieve the vision that it sets out.</p><p>Graham Donaldson makes it clear that, as we take forward that positive direction, we build on solid foundations. Scotland&#8217;s teaching workforce is well prepared and well supported. His 50 recommendations are designed to build on that strong base, ensuring that good practice is spread across the whole system.</p><p>As we undertake the work, it is increasingly understood that the public, private and third sectors must work together and with young people, families and communities to ensure that the full range of positive outcomes is delivered. There is agreement that early intervention to address risks, using the principles of getting it right for every child, is key to improving the life chances of those who might otherwise not achieve positive outcomes. We need to ensure that, through their education and development, teachers are enabled to contribute to that agenda.</p><p>I cannot during this statement refer to each of the 50 recommendations that Graham Donaldson made. The full Government response can be found on both the Scottish Government and review websites, and it indicates that we accept&#8212;in full, in part or in principle&#8212;each of the recommendations. Copies of our response can also be found at the back of the chamber.</p><p>I will highlight key aspects of the report that we need to take forward to achieve its vision. The most important partners in achieving that vision are teachers themselves. &#8220;Teaching Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; offers the opportunity to reinvigorate the concept of teacher professionalism.</p><p>Local authorities and universities have crucial roles in supporting teachers and working more closely together, and the report also highlights the contribution of national bodies. Making those partnerships work at a time of financial constraint will need detailed planning around implications&#8212;financial and otherwise.</p><p>To take forward many of the main recommendations in the report, the Government will set up a national partnership group for &#8220;Teaching Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221;. In that spirit of partnership, we have asked the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland and the Scottish Teacher Education Committee&#8212;representing the universities&#8212;to co-chair the group alongside the Scottish Government. It will include other important national stakeholders, such as the General Teaching Council for Scotland and the new national agency for quality improvement in education. We will also ensure that it includes front-line teachers and school leaders&#8212;those who have to make any arrangements work on the ground.</p><p>The national partnership group will have a challenging agenda. It will look in detail at how partnerships between schools, local authorities, universities and others can deliver the best quality in teacher education across the range of a teacher&#8217;s career. An important part of that will be developing opportunities to work towards masters-level qualifications. Through this development, we are moving towards highly successful models of teaching seen elsewhere in the world, encouraging a thirst for knowledge and intellectual ambition in the profession.</p><p>That is a challenging agenda. That is why we will set up the partnership working group immediately and ask it to report back on its proposed work programme by September 2011.</p><p>We have also identified two areas in which it would be helpful for the group to devolve some of its work, and two working groups, reporting to the national partnership group, will be set up. The first will look at areas of priority&#8212;such as specific curriculum areas or aspects of learning and teaching&#8212;that might be important to address at different stages in teachers&#8217; careers. The second specific group will be asked to develop the clear and progressive educational leadership pathway that &#8220;Teaching Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; suggests.</p><p>The important work that the national partnership group will take forward and oversee will set a substantial and demanding agenda into the medium term. However, &#8220;Teaching Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; sets out other directions that we need to build on now. That includes inviting the GTCS, as it moves towards its new independent status, as agreed by the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee last week, to consider how it might develop a more coherent approach to teaching standards. The GTCS will also be an important partner in work with the universities to reconceptualise and develop the traditional bachelor of education degree through which many of our teachers, especially primary teachers, come into teaching.</p><p>A final area in which we need to take steps now is in ensuring that the right people enter initial teacher education. Therefore, the Government will work with partners to improve selection procedures. Universities are autonomous institutions with the right to select their own students; however, they must also accept that there is a legitimate wider public interest in who trains to become a teacher.</p><p>As we discuss those wider ways forward on selection, there are areas in which we need to take decisive steps to ensure quality. We need to ensure that teachers have secured the higher level of literacy and numeracy skills that they need to develop those skills in others. Therefore, we will build on the existing high standards within the teaching workforce overall by undertaking work to ensure that new entrants to the profession have or develop appropriate standards of literacy and numeracy. We will take that forward vigorously and will aim to pilot approaches with the new student intake in 2012.</p><p>As we work with our partners, the actions that I have set out today will provide a collective challenge to us all. Professor Lindsay Paterson, writing in last week&#8217;s Times Educational Supplement, captures that well. He points to the role that we, in this chamber, must play alongside the universities, schools and others. I conclude with his words:</p><p>&#8220;The stability of purpose needed for lasting reform will require political consensus and strong leadership nationally. This revolution depends on us all.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646018", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Teaching Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There are three pillars to our approach to improving education in Scotland.

It is interesting to note that the prevalence of epilepsy is higher among children and very old people. It was interesting that Kenny Gibson informed Parliament that one third of children with epilepsy also have learning disorders. Today&#8217;s debate, which highlights the barriers that are faced by those with epilepsy in accessing learning at school, is therefore all the more important. Of course, we must remember that those barriers are faced not only at school but during future learning, skills development and employment.</p><p>Although the McCrone report specified that first aid and the administration of drugs should not be routinely carried out by teachers, I firmly believe that children and young people with epilepsy have the right to feel supported and valued at all times, unhindered by professional boundaries. As Kenneth Gibson highlighted, teachers spend a lot of time with children in school. Starting with initial teacher education, teachers must develop the core skills that they require to confidently enable the effective learning of all the children in their classes. Those core skills are set out in the standard for initial teacher education, as is the condition that all courses must be designed so that they prepare student teachers to be responsive to the needs of all pupils, including those with medical conditions.</p><p>As of earlier today, ministers no longer approve programmes for initial teacher education. Legislation was approved by the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee this very day, so that responsibility will be passed to the General Teaching Council for Scotland, which we believe is better placed to approve the detail of programmes of initial teacher education.</p><p>We must recognise the reality that students in our schools live with a wide range of serious conditions, and we must ask ourselves how realistic it would be for teachers to receive training in each of those conditions before entering the classroom. One strength of the Scottish education system is that each year our teachers are required to undertake 35 hours of continuous professional development and five in-service days. I hope that that ensures that each teacher is best equipped to meet the needs of their students.</p><p>Graham Donaldson recognised the issue in his recent and valuable report on teacher education. He pointed to the considerable evidence from universities, teachers, students and others that there is already significant pressure in relation to the breadth of the issues that must be addressed through teacher education. He made a number of suggestions for ways forward, but he did not suggest that there is a single clear solution. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning will soon set out his formal response to the report to Parliament, and will indicate how the Scottish Government will take forward the agenda.</p><p>I listened to Alasdair Allan with interest when he spoke of the actions that Epilepsy Wales is undertaking. I believe that the focus on health and wellbeing in the curriculum for excellence will enable many of the initiatives and good ideas to be taken forward.</p><p>Our schools must be communities in which our children&#8212;irrespective of their different abilities and needs&#8212;are able to learn and to achieve their full potential. Collectively, the whole school must take an holistic approach to supporting and meeting the individual needs of children with long-term conditions. That responsibility is set out in the comprehensive framework that is in place and which helps to ensure that, among other things, the needs of children and young people are identified as early as possible.</p><p>The additional support for learning legislation, getting it right for every child, the early years framework and the guidance on the administration of medicine all help to set the scene for the collaborative approach that is required, particularly between health and education, in order to ensure that all staff in schools are confident in their role in meeting the individual needs of all our children and young people, including those with epilepsy. It is important to note that our legislation and frameworks all point to the need for any child who has a difficulty to have one plan that all the various and relevant agencies sign up to.</p><p>I will illustrate our commitment to supporting improvement in the area. Through the national delivery plan for specialist children&#8217;s services, we are funding epilepsy services to increase the number of multidisciplinary staff and therefore to provide better all-round care to young patients. An example of that is a recently appointed epilepsy nurse in the Borders who is providing training to schools to raise awareness.</p><p>In closing, I again thank Kenneth Gibson for initiating this useful debate and pay tribute to the cross-party group on epilepsy, as mentioned by both Richard Simpson and Alasdair Allan. I take this opportunity to reassure the Parliament that the Government is committed to ensuring that every child and young person&#8212;irrespective of their needs&#8212;is provided with every opportunity to succeed and to reach their full potential.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645239", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Epilepsy Awareness Training"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my thanks to my colleague, Kenneth Gibson, for highlighting to Parliament the importance of ensuring that children and young people with epilepsy are provided with the support that they require and the support to which they are entitled to make the most of their educational opportunities.

They range from better-informed personal lifestyle and health choices to public involvement in science-based policy development and tackling the bigger global challenges, such as climate change and biodiversity. On the risks of getting our science policy wrong, Derek Bok, formerly of Harvard University, said:</p><p>&#8220;If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.&#8221;</p><p>Science learning in school is not only the responsibility of teachers, although I will now have an enduring image of Bob Doris and a Bunsen burner. Many members have spoken about the curriculum for excellence, which provides a framework for partnership working within which the wider science community, including the science centres, has an opportunity to support excellence inside and outside the classroom. The centres provide a source of inspiration&#8212;of wow and wonder&#8212;help to nurture a fascination with science that people may retain throughout their lives, and provide a shop front for bringing the science of our excellent researchers in further and higher education out of the lab to the wider public.</p><p>It is interesting that, annually, around 75 per cent of the visitors to the science centres are not children, but other members of the public. Joe FitzPatrick was right to say that the centres are not just for children&#8212;although, as a married woman, I would certainly not like to commend speed dating. On a more serious note, I want science centres to continue their excellent work, but I challenge them to be alert to new and important niches of activity where they can add value and help to cement and consolidate important related initiatives. Joe FitzPatrick spoke very well of the new science learning institute at Dundee Science Centre as an excellent example of where that is done. The centre has identified an enabling role that it can play in facilitating partnerships and collaborations between existing and new friends to support science learning, teacher training and continuing professional development across the city and the region that aligns synergistically&#8212;I shall move on to the point that Elaine Murray made, as I cannot even pronounce that word.</p><p>Elaine Murray spoke about the very positive HMIE reports with favourable results for all the science centres. They were very much about assessing the alignment of the science centres with formal education.</p><p>Nanette Milne spoke very well of Satrosphere in Aberdeen. It is to its credit that it has a new management agreement with Dundee Science Centre and has made new connections with the University of Aberdeen. That has resulted in a far higher profile for it in the city of Aberdeen and elsewhere.</p><p>Although the current economic climate is extremely tough, I am nevertheless delighted to confirm that, in contrast to what is happening in the rest of the UK, we plan to continue to support the centres in 2011-12 to the tune of &#163;2.6 million in recognition of the invaluable work that they undertake.</p><p>I accept that not everyone is able to or wishes to visit a centre, so we need to find other ways of bringing science to them. We recognise the challenges of geography and inclusion that parts of Scotland face, so we plan to provide an additional &#163;200,000 in 2011-12 to support transport costs to the centres for visitors from remote or socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. I hope that that is of interest to both Mr Coffey and Mr Stone.</p><p>I conclude by referring to the science and engineering 21 education action plan process that is currently under way. It is chaired by the chief scientific adviser for Scotland, Professor Anne Glover, and will set a strategic direction for science education and engagement for the coming years. I look forward to seeing the centres, and indeed the wider science community, playing an active role in that process as it moves forward in the months ahead.</p><p>Before I forget, I will respond to the issue that Sandra White raised. My understanding is that the Glasgow Science Centre has an endowment fund that no other science centre has.

I am glad that members from across the political spectrum have showcased colleges in their constituencies, as we have much to celebrate.</p><p>It is important to reflect on Mr Welsh&#8217;s opening remarks when he spoke of Angus College punching well above its weight. The college is rightly renowned for the high quality of learning opportunities that it delivers to the people of Angus. It is indeed a sector-leading institution and one of which many people in Angus, including Andrew Welsh, are justifiably proud. It is a successful and well-run college and, as has been said, an award-winning one. Under John Burt&#8217;s leadership, the college gained not one, but two gold prizes at the recent college award ceremony. One feature that interested me is that Angus has the highest percentage of school leavers going into further education. As Alex Johnstone and Johann Lamont reflected, colleges give a second chance in learning, but they are most certainly not the second-best option.</p><p>We all know that there will be significant challenges ahead for all our colleges. As well as celebrating our successes, members are right to speak of the challenges that institutions in their constituencies and across the sector face. Next year, Angus Council will have to bear its share of the consequences of the reduction by Westminster of &#163;1.3 billion in Scotland&#8217;s block grant, as will other councils. I believe that that budget reduction is too much, too soon, and that it will bring unnecessary pain and challenge to many institutions and put our economic recovery in jeopardy.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, the Government has protected student support at record levels. In 2009-10, &#163;79 million was invested in student support, which was a record level, and the figure for 2010-11 is &#163;84 million, which is again a record level. The draft budget seeks to protect that. However, the NUS campaign is compelling. Among the quotations on the NUS website, one student says:</p><p>&#8220;Having a bursary while I was a ... National Qualification ... student was the difference between eating and not eating.&#8221;</p><p>We cannot help but be affected by that. Another student says:</p><p>&#8220;When I decided to go to college, it was for a couple of reasons. One was to better myself and the other was so that I could get a job that paid higher than minimum wage so that as a single mother I could provide for my children better than I was at that time.&#8221;</p><p>That shows the life-changing potential of Scotland&#8217;s colleges.</p><p>Elaine Smith talked about the importance of the college sector to young women and young mothers.</p><p>As we know, budget discussions are on-going. The Government is a listening Government and we all await the result of the budget negotiations. Of course, the budget is finite. We do not have unlimited resources and, as John Swinney reminds us all, the budget ultimately has to be balanced.</p><p>A number of interesting points were made in the debate. For example, we heard that 55 per cent of college students are women. Although the rate of youth unemployment is lower in Scotland than it is in the UK, we cannot fail to be concerned about the rising number of unemployed young women. During the past year there has been a 12 per cent increase in the number of unemployed young women. We must consider the drivers for youth unemployment. The overarching point about the need for greater integration of employability and skills was well made by Margaret Smith and must be pursued.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644071", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education Colleges"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Andrew Welsh on securing the debate.

As other speakers have said, he is a very colourful character. The motion is typical of his imagination, his flair and his commitment to young people the length and breadth of Scotland.</p><p>Recession hits young people the hardest. Unemployment can do long-term damage to the young; it scars individuals and communities. We must learn the lessons of previous recessions and ensure that never again is a generation of young people written off. That means that we must support young people, recognising that they all have different ambitions and needs, as Margaret Smith and Hugh O&#8217;Donnell stated. For some young people, that is about helping them to create and grow their own business. Self-employment is the lifeblood of our economy. It is hugely important in the current economic climate when the jobs simply are not there. In supporting the motion, the Government will explore ways of establishing a Scottish youth microcredit scheme.</p><p>As many speakers, including Margaret Smith, Kenny Gibson and David Whitton, acknowledged, the crucial issue in establishing Grameen in the UK is that of resolving problems and interactions with the welfare benefits system. We have to rid the system of any disincentives. We have to recognise that, in supporting young people to transform themselves from a state of dependency to one of independence&#8212;a notion that I fully support&#8212;transitional funding will be needed. I hope that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will take that forward with their Government in London&#8212;the UK Government. In the very near future, along with Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Neil, I will meet Lord Freud to discuss a number of welfare reform issues.</p><p>As Jim Mather said in his opening speech, this Government remains committed to tackling youth unemployment. We have the immediate and pressing challenges that are associated with the recession. Youth unemployment in Scotland is currently at 17.9 per cent. Although the figure is lower than that for the United Kingdom, it remains too high. We are talking about the lives and futures of some 70,000 individuals. I accept Claire Baker&#8217;s point that the rate of young unemployment is much higher in some of our communities.</p><p>We remain focused on the more fundamental change that is needed to tackle the unacceptable and endemic problem of youth unemployment. Although there is no silver bullet, collaboration between public, private and voluntary sectors is essential if we are to reach out to more young people who face particular barriers in their life to ensure that they, too, get their fair share of Scotland&#8217;s economic growth.</p><p>I am confident that this Government has a robust and clear plan, the aim of which is to support young people to make more successful transitions to adulthood and the world of work. In essence, this is about our substantial investment in skills: &#163;120 million for new training opportunities, of which &#163;60 million is focused on modern apprenticeships.</p><p>Mr Mather described the great work that is being done in schools, whether through the curriculum for excellence or determined to succeed. Unlike Elizabeth Smith, I prefer to think that our cup is half full as opposed to half empty.</p><p>Of course, our further education colleges promote entrepreneurship, too. They do that at a fundamental level through their hands-on approach to vocational training. Only last week, I had the privilege of visiting Adam Smith College in Fife to help to launch the education into enterprise scheme. The programme will support 1,000 college students on higher education courses to take up work placements with small and medium-sized businesses and third sector organisations.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642834", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People (Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am very much aware that Robin Harper has an infectious enthusiasm for young people.

From what Elaine Murray, John Park and David Whitton have said, it is clear that there is little doubt that, across the political parties, we all recognise the value of Scotland&#8217;s apprenticeship programme. Apprenticeships are about capitalising on the aspiration of people all over Scotland and channelling it into creating a more successful economy.</p><p>Through the hard work and dedication of training providers such as Minerva People and hundreds of others across Scotland, we can convert aspiration into genuine achievement. That is why I am delighted to have the opportunity to close the debate, to support Elaine Murray&#8217;s motion and, like others, to thank her for securing the debate. I warmly congratulate Minerva on its success at the modern apprenticeship awards in December. I, too, am sorry that the Minerva team did not get to accept its award on the night.</p><p>Like Elaine Murray, I was struck by the story of Minerva, which is one of two women returning to work. We should always celebrate success, particularly when we have an opportunity to celebrate the success of women in business.</p><p>The other thing that struck me about Minerva&#8217;s story was that, although it has embraced technology through using e-profiles, Facebook, blogging and all the rest of it, it has not done so at the expense of the personal touch. I am interested to note that each and every apprentice is visited regularly on site at their workplace</p><p>I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate all the other winners and nominees who participated in the awards ceremony. I will spend a moment or two sharing with the chamber some of their remarkable stories and testimonies.</p><p>One of the winners was Thomas Rennie, who overcame a devastating bereavement to be selected to go forward to WorldSkills 2011 as a member of the United Kingdom squad. After sending more than 100 letters, Carrie Crawford chose to move 150 miles to start her dream job in fabrication welding. Carrie and Thomas are great examples of the determination of our young apprentices the length and breadth of Scotland. Of course, modern apprenticeships are not just for young people. Barry Adamson, the winner in the over-20 group, was able through the MA programme to change direction in his career after redundancy.</p><p>We also have a number of companies who have shown long-term commitment to the modern apprenticeship programme, such as Dales Engineering Services in Peterhead, which has been involved in the programme for 15 years and whose former apprentices are now making a significant contribution to the business at all levels. I also make a special mention of the apprentice of the year, Thomas Davidson, who has balanced caring commitments to his family with an extremely successful progression through his apprenticeship with the Scottish Rugby Union.</p><p>Those people are all committed to the apprenticeship programme and they deserve our commitment in return. The Scottish Government has demonstrated its commitment in maintaining high numbers of apprentices and making another 20,000 opportunities available this year, the majority of which are targeted at young people, although not exclusively. The Government has committed significant amounts of money to modern apprenticeships, investing around &#163;60 million. We have invested at that level because we have made the apprenticeship programme a key component of Scotland&#8217;s strong economic recovery.</p><p>As we have moved through the recession we have worked hard to ensure that apprentices whose employers run into difficulty have the opportunity to complete their training with an alternative employer. That is why we introduced and extended the adopt an apprentice and safeguard an apprentice schemes. The response of employers across Scotland to that has been superb and we have been able to support 1,000 apprentices whose apprenticeships were at risk.</p><p>I listened with interest to Mr Whitton&#8217;s preference for retaining the future jobs fund at the UK level. He also spoke of his commitments here in Scotland. We have to be absolute in our commitment to tackling youth unemployment. The figures that were released today show that youth unemployment in Scotland is now at 17.9 per cent. Although that figure has plateaued and is marginally lower than the UK figure of 18.2 per cent, we are still talking about 70,000 unemployed young people in Scotland. The consequences of youth unemployment for individuals and for communities can have a long-term and devastating impact.</p><p>In tackling youth unemployment, the modern apprenticeship programme has distinct strengths, such as the employed status in the framework, the long-term training opportunity that it provides for young people, the opportunity that it gives them to improve their skills significantly and the fact that it gives them a qualification that they can be proud of. That is something that John Park spoke about eloquently: the pride that people who have completed an apprenticeship have in the qualification that they receive.</p><p>The modern apprenticeship programme is well received, recognised and supported by employers, and we should be pleased that the most recent figures show a 70 per cent successful completion rate. We have a credible vehicle for moving ahead and tackling youth unemployment more effectively. I am also, of course, pleased that Elaine Murray secured more apprenticeship opportunities in her area&#8212;that is very important.</p><p>The apprenticeship programme is a collective effort. That is one of its strongest attributes. The programme requires commitment from participants, employers, training providers, funding bodies and the Parliament. Today&#8217;s debate has highlighted that the commitment is in place at all levels, which is good news for Scotland, its people and its economy. I support and congratulate Minerva on its continued work with apprentices in Dumfries and Galloway and I once again thank Elaine Murray for lodging a motion to highlight its success.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:26.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Minerva People Ltd"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s debate highlights the importance to Scotland of the modern apprenticeship programme.

There is a minimum of 22.5 hours a week of teaching time and teaching can be delivered only by GTCS teachers. That is stated in the regulations. Of course, we should all welcome the opportunity for other people with specialist expertise, whether that is David Miliband, some sporting personality or another appropriately qualified individual, to enhance the curriculum in addition to the core curriculum and the 22.5 hours of teaching.</p><p>If there is a genuine issue that members want to discuss pragmatically and sensibly, rather than inflaming concerns and sowing unnecessary doubts in the minds of parents, we in the Government are always happy to hear concerns from members from across the political spectrum about their constituencies.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21177845", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Government is not short on ambition for all our young people and children, irrespective of their background or start in life.

That, of course, is a direct consequence of the cuts of some &#163;1.3 billion imposed on Scotland by the United Kingdom Government. Let us be clear about the context in which SDS and the rest of Scotland's public sector now has to operate. We face a financial challenge without precedent since devolution, one that represents the biggest reduction in public spending imposed on Scotland by any United Kingdom Government.</p><p>The voluntary severance programme opened by SDS is a central part of the organisation's plans to meet its share of those significant savings. I accept that it means that jobs will go from the organisation. I regret that. However, there are two important points that I want to make absolutely clear. The first is that the SDS programme is a voluntary scheme with no element of compulsion. The second is that there will be no negative impact on service delivery as a result of the scheme. I have that unequivocal assurance from SDS and I am happy to give the Parliament that unequivocal assurance. What we have is a voluntary scheme about which we have categorical assurances from the board of SDS that service delivery will in no way be compromised. In fact, the very purpose of the scheme is to help SDS to make the efficiencies that it needs to make in order to protect spending on training programmes and other front-line services. Those are the top-line facts.<place-holder colnum=\"31911\"/></p><p>I turn now to the voluntary severance scheme. The scheme was announced by SDS on 16 December and will run until 28 January next year. The aim is to secure up to 125 full-time equivalent leavers from the organisation. That number will come from an existing base of nearly 1,400 full-time equivalent staff. Staff whose applications to leave are accepted will depart the organisation by 31 March next year. Final decisions on applications made under the scheme will be ratified by a sub-committee of Skills Development Scotland's main board.</p><p>To summarise: the scheme seeks up to 125 full-time equivalent staff from nearly 1,400, there will be no compulsory redundancies and there are assurances from the board that service delivery will not be compromised. In fact, it is quite the opposite, as the scheme aims to identify the savings necessary to protect front-line services with SDS continuing its commitment to make available 34,500 training opportunities.</p><p>As I said earlier, we regret the loss of jobs that will result, but this is the sort of tough decision that SDS simply has to take if it is to protect service provision from the full force of the cuts that have been levelled at the Scottish Government. The scheme is essentially about creating a yet more efficient organisation and getting scarce resources to where they are most needed: the front line.</p><p>In a moment, I will say something about the volume and effect of SDS's skills interventions, but first I will address efficiency. Skills Development Scotland has a strong track record in getting maximum value out of public money since it was set up in 2008. It has achieved &#163;20 million of efficiency savings over the past two years and is on track to deliver its target of a further &#163;19 million this year. For example, Skills Development Scotland and Scottish Enterprise have developed a shared service contract for information technology provision and expect it to deliver efficiencies of around &#163;20 million over five years.</p><p>What about service delivery? What is Skills Development Scotland's track record on that and why is it so important that we protect it? The interventions that Skills Development Scotland makes are delivering. They are improving outcomes for the unemployed, those who want to improve their skills and young people who face a particular threat from the recession and the Westminster cuts. On that too, let us look at the facts.</p><p>Skills Development Scotland has demonstrated its ability successfully to direct resources to support people into work, from work to work and to progress in work. It undertakes a number of functions, including, as members know: an all-age careers service that operates the length and breadth of Scotland; support for young people <place-holder colnum=\"31912\"/> leaving school and college; a range of national training programmes, including modern apprenticeships, training for work and get ready for work; the individual learning account 200 programme; and the co-ordination of our partnership action for continuing employment&#8212;PACE&#8212;national redundancy service.</p><p>SDS plays a key role in our efforts to tackle youth unemployment, which is a continuing priority for the Government. Working with local authorities and others, it helps to ensure that all young people have the opportunity to stay in learning after 16, as that is the best means of improving their employability. Our priority is to ensure that every young person leaving school, college or university has the support that they need for as long as they need it to move into long-term sustainable employment. SDS will help us to deliver that.</p><p>This year, a record proportion of school leavers&#8212;nearly 87 per cent&#8212;achieved positive destinations. That is a remarkable achievement in such difficult times. Much of that success is down to SDS's delivery of training. It delivered more than 20,000 modern apprenticeships in 2009-10, exceeding what everybody agreed was a testing target of 18,500 MA places. In doing so, it nearly doubled the previous year's number of MAs. That demonstrates the modern apprenticeship programme's role in delivering a strong economic recovery by supporting individuals and employers in Scotland and ensuring that Scotland has the skills that it needs for future growth and success. This year, SDS is again making available 20,000 MA opportunities. It has also extended its investment in the adopt-an-apprentice and safeguard-an-apprentice schemes until March 2011 to give every apprentice the best possible chance of completing their apprenticeship.</p><p>Next year&#8212;unaffected, as I have made clear, by the voluntary severance scheme&#8212;the Government will provide funds to support 34,500 training places. We plan to work with Skills Development Scotland to finalise the volumes for individual training programmes over the coming weeks. That represents the same number of places as Skills Development Scotland's budget supported in 2010-11, which is an enormous achievement, given the scale of the constraint that we face on public spending.</p><p>Since the start of the recession, our national redundancy programme, PACE, has been significantly expanded through Skills Development Scotland and the service that it provides has been considerably enhanced in response to weakening labour market conditions. The First Minister recently announced a &#163;300,000 package of skills and training support for Moray in response to the uncertainty that was created by the Ministry of Defence's strategic defence and security review. <place-holder colnum=\"31913\"/></p><p>Following the SDSR announcement, Skills Development Scotland moved quickly to increase its operational capacity in the area and has made it clear that its role is to lead a partnership initiative to assist people whose jobs will be affected. As part of the new funding package, Skills Development Scotland will provide additional training opportunities across the Moray community to supplement the support services already activated through PACE, but, of course, SDS has to make savings somewhere if it is to provide that level of service in Moray and throughout Scotland. That is at the very heart of the voluntary severance arrangements. Skills Development Scotland's scheme will help to create a yet more efficient organisation, ensuring that scarce funds go where they are needed, to help people throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21157065", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Development Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Against the background of the interest that various members have expressed, I will now make a statement on the voluntary severance scheme announced by Skills Development Scotland on 16 December.

As politicians, we like to try to rationalise everything, but often the bottom line is how one feels rather than how one thinks and I must confess that my heart usually rules my head.</p><p>I have found this issue difficult because I have been torn between my own instincts and beliefs and others' personal testimony. If&#8212;and I stress that word&#8212;the big moral issues of the day can be characterised as a spectrum between individual choice and the sanctity of life, my personal pendulum swings towards the latter and I have to say that, although the debate is not yet over, I intend to vote against the bill at this stage. Before I state my reasons for doing so, however, I should say that I am nevertheless proud to have been one of the signatories who enabled the bill to be subject to parliamentary debate and scrutiny. Nothing should be sacrosanct in this Parliament and, irrespective of our personal beliefs, we should be able to debate any issue and not only be able to defend our own position but allow our beliefs to be open to challenge. That is in the interest of all our constituents and a sign of a mature democracy and&#8212;dare I say it&#8212;mature politicians. Moreover, as a society, we do not talk <place-holder colnum=\"31076\"/> enough about death and dying; indeed, we tend to avoid such matters.</p><p>My other reason for supporting the opportunity to debate the bill, despite my not supporting it, is deeply personal. I apologise to members in advance for my sentimentality. My father used to say to me that he would rather die on his motorbike with the wind in his hair than suffer a debilitating or terminal decline. That may sound rather brash and matter of fact, but it was his personal and considered position as a result of seeing his brother dying of a lengthy terminal illness. As fate would have it, my father died on his motorbike at the age of 54. I was left wondering for a few days until the post mortem results were returned, but he was a healthy man who was taken before his time by an accident. That left a mark on me. Since then, I have wondered about the rights and wrongs of leaving people to take extreme action when all they want to do is exercise personal choice on how they can die with dignity, whatever that means.</p><p>There are no easy answers, and as a mother I feel differently from how I feel as a daughter. As a mother I never want to be a burden on my son; as a daughter I never want my mother to feel that she is a burden.</p><p>After much soul searching, I have come down on the side of those who have lobbied me to vote against the bill. However, I must be honest. I have at times resented the tone and tenor of some organisations, which have blistered the debate and misunderstood the intentions behind the bill. I note with interest that the opinion polls show that 80 per cent are in favour of the bill; in the correspondence that I have received thus far, 10 to one have been against it.</p><p>The area is difficult to legislate in. That is reflected in the many issues and concerns that the committee report highlights. I was formerly a mental health officer, so the discussions about establishing capacity struck a chord with me, and I take on board the evidence on that from the Royal College of Psychiatrists. I have also considered the concerns about the perception of change in the doctor-patient relationship and, of course, the difficulties in assessing undue influence. The crux of the problem is that the bill tries to deal objectively with some highly subjective issues. In many ways, the issue is simply too much for a member's bill.</p><p>Margo MacDonald has to be commended for her political and personal courage, but I cannot support this bill at this time.

He has worked hard with colleagues such as Keith Brown to establish the cross-party group on supporting veterans in Scotland, which does a good job.</p><p>I very much like the idea of a veterans charter, particularly as it could encapsulate all that we should be doing at a strategic level for our veterans. Having a charter that plainly states what all public bodies should be striving to do and what their duties are could go some way towards tackling the often inevitable problems that are faced by people who have seen active service, whether those are physical health problems, a disability, mental health problems or associated social issues.</p><p>Charters are all very well, but actions speak better and louder than words. I very much hope that we succeed in securing a charter. Public <place-holder colnum=\"30826\"/> agencies must be persuaded to be willing signatories, and they must then actually do what they have signed up to do. After all, our servicemen and servicewomen do without question what they have signed up to do on behalf of their country. As individuals, as citizens, as a Parliament and as a Government, we should ensure that there is a social contract for veterans, in recognition of what they do for us.</p><p>I have a particular interest in veterans who end up in the criminal justice system. Colleagues will recall a members' business debate earlier this year on that issue. I hope that a veterans charter would reflect on how the criminal justice system, at every stage from arrest to the worst-case scenario of sentencing and post-release supervision, could be better tailored to support veterans. For instance, community justice authorities could have a veterans champion.</p><p>With more alert services, we could be doing much more to prevent veterans from becoming involved in the criminal justice system. In that respect, a veterans charter could be a valuable tool. No one is above the law, but we cannot escape the significant mental health issues that are faced by many veterans who end up incarcerated. There is much more to be done in that respect.</p><p>I take the opportunity to ask the minister what progress has been made on having more reliable data on the number of veterans in Scotland's prisons. In the debate earlier this year, he said that he would pursue the issue at UK level with the new Secretary of State for Defence and the minister with responsibility for veterans, to build on the assurances that the Scottish Prison Service and the Ministry of Defence have given to work together on the matter. We do not want numbers for numbers' sake; we need better information about the profile of veteran offenders, because that will enable us to build up a better picture and have a better chance of rehabilitating veterans who end up on the wrong side of the law.</p><p>I draw members' attention to a recent report by the Howard League for Penal Reform, \"Leave No Veteran Behind: The Inquiry into Former Armed Service Personnel in Prison visits the United States of America\", which notes interesting parallels and differences between the UK and the USA in relation to veteran offenders. I should say that on both sides of the Atlantic veterans are far less likely to offend than are the general population, but when veterans offend the offence is more likely to be serious and to involve violence. Veterans tend to serve longer sentences. They also tend to be older: 30 per cent of veteran offenders&#8212;a significant proportion&#8212;are over 55. Of course, that figure is based on data on the <place-holder colnum=\"30827\"/> prison population in England and Wales. We need more information on Scotland.</p><p>The Howard League for Penal Reform's report floats the idea of a veterans court, a good example of which is in Buffalo in the USA. I am not instinctively drawn to specialist courts, because I think that our courts system should be able to deal day to day with the special issues that are associated with women offenders, drug offenders, domestic abuse offenders and veteran offenders. However, the approach is worthy of consideration, given its success across the Atlantic.

The committee should be commended for its focus on the practicalities as opposed to the politics of Calman, and there is much to be thankful for that committee members appear to be pragmatists first and ideologues second, although perhaps that has not been reflected in some of the speeches that we have heard today.

We cannot and must not underestimate the potential to deliver more effective and efficient health care and medical research and a more truly joined-up 21st century health service. Telehealth has given us the opportunity and means to revolutionise the service, with prompt, accessible and preventive health care.</p><p>The committee is right to aspire to see Scotland as a world leader in e-health and the first country to establish a national-scale telehealth service. I detect its impatience in its report. It is good to be impatient and to demand the best&#8212;sometimes that is the only way of moving things forward. Of course, Government must balance a good pace with good footwork, to ensure delivery. As the minister indicated in her speech, good progress is being made and there is a shared vision, not least in the desire to mainstream telecare.</p><p>Although I understand and accept the minister's decision on HEAT targets, I urge her to consider such targets as a weapon to be retained, if there is a need to cut through the cultural resistance to which Mary Scanlon referred, the pilotitis to which Ian McKee referred or the professional self-interest to which Michael Matheson referred. The financial climate in which we live at present is very challenging&#8212;that is probably an understatement&#8212;but with every crisis there are opportunities. There are opportunities to develop a shared approach to services, not least in information technology.</p><p>I reiterate that telehealth is about taking health care to patients, where and when they need it, and not an excuse to centralise services; on that point, I concur with Liam McArthur. I reinforce the remarks that other members have made this afternoon about the great value of technology for remote and rural areas. I know that Livingston is just off junction 3 of the M8 and will not be considered remote or rural, but my constituency is mixed and has a large rural component, where public transport is rather poor. There are also areas in West Lothian where broadband access remains rather elusive. The committee was right to highlight in its report the relationship between the roll-out of broadband and that of telehealth, and the need for those strategies to co-operate.</p><p>Given that many members have raised the issue of digital participation, I highlight the fact that there is a cross-party group on the subject, chaired by <place-holder colnum=\"28783\"/> my friend and colleague Willie Coffey, who assures me that the group is working hard to address some of the issues that have been mentioned. I am sure that members are welcome to attend meetings of the group.</p><p>I confess that initially I came to the issue of telehealth as a bit of a sceptic. I am the sort of person who would rather speak to someone than send them an e-mail. My initial concerns were probably epitomised by the sketch in \"Little Britain\" in which a woman sits behind a computer and, irrespective of the customer's question, always gives the answer, \"Computer says no.\" I became a convert when I became aware of the good work that is being done in West Lothian. NHS Lothian, in conjunction with West Lothian community health and care partnership, has been participating in one of the biggest telehealth projects in Europe&#8212;a &#163;700,000 project that focuses on the use of telemetry in tackling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and stroke.</p><p>To my surprise, the technology is extremely popular with patients, who have the equipment in their own homes. Carers are reassured that their loved ones have more immediate access to health care, and the approach has been proven to improve a patient's confidence and their control over their illness.</p><p>I will quote one patient who said in an evaluation of the project:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"My Doctor phoned me up to say that he had been monitoring my health system and wanted to visit me as he thought I had become unwell. It was great, as I was just about to phone him and ask for an appointment anyway - the system works.\"</p><p>Mind you, that sounds a bit more like telepathy than telehealth, so we should perhaps be careful as to what we aspire to.</p><p>There is huge potential in clinical portals, telehealth, telecare and telemedicine.

Although those terms convey meanings to politicians and professionals who are involved in the drug and alcohol field, I am not convinced that that terminology means much to the individuals, families and communities whose lives are blighted by drug misuse. Ultimately, people want to know what their Government and council are going to do about the problem. They want to know what we are doing about the chaotic drug user living next door to them, who has a constant stream of visitors day and night&#8212;the chaotic drug user who may or may not have children living at home. We cannot and must not underestimate or minimise the scale or scope of the problem of drug misuse in Scotland, given that more than 50,000 people <place-holder colnum=\"28547\"/> are using illicit drugs. Facing up to the facts is the first stage in recovery.</p><p>Neither must we hide our light under a bushel when it comes to the good things that are being done or that organisations and individuals are trying to achieve. It is good news that 100,000 children in Scotland have benefited from the cashback for communities scheme and that the curriculum for excellence is looking at how to promote effective educational programmes, such as choices for life and know the score. We have 1,000-plus more police officers on the street and the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency has seized tonnes of drugs, to a value of &#163;26 million. Record investment in drug treatment of &#163;28.6 million is clearly good news, as it is 20 per cent more than before and exceeds the Scottish National Party manifesto pledge. The introduction of HEAT targets is most welcome, such as the target that by 2013 people should be treated within three weeks.</p><p>The central focus is indeed on recovery. There is a good news story here: the message in our on-going battle is one of hope, not despair, because people can and do recover from drug misuse and change is possible.</p><p>It is absolutely right to put recovery at the heart of all that we do, given the comorbidity of drug misuse with mental health problems and childhood sexual abuse. However, we also need to be frank in acknowledging that failure is also the norm on the road to recovery. Few people get it right first time&#8212;ask anybody who has tried to lose weight or stop smoking.</p><p>Children have to be at the heart of any framework or strategy. As part of our endeavours, our priority has to be to consider the children whose lives are adversely affected by drug-abusing parents. The problem is endemic and we need to be frank that having a parent who uses alcohol problematically is not and will never be conducive to a healthy childhood. I am not prepared to dress that up in political correctness. The unequivocal message should be, \"If you've got bairns, you shouldnae be abusing drugs or alcohol.\" We also need to be frank and honest with each other about what we can and should do to solve the problem. As we have heard, it is estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 children are affected by parental drug misuse. We believe that 10,000 to 20,000 of them are living with a drug-abusing parent. I am informed that there is on-going work to try to establish more accurately those numbers and who those children are.</p><p>Some 65,000 children live with a parent with an alcohol problem. Across the UK, a quarter of children who are on the child protection register <place-holder colnum=\"28548\"/> are there because of alcohol or drugs. The figures for children who are looked after, whether at home, in foster care or with family and friends, is comparatively lower. We need to be blunt in saying that we cannot go around every community in Scotland gathering up children whose parents abuse drugs or alcohol. We would never have the capacity to take all the children into care, nor should we.</p><p>When it comes to protecting children and giving them the best chance, there is nothing worse, or more dangerous, than a one-size-fits-all, blanket philosophy or policy, so what should we be doing? In families where the prospects of recovery are poor, we need to take faster and more decisive action to remove children. However, in the vast majority of cases we should be working with the drug-abusing parent. That is not easy&#8212;it is difficult but crucial work. At the heart of the strategy should be the aim to do more about parenting by running parenting programmes with individuals, communities and groups. That work can be done within the community, in the residential setting or in prison.</p><p>If recovery is to be part of our focus, the other crucial part of that focus should be on parenting. Across the disciplines that are involved in working with people who abuse drugs and alcohol, we need to train more people in parenting programmes.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20995658", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I confess that I have a strong dislike for the words \"strategy\", \"framework\" and \"action plan\".

The soothsayers and doom-mongers said that this first Scottish Government would not last six months. Of course, crucial to its success is the ability and determination to work with others, whether it is the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the police, the national health service or even Opposition parties.</p><p>Having met 77 of our 90 manifesto commitments, the Scottish Government's record compares well with that of the Labour-Liberal Executive, but we should be setting our sights much higher. The previous Executive may well have brought in the best housing legislation in the world, but it forgot to build the houses. It is this Government that has funded hundreds of new houses in my constituency and thousands across Scotland.</p><p>We have heard today that there will be no taking the foot off the gas for the Government in the fourth year of this parliamentary session. The legislative programme includes measures of justice that seek to address the centuries-old double jeopardy rule, deal with forced marriages, and modernise death certification to minimise the concealment of unlawful death; and there will be a private rented housing bill focusing on the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.</p><p>The dominant issue in the year ahead will, of course, be the budget. It is anticipated that, in the next 12 to 14 years, we will receive &#163;42 billion less from Westminster and, given that it will be 15 years before the budget returns in real terms to 2009-10 levels, I am tempted to suggest that Westminster is part of the problem and not the solution. There is a choice between a decade of despair, and independence.</p><p>Undoubtedly, difficult times with tough decisions are ahead, but there are also opportunities. First and foremost, there is an opportunity for the Parliament to show the people of Scotland that it can work together to protect their interests against another unelected Tory Government&#8212;only this time the Tories are aided and abetted by the Liberals.</p><p>The severity of the shrinking public finance cake demonstrates conclusively that the status quo is no longer a viable option in terms of what the Parliament can and cannot do. This is where we get to the heart of the matter. My preference has always been to take the constitutional issue to the people&#8212;their options and choices for the future&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"28266\"/> and take it to the people we will. As elected representatives, we would do well to remember that the real debate takes place outside the chamber. We in the SNP will not allow three Opposition parties to deny millions of Scots the right to decide. The Labour Party et al may think that Scots have the right to cheap booze, but I think that we have the right to decide our future. Let us lift the debates of national importance and not appeal to the lowest common denominator.</p><p>I am an ardent supporter of minority government&#8212;as a humble back bencher I think that it is good that Governments do not always get their way&#8212;but I am also an ardent believer in conviction, whether on minimum pricing or on a referendum. On the building blocks of life, we must appeal over the heads of the Opposition when it is in the national interest to do so. Minority government brings huge opportunities for the Opposition but, once again, it has missed the boat; the Opposition parties will not say what they will protect and what they will cut. They were even offered the opportunity to draft the second option in the referendum bill, but they were intransigent as usual. Mind you, try explaining Calman on the doorsteps: it is financially complex and economically illiterate; in other words, it is a dug's dinner and nobody truly believes in it. We have already heard from the First Minister that, if Calman had been implemented in 2009-10, we would have been &#163;900 million down. Of course, support for independence does well in comparison with support for Calman, but the majority of polls show that most people want our Parliament to grow&#8212;they want change of some description or another. It is therefore beholden on us to bring that debate to the people, so it is shameful that the Opposition parties have consistently said that they would vote down a referendum bill.</p><p>Either people believe in Scotland as a nation, or they do not. Either they believe that we can manage all our money, or they do not. Either they believe that we have it in us to grow our own economy, or they do not. We should be lifting our eyes to the hills rather than constantly looking down and being afraid of the fall and, to steal the slogan of an opponent, we should be going forward not back. The election in 2007 changed the Parliament and changed the Government; indeed, we got a Government instead of an Executive. The election in 2010 will change mindsets, change confidence and give renewed aspirations to the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20976559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The legislative programme will build on and consolidate the Scottish Government's record of achievement.

If the Parliament is passionate about reducing crime and making communities safer, we must cast a cool eye over the evidence and decide dispassionately what works in punishing and changing offenders. All the evidence shows that short prison sentences do not work for low-level offenders. They are counterproductive and costly. We can no longer afford to have a misplaced confidence in prison.</p><p>I am surprised that members of the Labour Party think that it is entirely appropriate for those convicted of domestic violence to receive sentences of three months or less.

As a former local government councillor, I was a member of the West Lothian children's panel advisory committee for a number of years.</p><p>The West Lothian CPAC was, in my view, an exemplar in the recruitment and training of panel members. The local recruitment campaign bore far more fruit than the annual national campaign, and great efforts were made&#8212;with great success&#8212;to recruit men and people with real-life experience. West Lothian panel members represent all aspects of community life, and there is a good spread and variety of professions, backgrounds and ages.</p><p>The selection process was extensive, and successful panel members have for a number of years now had to evidence their on-going training and development. That was done in recognition of the professional job that we ask volunteers to do. I can say with confidence that the quality of panel members in West Lothian is outstanding.</p><p>Of course, what exists in West Lothian will not be unique; there will be other areas of excellence. However, I cannot say with confidence that the West Lothian experience is the national experience the length and breadth of Scotland. All change is difficult and, having reflected on my discussions with Senga Kemp, the chair of the children's panel, and Bill MacDonald, the chair of the CPAC, both in West Lothian, I say to the minister that we must ensure that we take the good folk with us. I understand the benefits of moving towards a national supporting body and national standards, but as members on all sides of <place-holder colnum=\"27343\"/> the debate have emphasised today, we must not lose the benefits of local activity and knowledge.</p><p>This morning, I spent a considerable time with a mother in my constituency who feels totally let down and abandoned by the system. Her child was the victim of an incident involving other children. She did not want vengeance or retribution, tempting though that was and is. What she wanted was twofold. At the time, she needed information and support, but they were not forthcoming, so she had to pursue them at a time of great trauma for her daughter and her family. Services were most certainly not seamless and vital information was not shared.</p><p>Crucially, however, what she wanted to know above all else was that the children who had committed the act against her daughter would not be lost in the system. She wanted to be reassured that everything would be done to turn those children's lives around. She wanted to know that we&#8212;the state&#8212;would ensure that what happened to her child would not happen to another. Of course, I cannot put my hand on my heart and reassure her that that will indeed be the case. We cannot always prevent bad things from happening to children. However, we need to have a children's hearings system in which we have absolute confidence.</p><p>Although confidentiality of individuals and families cannot and must not be breached, we need to find ways in which to communicate far more effectively what actually happens in hearings and the range of options that is available. That is certainly reflected in the briefings from Barnardo's and others. It is not just politicians who need to have confidence in the children's hearings system. We need to go out there and convince members of the public that it is not the soft option in addressing the needs of children who are in trouble. Professionals and politicians need to think carefully about the language that we use. We all spend much time talking about outcomes for children when, ultimately, what we are talking about is changing children's lives and giving them the best possible start in life.</p><p>I am not a member of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee&#8212;that is not a pleasure that I have&#8212;so I have not sat through all the evidence from all the stakeholders, which is another word that I hate. However, two things leaped out at me. The first is that it is important to increase powers to address the non-implementation of decisions that are made by the children's panels. As a former social worker, I carry the professional scars of old battles&#8212;mainly with health, I have to say&#8212;so I read with interest the briefing from the Association of Directors of Social Work, which states that the bill could provide an opportunity to make more tangible the <place-holder colnum=\"27344\"/> language of shared responsibility. I suppose that the bottom line is always about improving children's lives. There is an old saying: \"You're only young once.\" Some other interesting briefings were provided by the voluntary sector. I note that, when it comes to decision making and enforcement powers, people want panels to take account of the remits of other agencies. Although I do not disagree with that&#8212;it is stating the obvious&#8212;neither do I want children's panels to let agencies off the hook. To get the best deal for children, professionals and agencies sometimes have to think and act outwith the box, laying to one side the tick-box criteria and exercising professional autonomy.

When we need to act, we need to do so quickly and comprehensively.</p><p>I believe that now is the time to reform Scotland's children's hearings system. The bill gives us the opportunity to hold dear the Kilbrandon principles and move forward to ensure that all children in need have every opportunity to succeed in life. Scotland's children's hearings system has been admired around the world, but time stands still for no one and we should aspire to be world leaders.

He rightly pointed out that the family nurse partnership has been well researched over a period of 30 years in the United States. As I understand it, it is somewhat inspired by the system of health visitors in this country. I know that the valuable role of health visitors is appreciated by members throughout the chamber. The way ahead for health visitors has been the subject of debate and will no doubt continue to be so.</p><p>It is, of course, good news that the family nurse partnership is fully funded by the Scottish Government for three years. I do not doubt that that is money that is well spent on vulnerable first-time parents.</p><p>As the member for Livingston, I am acutely aware of the high number of young parents in my constituency. I hasten to add that I do not see that as a bad thing&#8212;I do not consider the terms \"young parent\" and \"young mother\" to be pejorative. Some 38 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds in West Lothian <place-holder colnum=\"26527\"/> have one child or more, whereas the national average for that age range, according to the most recent census, is 32 per cent. Although the figure for West Lothian does not represent huge numbers of people, I note that the rate of teenage pregnancy in pockets of deprivation in my constituency can be three or even 10 times the average.</p><p>Ian McKee's motion points out that one measure alone will not provide the entire answer to the challenge of working with young vulnerable parents. Young parents do not always access services, which often are not designed for them. Further, public policy is often designed to deter young people from becoming parents too soon, although ironically it has little to say when they do.</p><p>I am pleased to say that there is a history of good work with parents in West Lothian. The Broxburn family centre has done much pioneering work, combining parenting input with educational input, and the sure start programme has worked well with the department of adolescent and child psychiatry and the department of psychological services at St John's hospital.</p><p>I am aware that Barnardo's Scotland has an excellent test programme called you first. One of the two test sites is in Blackburn in West Lothian, just outside my constituency. Crucially, the you first programme, like the family nurse partnership, enshrines the belief that young parents are part of the solution and not part of the problem. They are a resource with whom organisations should work in partnership. All the evidence shows that the relationships that the skilled workers&#8212;whether they are nurses or social workers&#8212;form with the participants, and the skills that they deploy, are often more important in achieving outcomes than the course content.</p><p>The you first test project has had tremendous outcomes. All the participants are on course to achieve qualifications. There are reports that participants have developed better relationships with their children, and 80 per cent of the parents are receiving the benefits to which they are entitled. They have bank accounts, and they have been put in touch with the local credit union.</p><p>A general point about the evaluation of programmes such as the family nurse partnership and the you first programme is that we should evaluate not only the outcomes for parents but the outcomes for children. The key objective of all services that work with parents is to improve the life chances of children.</p><p>One small caveat to supporting such initiatives is that, as Richard Simpson said, we have to guard against endless pilots. We need to ensure good integration and co-ordination of services, whether those are statutory services, the health <place-holder colnum=\"26528\"/> service or services in the voluntary sector. We need to avoid duplication, because that is important in these difficult financial times, and because we need to ensure that we have a good geographical and equitable distribution of services.</p><p>It is always worth making the point that parenting, and ensuring that children get the best parenting possible, is everybody's business: every department of Government, local government and the health service.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20809177", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Family Nurse Partnership Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I congratulate my colleague and old friend, Dr McKee, on securing this debate.

While no one is above the law, we nonetheless have a moral responsibility to those who risk everything for their country. To do the best by our troops, we need honestly to acknowledge the trauma of active combat and the personal cost for some in terms of physical and mental health, substance misuse, relationship problems and resettling into civilian life, all of which can be the root cause of offending by veterans. If we are to do the right thing by veterans whose front-line experience relates directly or indirectly to their offending behaviour, as with all offenders we need to know who they are, where they are and what works.</p><p>Of those leaving the forces, 15 per cent experience transitional and coping problems. As parliamentarians, we should be concerned about a recent survey and anecdotal evidence that suggests that there are a large number of veterans within the criminal justice system. That body of evidence exists in England and Wales, and we should seek the same information in Scotland. A recent joint study by the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence found that 3 per cent of the prison population in England and Wales had served in the armed forces. However, the National Association of Probation Officers estimated that the figure was 8 per cent; the Veterans in Prison <place-holder colnum=\"25703\"/> Association estimated that it was 9.1 per cent; and one study in HM Prison Dartmoor in 2007 estimated that it was 16.5 per cent.</p><p>What of Scotland, with her strong military traditions? According to the most recent figures from the Scottish Prison Service, there are 135 veterans in a prison population approaching 8,000. That is 1.7 per cent of the prison population who self-report if asked whether they have an armed forces history. As a former prison social worker, I instinctively think that those figures are an underestimate. Indeed, the SPS, to its credit, appears to acknowledge that. I am grateful to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill and the United Kingdom defence minister Kevan Jones for giving me their assurance that they will work with the Scottish Prison Service to ascertain accurately how many veterans are in prison in Scotland.</p><p>The most thorough study in England and Wales involved the matching of MOD and Ministry of Justice databases. If the findings were similar in Scotland, the number of known veterans in our criminal justice system would at least double. However, the figure for the number of veterans who are serving community service and probation orders is unknown. I will reply to Kevan Jones's helpful letter and will seek the minister's support in encouraging a comprehensive study of veterans throughout the criminal justice system in Scotland.</p><p>We need to know the number of veterans in prison and elsewhere in our justice system to ensure that the appropriate spectrum of services for veterans at risk of offending is available, from arrest referral, diversion, alternatives to custody, and through-care and aftercare provision for those for whom there is no option but custody. Of course, much harm could be prevented with the right support to veterans, pre and post release from service.</p><p>Whatever the statistics, veterans will make up a small part of the overall prison population. However, NAPO states that a significant number of veterans have seen combat and that most incarcerated veterans appear to suffer from a combination of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and alcohol problems. Evidence suggests that armed services personnel are more likely than the general population to drink dangerously.</p><p>Combat Stress deals with a staggering 4,200 veterans with profound trauma across the United Kingdom. Our armed forces often have experiences of the most harrowing and disturbing nature, so it should be no surprise to us that ex-service personnel who commit crimes are usually struggling with trauma issues. Having worked in both the criminal justice system and the mental health system, I am not convinced that prison or <place-holder colnum=\"25704\"/> mainstream mental health services are always best equipped to care for and to rehabilitate veterans whose offending relates to combat trauma. Understandably, veterans would rather speak to other veterans about their experiences. More effective means of preventing and treating psychiatric service-related disorders are required, as it can be 13 years before a veteran is referred to an organisation such as Combat Stress. We know that combat-related mental health problems can be missed or misdiagnosed.</p><p>At a recent joint meeting of the mental health and veterans cross-party working group, I heard that more education is needed among general practitioners and that, in some instances, the use of benzodiazepines can lead to flashbacks and violence.</p><p>Some excellent work is undertaken. Recently I was blown away by a visit to Erskine; Veterans First Point is another hugely impressive organisation. The appointment of veterans champions in local authorities and the national health service is welcome, but criminal justice authorities may need to do likewise.</p><p>I thank the academics and the veteran, criminal justice and mental health organisations that recently gave up their time to participate in a summit that I held in Parliament. I am most grateful to those members who signed my motion and are participating in tonight's debate. I also appreciate the contributions of the many individuals who have contacted me on the matter, subsequent to an incisive article by a young freelance journalist, Rachel Money.</p><p>I firmly believe that we are only at the beginning of the journey on this matter. Sadly, given the nature of the conflict in Iraq and, in particular, the theatre of war in Afghanistan, if we do not take pre-emptive action we will see more traumatised veterans in our prisons in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764185", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans (Criminal Justice System)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Men and women from throughout Scotland who serve in the armed forces make huge sacrifices on behalf of all of us.

However, the report, as well as the Scottish Government response and this debate, should be viewed as only the beginning of the discourse. The committee report ended on a poignant and pragmatic note when it quoted Sacro, which stated in written evidence:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Perhaps too much emphasis has been given in the past to analysing the profile of women offenders rather than devising solutions to the problem.\"</p><p>To give women realistic opportunities to address their offending behaviour is not just an equality issue; it is also about making our communities safer and in many instances creating more secure and stable families.<place-holder colnum=\"23836\"/></p><p>Politicians need to acknowledge the enhanced vulnerability of women offenders as well as the need to engage effectively with and empower women to take responsibility for their lives. We do women no favours if we infantilise them and frame our discourse with them purely in the context of their victimhood. No one is above the law. However, as the committee said, we need to understand clearly and address the consequences of the different ways in which women enter the criminal justice system and are subsequently treated.</p><p>As we heard, the female prison population has doubled in a decade, whereas the male prison population has increased by only 16 per cent. Front-line practitioners report higher tariffs for women and we know that, historically, women have been more likely to be imprisoned for a first offence. The impact of imprisonment is greater for women than it is for men, because women are more at risk of losing their children and homes, and because women offenders' lives are far more chaotic, as has been frequently reported.</p><p>We know that the proportion of male offenders who have drug and addiction problems is high; the proportion is even higher for women offenders, 98 per cent of whom have such problems. It is reported that 75 per cent of female prisoners have experienced childhood abuse. The impact of such abuse, domestic violence and mental health and addiction problems is profound and is most acutely exemplified by women who enter prostitution. The underlying seam, of course, is the comparative powerlessness of women in society.</p><p>I am pleased that the committee put strong emphasis on the mental health of women offenders. I think that the issue first came to prominence in the 1990s, when there was an alarming suicide rate at Cornton Vale. The issue is not just that there are more women in prison who have what are broadly and glibly described as mental health problems&#8212;some 80 per cent of women prisoners have such problems, as opposed to 50 to 60 per cent of their male counterparts, depending on which of numerous surveys we accept. The issue is that, proportionally, twice as many women prisoners as male prisoners are experiencing severe and enduring mental illness. Severe and enduring mental illness requires concerted, co-ordinated and robust treatment in a hospital or from community care services. For the most part, women with severe mental illness pose a greater threat to themselves than they do to other people. I agree whole-heartedly with what Robert Brown said about that.</p><p>We can improve mental health services in prisons. I am glad that in time the NHS will become responsible for the health care of <place-holder colnum=\"23837\"/> incarcerated men and women. However, prison can never replicate hospital care, nor should it do so. I have some sympathy in relation to the reluctance of mainstream mental health services to take on offenders, given that they are not always best equipped to do so, but the practice of sentencing women to prison in the absence of appropriate mental health services is unacceptable. The notion that we should send women to prison for their own protection is fundamentally not right.</p><p>I spent most of my previous career in social work working with male offenders, including mentally disordered offenders. It was not uncommon to come across men who were in the wrong system&#8212;there were men in prison who should have been in hospital and vice versa. However, even I was alarmed to read the evidence of Sue Brookes, a former governor of Cornton Vale, who talked about the frequency with which</p><p class=\"indent\">\"women arrived at reception in Cornton Vale clearly not knowing who they were, let alone where they were\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee</em>, 5 May 2009; c 1005.]</p><p>That is a fundamental issue of justice. We cannot have women going through the criminal justice system who do not comprehend the court process. It sounded as though the women whom Sue Brookes described were clearly not fit to plead.</p><p>The report considered whether there is sufficient high-security provision outwith Cornton Vale to treat violent or seriously ill women. Justice cannot be done to that complex issue in this debate. I urge a degree of caution, because the number of women who require maximum-security hospital care such as was provided at the state hospital is very small. Indeed, the number is so small that, when the state hospital was redesigning its campus, the long-term plan was to close Alexandra ward, which was the women's ward. Some time before becoming an MSP, I had the privilege of working on that ward. It is worth noting that most of the women in it had a significant and profound learning disability and could have been cared for elsewhere if the facilities had existed. The development of medium-secure forensic services is welcome, but how those services currently meet the needs of women is questionable.

As many members do, I have an interest in both flood prevention and flood rescue, primarily due to the devastation that was caused by extreme flooding in my constituency in August 2008, so I am pleased that in his motion and opening speech the minister stated quite clearly that the Government accepts the need to act on the recommendations of Scotland's water rescue review.</p><p>The review makes some eminently sensible and pragmatic suggestions that will, if fully implemented, improve responses for people who need to be rescued in the future. The recommendations also provide the building blocks for a more co-ordinated multidisciplinary service in which all the players are clear about their roles and duties, and in which it is clear who does what and, crucially, who is in charge.<place-holder colnum=\"23045\"/></p><p>I am all too aware of the fire and rescue services' crucial role in rescuing constituents of mine who were trapped and in severe danger as a result of the severe flooding in Broxburn. The review estimates that each year throughout Scotland the services attend about 200 water incidents, resulting in five public fatalities, 16 public casualties and 30 public rescues.</p><p>Fire and rescue services have developed flood rescue capability, firefighters are among the most expert in this area and the services already have a statutory duty to rescue persons who are trapped by severe flooding, so it is entirely appropriate that they should lead in the execution of flood rescue. That expert role complements the more strategic role and function of the police, who in such incidents co-ordinate other agencies and resources.</p><p>A recommendation that, for me, sprang out of the report and which has not been missed by other members, is the need to compile a comprehensive list of rescue assets across all sectors. I do not want to be flippant about boys and their toys, but we need to know how many toys are in the cupboard and what they are. After all, in a small country such as Scotland, we have to learn to share in the interests of those who need to be rescued and, indeed, the taxpayer.</p><p>As James Kelly was, I was interested to note the suggestion that instead of public bodies purchasing hugely expensive equipment to deal with extreme situations, only for it to remain underutilised for most of the year, it might be appropriate to have contracts with the private sector. The caveat is that such equipment must be accessible quickly, easily, unconditionally and at a fair price&#8212;we cannot have public services being held to ransom. As always, of course, the devil will be in the detail.</p><p>Having heard the testimonies and accounts of elderly constituents who were rescued, I was pleased to read in the review that the Scottish Ambulance Service&#8212;for which I have enormous respect&#8212;is developing a water incident support capability. We cannot understate the dangers of, and trauma that is caused by, flooding. Often, paramedics provide the initial post-rescue assessment, care and treatment. We certainly must not dismiss or diminish the experience of those who have been rescued from severe flooding by concluding that they are just a little wet and cold. Some constituents of mine who were affected were elderly, were vulnerable or had pre-existing medical conditions. They rightly feared for their lives as they saw their homes and a lifetime of possessions being destroyed. As we know, flooding also brings with it contamination, the spread of pollutants and all the health risks associated with such things. The Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"23046\"/> Ambulance Service must be commended for attempting to develop the service and for seeking to improve medical care not only for people who are being rescued but for the other emergency responders who face the challenging and hazardous conditions that are caused by severe flooding.</p><p>I welcome the fact that Paddy Tomkins's review acknowledges the voluntary sector's role in flood rescue. After all, its resources range from the highly trained RNLI to more local organisations that rally round in response to events.</p><p>The right balance has been struck between the appreciation that local needs are best met with local plans and informed by local knowledge. We must also remember that local canoeists, anglers and suchlike can provide invaluable support in prolonged search and rescue operations. Nonetheless, the review was quite right to state that the collation of local plans must also amount to a coherent national strategy.</p><p>Like John Farquhar Munro, I think that there is a need to emphasise on-going public education and personal responsibility for water safety. Members will no doubt have seen the news a week or so ago, when it was revealed that a driver drove his car down the frozen Union canal in West Lothian&#8212;an act so stupid that it renders me almost speechless. I am pleased to note that that matter of extreme irresponsibility is being dealt with through the courts, as is entirely appropriate, given the potential risks that it presented to those who responded to it, particularly the emergency staff.</p><p>I am pleased to participate in the debate.

It is a devastating blow for the workforce and for the local economy in West Lothian.</p><p>When I was growing up in West Lothian, in the early 1980s, male unemployment in the area was one in four. Indeed, my father was one of those statistics. I therefore take seriously any job losses in my constituency.</p><p>I thank members across the political spectrum for supporting the motion that is before us tonight. Members will be aware that the first 45 of the 500 planned redundancies took place during the holiday period. Losing one's job is hard at any time of the year is hard, but it is harder still at Christmas.</p><p>While there is stoicism among the workforce, there is also immense dignity and pride. The decision to transfer production from the site in Livingston to Waterford in Ireland represents an injustice to a committed and highly productive workforce, given Bausch &amp; Lomb's success in Livingston. Bausch &amp; Lomb acquired the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"22462\"/> contact lens manufacturer Award in 1996, and based its operations in Livingston, which remains highly productive and efficient. The SofLens product meets the high quality standards for the Japanese market, and only 20 contact lenses in a million are lost. Livingston is a lean operation&#8212;local management certainly do not jet about in first class.</p><p>Bausch &amp; Lomb was highly regarded, and was supportive of other local businesses and the wider West Lothian community. However, despite its reputation, success, efficiency and prudence, the Livingston site still lost out to Ireland, and we must ask ourselves why. Bausch &amp; Lomb is owned by Warburg Pincus LLC, a New York private equity company, which, in response to the current economic downturn, crunched some numbers and decided that it needed to reduce its manufacturing sites from three to two. There is not much that we can do about that&#8212;until we scratch the surface and look a little closer.</p><p>Bausch &amp; Lomb was never going to close its corporate headquarters in Rochdale in New York, which is the mother ship, with a large research and development base. It was therefore a choice between Livingston in Scotland and Waterford in Ireland. The significant factors in Ireland's favour include lower corporation tax and the ability to access Government grants. In contrast, West Lothian lost its assisted area status in 2006. It also costs more to make workers redundant in Ireland.</p><p>When will we truly learn the lessons of the importance of corporate HQs, investing in R and D and considering how best to compete with the world? When will we learn that, to protect Scottish jobs, we need a Parliament with the economic and taxation powers to do so?</p><p>The 90-day statutory consultation period has expired, and Bausch &amp; Lomb, Unite and staff representatives have agreed on an enhanced redundancy package. A range of training programmes has been made available, and a job shop and advisory centre has been set up on site, supported by partnership action for continuing employment. The first phase of transfer of production will commence this month and the process will continue into 2011. However, I believe that where there is life, there is hope, and I urge the Scottish Government and Bausch &amp; Lomb to leave no stone unturned to see whether some remnant of the business can remain in Scotland. After all, acorns grow into oak trees.</p><p>If we cannot save jobs, we have to find sustainable ways to create them. I will therefore focus on the opportunities that are afforded by the clawback of the regional selective assistance grant of &#163;1.1 million. I am already on record as advocating that that money should be utilised to create jobs in West Lothian. Indeed, there is <place-holder colnum=\"22463\"/> precedent, as that is exactly what happened when Motorola left the area.</p><p>I remind the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth that West Lothian has the highest unemployment in a generation, above both the Scottish and United Kingdom averages. Youth unemployment is in excess of 8 per cent, and we have one of the largest more choices, more chances cohorts in Scotland.</p><p>I began my speech by reflecting on the West Lothian in which I grew up, and I will end by reflecting on the determination that there is to succeed in West Lothian. There is an economic partnership between the local council, college and chamber of commerce, all of which contain people with experience, commitment and the will to drive us through these difficult times.</p><p>To me, West Lothian is like Scotland: it is small and beautiful in parts and has so much to be proud of. However, like Scotland, it could do so much better. I hope that the cabinet secretary can help us to achieve that better future and give serious consideration to the use of the RSA clawback.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20473773", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Decision Time: Bausch &amp; Lomb (Livingston)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am proud and privileged to represent the constituency in which I was born, and I regret deeply the decision that has been taken by Bausch &amp; Lomb to push ahead with the closure of its award-winning manufacturing site in Livingston.

It states in its briefing that much has been achieved but that there is still a job of work to do.</p><p>When it comes to Scotland's children, there is never room for complacency. The GIRFEC pathfinders give a significant early indication of better outcomes for children. As Margaret Smith has acknowledged, the number of children on the child protection register has fallen; reports are being submitted on time; children are seeing their supervising officers within target times; and the length of wait for adoptive and permanent placements has fallen.</p><p>The HMIE report is very much welcome, as it has provided us with the clearest and most comprehensive picture of how child protection services throughout Scotland are performing. It is based solely on the first reports, as opposed to any of the follow-up reports, in which sense it is slightly behind the times. Nonetheless, it has established a baseline from which to test progress.</p><p>I noted with interest how the 30 councils had performed across the 18 quality indicators&#8212;graded from excellent to unmet&#8212;which gave a total of 540 possible grades. There were only 12 grades of excellent and, at the other extreme, 13 of unmet. The bulk of the grades&#8212;438&#8212;were very good, good or satisfactory, straddling the middle of the range. That is a good start, but we should be aiming for excellence. We should aspire for good, very good and excellent because, to be blunt, even satisfactory is not good enough. It would not be good enough for my son if he were ever in need of care and protection. Why should we not aspire to and achieve the best child protection system in the world? The question remains: how do we do that? We talk about outcomes, but what we actually mean is how we can keep more <place-holder colnum=\"21903\"/> children safe and how we can improve their prospects.</p><p>I recall the findings of the report \"For Scotland's children\", which said that the children who were most in need of services were those who were least likely to receive them. Although there are issues around difficult-to-engage families, there are also issues around difficult-to-access services. One of the positives to come out of the GIRFEC pathfinder pilots is the fact that the families have reported benefiting from and appreciating the support and care that has been provided through a one-team approach. Of course, we need to look through the eyes of a child to shape the services, but there is no getting away from the fact that, as adults, we must take the responsibility to do what is in the best interest of each child who is at risk.</p><p>The importance of universal and core services should never be underestimated. Public pressure and media scrutiny can result in politicians grabbing for the new trend, fad or initiative despite the fact that, in times of crisis, it is more important than ever to invest in and replenish bread-and-butter services. I cannot think of Baby P and others like him without getting angry. His injuries should have been obvious because they were so appalling and were sustained over time. It is correct and proper to focus on the high-profile, extreme cases to learn lessons, but the danger is that professionals and services can focus so much on the extreme cases that they neglect or miss the more numerous situations in which the symptoms and signs of abuse are far less obvious&#8212;more subtle but just as damaging. Our focus must be on prevention as well as on investigation.</p><p>It should not surprise us that risk assessment is the area that we need to improve the most. Risk assessment is complex: it requires skills, knowledge, experience, instinct and good old-fashioned common sense. It is mutlifactorial, interdependent with and underpinned by the achievement of other quality indicators, the obvious one being the timely sharing of information. To date GIRFEC has built the foundations for such assessment and, when fully implemented, it should deliver consistent assessment across professional and local authority boundaries and provide a shared language and understanding of risk.</p><p>Yesterday, we debated violence against women and many of us commented that gender-based violence is a cause and consequence of women's inequality. We described it as a human rights violation. I agree 100 per cent with Children 1<sup>st</sup> that there should be zero tolerance of violence against children in all its forms. Similar to the work on domestic violence and abuse, we need to challenge some of our cultural values and assumptions about children. Children need the <place-holder colnum=\"21904\"/> safety and security of boundaries, consistency and routine. I have never subscribed to the view that children should be seen and not heard&#8212;many members who have met my two-year-old will say, \"Just as well\".

As has been said, <place-holder colnum=\"21748\"/> violence against women is both the cause and consequence of women's inequality, linked to disparities in employment, health, wellbeing and participation in public life. It is continuously related to poor mental health and substance misuse. Crucially, it disables women from being everything that they are and want to be. We should not and must not underestimate the social and economic costs of gender-based violence, as well as the harm that is caused to individuals and their families; Marlyn Glen referred to that. In essence, violence against women continues to be a human rights violation.</p><p>The motion rightly celebrates the work that is being undertaken in communities the length and breadth of Scotland, supported by the Government. I will, therefore, touch on the cutting-edge work that is being done to create sustainable services for women survivors and their children in West Lothian. Resources and skills are shared across a strategic partnership involving social work, police, health, education, criminal justice, housing and women's aid. West Lothian is one of the local authorities that include the issue of violence against women in their single outcome agreements. Crucially, there is an acknowledgement that survivors are diverse and not a homogeneous group and that there are multiple forms of abuse and deprivation. Therefore, services across various disciplines, while encouraging disclosure, must provide a supportive and single point of contact for multiple services. Substance misuse services in West Lothian now screen all women's service users to establish whether there is a need to refer them to violence against women services. Locally, there will be moves towards implementing routine inquiries of abuse across key priority settings such as mental health, accident and emergency, primary care, sexual and reproductive health and maternity services. The practice of just asking the question struck a chord with me.</p><p>Given the focus that there is now on the impact of domestic violence on children and young people, I thought that colleagues might be interested to know about the excellent preventive educational programme that is being delivered in all West Lothian secondary schools and the West Lothian domestic abuse children's screening group, which, in 2008-09, received a staggering 2,000 referrals of children who had been exposed to the physical and psychological dangers of domestic abuse and violence. For me, that is a stark reminder of the pervasiveness of violence against women and children. It is well known that one in four women will experience gender-based violence at some time in their life.

I appreciate the work that has been done by Deafblind Scotland on the issue and its success in encouraging so many of my constituents to correspond with me.</p><p>As we have heard, there are at most 5,000 deafblind people in Scotland&#8212;a small but not insignificant group of people who have a unique and profound disability. It should therefore not be beyond our wit or our finances to make what would amount to a small change in transport policy. As my constituent, Mr Laird, from Stoneyburn, said to me, small changes can have a big impact. Mr Laird got to the heart of the issue when he wrote in a letter to me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Even the very brave, able, deafblind person rarely travels alone. In most cases their companion is a skilled guide/communicator who acts as the deafblind person's eyes and ears.\"</p><p>Despite the necessity for deafblind people to travel with a skilled companion, the companion is eligible only for some discount and only in some local authority areas. The situation becomes very complex because, in some areas, the discretionary local authority rail travel concession is available only within the local authority's boundaries. Of course, the whole point of rail travel is to enable us to tackle longer journeys comfortably and in a more reasonable timescale, and to access more direct routes. It is also often necessary and desirable for deafblind people to use rail transport as opposed to other forms of transport.</p><p>I am pleased that concessionary rail travel for deafblind people's companions is available in West Lothian and, I note, also in Falkirk and Edinburgh. I wonder whether those authorities, which share boundaries, could extend their schemes into one another's areas, or whether they currently do so. That might be an important question to ask.</p><p>The crux of the issue and the motion is the principle that deafblind people's companions are valuable and essential and should be able to travel for free by rail and by bus. I am told&#8212;and I am sure that my constituents will correct me if the information is wrong&#8212;that it costs &#163;1 for a companion to travel on the train from West Lothian <place-holder colnum=\"21463\"/> to Edinburgh, but if that person wants to travel from West Lothian to Glasgow, they have to pay half the full fare. In my constituency, there have been big improvements in the Bathgate to Airdrie line, which offer enormous opportunities to people across West Lothian, and it would be a missed opportunity if deafblind people could not also receive the maximum benefit of those improvements.</p><p>The national concessionary travel scheme is one of Parliament's successes, partly because of its universal eligibility for older people. However, although I support the universal aspect of the current scheme for older people, I regret that some people are excluded. The minister knows my views about the exclusion of people with learning disabilities who are on the lower rates of the disability living allowance, and I have the same view about the exclusion of disabled people's companions. It is fantastic that someone who is over 65, irrespective of their health and financial position, can travel anywhere in Scotland for free, but surely the same principle should apply to all Scotland's disabled people and their companions whether they are travelling by bus or by rail.</p><p>I note that deafblind people are not specifically defined in the Transport (Scotland) Act 2005, and I wonder whether the minister would consider the benefits of changing that.</p><p>The Scottish Government has conducted a major review of concessionary travel, the report of which was published in May. Although the review considered the need for additional companions on buses and whether to extend the scheme wholesale to rail, it did not specifically consider extending the funding to cover companions on rail for blind or deafblind people. As some months have passed since the publication of the review, I wonder what the minister's current thoughts are and whether he will consider addressing that issue.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20389856", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Deafblind Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I am grateful to Margaret Mitchell for securing the debate.

That is reflected in the &#163;45 million that is allocated to the further education sector in the <place-holder colnum=\"20250\"/> draft budget, which represents a welcome 6.9 per cent increase in these turbulent economic times.</p><p>West Lothian College, in my constituency, is committed to working with the Government on its sustainable economic growth agenda. The scale of enrolments in Scotland's colleges is staggering&#8212;the best part of 500,000 students were enrolled in 2007-08&#8212;and colleges such as West Lothian College have the capacity and willingness to deliver even more for their communities. Unemployment is at its highest since 1996 and West Lothian has one of the highest levels of unemployment among school leavers and the more choices, more chances group. I have written to the cabinet secretary on the matter. I welcome the additional 270 places under the get ready for work programme.</p><p>The cabinet secretary said that she met apprentices at West Lothian College this morning, so I have no doubt that she has a good understanding of the desire in West Lothian to do more. The recent announcement by Bausch &amp; Lomb that it will shed 500 jobs in Livingston is a salutary reminder that global factors can have a devastating impact on a local economy. The announcement also underlines the importance of colleges in rebuilding local economies.</p><p>Scottish colleges have successfully used additional funds to maximise training places, many of which are targeted at young people who need more choices and chances. At West Lothian College, 60 per cent of students are under 19 years old, and throughout the college sector in Scotland 24 per cent of students come from the most deprived areas.</p><p>A success of the sector is its strong links with employers. Some 76 per cent of employers who have taken a college graduate have said that their new recruit was well prepared for work. In my area, the development of school-college partnerships has brought many benefits for secondary 3 to S6 pupils, who have the option to study for national qualifications in a college environment.</p><p>It is clear that student support funds are under strain, despite the Government's action to increase hardship funds by &#163;1 million a year and despite investment of &#163;9.5 million this year. West Lothian College reported to me that its bursary funds ran out early this year. The college's principal also told me that some regulations of the Department for Work and Pensions disadvantage students, who lose direct and related benefits when they come to college. Like Margaret Smith, I might well write to the cabinet secretary on the issue, which needs to be addressed.</p><p>Like other members, I have received correspondence from people who are calling for a <place-holder colnum=\"20251\"/> statutory right to child care for parents who attend college. I will pay close attention to the proposed Government review of child care support for students. Child care is crucial and I am glad that I attended college many years before my son arrived.</p><p>There is much success to celebrate in the college sector. Good or very good results were recorded in 99 per cent of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education college reviews from 2004 to 2008, so we can be reassured that our colleges deliver good value for money and a high quality of education.

Many firefighters in my constituency knew and worked with Ewan. I also take the liberty of drawing to members' attention the motion that has been lodged by my colleague, Shirley-Anne Somerville, which supports the call for Ewan Williamson to be posthumously awarded the Queen's gallantry medal. I urge members to consider giving their support to the motion.</p><p>The FBU briefing contains the salutary statistic that in the 27 years from 1979 to 2006, only two firefighters lost their lives in the line of duty yet, in <place-holder colnum=\"19456\"/> the relatively short period between 2007 and 2009, the figure was four firefighters. As other members have done, I thank the FBU for the briefings that it has distributed, which&#8212;as is its style&#8212;are both informative and straight to the point, rarely missing a target. I have been impressed not only by the FBU's steadfast focus on representing the interests of its members, but by its commitment to making our communities safer. It disappoints me, therefore, that some of our fire and rescue authorities are not as inclusive as they could be in their decision-making processes. They could do far more to listen to and consult the FBU, which would be in the interests of all stakeholders, not the least of which are our communities.</p><p>I listened with great interest to the minister's comments when he advised us that the Government intends to review the integrated risk management planning process. I am told that the IRMP process is meant to enable fire and rescue authorities to identify risks in their areas and put in place the resources to address those risks. That sounds grand in theory, but the reality in my constituency has been very different, where the IRMP process has been used to identify the euphemistically entitled \"efficiency savings\"&#8212;more commonly known as \"cuts\". There has been a downgrading of services at the Craighill station in Livingston, despite the fact that the new town has a growing population and a growing number of residential homes, businesses and nursing homes, as well as a hospital at the heart of the town and a nearby motorway. The IRMP process was used to justify the cut, but I fear that the reality was that a political decision was made. The minister is well aware of my views on joint fire and rescue boards, which disadvantage smaller areas such as West Lothian in relation to their larger neighbours.</p><p>There has also been inconsistency in how the IRMP process has been developed, and the differing approaches to the process have contributed to divergences in response standards, although I note that national incident response standards were abolished in 2005, as members have previously stated. Like other members, I have considerable sympathy for the idea of common or national incident response times, given the concerns that exist about postcode-determined fire services. Given that the Scottish Ambulance Service can work to national response times of 13 and eight minutes, it seems odd that response times for fires in identical buildings differ in Scotland's cities because of local determinations of resource application.</p><p>My last grumble&#8212;in the current debate, at least&#8212;relates to training. I note the minister's comments about unnecessary duplication in training and information technology. This is where I will sound like a broken record, but I make no apology for that. The minister is well aware of my <place-holder colnum=\"19457\"/> objections to the proposal by the Lothian and Borders fire and rescue board to build a new multimillion-pound training centre at Newbridge while it cuts front-line services in my constituency. I believe that that would be a fickle use of public money, given the proximity of Lothian and the Borders to the national training centre in Gullane.</p><p>I will end on a positive note. The facts that the minister has announced his intentions regarding the pensions commutation problem and that he has previously ended speculation in relation to control rooms are to be celebrated. I also record my appreciation for the firefighters in my constituency&#8212;in particular, the retained firefighters in Broxburn, who had to deal with the severe flooding that occurred in the community last year.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire and Rescue Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I associate myself with the minister's tribute to Ewan Williamson.

Before Mr MacAskill made his decision, <em>The Sunday Times </em>published a poll that found that 11 per cent of respondents supported compassionate release. However, since the decision, further polls have shown that 32 per cent and 40 per cent support compassionate release and, of course, there is the poll that shows that 56 per cent of Scots do not think that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice should quit. That reflects my experience of a growing understanding among people on the street of why the justice secretary released Mr al-Megrahi home to die.</p><p>The television images of saltires being flown in Libya turned many folk against compassionate release. Conversely, the interjections by the United States increased support for the justice secretary. I have also found that there is an informed understanding and critique of UK and US foreign policy as a result of the aftermath of the war in Iraq and the mass opposition to that war. It has not escaped the notice of many that Hillary Clinton recently welcomed a member of the Gaddafi family&#8212;the national security adviser for Libya&#8212;to Washington saying that she valued the relationship between the US and Libya and the opportunities to broaden and deepen that relationship. The duplicity of doing one thing and saying another is not lost on the general public.</p><p>Although we all must accept that we exist in a global geopolitical environment&#8212;that is the point that Margo MacDonald has been making&#8212;the justice secretary took his decision purely on the law and policy on compassionate release. The decision to send Mr al-Megrahi home to die was taken by the book. The procedures were followed, Mr MacAskill received advice and he considered it <place-holder colnum=\"19074\"/> accordingly.

Working with people and families is complex; it requires fine judgments that are based on the most robust information available at the time. The good work is often overshadowed by the headlines when things go wrong. Work with people is never risk free. Nonetheless, as a profession, we are not flawless and must be accountable for the decisions that we make. The quid pro quo is that politicians must be accountable for resourcing, policy and legislation.</p><p>I was proud to be a social worker. Like Trish Godman, I am a former mental health officer and have speculated with her&#8212;privately, of course&#8212;about who in the Parliament may be liable to detention. There were times in my career when I advocated vigorously for the rights of prisoners or detained patients to receive appropriate, humane care and treatment. However, there were equally times when I pursued a course of action that infringed on the liberty, privacy and rights of my clients. That, of course, was unpopular with clients and, at times, with other professionals, whether in the Scottish Prison Service or the health service, but social workers&#8212;like politicians&#8212;have to make unpopular and hard decisions. I was always <place-holder colnum=\"18830\"/> fortunate enough to have some very good and supportive managers. I make a special mention of Mr Ed Finlayson, who is currently the team manager at the state hospital at Carstairs. He had a lot to put with in managing me.</p><p>There were many highs and lows in my career and a low point that I will never forget was the first time that I had to make an application to detain a young mother under mental health legislation.

One is that a young offender whom I supervised on a probation order used to say to me in all earnestness that he would rather have spent six months in Saughton than see me every week.

I hope that, when people criticise social workers, they remember the serious workload and resource issues. However, I was somewhat heartened last night when I attended a school awards ceremony for a primary 7 class and, among all the boys who wanted to be footballers and jet pilots and the surprising number of girls who wanted to be beauticians and hairdressers, there was one pupil who wanted to be a social worker and another who wanted to be a social care worker.

The fact that it took so long to end slopping out was detrimental not only to our justice system but to public confidence in the system, as it created a situation in which people could make claims under human rights legislation.</p><p>The SPS's original target was to end slopping out by 1999, but a review in 2002 of the prison estate and plans to build two new prisons pushed the date back to 2008 at the earliest. In 2004, the <place-holder colnum=\"18530\"/> Napier case established that slopping out was indeed a breach of human rights. In 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland, should it really have taken human rights legislation to end a Victorian practice? In that respect, we&#8212;and I mean that collectively&#8212;made a rod for our own backs to the detriment of taxpayers. The reticence of and feet dragging by politicians and the SPS showed what happens when we frame justice debates in terms of hard or soft measures instead of focusing on what is proportionate, what is right, what is just and what actually works. I hope that we can all learn this salutary lesson for future debates on the criminal justice system.</p><p>I have no doubt that, in overturning the Court of Session judgment on the Somerville case, the law lords were very erudite in the legal points on which they based their decision. What I did not understand was Jack Straw's reticence and the view that he expressed in December 2008 that he was not persuaded of the case for changing the law. As the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has made clear, it was wholly unjust and unacceptable for the Scottish ministers to be the only public authority in Scotland&#8212;and, indeed, in almost the whole of the UK&#8212;to be exposed to claims for damages under human rights legislation outwith the one-year time bar.</p><p>I am glad that the situation has been resolved and that, as a result of the bill, savings will be made to the public purse. Many people were alarmed to hear that the SPS had to set aside &#163;67 million to deal with just over 1,200 outstanding cases and that it expected to deal with 200 new cases a month. I look forward to hearing how the cabinet secretary plans to put the savings to good use. For the record, I hope that some consideration is given to making extra funding available for community sentencing. Although I have never subscribed to the view that money alone can solve all the ills and difficulties faced by criminal justice social work departments and those who are tasked with supervising offenders, I think that, in introducing enhanced community payback orders and ending unconditional automatic early release, we have an opportunity to invest further in innovative and imaginative practices that will enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "17369268", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Convention Rights Proceedings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although the crux of the bill is to ensure that the one-year time bar applies to human rights claims brought under the Scotland Act 1998, and although&#8212;notwithstanding issues about chemical sanitation&#8212;slopping out has become a thing of the past, I will for the record state my objections to the practice, as it forms an important backdrop to the bill.

As statutory aggravations already exist for other forms of hate crime, it is incumbent on us to level the playing field for other excluded groups.</p><p>At this point, I thank Leonard Cheshire Disability for its particularly illuminating briefing. There are 800,000 disabled people in Scotland, 59 per cent of whom are women&#8212;I am advised that that is because we live longer than our male counterparts. However, as every study makes clear, a disabled person is five to 10 times more likely to experience hate crime as a non-disabled person. We have already heard the statistics that <place-holder colnum=\"18118\"/> show that those with mental health issues are 11 times more likely to be victimised and that 90 per cent of people with a learning disability report experiences of being bullied. What is absolutely clear is the persistent and repetitive nature of the offences against and harassment of disabled people.</p><p>In the past, there has been some confusion about what has been considered, treated and responded to as antisocial behaviour when offences should have been prosecuted as hate crimes. It is interesting to note that the perpetrators of hate crimes against disabled people are often strangers. They often participate in groups and the crimes are often committed in public places, although there is some differentiation between rural and urban areas. In rural areas, the crime against the disabled person is more likely to occur in a domestic setting. Like Michael McMahon, I think that we need to be alarmed and concerned at the number of disabled people who accept harassment as part and parcel of their impairment. Leonard Cheshire Disability eloquently talks about the need to prevent attacks on disabled people by shining a light into a dark corner of our society. By passing the bill, we will ensure that hate crime will not be shielded from the public view.</p><p>There is some information on the prevalence of the attacks on and the offences that are committed against disabled people, but I believe that it only scratches the surface.

The latest figures, from 2005, show that 10,000 babies were born throughout the UK as a result of IVF in that year, of whom 942 were born in Scotland. Of course, all children are special and all parents boast, but I have no doubt that the mothers of IVF babies have more bragging rights, because their miracle babies are a triumph not only of medical science, but of faith.</p><p>I have always believed that being a parent is a privilege and not a right, but everyone should have the same right to treatment. Equity of access is a founding principle of our national health service. I am therefore interested to hear from the minister what progress has been and will be made to ensure universal implementation of the recommendations of the expert advisory group on infertility services. As Mrs Eadie said, variations in the upper maternal age limit and in definitions of a treatment cycle are unacceptable. We know that, for clinical reasons, unexplained infertility will not be diagnosed until three years have elapsed. A woman living in the Lothians will then have an additional three-year wait for treatment. For a woman in her 30s, six years is far too long to wait.</p><p>If someone has unexplained infertility and is in their 20s, there is a 50:50 chance that treatment will be a success. If they are in their early to mid-30s, that reduces to one in three. If they are in their mid to late 30s, it reduces further, to one in four, and for those over 40, it reduces to one in 10. Speedy treatment is therefore imperative. I know of no couple who go into treatment blind to those statistics. To put oneself through treatment is to let the genie of hope out of the bottle when, for many people, there will be no baby at the end of the rainbow&#8212;only disappointment and despair. For that reason, I commend Infertility Network UK on the work that it does not only in assisting couples in accessing treatment but in supporting them to live with its consequences, good and bad. I hope that the minister can advise us what support is currently available to such organisations.</p><p>The funding and availability of fertility treatment&#8212;like all health services&#8212;invariably rightly becomes wrapped up in political issues of choice and priority, but it should not become a political football. As a back bencher, I want to do all that I can to push fertility treatment up the list of political priorities, but I have the luxury of not <place-holder colnum=\"18053\"/> having to make the hard decisions for which the minister must account. However, for those who have had to work harder than most at conception and have eventually been blessed with the safe arrival of a real wee person who looks so unique but so familiar, we know how lucky we are. As Mrs Eadie stated, it costs approximately &#163;4,000 per cycle of treatment, but our children are priceless.

Evidence was presented to the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee that waste could increase by 13,700 tonnes per annum. The Irish experience has demonstrated clearly the unintended consequences of replacing plastic bags with so-called environmentally friendly bags for life, which has resulted in an increase in food packaging for loose items for health and hygiene reasons.

Worldwide, a woman dies in pregnancy and childbirth every minute. Over half a million women die due to complications and 10 million women suffer debilitating illness and lifelong disabilities. Those are truly shocking statistics.</p><p>There is a huge disparity in maternal health between rich and poor countries and within rich and poor countries depending on whether one is in a rural or an urban area and whether one has had access to education. A woman's lifetime risk of dying in childbirth in the developing world is one in 76 and in countries such as Niger it is as high as one in seven, but in the industrialised world it is one in 7,000.</p><p>As we heard, mothers play a vital role in the economic health of their families and motherless children are trapped in a cycle of poverty. Worldwide, 2 million children are orphans due to their mothers dying in childbirth. Despite the progress, the number of deaths of children under five remains unacceptably high although it has dipped below 10 million&#8212;an annual death rate that is truly appalling, particularly when it is from preventable diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and measles.</p><p>The situation in Scotland is very different. Nonetheless we are not without our challenges. While neonatal and postnatal deaths have decreased over the past 30 years, the rate of stillbirth remains static.

Prompted by Dr Simpson's motion, I found out more about telehealth developments in West Lothian and beyond, and I was pleasantly surprised. However, I agree whole-heartedly with Liam McArthur that telehealth is about the quality of care, and enhancing the patient's experience and access to medical care. It is certainly not a Trojan horse for the centralisation of health services.</p><p>During my investigation I found out that NHS Lothian, with West Lothian community health and care partnership, has been developing telehealth capacity by working with GPs and identifying health clinicians who would be willing to contribute. I am told that that &#163;700,000 project is one of the biggest telehealth projects in Europe. It focuses on the use of telemetry in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and stroke; smaller projects are examining childhood obesity and congestive cardiac failure. An innovation of particular interest is the exploration by West Lothian CHCP and NHS Lothian of the use of technology in mental health and palliative care. I will certainly look at that work closely as it develops.</p><p>Thirty patients in West Lothian have telehealth equipment in their homes. The pilot work throughout the Lothians has shown that the technology is extremely popular with patients, in terms of improving their self-confidence, reassuring carers and improving access to care.</p><p>One patient who was involved in the pilot said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I've never felt so well looked after in my life.

The aim is to reduce hospital days by 3,000.</p><p>I was delighted to note that in February this year an investment of &#163;1.6 million was announced for e-health, and that more than &#163;0.5 million of that money had come from private partners&#8212;including a company called Atos Origin, which is in my constituency and to which I pay tribute.</p><p>Before Christmas, I spent a Saturday night with the Scottish Ambulance Service in Livingstone, to see at first hand some of the technology&#8212;which Dr Simpson mentioned&#8212;that is used in responding to the needs of patients with chest pain and suspected heart attacks.

I firmly believe that the record investment in affordable housing by the SNP Government of &#163;1.5 billion over three years will ensure that more houses are built the length and breadth of Scotland. Combined with the ending of the right to buy, that will put the plug back in the bath, ensuring that the new water&#8212;the new resources&#8212;are not allowed to drain away or be wasted.</p><p>I listened with interest to Mary Mulligan's comments. Like me, Mrs Mulligan represents a West Lothian constituency. She described herself as a positive person, but I am sure that she will forgive me if I beg to differ on that. Given the new house-building programme in West Lothian, I would have thought that there would be more cheer in Mrs Mulligan's speech. Because of the actions of the SNP Government, West Lothian Council will build 700 council houses over the next four years&#8212;other local authorities will be able to do likewise. That work started last winter and the first homes are now complete. Out of those 700 houses, 458 will be in Mrs Mulligan's constituency whereas only 242 will be in my constituency. So Mrs Mulligan has 458 reasons to be cheerful in comparison with my 242.</p><p>The record of the SNP Administration and local SNP administrations compares very well with what went before. Over a 12-year period from 1995 to 2007, West Lothian Council, under Labour, built 280 houses through a housing partnership; we aspire to build 700. In a third of the time, the combined efforts of SNP members, both local and national, will result in more than double the number of new houses becoming available.</p><p>I listened with great interest to the remarks that were made on the subsidy that has been made available to Midlothian Council and how it, unlike other councils, will receive only &#163;10,000 per unit. I say to Mrs Mulligan that there is nothing underhand about that. Like Midlothian Council, West Lothian Council will receive a subsidy per unit of &#163;10,000, and it is apparent that the larger house-building projects will receive a smaller unit-price subsidy. I also remind her that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities had a pivotal role in the distribution of those funds.</p><p>I am sure that members will welcome both the announcement during the recess by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing that she will double the money that is available to local authorities to build new homes from &#163;25 million to &#163;50 million, and the &#163;100 million that the Scottish Government has made available to registered social landlords with a view to securing additional <place-holder colnum=\"16850\"/> investment in houses. In my constituency and Mrs Mulligan's constituency, registered social landlords have purchased a number of completed units.</p><p>During the 10 years that I was an elected member of West Lothian Council, housing was one area in which there was a degree of political consensus between SNP and Labour councillors. I feel it is highly important for me to remind Labour parliamentarians about the genuine shared angst and anger at the ever-growing waiting lists and rising homeless presentations. With the shrinking housing stock, people were forced to go down the homeless route as opposed to biding their time on a waiting list, and the consequences for housing services, children and community cohesiveness were stark.</p><p>The second area that had cross-party unanimity was ending the right to buy. The shrinking stock eventually resulted in council houses becoming the houses of last resort because to get a council house someone had to have huge social needs to gather enough points to meet the demand. That is a very sad reality for our communities, which rely on a much more balanced and cohesive social mix.</p><p>The third issue that we always agreed on locally in West Lothian was the need for Westminster to write off the housing debt. I am pleased to say to Labour locally and nationally that we, the SNP, have stepped up to the plate on ending the right to buy, which will, as the minister highlighted, save between 10,000 and 18,000 homes. Will Labour members get Westminster Government to step up to the plate and write off the housing debt?</p><p>Less of an issue for an authority such as West Lothian Council but certainly in the Scottish national interest is that the social and economic arguments for bailing out banks in the current economic climate have the same resonance for housing.

Recently, the community there was once again touched and hurt by a serious offence against a young man. Although I do not want to confuse criminal behaviour with antisocial behaviour, the backdrop to the difficulties was a lot of gang-related antisocial behaviour. The community faced the type of difficulties that can either make or break a community. However, people contacted their councillor Peter Johnston and said, \"Enough is enough. We want to reclaim our community.\" That chimes with much of what is in the antisocial behaviour framework. The community demanded and successfully negotiated a package of measures, including an increased police presence and a commitment to provide a facility for older children to hang out in, for want of a better expression. Leisure activities are provided free to young people on Friday afternoons, when they leave school after lunch time and there are facilities such as a drop-in cafe on a Friday afternoon at which young people are fed and can socialise before they, dare I say it, go out binge drinking at the weekend. Although that might sound like happy-clappy social work psychobabble, it is what communities want and, at the end of the day, it works. The community has successfully negotiated services and a package of measures for all their children and young people.<place-holder colnum=\"16541\"/></p><p>I have lost count of the number of times over the years that I have heard parents and concerned members of the community lament the fact that all our energy is often targeted only at those who misbehave or offend and that resources and services are often provided only for those who are in difficulty. The cry has been, \"What about the children who don't misbehave? What about the children and young people who are not causing difficulties?\" The complaint is that those children are overlooked.</p><p>The antisocial behaviour framework is absolutely right in not just punishing bad behaviour but rewarding good behaviour. As well as providing disincentives to transgressors, we must provide incentives and encouragement for good behaviour. As the minister said, we must take a more balanced approach. We need the carrot as well as the stick, and we must get serious about prevention.</p><p>The research on public opinion that has underlined the strategy is interesting, although I suspect that it confirms what we already knew. Yes, people want those who blight their lives to be dealt with and punished proportionately&#8212;quite right, too, because the legislative framework remains. Of course, the SNP supported the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004. As an MSP, most weeks I am involved in making representations by phone or letter or by attending case conferences to encourage the local authority or housing associations to use the powers that they have under the act. I see the antisocial behaviour framework as a logical extension of&#8212;and logical progress on&#8212;the legislative framework that has already been put in place.</p><p>The other point to make about the research on public opinion is that it demonstrates clearly that communities want the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour to be addressed; they want long-term solutions. Our message to our communities is that we are in this for the long haul. We do our constituents a disservice when we resort to political, knee-jerk soundbites. People understand that, often, there are no quick fixes. Communities understand and know all too well what the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour are.</p><p>The issue that we, on behalf of our communities, cannot duck is the impact of alcohol abuse. Later this year, we as a Parliament will debate the proposed health bill. I know from speaking to individuals and community groups in my constituency that when it comes to addressing the nation's alcohol problem, they do not want us to duck the issue. They do not want more of the same; they are looking for bold measures. They are looking for us not to shy away from making difficult decisions. I fear that the comments about <place-holder colnum=\"16542\"/> soft-touch Scotland might come back to haunt those who made them if they duck the issue of alcohol abuse.</p><p>Finally, I will say a brief word about parenting. Like Paul Martin, I accept that parenting is the hardest and most important job and that we do not have the God-given right to be a parent. I cannot help but observe the issue of unsupervised children in the village where I live and the community that I represent. However, that is a complex issue and I suggest that to address it we need more than an antisocial behaviour framework.

For that reason, I will not speak at length about how last week's events ran the serious risk of disrupting local authorities, including my local authority of West Lothian Council, which could have had a &#163;19 million shortfall and a 40 per cent increase in council tax. However, I would heed the words of Jim Spowart, who said at the weekend that now is not the time for point scoring. It is often the leading lights in civic Scotland and in the business community who speak good old-fashioned common sense. I believe that the political parties, <place-holder colnum=\"14676\"/> Parliament and Scotland have moved forward and for the better this week.</p><p>As Keith Brown did, I welcome the growing consensus that Scotland should have a budget that makes decisions about raising income as well as about spending it, instead of what happens just now, which is a bun-fight about how we will cut the cake. Many of us will recall the unedifying comments by Tony Blair when he drew comparisons between the Scottish Parliament and English parish councils. Ironically, parish councils can borrow &#163;5 for each person in their area. Furthermore, local authorities can utilise prudential borrowing and the Northern Ireland Assembly can borrow up to &#163;2.5 billion. Instead of having such powers, we have a fixed budget that is given to us by the mother of all Parliaments&#8212;apparently, mother knows best. However, I hope that one day our adolescent Parliament will come of age.</p><p>I suppose my hope is that, when next we approach budget negotiations, we will have learned the lessons of past budget negotiations and give ourselves a reality check, in order to remember two things. First, the budget is a balancing act for all parties, but all must remember that whatever they propose must find support across the political spectrum. Secondly, a significant proportion of the &#163;30 billion-plus budget is already committed, with fixed and non-negotiable costs as well as statutory obligations.</p><p>Before negotiations in smoke-filled rooms, or even before the first handbag is drawn, we must remember that a third of the budget&#8212;in excess of &#163;10 billion&#8212;has already been eaten up by local government, and pensions liabilities for teachers and NHS staff take up the best part of &#163;3 billion. I bet that by the time we include European Union regulations for agriculture support, for roads, and for police, fire and prison services, at least half the cake has already gone. Maybe Mr Swinney will clarify how much of the budget is available for discretionary spending.</p><p>The devolution settlement ensures that no one can be bought and sold for Swinney's gold, I am&#8212;of course&#8212;sad to say. However, even a limited amount of money can go a long way if it is spent wisely. I have never believed that one political party has a monopoly on good ideas. Spending &#163;230 million on accelerated capital spending, &#163;70 million on affordable housing, and &#163;60 million on town centre regeneration supports 5,000 jobs as well as apprenticeships, and are the right things to do. Without full economic powers, however, we will never truly tackle poverty or inequality.</p><p>We are living through the worst recession in 60 years. As Joe FitzPatrick does, I welcome the comments of Liz Cameron, who was absolutely right to say that<place-holder colnum=\"14677\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"every day the budget is delayed, that's delaying contracts that could be going out to the private sector.\"</p><p>She urged</p><p class=\"indent\">\"all political parties to get around the table\"</p><p>and to concentrate on \"the bigger prize\" that could</p><p class=\"indent\">\"be won ... for the Scottish economy.\"</p><p>The loss of jobs in my constituency has focused the mind. At this time, our resolve and aspirations should be focused on the bigger picture and on, as Liz Cameron put it, the \"bigger prize\". In a Parliament of minorities, we all have an opportunity to grasp that prize. Ensuring the safe passage of our budget is the responsibility of all 129 members of the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Despite the political commentary describing last week's events as \"a crisis\", I prefer to think of it as a rite of passage, the growing pains of a young Parliament or perhaps the birth pangs of a better nation. The past week has been a defining moment for the Scottish Government and Parliament. Across the political divide, there has been a shift in thinking and in how we do business. Minority government does work, and Scotland has changed forever and for the better.

I appreciate that local authorities already have duties and responsibilities, but I feel strongly that we need national leadership on what constitutes best practice.</p><p>My constituents have often compared their experiences to that of a bereavement, given their inability to function in the immediate aftermath due to shock. I am talking about able people not being able to deal with the practicalities. They have described mood changes and depression, as well as repeated nightmares of being trapped in a home with rising water levels.

I appreciate the Scottish Government's approval of a &#163;5 million flood defence scheme in Broxburn. West Lothian Council is actively looking at how to extend the scheme and truncate the implementation period. In that regard, I make a plea to the minister: can anything be done about European Union procurement rules, which slow processes down to a standstill at times? Like other councils, West Lothian Council is also considering early warning systems.</p><p>On a personal note, I add my thanks to Graham Hedger, the flood prevention officer at West Lothian Council, and to Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service, particularly the retained fire crews, and other emergency services for the professionalism and care that they showed to my constituents.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14622229", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in today's debate, and I extend a warm welcome to residents of Burnside village, near Broxburn, in my constituency, who join us in the public gallery.

Implicit in many of the consultation responses that the Health and Sport Committee received is the idea that elected members would be too stupid. Indeed, I think that it was stated explicitly that elected members would be of variable quality. However, people of different abilities communicate with different people. The rather douce councillor or elected member might well be able to communicate a message more effectively to some parts of the community than would a polite professional accountant. The complexity of health issues and the size of budgets&#8212;&#163;8 billion in Scotland and the best part of &#163;1 billion in NHS Lothian&#8212;mean that there is all the more reason to address the democratic deficit. We are, after all, talking about vast amounts of public money.</p><p>As I drove into Parliament this morning I listened to Radio Scotland, on which doctors' leaders were reported as saying that direct elections would lead to cliques and manipulators. I argue that a lack of democracy leads to cliques and manipulators. That level of debate exemplifies the establishment's desperately hanging on to the <place-holder colnum=\"14035\"/> status quo and its disproportionate power and influence at the expense of public accountability and engagement.</p><p>Local authorities and elected members are not without criticism, but they make difficult and, from time to time, unpopular decisions and they prioritise resources to intervene and improve quality of life and indeed, to save lives in cases of child protection and the protection of vulnerable adults, which are complex areas. They have to make decisions about universal service provision and targeting services based on need.</p><p>There are, of course, more considered objections based on the experience of direct elections to health boards in other countries, such as low turnout, decreasing numbers of candidates and a lack of diversity among those who are elected. As Unison says, democracy is not a panacea, particularly not when it comes to improving diversity and representation of the underrepresented. We have only to look around the chamber to see the lack of women and ethnic minorities, but that is not an argument against democracy; it is a reason to find the right democratic process. It is also a good reason to have pilots.</p><p>The current system of appointments has failed to improve diversity in health boards. Indeed, the local health concern campaign expressed concerns that although the appointment system gave the impression of public involvement, people were not enabled to put forward their views through fear of deselection. I have a constituency case involving a woman from an ethnic minority who was a non-executive lay member of NHS Lothian. She is a woman of exceptional ability, non-political and non-partisan, who I believe was forced to resign in a non-transparent and underhand manner. That is an example of why the culture has to change.</p><p>Health boards have expressed some concerns about single-issue candidates. Again, they represent a misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the democratic process. The debate about the pros and cons of a single-issue candidate should be had in an election. I also suggest that it is the actions of NHS boards that have breathed life into single-issue campaigns, possibly because boards' decisions were wrong, they had not persuaded the community of their decision, they had not meaningfully consulted the community or their decisions were not transparent in the first place. We have experienced all those failings in West Lothian.</p><p>I was disappointed by NHS Lothian's evidence to the Health and Sport Committee, and I noted with interest Michael Matheson's comment that NHS Lothian said that it had consulted when, in reality, it had not. I was disappointed by the <place-holder colnum=\"14036\"/> comments about an elected councillor from West Lothian who was elected on issues relating to St John's hospital. The evidence led by NHS Lothian singled him out and stated that his contribution was of limited value. NHS Lothian's evidence also said that directly elected members posed a risk of destabilising boards and contributing to a lack of unity.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14592920", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Boards (Membership and Elections) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I put on record my thanks to Unison for its briefing, which cut succinctly through the verbiage of objections from health boards, called a spade a spade and got to the heart of the matter when it said: \"Opposition to the Bill in the main comes from the health establishment\".

It was done with a knitting needle, actually, and I had some bruising and so on. However, my personal view is that how our judiciary views crimes of violence and crimes against people needs challenging. I often came across offenders who were serving lengthy sentences for crimes against property. I am not condoning such crimes, but I would sometimes come across sex offenders and violent offenders who were serving significantly lower sentences. I think that we, as legislators, should challenge the judiciary's mindset in that regard.</p><p>I know that judicial independence and all the rest of it must be protected within our legal system, but I am still concerned that we sometimes place more value on property than on people. To give an example from my constituency, a paramedic who works for the Scottish Ambulance Service in <place-holder colnum=\"13872\"/> Livingston had her nose broken by&#8212;as we could all have guessed&#8212;an alcohol-fuelled offender. He was dealt with very leniently, despite all the emergency worker legislation. The issue, I suggest, is how we view crimes against people. We have a responsibility to raise such issues and to push that agenda forward.</p><p>As a former criminal justice social worker, I would be the first to admit that robust community sentencing cannot be done on the cheap. Henry McLeish is 100 per cent correct to make that point repeatedly&#8212;including on the radio this morning&#8212;but we also need to consider some of the positive aspects. We have a fair local government settlement, despite a tight spending round. Some &#163;95 million is being invested in criminal justice social work services, which represents a 185 per cent increase over a decade. As the cabinet secretary said, additional resources of &#163;2 million over this year and next are being targeted at additional recruitment in recognition of the fact that workloads will increase.</p><p>Of particular interest to me is the Government's support for Edinburgh's criminal justice social work development centre, which brings practitioners together to learn from research and to share effective practice. Some 1,000 practitioners from throughout Scotland will have had the opportunity to participate in such events. In addition, 300 people will have been trained as trainers so that they can pass on their skills on how to work with young people who display sexually harmful behaviour.</p><p>Of particular importance is the recommendation that case information should travel with the offender. The amount of time that I used to spend chasing up information on a particular client could be hours, weeks or sometimes months. There are many positives, but there is much to be done.</p><p>I can see by the clock that I am running out of time. I had hoped to concentrate more on what should happen to children and 16 and 17-year-old offenders. McLeish recommended that they should go to secure units rather than to prison. The Government's response states that, where such offenders are imprisoned, we should ensure that they are kept separate from adults. There is a real debate to be had on that issue, but I warmly welcome the fact that the days of 14 and 15-year-olds being imprisoned under unruly certificates will soon be gone.</p><p>Finally, I want to flag up the fact that we need to debate the age of criminal responsibility. Bill Aitken said that he had hoped that we would have more debate from the cabinet secretary.

There are currently 22 Scots waiting for a liver transplant, and my constituent is one of four who have been waiting for that transplant for more than a year. As a result, I am aware of the work of the Scottish liver transplant unit of the Edinburgh royal infirmary. It is a busy service with a 96 per cent occupancy rate for its 18 beds. It is a small unit.</p><p>The work that is done by the living donation liver programme is particularly exciting. The liver is an amazing organ that can practically regrow itself.</p><p>I have always been instinctively sympathetic to the BMA's position in favour of a soft system of presumed consent, notwithstanding the unhelpfulness of that language. The BMA's position is pragmatic and sensitive to the views and needs of grieving relatives. It is based on the reality of the current system, in which only 25 per cent of organ donors in 2006-07 have registered their positive choice, with 70 per cent of organ donations being decided by the families on behalf of the deceased.</p><p>However, having listened to the debate, I am interested in the suggestion that Christine Grahame made on behalf of Dr Ian Grant, who is a consultant at the Western general hospital. That suggestion was that we need people to register for or against organ donation, although I believe that Christine Grahame said that Dr Grant thinks that such registration should be compulsory. That is an attractive suggestion, especially as we all go for regular health checks. Women go to well woman clinics, many of us go for flu jabs, and we make regular visits to our GPs with our children.</p><p>We also go to lawyers to discuss the making of our wills and what we want to happen when we are no longer here.

I do not want to sound morbid, but talking about what we want to happen once we are no longer here must become a cultural norm.</p><p>Last night I was showing the Kirknewton gala day committee around the Parliament and debating chamber. The group was made up of a cross-section of women from different backgrounds and of different ages. While we were in the chamber, we were talking about the debates that are coming up.

The ecumenical parish is very much at the heart of its community. In 2005, Knightsridge achieved an eco award for its butterfly garden. Several young people and Sunday school teachers embarked on that environmental project over the school holidays in 2005 and turned an ugly, litter-filled area into life-giving space.</p><p>They did not stop there.

He was seen by 19 health professionals and had been in hospital three times. He had more than 50 injuries. Three days before he died, he was seen by a paediatrician who failed to diagnose his broken back and ribs, injuries that would have left him paralysed. Instead, he was described as cranky and miserable.</p><p>As a former social worker, I am incredulous about the single and collective failings of each agency towards Baby P and, as a mother, I can barely bear to think about it. However, as a parliamentarian and a citizen, I must and we must. Closer to home are the death of baby Caleb Ness and the HMIE reports about Aberdeen and <place-holder colnum=\"12595\"/> Midlothian, which are chilling reminders of the tragedies that could have been.</p><p>Following Victoria Climbie's death, the Laming report, among other things, focused on corporate parenting. Corporate parenting is defined as:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"formal and local partnerships needed between all local authority departments and services, and associated agencies, who are responsible for working together to meet the needs of looked after children\".</p><p>Forgive me, but that is rather staid, managerial, civil service, policy-maker language. The important thing is to consider who corporate parents are. Local councillors need to take on leadership and ownership and they need to be at the vanguard of their local child protection system and services.</p><p>What then is the role for parliamentarians? We should be the corporate interfering granny, looking over the parents' shoulders to ensure that they are doing it right. We should be the nosy neighbour, always watching and asking searching and probing questions about outcomes for Scotland's children. We have reams of well-meaning legislation and policy statements. As we know, professionals have a duty of care and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 rams home the point that children's welfare is paramount and that their needs and rights take precedence over those of everybody else.</p><p>To its credit, the previous Scottish Executive produced \"It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright.\" The Scottish Government has produced, \"These Are Our Bairns: a guide for community planning partnerships on being a good corporate parent.\" Government has to be blunt and concrete in saying that it is entirely unacceptable for any professional&#8212;not just social workers, but nurses, doctors, health visitors, housing officers or anybody who is paid from the public purse or who works in a service that is funded by the public purse&#8212;not to share information or not to work in children's best interests. That must be the case irrespective of whether people work in a service that works directly with children or one that provides only indirect support to children, or, indeed, whether their client is an adult as opposed to a child.</p><p>Often, in the wake of the death of a child, we hear commentators, particularly in the press, say that in the years following all the horrific revelations of institutional abuse of children in our child care system, the pendulum has swung the wrong way and we have gone to the opposite extreme. Apparently, social workers are now too reluctant and reticent to take children into care and the current presumption is that a bad family is better than no family. However, the clear message from Government and Parliament is that there must be no room for fashion or fads when it comes to protecting Scotland's children. Protecting <place-holder colnum=\"12596\"/> children is a straight-down-the-line decision, which should be evidence based and made with vigour and rigour about what is best for each child. That decision should be made without fear or favour. The quid pro quo from parliamentarians and Government to workers and other professionals is that when they make those decisions without fear or favour, we will stand by them.</p><p>According to some studies, 60 to 80 per cent of a social worker's time is spent staring at a computer screen, wrapped up in bureaucracy or doing paperwork. Of course, as Hugh Henry said, resources are always central to any discussion about protecting children's services. I am glad that we have expressed our support for the difficult job that our social workers do and that we recognise the successes that often go unreported. We also recognise that work with children and families is complex and takes time, and that there needs to be dialogue and sharing of information.</p><p>I am proud of Scotland's children's hearings system. However, there is never any room for complacency. Approximately 50 children throughout the UK die every year at the hands of their parents or carers. As we know and as we have heard today, there are many forms of abuse. We have to stand by our children. The challenge for policy makers and politicians is to feel for the children who do not have parents or people to put their interests first. As Sandra White said, we must want for those children what we would want for our own children.</p><p>Like most parents, I would rather lose a limb than see any harm come to my son. As parliamentarians and legislators, that is the desire and ethos that we need for all Scotland's children.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246612", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In our deliberations about Scotland's looked-after children this morning and our expressed desire to improve, promote and protect children's welfare, it is paramount that we reflect on the suffering of Baby P, which is a haunting example of what can happen when we get it so very wrong, by acts of either commission or omission.

Forgive me, but I cannot help commenting on the irony that the man who worked so hard for peace in Northern Ireland was the same man who took us into an illegal war in Iraq. Of course, as we know and have heard this afternoon, politics and politicians are full of contradictions.</p><p>As other members have done, I commend the detail of the good work that the British-Irish Council undertakes. I have a particular interest in the on-going work on migration. I come to the debate as a Scot of Italian extraction. The experience of Italian Scots is similar to but different from that of our fellow Irish Scots. My great-grandfather, at the age of 12, was put on a boat to leave Italy and told that he was going to America. Luckily for me, he ended up in Blackburn in West Lothian. On a more serious point, it is important that migration is discussed and addressed positively and pragmatically, because we need migrants to fill the skills gaps in certain areas of our economy. The participating nations in the British-Irish Council have different needs when it comes to migration. The debate must be framed positively, not pejoratively with talk about British jobs for British people, which Gordon Brown said at his party's conference last year and which a recently appointed minister reiterated.</p><p>The work on digital inclusion is welcome. Parts of West Lothian, including the village in which I reside, do not have access to broadband. It is <place-holder colnum=\"11811\"/> interesting that only 50 per cent of Scottish households have broadband and that 73 per cent of disabled adults do not have access to broadband at all. In the digital age, internet access and broadband are pivotal to improving the quality of life and economic and social participation. I look forward to hearing more about that work in due course and about the work on healthy independent ageing, which sounds good to me.</p><p>The concept of the British-Irish Council has always interested me, as a nationalist. It underlines the importance of, and the relationship between, the independence of a state and the interdependence between states. As the participating nations grow, develop and change in accordance with the political will of each country, the British-Irish Council will, I hope, also grow and change, irrespective of what it is called. It is worth noting that the relationship between the United Kingdom Government and the British-Irish Council is the best that it has ever been, notwithstanding recent comments about the Irish economy. I firmly believe that it is about two independent countries freely associating and co-operating as equal partners. There are many examples from Europe and throughout the world of independent nations working together on the basis of shared interest and geography and mutual benefit. For example, there is the Benelux economic union, which was set up after the second world war, and the Nordic Council, which has been on the go since the 1970s and which has achieved many great things.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, I look forward to Scotland participating as a fully grown-up and independent nation and discussing, debating and co-operating on a full range of issues.

As a constituency member, I have a duty to represent my community in the context of the challenges that are presented by the recent demise of HBOS and its subsequent possible merger with Lloyds TSB.</p><p>Political endeavours to date have rightly focused on the high-level and strategic discussions about retaining jobs in Scotland and ensuring that we get the best deal for Scotland. They have promoted the necessity for key head office decision-making functions to remain in Scotland. However, our focus will have to turn at some point to communities across Scotland such as mine because&#8212;make no mistake&#8212;banks, like post offices, provide a community service as well as a commercial one. They are part of our social fabric and they add to both the social and the economic viability of our smaller towns and villages. We must not lose sight of that.</p><p>For that reason, I welcome the First Minister's comment that we must consider the needs of the whole of Scotland and not just those of the capital city, however important Edinburgh is. In the wake of the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB, I believe that West Lothian is particularly vulnerable to branch closures because of the distribution of branches of HBOS and Lloyds TSB&#8212;for every Lloyds TSB branch, there is an HBOS just down the road.</p><p>Local concerns escalate when we consider what might happen to Intelligent Finance&#8212;a division of Bank of Scotland plc and part of HBOS&#8212;whose customer services operations are located in Livingston and Rosyth. Between them, those sites accommodate 1,200 workers. In scrapping Intelligent Finance accounts and credit cards, HBOS has already affected 400 jobs. The closure <place-holder colnum=\"11116\"/> of HBOS's mortgage processing centres will affect jobs in Livingston as well as in Chester and Cardiff.</p><p>Recent events come hot on the tail of announcements of other job losses in my constituency over the past 12 months&#8212;by HSBC, Glenmorangie and Bausch and Lomb. Although unemployment in West Lothian stands at only 2.3 per cent, which is lower than the Scottish average and the same as the UK average, we in West Lothian are hypersensitive to the possibility of job losses because of vivid memories of the early 1980s, when one in four of the male working-age population was unemployed. My father was one of those men. Every West Lothian family has been touched by unemployment at some point in the recent past. Although West Lothian is to be commended for turning round its local economy, we can ill afford to lose more jobs. Therefore, I ask the cabinet secretary to consider in his summing-up speech how best we can take forward the specific needs of communities and, in particular, whether local authorities might have a role, given their economic development functions.</p><p>Sadly, job losses may indeed be inevitable. In <em>The Scotsman</em> last week, Peter Jones predicted that Scotland would lose 3,000 to 4,000 jobs within a year, based on the 15 per cent loss of jobs that occurred following the merger of the Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest. Arguably, that could be a conservative estimate, given that the e-mail that was sent to staff by the HBOS chief executive, Andy Hornby, insisted only that \"the majority\" of HBOS employees would keep their jobs. Obviously, that leaves concerns about what will happen to the minority&#8212;potentially, 49 per cent.</p><p>Like most people in the real world outside the Parliament, I do not claim to be proficient in the intricacies of the stock market or the financial services sector, nor have I ever met a spiv or speculator. However, like most people, I must ask how this was allowed to happen. We live in a country that is highly regulated. Some would argue that we have a tendency to overregulate. We gold-plate basic regulations. My local council cannot put in flood prevention schemes without having to advertise work in Europe, while my constituents lie awake worrying every time that it rains. It is ludicrous and ironic. To quote Professor Ronald MacDonald:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need much better regulation of the financial sector as it has been very lax and we are reaping what we've sown in the sense that it is a poorly regulated financial sector.\"</p><p>Of course, Alistair Darling has been talking about tightening the regulation of the financial industry since the Northern Rock collapse, but nothing has happened. In October 2007, Alistair Darling said that the Labour Government would <place-holder colnum=\"11117\"/> lead an international effort to learn lessons from the run on Northern Rock and develop a new regime that would restore stability to the financial markets. A year later, he was still making the same promises in his speech to the Labour Party conference. Too little, too late.</p><p>There is deep anger and a deep sense of loss over what has happened to HBOS. As we turn our eyes to the future, I hope that we can unite and do what we can at a practical level to save jobs.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035851", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hbos"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The role and purpose of the Scottish Government is to represent and advance the Scottish national interest, not least in times of adversity and uncertainty.

I know&#8212;and I am sure that Richard Simpson knows&#8212;that it is deeply unwise to have offenders in the mental health system and to have mentally ill people in prison. The legal basis for detention and the aftercare procedures are entirely different in cases where someone is ill <place-holder colnum=\"10790\"/> and offends because of their illness and cases where the person is an offender.</p><p>The Scottish Prisons Commission report is aptly entitled \"Scotland's Choice\". We have known for many years what works and what does not work, so there is absolutely no need to reinvent the wheel. Irrespective of fluctuations in the crime rate&#8212;whether it has remained stable or has increased or decreased&#8212;prison numbers have continued to soar. Notwithstanding the need to incarcerate dangerous and serious offenders, we have always had a misplaced faith in prison. Professor Coyle states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"How many prisoners do we want to have in ... Scotland? Because ultimately the answer to that question does not depend on levels of crime or on levels of re-offending. It is a matter of public choice.\"</p><p>That is the real issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Soaring prison numbers are counterproductive and unsustainable and will, I fear, end in tears. Meltdown is not in the interests of the public, prisoners or prison staff. We are currently 1,000 prisoners over capacity. To address that, we need to address what happens to offenders at the point of sentencing. We want to do something different with them and something that works; we do not&#8212;as some have quite scandalously suggested&#8212;want to open the gates and let people walk free.</p><p>My colleague Willie Coffey was right to point out the damaging effects of short sentences. As he mentioned, in 2006-07, about 6,000 fine defaulters were imprisoned. He was perfectly correct to highlight that 88 per cent of those 6,000 spent less than two weeks in prison. One needs to look at the annual turnover of prisoners rather than at snapshot figures. No doubt the prison population on a particular day might have included only 13 fine defaulters, but the annual turnover shows that 88 per cent of those 6,000 fine defaulters spent less than two weeks in prison. That is not a good use of public resources.</p><p>If we are serious about challenging offending behaviour and addressing in depth the issues of drink, drugs and mental health as well as the education and employability of offenders, we need to target the good skills of prison staff.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13979203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Prisons Commission"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, it would be prudent for me to declare an interest.

We know that tough community sentences work.

Of course, in part that might be a reflection on my personality.</p><p>We know that reconviction rates for those on community sentences are more favourable than for those who leave prison. I know that West Lothian has achieved an excellent reduction in reconviction rates because of the good community service work that is being done.

That means that they are got out to work immediately.</p><p>Overall, the debate has given us many examples of how the system can be beefed up and made bolder. We need to use bail more wisely and target the people who are kept on remand. There are great examples of how community service sentences can be beefed up by using conditional sentences with a wider range of conditions. The progress courts will be a great way of ensuring that offenders are held to account and cannot turn their face against the law and against their community service orders without serious consequences.</p><p>Finally, I am committed to the idea that punishment should be visible, swift and fair, and it is for MSPs across the political divide to show some leadership in what works.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13979203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Prisons Commission"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We could debate the statistics all afternoon, but I hope that we are agreed on the principle that fine defaulters are   clogging up the system.

We have heard a few times in the debate that the Scottish economy is robust, but not immune from global pressures. Every man and woman in the street continues to feel the pinch with, as we have heard, soaring energy prices and the scandal of 500,000 Scots being in fuel poverty. That is particularly scandalous in an energy-rich country like Scotland. The cost of living is up, with the retail price index at 5 per cent. The cost of living is, of course, even greater for the over-65s. The price of petrol has increased, which results in the cost of everything increasing.</p><p>Despite not having full economic powers and facing the frustration of having one hand tied behind its back and being able only to campaign for a fuel duty regulator as opposed to implementing one, the Scottish Government has succeeded in putting money back into the pockets of hard-pressed Scots. The council tax has already been frozen and we have heard today our political commitment to the abolition of such a regressive and hated property tax&#8212;although the will of Parliament will determine whether we achieve our aspiration of introducing a local income tax. Prescription charges are also going. Of particular delight to me and my Livingston constituents is the fact that car parking charges at St John's hospital will go at hogmanay&#8212;a happy hogmanay that will be.</p><p>The resilience of the Scottish economy is exemplified by growth that continues to match or surpass that of the UK, as it has done over the past three quarters. Our population is increasing&#8212;Fergus Ewing and I have made our own small contributions to that, as have Richard Lochhead and Shirley-Anne Somerville, and Karen Gillon will make her contribution in the months to come. Our population is at its highest level in 25 years. Retail sales are up and house prices in Scotland continue to edge up&#8212;notwithstanding today's reports that house prices in Edinburgh have fallen quite dramatically.</p><p>I want to focus on the Government's much-welcomed proposals to advance the affordable housing agenda, but I prefix my comments with a personal view. While recognising the value of the house-building industry to the Scottish economy&#8212;not least because it provides employment&#8212;I have never been convinced that rising house prices are a good thing per se. In my constituency, soaring house prices have had a disproportionate effect on <place-holder colnum=\"10383\"/> first-time buyers. Median incomes in Livingston constituency are between &#163;17,000 and &#163;18,000 a year; average house prices are about &#163;160,000 in Scotland and a little bit higher than that in West Lothian. In Edinburgh, average house prices are around the &#163;200,000 mark. People might well make a hefty profit on their house sale, but that will only be diminished when they need to pay more to buy their new house. It concerns me greatly that young families are mortgaged to the hilt. We have gone from one extreme to the other, from a situation in which people were offered 100 per cent-plus mortgages to one in which first-time buyers now struggle to get a mortgage at all.</p><p>In my view, it is the job of Government to support first-time buyers and those who struggle to pay their mortgages in these economically challenging times, but it is not the job of Government inadvertently to bolster house prices. With that in mind, I believe that the measures introduced by the Scottish Government strike the right balance, in particular in their support for first-time buyers. The investment of &#163;250 million in low-cost initiatives for first-time buyers is very welcome indeed, as is the &#163;25 million for home owners who struggle to pay their mortgages. Of course we have a responsibility to prevent repossessions, given the impact that those would have on our already difficult problem with homelessness.</p><p>Affordable housing is very much at the heart of the Government's agenda. I believe strongly that abolishing the right to buy was a bold and decisive move that has kick-started a new generation of social housing. I welcome the fact that, for the first time in decades, new council houses will be built in West Lothian. Of course, much remains to be done. Some 200,000 people are on council house waiting lists across Scotland&#8212;11,000 in West Lothian alone&#8212;so there is a lot of work to be done.</p><p>I endorse the Government's legislative programme.

Care leavers are disadvantaged on almost every front, with an increased risk of alcohol or drug misuse, mental health problems, contact with the criminal justice system, homelessness, unemployment and difficulties in sustaining education. I thank Robert Brown for the two pertinent recent motions that he lodged. The first reinforces the point that care should normally continue until at least 18 years of age and the second calls for an increase in supported accommodation and semi-independent living units.</p><p>One young person in the \"Sweet 16?\" report that Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People prepared states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It would be better if there was more preparation for leaving care, especially a semi-independent flat where staff could come in to check how you're getting on. The practical things were the most difficult to cope with.\"</p><p>I remember well the telephone calls that I used to make to my mother when I first left home, with seemingly stupid questions about how to defrost a chicken and change a plug. It is only with the passing of years that I realise how lucky I was.</p><p>I commend the children's commissioner and her team for the \"Sweet 16?\" report. Kathleen Marshall has reminded us that, although it is fundamental to have enabling legislation and policy, it is what happens in practice that counts. Her report is a somewhat painful reminder of the harsh reality for <place-holder colnum=\"10171\"/> many of Scotland's children. At the last count, slightly more than 14,000 children and young people were looked after, whether at home, in residential care or residential school, or by foster or kinship carers. Interestingly, that is an increase of 26 per cent since 1999. As we know, 75 per cent of those youngsters leave school with no qualification and less than 1 per cent go to university.</p><p>I am pleased that in West Lothian 78 per cent of looked after and accommodated children obtain a minimum level 3 in English and/or mathematics, which is essential to progress towards a college placement. However, as a children's rights officer who is quite rightly quoted in the \"Sweet 16?\" report states,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For young care leavers it is very much a postcode lottery.\"</p><p>That is not acceptable in today's Scotland.</p><p>The learning to care/care to learn agenda is still pivotal. Education is the passport from poverty&#8212;in its broadest sense, it gives our children the ambition and ability to achieve. Nor is it acceptable that 25 per cent of young people aged 15 to 21 who are eligible for through-care and after-care services are not in touch with those services. Douglas Bulloch, in the report that he produced for the previous Scottish Executive entitled \"For Scotland's children: Better integrated children's services\" identified that the children who are most in need of services are often the most likely to have difficulty accessing them.</p><p>Karen Whitefield's motion acknowledges that examples of good practice exist. West Lothian Council has the having your say advocacy projects, the youth inclusion project and one-stop shops for vulnerable 16 to 21-year-olds. The crux of good services is the local authority's attitude to corporate parenting, and West Lothian Council should be commended on its attitude to that. A corporate parent must aspire to do all that a good and reasonable parent would do, by holding together the many strands of a child's life and caring about their safety, health, education, friendships and future, and by talking and listening to them.</p><p>The corporate parent should also&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;fight with and argue with their children. As one young person in the \"Sweet 16?\" report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Staff don't fight you if you want to leave at 16.\"</p><p>Children and young people need boundaries to push against; they need to know that they are wanted and they need to know that someone cares.</p><p>The children's commissioner makes many recommendations in her report.

The system and society&#8212;the collective \"we\"&#8212;turned its back on that young woman, and she paid with her life.</p><p>I extend a warm welcome to the representatives from Scottish Women's Aid, West Lothian Women's Aid and Amnesty International who are in the public gallery today. Due to their vocation and dedication, and the work that is undertaken by government at all levels, both past and present, in regard to domestic violence, I am somewhat confident that in today's Scotland, more women are safer.</p><p>However, we are turning our backs on a group of women whom I would describe as new Scots or new Scotswomen. Unless we can navigate or cut our way through the demarcation of devolved and <place-holder colnum=\"9243\"/> reserved matters, we will continue to fail&#8212;perilously&#8212;to protect new Scotswomen who are fleeing violence.</p><p>Amnesty International and the Southall Black Sisters have produced deeply disturbing evidence that women with insecure immigration status have no recourse to public funds and are, therefore, unable to claim the benefits that they need to flee violence. They have no right to be accommodated under housing legislation and no housing benefit or supporting people money to pay for refuge and support. They have no right to benefits; yet some of the women have no right to work. Women who flee violence often leave with nothing, and women with no recourse to public funds face the stark and cruel choice of either remaining trapped in a violent relationship or entering destitution.</p><p>Who are the women with insecure or uncertain immigration status? They are women with valid visas who are here legally as spouses, students, visitors, workers and those who are classified as overstayers, in addition to those who are the victims of human trafficking. Scottish Women's Aid does its level best, but how can it absorb a cost for which it is not funded&#8212;a cost in excess of &#163;6,000 per woman per year&#8212;with no recourse to public funds? It is simply not acceptable or sustainable for women to have to rely on charitable donations or sheer good will for the accommodation and support that ensures their safety.</p><p>Scottish Women's Aid has highlighted the fact that 106 women throughout Scotland have been refused refuge in the past year. In today's Scotland, any woman should be able to access refuge irrespective of her race, ethnicity or origins. To deny that is, in my view, an abrogation of human rights as well as of human dignity. Many of the women have children and Scottish Women's Aid informs us that an increasing number of local authorities are suggesting that they can accommodate the child but not the mother. That may represent the reality of the legal position, but it is, nonetheless, absolutely outrageous and contrary to the well being of children and the spirit of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p><p>There are many challenges for women who are trying to navigate their way through the immigration process. It is costing one West Lothian woman in excess of &#163;700 to apply to the Home Office, and an application can take between three months and two years. Then, there is the need to obtain evidence from a doctor who has documented injuries that are attributable to domestic violence; yet, as we know, some offenders are very careful and will leave only mental scars.</p><p>Scottish Women's Aid and Amnesty International are campaigning for the Scottish Government to put in place emergency funds <place-holder colnum=\"9244\"/> while a permanent solution from the UK Government is sought&#8212;that is, the exemption of women who are fleeing domestic violence from the rule that currently denies them recourse to public funds. Other countries, such as Canada, the United States of America and Austria, have similar rules that deny recourse to public funds, but those rules specify exemptions.</p><p>The crux of the issue is reserved to Westminster. As a nationalist, I regret that fact. I hope that the Scottish Government will lead the way in finding a solution and co-operate constructively with&#8212;and, when appropriate, cajole&#8212;Westminster, just as it is my duty as an MSP both to co-operate with and, at times, to cajole the Scottish Government in the interests of my constituents, whether they be indigenous or new Scots.</p><p>Scottish Women's Aid first raised the issue five years ago and, with more new Scots coming to Scotland&#8212;indeed, to my constituency&#8212;we need action now.

I look forward to doing that.</p><p>Having listened to front-line staff in Livingston, I certainly hope that the Health and Sport Committee will undertake a review of the Scottish Ambulance Service. Personally, I feel that such a review would be timely, as it would follow on from last year's Audit Scotland report on out-of-hours services. In that report, Audit Scotland correctly highlighted the need to improve the links between the out-of-hours service, NHS 24 and the Ambulance Service. The report emphasised the need to strengthen communication and, crucially, it urged a review of the impact of the out-of-hours service on the Ambulance Service.</p><p>I note and welcome the eight-minute target for category A call-outs, which is all very laudable, but I believe that additional, more sophisticated performance indicators are needed. Surely if an <place-holder colnum=\"8887\"/> ambulance crew does not arrive within eight minutes but succeeds in saving a life, that is a good result in anybody's book.</p><p>Responding to emergencies day in, day out requires physical, emotional and mental strength. It is unacceptable that staff struggle to get meal and refreshment breaks, especially when they are working a 12-hour night shift.</p><p>When describing the challenges of their work, Ambulance Service staff repeatedly iterated to me that they felt that calling out an ambulance seemed to be the default position. NHS 24 appears to be the regular culprit behind inappropriate call-outs. Telephone assessment based on buzz words can be a rather blunt instrument and compares poorly with face-to-face clinical assessments. In addition, as we all know, A and E targets for vacating hospital beds also have an impact on the Ambulance Service.</p><p>My constituency is semi-rural in parts but, with the growth of Livingston new town and the core development areas, the constituency has one of the fastest-growing populations in the United Kingdom, never mind Scotland. St John's hospital at the heart of my constituency has the highest rate of hospital-to-hospital transfers in Scotland, as evidenced in a recent national audit. All of that, combined with the removal of some acute services from St John's hospital to the Edinburgh royal infirmary in 2004, has had huge resource implications for the Ambulance Service in my constituency.</p><p>Increased journey times are a real issue. The increased number of journeys between West Lothian and Edinburgh has implications for equity of access for my constituents, as ambulances are increasingly caught up in out-of-area call-outs. That is a cruel reminder of the consequences of not keeping health care local.</p><p>With the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the national health service approaching, we need to keep health care local if we are to be true to the NHS's founding principles.

The increasing number and proportion of over-65s and over-90s will, indeed, provide challenges for government at all levels, but we must remember that some good news is at the crux of the challenge and we must desist from framing discussions about older people and the challenges for public policy and the public purse in pejorative terms.</p><p>That is why I welcome Lord Sutherland's independent review. In dealing with the here and now, he looks to the future and provides a framework to work towards improving the lives of those we refer to as older people.

That system has, by and large, stood the test of time and is still with us today. Lord Sutherland has indicated that free personal and nursing care is affordable, so we can be confident that that policy, too, will stand the test of time. Like the children's hearings system, it is an example of how we can do things differently in Scotland to reflect the core values that we have as a nation, which cut across the political divide.</p><p>As we know, the raisons d'&#234;tre of free personal and nursing care were equity and the principle of free care based on need.

Anyone who earns less than &#163;19,500 and is ineligible for tax credits will be worse off. Those who earn &#163;17,000 or less will face a higher effective income tax rate in the current financial year as a direct result of the 2007 budget. Any taxation should, of course, be progressive and based on the ability to pay. That is a fundamental principle that the SNP holds dear. The regressive move by the former chancellor and current Prime Minister has resonated sourly in my constituency of Livingston. For example, a receptionist who earns &#163;14,000 <place-holder colnum=\"8229\"/> will be a net loser while MSPs and MPs will be net gainers.</p><p>Although Livingston and West Lothian are fortunate enough to have a relatively good array of employers compared with the rest of Scotland, companies associated with silicon glen have been lost and replaced by McArthurGlen and a reliance on the retail industry. Consequently, incomes are relatively low. The 2007 \"Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings\" demonstrates that, as the median income in my constituency is just over &#163;17,500. Another factor is that, according to the last Scottish house conditions survey, 8,000 homes throughout West Lothian are fuel poor. Social tariffs are all very well, but they are not mandatory. Winter fuel payments are welcome, but they now cover less than 20 per cent of a pensioner's fuel costs. Four years ago, the winter fuel payment covered approximately a third of a pensioner's fuel costs.</p><p>The term \"compensation package\" says it all. Surely, if people require to be compensated for a Government decision, the original decision must have been wrong. No Government likes to lose face by doing a U-turn, but sometimes that may be the best option and the right thing to do. Instead, a bungling Mr Brown and Alistair Darling are trying and failing to compensate for bad decisions.</p><p>The Social Market Foundation rightly points out that the compensation package will compensate only one in five of those adversely affected.

The sheer lunacy is that in his last budget Gordon Brown unpicked a measure that he introduced. The <place-holder colnum=\"8230\"/> implementation of the 10p tax band was widely welcomed. In 2000, when Wendy Alexander was the Minister for Communities, she described it, among other measures, as putting money in the purses of mothers.</p><p>I do not often find myself quoting the former Labour minister Brian Wilson, but on this occasion I will.

As with the poll tax in days of yore, this succeeds in offending not only the victims, but also a large body of opinion that does not wish to benefit at their expense.\"</p><p>So much for London Labour; it has lost its way and its focus. As Christina McKelvie correctly highlighted, it is now left to the SNP to put money in the purses of ordinary Scots through the council tax freeze, the reduction in prescription charges&#8212;they are soon to be abolished&#8212;and increases in free personal care and nursing home payments.</p><p>I realised a long time ago that if you want social democracy you have to be able to pay for it.

If we want compassion, we certainly need enterprise; they are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>Of course, it is hard for me as a nationalist to be dispassionate about Scotland and our desire for full self-determination but, as we are all agreed, we cannot turn the clock back and there is only one direction of travel.

I make my contribution to tonight's debate with that point in mind.</p><p>For those who do not know, Bathgate is in the West Lothian constituency, which neighbours mine. Consequently, it has much in common with West Calder and Broxburn, which are in my constituency. Those smaller West Lothian towns have a shared history and heritage and share the challenges of co-existing as near neighbours to the ever-growing and ever-successful Livingston new town&#8212;in an ever-changing local and global economy. We must therefore enable the business communities in those small towns to flourish and thrive. In that respect, the business-led BID concept, which is supported locally and nationally by the SNP, is a shining example of how the needs of local businesses and the wider community can be met.</p><p>When the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, Mr Swinney, visited Bathgate, he was bowled over by people's commitment to making the BID concept work. Moreover, last night, at an economic debate in Livingston, Mr Mather, the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, emphasised the importance of economic partnerships and the need to get everyone in the same room and talking to each other. If we can&#8212;to use his words&#8212;crossfertilise and pollinate, we can all move up together, and the BID concept is an excellent example of economic partnership.</p><p>The BID team's business plan, which is based on the business community's views and needs with regard to improving its trading conditions and environment, clearly demonstrates that the benefits are more than economic; I have no doubt that it will also deliver environmental, social and cultural dividends. Although the concept is about creating a recognisable brand, its pragmatic focus takes in accessing additional funds and services that will make a difference and will, crucially, enable communities to devise town centre strategies that will keep the heart of our smaller communities pumping.</p><p>I am pleased that West Lothian Council's current administration will continue to match-fund the Bathgate BID levy over the next five years. Indeed, the very concept complements the SNP Government's support for small businesses, including the reduction in and scrapping of business rates. [<em>Interruption.</em>] With the recent announcement in West Lothian of job losses at <place-holder colnum=\"7851\"/> Bausch and Lomb, HSBC and Mahle Engine Systems, the success of the Bathgate BID is a timely reminder of what we can and should be doing to ensure our communities' economic viability.</p><p>I, too, thank, commend and send best wishes to Sam Crawford, who chaired the BID steering group; implementation officers Amanda Finlayson, who is one of my constituents, and Pat Kerr; and David Stein as well as the wider Bathgate business community.

That is positive news indeed.</p><p>If Mr Lamont is concerned about \"soft-touch Scotland\", I invite him to visit the criminal justice social work team in Livingston, because that will show him exactly how managing offenders in the community can and should be done. If my memory serves me correctly, the West Lothian criminal justice social work team has the best record and results on probation and community service officers.</p><p>The Government's emphasis is on visible policing, which will result not only in everyone feeling safer but in communities actually being safer. There is no doubt that a tough challenge lies ahead for us in ensuring that the police force is fit and resourced for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The Government has risen to the challenge, and the Justice Committee, to its credit, in its report bores down into the pivotal and essential issues.</p><p>The key issue, personally speaking, is community policing. I have been in representative politics for the best part of 11 years, and I cannot speak highly enough of the community police officers with whom I have had the privilege of working over the years&#8212;that is, when and where they have existed, because in the year prior to the 2007 election West Lothian, which should have had 25 community police officers, quite often operated at half that capacity due to various stresses and demands on the police force.</p><p>I draw members' attention to page 9 of the Justice Committee's report. With respect to the Scottish Police Federation evidence, the ASPS</p><p class=\"indent\">\"defined community policing as 'softer-edged policing that includes diversionary work in youth clubs and liaison with various community groups.' Chief Superintendent Murray argued that the public wanted 'the harder-edged, enforcing arm of the police'\".</p><p>I reject any suggestion that community policing is the softer policing option. Community policing, at its best and properly resourced, is well placed to deal with the harder-edged issues, whether those are drugs in our communities, youth disorder, disorder by older offenders or antisocial behaviour.</p><p>From my own experience, I am well aware that community police officers often come up with imaginative solutions to deal with local hotspots. Community police officers have often laid down arguments to their senior officers about the need for additional resources. Other examples of partnership working have been crucial.<place-holder colnum=\"7587\"/></p><p>Community police work deserves status and has to be at the heart of what policing in Scotland is about. I look forward to hearing about the continuing work of the Justice Committee in that area.

We need to find the best way forward and we need a solution. In short, we need action.</p><p>The minister is actively considering an accreditation scheme for property managers, and it is anticipated that Scottish planning policy 2, which will be published later this year, will strengthen the message that proper, detailed consideration must be given to the management and maintenance of communal land and property.</p><p>Mrs Godman's motion suggests that the common-hold system, which operates in England and Wales, is a potential solution. I make additional suggestions. In some factoring arrangements, residents' title deeds contain a clause that allows them to form a residents association and, by majority, appoint or change the factor whom they pay to maintain common ground. My constituents and others have no such choice; they are subject to an enforced monopoly. Not one resident disputes their responsibility to pay for the upkeep of land; they are in dispute simply about the level of service that they receive and to whom they must pay their money. Legal opinion has been sought and it may be that, under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003, a monopoly in such circumstances is illegal.<place-holder colnum=\"1570\"/></p><p>Across Scotland, residents are calling for regulation. I support the introduction of regulation that is on a par with that which is proposed in Ireland. I know that the minister is considering a national accreditation scheme for property managers, which I will support if land-maintenance providers are included and grave consideration is given to the necessity of having a compulsory scheme.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387064", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Land (Housing Estates)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mrs Godman on securing the debate.

Even offenders require treatment. I am a former mental health officer, so I am painfully aware that mental health care is the Cinderella service&#8212;I am talking about mainstream mental health services, let alone the forensic settings in which I worked. There is little focus on targets or on reducing waiting times for people who use mental health services.</p><p>If we are to address health inequalities, we must start by addressing the democratic deficit in health.

Such an approach has been to the detriment of St John's hospital in Livingston, which is at the heart of the community that I represent. The hospital has lost vital services, which has threatened its viability as an acute hospital.</p><p>Equity of access is at the heart of efforts to tackle health inequalities.

I welcome the cabinet secretary's commitment to meeting me and local campaigners and stakeholders to discuss what we can do to secure and enhance the future of St John's hospital as an acute hospital.</p><p>The cabinet secretary is aware that I have corresponded with her on car parking charges at St John's hospital. I call for a moratorium on the proposed increases in charges at St John's, pending a full review. I am alarmed and concerned that NHS Lothian is in breach of Government guidance, given its recent admission that the proposed increases of up to 100 per cent are designed in part to offset the costs of transport, which is required only because vital services have been removed. It is ironic that there is free parking at the McArthurGlen shopping centre, council buildings and the Livingston Football Club, but not at the local hospital. The car parking charges are nothing short of a tax on the sick and those who visit them or spend their lives treating them.
