{"info": {"total_results": 232, "s": "speaker:25088 section:sp", "first_result": 201, "spelling_correction": "", "results_per_page": 100, "page": "3"}, "rows": [{"body": "<p>As many colleagues have said, the issue is complicated, and we are all a bit wiser thanks to the briefings that we have had from a number of organisations. However, certainly on a personal level, I still feel that I have but scratched the surface of the information that is out there. The SDF told us that NPSs&#8212;I will just use the shorthand at this stage in the debate&#8212;or legal highs are a potential danger to users. I very much enjoyed Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s speech and I agree that it is important that we use the terminology of legal highs. As Dennis Robertson said, I do not think that many users of legal highs are likely to be listening to the debate or are likely to view it or read the Official Report subsequently. That issue about information is perhaps one that we have to address.</p><p>The key words are &#8220;legal&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221;. I suggest that it is difficult to second guess people. It is the fact that people get high from alcohol or legal drugs that attracts 17-year-olds to taking them, albeit that alcohol is illegal for them to consume. I do not think that the word &#8220;legal&#8221; necessarily has the attraction that the word &#8220;high&#8221; has in the scheme of things. However, even that small point shows that we need evidence. It is vital that such evidence comes from the appropriate source. We need a balanced response to the issue and, at the head of that response by a country mile, I would like to see education. The SDF, Crew and the harm reduction teams are clearly involved in that.</p><p>The motion talks about law enforcement and the challenges of enforcement. At the risk of being out of kilter with all previous speakers, I point out that there is a debate to be had as to why there should be enforcement on legal issues, and certainly with regard to legal highs. The police&#8217;s role in the choices for life scheme is important. Clearly, the police wish to have more powers to deal with the issue, but what are the implications of the law enforcement agency seeking more powers on the issue? Where would that stop? Around the globe, people take a range of substances to stimulate themselves. We need to be cautious that we are approaching this properly.</p><p>I asked a couple of young folk about the issue, and they had a totally different attitude from me and perhaps other members. Indeed, the swift response that I got from someone was that we should legalise cannabis. I do not propose that we do that, but we can learn from experience in other jurisdictions, most recently Uruguay, about the implications for new psychoactive substances of that particular act. We must also consider the consequences of turning something that is presently legal into something illegal. We know that law enforcement and legislators struggle to keep up with the pharmaceutical people, but our approach needs to be entirely evidence based.</p><p>Drug users are the informed consumers. My colleague Alison McInnes said that consumers do not know what they are buying. Members might think that that is terrible, but some folks think that it is a bit of a lucky dip. They think, &#8220;You never know&#8212;it might be good or it might be bad.&#8221; That is why some folks end up buying dog worming tablets.</p><p>Head shops have been talked about a great deal, and there has been collaborative working on that issue. Much has been said about packaging. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is looking at issues of reckless conduct. I was grateful to be invited along to the meeting that the minister talked about. A trading standards officer who was there was puzzling with the thought that, if someone is content with spending &#163;22 on bath salts, how do we approach that?</p><p>Kezia Dugdale talked about bulk purchases, and our briefing was helpful in highlighting the free sample issue and self-funding dealerships, which I would describe as pyramid selling&#8212;that is capitalism; it works well in that field, just as it works well for Governments as they trade in their drugs of choice, alcohol and tobacco. The SDF briefing also talks about alternative lifestyle choices, and we know how alcohol advertising promotes lifestyle choices. If anyone is listening to the debate, they might therefore get a whiff of hypocrisy from what we are saying.</p><p>I heard a lot about quality control, although I do not think that everyone talked about support for testing. The initiative in Wales was mentioned, and I support such an approach. It is hugely important that people can make informed choices about everything that they do.</p><p>Injecting is a small part of the picture, we are told. In a previous debate, which has been mentioned, I talked about supervision of injecting, which is a significant way of reducing harm, not just for individuals but for communities.</p><p>The SDF tells us that in the vast majority of cases no issues are reported. Labour&#8217;s amendment talks about promoting understanding, but will we get all the knowledge or just the downside? If examination of drugs shows that there are no ill effects, does that mean that they are okay?</p><p>There are challenges for the police, who at operational level have not always been supportive of approaches to harm reduction such as needle exchanges and searching people as they leave premises. I urge that there be no tokenism or quick publicity-seeking fixes to deal with head shops, which are a small part of a much bigger issue. Let us be pragmatic, not patronising.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22884031", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Psychoactive Substances"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As many colleagues have said, the issue is complicated, and we are all a bit wiser thanks to the briefings that we have had from a number of organisations.

Much has been said about the Equal Opportunities Committee. I thank our convener, Margaret McCulloch, for her comments and her r&#233;sum&#233; of the work that took place. I also thank our valuable committee staff, who were tremendously helpful in providing support to enable us to scrutinise the bill.</p><p>A lot of evidence was taken and, like many, I have had a lot of communications. Some of them have not been particularly measured and others have clearly indicated that they have not read the proposals, which is a bit disappointing.</p><p>Of particular interest was a line of emails that I got. As someone who has spent all but a handful of years in the Highlands&#8212;I was born, was brought up and live there&#8212;I found being told that I could not possibly be a Highlander or I would not support the bill to be quite dismissive of an entire population and, indeed, the geography of the place.</p><p>In many locations around the globe&#8212;sadly, 21st century Scotland is no different&#8212;people choose selective tracts from a book of their choice to support various things. That might be girls not being educated; women not being allowed to be doctors or to drive motor vehicles; the mode of dress that can be worn; boys and girls not being allowed to be educated in the same room; the races being segregated; children being beaten; interfaith and interrace marriages being banned; goats being thrown off towers to their deaths; and people who love each other not being allowed to marry.</p><p>There have been many entirely reasonably expressed views. I do not go for the hierarchy. We either believe in equality or we do not; there is no hierarchy within that.</p><p>I will quote two of the communications that I have had. One is from a monk in an abbey in the Highlands and Islands, who concludes by saying:</p><p>&#8220;Of course the main victims in your favoured legislation will be children&#8212;but they don&#8217;t vote, so obviously can be safely ignored&#8221;.</p><p>I have to say that I will be safely ignoring that gentleman.</p><p>I commend the approach to children that is taken by Stonewall Scotland, which says:</p><p>&#8220;Existing law already states, rightly, that all decisions on adoption or fostering must be based on the best interests of the child. Stonewall Scotland agrees that prospective foster carers and adoptive parents should not be rejected solely because of their views on same-sex marriage. We do believe, however, that potential adoptive parents or foster carers should be assessed on whether they have a range of skills to support looked after children, including those who may grow up to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender or may be experiencing homophobic or transphobic bullying.&#8221;</p><p>What a contrast between the views of that proponent of faith adherence and the support that we have had in the way of briefings from equality groups.</p><p>Similarly, like other members, I have received a communication from a Free Presbyterian minister, who says:</p><p>&#8220;If you ignore this warning&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>the warning not to support the bill&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;I am clear from complicity of you dying in your iniquity.&#8221;</p><p>He adds that his</p><p>&#8220;conscience will be purged from any involvement in the national sin.&#8221;</p><p>I have news for the Rev Campbell: I am going to die, and my death certificate will not state that the cause of death was iniquity or involvement in the national sin.</p><p>To those sadly loveless communicants, I say that I, too, can quote from a book. The book that I will quote from says:</p><p>&#8220;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.&#8221;</p><p>A lot has been made of statistics, and Jackie Baillie has alluded to the social attitudes survey. To me, it is not about who can get the bigger gang together but about which group values equality more. We have heard about the civil registrars and the contrast with the faith adherents, but who would want to get married in a situation involving duress anyway?</p><p>It is quite clear to me that one person&#8217;s morality is another person&#8217;s prejudice. I am sad to say that we have heard a lot of prejudice in relation to this bill. As I have said before, I do not think that there can be any caveats in relation to equality.</p><p>We have an opportunity to make history. Not many people get that. There have been vital votes on franchise and slavery, and the future analysis of that has been important. James Dornan will be seen to have acted to make a difference.</p><p>I have one final quote&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the various groups that provided briefings for the debate.

Although there have been some economic gains in middle-income countries, they have not resulted in lifting many people out of poverty.</p><p>In the report, Oxfam mentions the political leadership in the United Kingdom. I hope that members of the Scottish Parliament and the other devolved institutions will see that there is a clear supporting role for them, too.</p><p>With regard to equality, Oxfam mentions the need to</p><p>&#8220;Put tackling inequality at the heart of decision making&#8221;,</p><p>&#8220;Address the unfair UK and global tax rules that fuel inequality&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;Promote universal free public health care and education services to tackle inequality&#8221;.</p><p>There are other points, but I will move on to climate change, given the limited time that I have.</p><p>Oxfam encourages investment in a low-carbon future, which I hope that we would all support. It refers to the UK, but that is for Scotland, the UK and the planet. Oxfam asks us to invest in climate resilience and low-carbon development overseas and to</p><p>&#8220;Promote ambitious global agreements on climate change&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;sustainable energy access&#8221;.</p><p>Positive moves on that have happened in the Parliament, but we should not be complacent.</p><p>The world produces enough food for everyone, yet one in eight people&#8212;840 million people&#8212;go to bed hungry each night. It is estimated that climate change could increase child malnutrition by 20 per cent, which would eliminate improvements that might otherwise occur through campaigns such as this one. A damning statistic is that, for every $6 of subsidy for fossil fuels, renewable energy enjoys only $1 of subsidy.</p><p>Oxfam is talking about, for example, an innovative dairy programme in Sri Lanka, a revolutionary rice-growing system in Liberia, and seed-growing co-operatives in Nepal. All those measures are designed to be catalysts to lift entire communities. Oxfam talks about smart aid and says that a concerted effort is needed to achieve the ripple effect of such good work. The important thing is to empower communities.</p><p>Oxfam talks about reappraising how aid works and seeing it as having transformative power rather than as a single short-term action. Aid helps people to build skills and help themselves. That approach is at the heart of what Oxfam does and has done for many years. We have all been involved in gifting a goat, a hen or bags of seeds and the like. Oxfam believes&#8212;it is rather harsh on itself&#8212;that it has not communicated that model of growth particularly well.</p><p>Oxfam notes that, in the past 10 years, 50 million more children in Africa have benefited from education, which is at the root of all our potential for improvement. It refers to how the global fund to tackle HIV, which blights the continent of Africa, is saving 3,000 lives a day and how debt cancellation has released millions of pounds for positive work in the countries affected&#8212;although many of us feel that countries could go a lot further on debt cancellation.</p><p>Oxfam does not just work abroad. There are fine examples from its work across Scotland. Govan features a lot in that&#8212;it is where Tea in the Pot; the GalGael Trust, which builds the wonderful traditional sailing boats that we have seen; and Sunny Govan radio are based. In my part of the world, Lochboisdale Amenity Trust is undertaking an interesting project to fund the purchase of trees for crofters to create shelter belts on fenced crofts and common grazings and for amenity planting. Oxfam is involved with partner agencies in making grants.</p><p>The mother appeal will give mothers worldwide the lift that they need to use their power to change the future. I think that we all agree that mothers are a powerful motivating group not only in their families but in their communities. The hope is to raise &#163;10 million, and the UK Government has said that it will match up to &#163;5 million donations that are made before 31 March and sales of items that are donated before then and sold before the end of April. I do not often praise the UK Government, but it is to be complimented on that and on retaining the overseas aid budget.</p><p>A new vocabulary, certainly for me, is associated with the campaign. There is shwopping&#8212;I hope that I have pronounced that correctly&#8212;which means bringing an old item of clothing into a Marks and Spencer store each time that something new is bought. All such clothing goes to Oxfam. I am told that items are placed in a shwop drop box. I am sure that adequate instructions will be available for anyone who wishes to help.</p><p>The appeal is targeting projects in Bangladesh, Tajikistan and Zambia. We all understand that there is a range of problems there and that it is important that we provide assistance.</p><p>Oxfam has a wide community and it is well known across Scotland. It provides statistics on and a breakdown of income from its shops. I am delighted that the shop in Oban town, where I used to live, features in the top 10 of shops. Oxfam has a breakdown of its record shops, clothes shops, bookshops and the like.</p><p>Oxfam quotes an interesting survey from last year, in which people said that supporting a charity uplifts their spirits. I hope that we will all take the opportunity to have our spirits uplifted in coming years and that we will all support this good campaign.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lift Lives for Good"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests as a member of Amnesty.

I would certainly favour such an approach.

As I said in my intervention, I see no threat in people understanding their human rights fully. In the longer term, problems will arise if people do not know their rights. If the national action plan is properly implemented, people should be pushing at an open door with authority to ensure that their rights are being respected.</p><p>We cannot say often enough that those rights are dignity, equality, freedom, autonomy and respect. Indeed, the PANEL&#8212;participation, accountability, non-discrimination, empowerment and legality&#8212;acronym has participation as a key element and there are opportunities with things such as consultative budgets and, as members have alluded to, the opportunity to participate in the compilation of our constitution, which has adopted a rights-based approach.</p><p>Accountability is the next element, and the Parliament has been criticised for not having a human rights committee and not appearing to address human rights issues overtly when we know that they are being addressed. Perhaps we need to be a bit more explicit about that.</p><p>Non-discrimination is the third PANEL element. We all have interests in particular areas. Ms Marra is genuinely interested in and concerned about the issue of female genital mutilation, and who would not be? Others, like myself, are interested in Gypsy Travellers, Roma, and blacklisting, all of which are important aspects that we have to pick up on.</p><p>Empowerment is very important, and we need to be alert to the role that advocacy plays in that, and how often it is the first thing that local authorities cut in these pressing times.</p><p>The national action plan will be relevant regardless of the outcome of the referendum, although I note that the report says that progress has been made since devolution, and it identifies the next steps. The minister rightly points out that we have a strong legal framework.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, Alex Johnstone referred to the deserving and undeserving as viewed in rights.

We will have an opportunity to address that in the coming months.</p><p>Health and social care has been touched on, and I think that independent living is a clear issue, as is the fact that the ever-present dignity and acknowledgement of the individual should be key to any care package.</p><p>The minister is right to talk about the Government&#8217;s commitment to abolishing homelessness, and that is very positive, but it has to be delivered in practice. However, the challenges remain for people such as prisoners who are released without a home to go to and who have difficulty in accessing medical treatment because general practitioners will not treat certain individuals who have addiction issues.</p><p>The action plan has a vision of a Scotland in which everyone is able to live with human dignity, and I do not believe that anyone will dissent from that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22798433", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Rights"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I congratulate the Scottish Human Rights Commission on the publication of its national action plan.

I was delighted to hear the minister talk about the human-rights based approach that will be taken.</p><p>I want to comment on some research by the Scottish Drugs Forum, which looked at the life stories of 55 people: people, not statistics. The main aim of that research was to record and understand the life stories of problem drug users; we have heard many examples of what came out of that. It is compelling that the interviewers were SDF volunteers who were addicts in recovery. I commend that approach, which was also used in SDF&#8217;s naloxone peer-educator initiative.</p><p>I was delighted that the research covered urban and rural Scotland, because the problem is not limited to the central belt&#8212;it covers the entire nation, unfortunately. It will come as no surprise to anyone that most problem drug users are from disadvantaged neighbourhoods and are personally disadvantaged. There is no doubt in my mind that antipoverty policies and the promotion of equality, in terms of income disparity, have the potential to make a significant impact.</p><p>We heard from members that an association between problem drug use and deprivation is worsened by stigmatisation. I find such stigmatisation to be particularly galling when it comes from people who systematically abuse alcohol, as it often does. There is almost a strange snobbery associated with that.</p><p>Many of the 55 people talked about significant childhood problems, including anxiety and attention deficit, hyperactivity and conduct disorders. I hope that the getting it right for every child approach will catch that. Anne McTaggart&#8217;s comments about education were very important, and I certainly commend the patient-journey approach, which looks at where interventions could have made a difference.</p><p>We heard in the research that using alcohol and drugs relatively heavily from a relatively young age happens usually in the context of socialising and having fun. In a previous debate I mentioned to the health minister the cynical targeting by social media that is taking place, which is a significant problem; alcohol promotion&#8212;whether peer promotion or global promotion&#8212;is something that we need to address.</p><p>We hear of the multiagency approach to everything, which is fine; however, local authorities and housing associations face challenges in having to deal with competing issues including provision of housing to people who have drug addiction issues and the disruption that can sometimes result. We need to address that and we need to address GPs refusing access to people because of their addictions.</p><p>Of course, many addicts are not bothered or concerned about the implications of what they do and will experiment with so-called legal highs because they feel that they have nothing to live for. We also have to remember that many of them are victims of the violence that is associated with the street drugs trade.</p><p>I am particularly concerned about the problem of estrangement from families and about difficulties with care and custody of, and access to, children. We should work very hard to keep family units together and social work departments&#8212;rightly&#8212;take a child-centred approach to such matters.</p><p>I, too, support methadone as an important part of the process. It is regarded as an essential aid on the road to recovery, offering the possibility of improvement, increased stability and&#8212;significantly for me&#8212;a reduced need for street drugs. Interestingly, the SDF research also highlighted difficulties in getting and keeping a methadone prescription. In my earlier intervention on the minister, I asked about the patchwork of services and I certainly think that there should not be any no-go areas&#8212;including Argyll in my region, where thus far ignorance has prevailed. However, I think that NHS Highland is going to ensure that the full range of services that should be available to all citizens will be available.</p><p>I want to raise with the minister an issue that has previously been raised by my colleague Patrick Harvie about diamorphine, which as we know is a controlled drug but can be prescribed for treatment of drug misuse and addiction. In the response to Mr Harvie&#8217;s written parliamentary question, the cabinet secretary Alex Neil said:</p><p>&#8220;Such decisions should be based on individual patient need and are a matter for the clinical judgement of the patient&#8217;s doctor&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 18 November 2013; S4W-17911]</p><p>The fact that no licensing requests have been made might be connected with an understanding that such a move would be a departure from Government policy, but I want nothing to be ruled out in terms of assisting people who have drug issues, including the prescribing of heroin on a harm-reduction basis. Of course, that would need to be assessed, but I would welcome either ministers&#8217; comments on the matter. Of course, the same goes for the very challenging approach of supervised injection, which also has a role in harm reduction, and street-drug analysis. There is no doubt that our harm reduction people often deal with very challenging individuals and disruptive lifestyles, so anything that can be done to help is worth trying. I therefore ask ministers to consider such initiatives.</p><p>A very compelling phrase in the SDF research was about</p><p>&#8220;maximising what people can recover to.&#8221;</p><p>People must have something to aspire to; with compassion, understanding and care, we can make things better for them.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22768223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Expert Review of Opioid Replacement Therapies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the broad consensus that we have heard, and which I hope will continue.

For me, there is little more important than equality and fairness and, for that reason, I fully endorse the bill.</p><p>A number of members have talked about changed attitudes. That is reflected in attitudes to gender, disability, race and sexual orientation. As a police officer who commenced work in the mid-1970s, I learned laws about homosexuality that seem bizarre and are totally unacceptable nowadays.</p><p>The Equality Network&#8217;s recent briefing says that marriage equality &#8220;matters to LGBT people&#8221;. That is very apparent, and we have heard powerful testimonies from Ruth Davidson, Marco Biagi, Kevin Stewart, Jim Eadie and other members.</p><p>I have received many communications from people of faith and I hope that I showed that I was respectful of their views. Those views were clearly individual ones. There were individual interpretations individually made from self-selected sources.</p><p>I am sure that the faith groups recognise that attitudes have changed, not least to things such as mixed-race marriages and divorcees. If members check the Official Report, they will see that Professor John Curtice talked about the</p><p>&#8220;liberalisation of attitudes even among regular worshippers.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 19 September 2013; c 1518.]</p><p>It is clear that there is no requirement to marry same-sex couples and that protection is afforded to faith groups by article 9 of the ECHR. I, for one, commend the legislative co-operation with the UK Government on aspects of that. I hope that faith groups will participate at some future point, and I commend the humanists, Quakers, Unitarians, liberal Jews and others.</p><p>Not much has been said about registrars; I thought that more would have been said about them. They are public servants and should complete public duty. We would not tolerate people saying that they would not participate in conducting a mixed-race marriage so, frankly, they need to get on with it.</p><p>There has been a lot of talk about the nature of communications. Unlike Margaret Mitchell, I have not found opponents to be inhibited in any way in their contact with me. I have received individually written letters, mass postcards and personal representations. Some people have strange obsessions with physical acts. I found reading about some of them to be very uncomfortable. Like many others today, I got a communication that started, &#8220;Dear Frequent Sinner&#8221;. Uniquely, however, when I tried to explain things to someone in the range of other parliamentary work, I got back, &#8220;Nice work, Satan.&#8221; It is important to recognise that there are genuine, strongly held views on both sides and that those remarks are not representative of all the faith organisations.</p><p>Other members have touched on the issues that the Scottish Transgender Alliance raised; time will not permit me to go into them. I commend the cabinet secretary for his comment that he will think further about those issues. There are a number of issues and they are challenging to discuss, not least the age aspect, but I was reassured by what I heard from the cabinet secretary at the Equal Opportunities Committee and I look forward to those issues being addressed.</p><p>The future will not be without challenges, but it must be without prejudice. The bill will make Scotland fairer and more equal and, I hope, an enlightened and inclusive nation.

However, politics is about priorities and competing demands, and it is evident that the motor lobby has a very strong voice that has been listened to.</p><p>I am disappointed that there has been no mention of ferries, which are a vital part of our infrastructure. Given the fact that the motion talks about &#8220;strategic transport networks&#8221;, it is strange that there has been no mention of ferries. There is good news for the Scottish Government in relation to the Raasay ferry, which has an innovative design and was built in Scotland. I would like to see that replicated, with a replacement programme that would put our shipbuilding yards to some constructive use, and an enhanced, less polluting fleet.</p><p>I was heartened to hear the minister say that he is keen to encourage people to move from road to rail. Of course, the practicalities of rail travel will shape people&#8217;s view on whether it is worth while. I received a detailed email from a constituent who travelled twice on the Inverness to Aberdeen line at the weekend. He outlined the various challenges connected with his journey and said that</p><p>&#8220;26 got on at Insch, 50 at Inverurie and 15 at Dyce. We became a sardines tin!&#8221;</p><p>That is good news in that plenty of use is being made of the service, but he had a similar experience on the return journey. That raises the question why, 10 years after we were promised that the short platforms at Elgin and Insch would be lengthened, that has not happened. That is what people are interested in&#8212;they want practical opportunities to use rail.</p><p>As things stand, it is quicker to use the train than to travel by road between Inverness and Aberdeen. It is, therefore, disappointing that the Scottish Government seems intent on reversing the position with its plans to dual the A96. How does that square with the minister&#8217;s assertion that he wants to encourage people to move from road to rail? A cost benefit analysis must be done on that. The phrase &#8220;modal shift&#8221; is used a lot, not just about freight, but about passengers. What analysis is done? We must make rail an attractive option, and part of doing so will involve considering how it integrates with other policies&#8212;not just transport policies, but policies on the environment and planning. For example, how transport links with developments such as those at Kishorn will be important.</p><p>Reference has been made to the briefings that members have received. I will talk about the one from Friends of the Earth Scotland in the context of the damage that air pollution does to health. We all want to encourage more cycling and walking as well as more and better public transport, but those things will require less traffic.</p><p>The minister&#8217;s mention of retrofitting is welcome. That is a practical example of what we should encourage: inspecting, repairing and replacing in that order, not going straight to replacing.</p><p>Unusually for me, I will commend something from the United States. Smart Growth America, which is on the internet&#8212;I can show the link to the minister&#8212;has carried out research that says:</p><p>&#8220;Public transportation investments generate 31 percent more jobs per dollar than new construction of roads and bridges, and repair work on roads and bridges generates 16 percent more jobs per dollar than new bridge and road construction.&#8221;</p><p>The research goes on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Fixing existing infrastructure produces a higher return on investment than new construction because repair:</p><p>&#8226;prevents the need for reconstruction later, which costs 4 to 14 times as much;</p><p>&#8226;saves money by reducing damage from potholes and vibrations;</p><p>&#8226;Keep existing communities vibrant. Neglecting existing places while building new infrastructure drives growth out, and means the public ends up buying two of everything.&#8221;</p><p>I do not think that we have the money for &#8220;new construction&#8221;, so I commend the inspect, repair and replace approach.</p><p>Mention has been made of the Borders rail line. It is welcome and a good example of consensus being built. In a previous debate, I also commended the additional Oban to Glasgow rail service, with which there is excellent connectivity.</p><p>Members talked about shift, but the shift will require infrastructure. Members also talked about the north rail line. It is now at capacity and I understand that that is why freight now goes east and south, rather than west and south.</p><p>Rail and cycle hubs are very important, too, but their design is important. The right design must form part of the franchise so that there are storage areas for cycles and other things. I have been in touch with the minister on those matters.</p><p>The national cycle network is very much to be welcomed.

The briefing from Citizens Advice Scotland says that tribunals are the facet of the justice system that people are most likely to access. If people are going to access tribunals, they must be accessible and I concur with CAS and others that the purpose of tribunals should be on the face of the bill. Citizens Advice Scotland suggests various principles to ensure that the practice and procedure of tribunals is accessible, such as placing users at the core of tribunals. The policy memorandum says:</p><p>&#8220;The Bill has no differential impact upon island or rural communities.&#8221;</p><p>That will be the case, but I hope that technology can be embraced, in conjunction with the courts and public services, to ensure accessibility.</p><p>CAS says that tribunals should be fair, expeditious and just. That will require adequate resourcing. Like many members, I do not favour the resourcing coming by way of fees, which would affect people&#8217;s access. CAS also suggests that a safeguard must be provided to ensure that the spirit of tribunals and the distinctive nature of individual tribunals will be maintained. Many speakers have covered that point. We know that there is a unique range of not only subjects but manners in which those subjects are dealt with. CAS says that the bill should provide a framework of defining principles to frame the development of new tribunals. We have heard from the minister that there is a feeling that the framework is adequately loose&#8212;if I can use that term&#8212;to absorb future tribunals.</p><p>The principles that CAS suggests would help to mitigate the lack of detail about procedure on the face of the bill by guaranteeing a minimum standard to which all Scottish tribunals should operate. Its suggestions are not at all unreasonable and I hope that they can be considered.</p><p>Much has been made of the special case that the Lands Tribunal for Scotland believes that it is. That is certainly not my view. It said that it does</p><p>&#8220;not really fit in with the scheme.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 3 September 2013; c 3112.]</p><p>In a written response, the minister told the committee that all the tribunals are unique; I would not place one above any of the others. The Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland has been referred to&#8212;it can deprive someone of their liberty. There are also challenges associated with the additional support needs tribunal. All the tribunals are important and should be treated similarly.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s view on the postponement of the inclusion of reserved tribunals is that it would welcome the inclusion of the other tribunals, although our report acknowledged that this is something that</p><p>&#8220;is not entirely in the hands of the Scottish Government&#8221;.</p><p>I do not think that it is in the hands of the Scottish Government at all. The report went on to urge the Scottish Government</p><p>&#8220;to work with the UK Government to ensure ... early progress&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>we have heard that those discussions are on-going&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;and to examine closely whether the Bill as drafted will create any barriers to the future inclusion of reserved tribunals&#8221;,</p><p>not that we identified any.</p><p>I welcome the significant role that tribunals play in civic Scotland and the oversight provided by the Lord President. My early intervention on the minister about the appointment of the tribunals president is not about an individual&#8212;far from it. The Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the committee&#8217;s report says:</p><p>&#8220;The position is not a stand-alone appointment&#8212;it is an assignment by the Lord President. ... The President of Scottish Tribunals has to be a senior person from within the Lord Presidents judicial complement as they will have the responsibility for managing the Upper Tribunal which will be made up of Senators, Sheriffs Principal and Sheriffs as well as Chamber Presidents&#8221;.</p><p>There is a debate about appointment versus assignment. How does someone become assigned? Roderick Campbell talked about opening up the field, but how do we do that if we do not know the field&#8217;s boundaries? I do not think it is unreasonable to ask for a job description which, in many respects, is given in the Government&#8217;s response to the committee. Public appointments should have a post and person specification. It is not about personalities but about public confidence and about judicial and senior circles in Scotland not being seen as some sort of exclusive club. The committee commended the idea of extending the pool of eligible candidates.</p><p>I welcome the minister&#8217;s response on the use of the term &#8220;judge&#8221;. We want the tribunals to act independently and make their own decisions, but implying wigs and gowns might be intimidating and off-putting to tribunal users. I think that that is the case. The tribunal should be a forum for the lay person, but that certainly is not my experience of employment tribunals. I go along with a lot of what Elaine Murray said about the changes that have taken place there, and I would add to that the issues of increased qualifying periods of one to two years, the fees, reduction in compensation and judges sitting alone. If we come to inherit the employment tribunal, we would be going to what has certainly become a different beast in recent years. I think that there would be an opportunity for the Scottish Parliament to reinstate some of the fairness and opportunity with control of employment law.</p><p>The issue of specialisms has been mentioned. There is another human resource term that should apply, which is succession planning. The explanatory notes to the bill state that</p><p>&#8220;the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland ... currently has 332 members ... the Scottish Charity Appeals Tribunals ... has 19.&#8221;</p><p>Further on, table 3 refers to:</p><p>&#8220;Projection of number of members approaching 70, and number of resignations&#8221;.</p><p>I certainly do not favour age discrimination. I think that people should hold a job on the basis of competence. One of the ways to deal with the issue is not to invest specialism in individuals but ensure that knowledge is widely spread by having succession planning systems.</p><p>I will conclude by again mentioning Citizens Advice Scotland, which said something that I think we can all go along with: the needs of the user must be placed at the centre of the process.

Some astonishing figures have been quoted, such as the fact that 23 per cent of convictions are for breach of the peace.</p><p>The Scottish Government is keen on preventative spend, and I certainly warmed to much of what Anne McTaggart said about how that approach could be adopted on the issue of offenders. We have high police numbers, the crime rate is at a 37-year low and reoffending is down. The other day, I saw a picture in the local paper of a PC Macleod in a primary 1 class&#8212;I point out that he was instructing rather than participating. We have campus cops. The role of education is important, because all the evidence shows that offenders have majorly underachieved in relation to numeracy and literacy and that they lack communication skills, which often contributes to their offending behaviour.</p><p>Like many others, I was delighted that, last year, Scottish Government officials held discussions with a range of people. They have come up with the notion that the system is not fit for purpose.

Apex Highland, with which I have a lot of dealings, certainly does tremendous work in assisting people who face many challenges, and it values them as individuals.

Indeed, I have personally sat in on one of the acupuncture group sessions, which I found very therapeutic. There are wee magnets that go in your lugs.</p><p>Apex Highland plays an important role in relation to the jobcentre. The need for enlightened employers was alluded to. Organisations such as Apex are involved in community projects. On more than one occasion, I have been asked to present the users of the service with certificates. That might be the only occasion on which those people have been given anything by way of a reward, and they genuinely value it. Also, the community genuinely values the work that they do. Hopefully, it leads to gainful employment with enlightened employers.</p><p>We need co-ordination across the public sector. That means between the UK Government with regard to benefits, the Scottish Government with regard to support for the third sector, the Scottish Prison Service and local authorities, within which we need co-ordination between housing and criminal justice social work. It should be no surprise to anyone when someone leaves prison. That should have been prepared for, which should mean that a fundamental right, namely the right to housing, is catered for.

Many of those new age travellers are now back working in the City of London, but the stopping-off places remain blocked off, and the vested interests are keen for that to remain the case.</p><p>There is a place for talk and for strategies, but I am interested in practical solutions. When a site is blocked off, it is done by placing a handful of large boulders. If the Scottish Government is genuinely interested in maintaining the &#8220;traditional way of life&#8221; of the Gypsy Travellers, as it says it is in its response, it will play its part in making available some of those sites. I accept that not all the sites are in public ownership, but it seems to me that the transport minister could get in touch with Transport Scotland and the local authority minister could get in touch with councils. To me, that would be a wee bit more proactive than the examining that we have been promised. It would also have the benefit of showing leadership to other landowners.</p><p>Bulldozed tracks cover the hills of the Highlands and farmers have the status called &#8220;permitted development&#8221;.

There are three permanent ones in the Highland Council area: one is built on a rubbish tip, one is in a sand quarry and the other is in a stone quarry.

I want us to be a society that cares about, and is compassionate towards, victims and witnesses.</p><p>With my background as a police officer, I know only too well that police officers, procurators fiscal and court officials routinely deal with witnesses and victims. However, we forget at our peril that, for many victims and witnesses, it is a unique experience and their first engagement with those services. There are, of course, particular challenges associated with repeat victims.</p><p>Since my time, the police and the Crown have made huge progress with regard to domestic abuse and sexual crimes. There is still a way to go on those, and the bill will play its part, although it is not without some challenges.</p><p>There has been much discussion in the debate about giving witnesses and victims the right to certain information. The Justice Committee supported that call and the proposal for an online hub. Like others, I am grateful for the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response to the stage 1 report, which suggested that the online hub was not intended as a replacement for human contact. There is no substitute for an empathetic human. Let us also not forget that the needs of those who are not online must also be serviced.</p><p>The phrase &#8220;Clear standards of service&#8221; has been mentioned. Often, unintended offence is caused to victims by the manner in which information is or&#8212;more commonly&#8212;is not relayed. Such information can relate to changes of plea, charges being dropped and the accused being released on bail, for example.</p><p>The children&#8217;s commissioner gave the committee an excellent document&#8212;&#8220;Children&#8217;s Rights Impact Assessment: The SCCYP Model&#8221;&#8212;in which he refers to the standards of service and the fact that there is no mention of their being monitored, evaluated or reported on. I note that, in his response to the stage 1 report, the cabinet secretary said that there would be individual standards. I am sure that the committee will want to look further into that.</p><p>I see no intrusion into the rights of the accused. A presumption of innocence must apply. The bill certainly passes the human rights test and is not in conflict with human rights legislation.</p><p>There are degrees of vulnerability. No one welcomes standing in a court and, as is often the case, being required to point out the accused. Most will feel vulnerable. The presumption that certain categories of person are more vulnerable and given the right to use special measures is important. I welcome it, and I also welcome the witness assessment.</p><p>However, there is no point in assessing need unless we meet it. One way that we will move towards meeting the need is the commitment from the Scottish Court Service in the past couple of weeks to make facilities for special measures available throughout the country. That is to be welcomed.</p><p>The Justice Committee asked the Scottish Government</p><p>&#8220;to make every effort to ensure that removal of the presumption that child witnesses under the age of 12 will give evidence away from the court building does not lead to the unintended consequence of children giving evidence in court against their will.&#8221;</p><p>That illustrates the differing views. The cabinet secretary has given the following reassurance:</p><p>&#8220;The Bill makes a small amendment to put more weight on the views of the child so that if a child expresses a desire to give evidence in court&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>and some do, along with their parents&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;there will be a presumption that this will be allowed.&#8221;</p><p>The correspondence from the victims organisations collaboration forum Scotland has been mentioned by some members, such as Alison McInnes, so I will not go into detail on that. I reiterate that the forum has a genuine concern about the right to appeal the use of special measures and calls for the removal of certain provisions from the bill. I note that, in his response to the stage 1 report, the cabinet secretary advises us that he is discussing that with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. It is an important issue, and I hope that there is a positive response to the forum&#8217;s specific concerns.</p><p>Committee members have alluded to the harrowing first-hand testimony that we heard from victims about the traumatic and long-lasting effects on them and their families, friends and entire communities, and the health and wellbeing implications for them. No one wants to be a victim or a witness, and I am delighted that the 40-year low in the level of crime means that there are fewer victims, but there is of course no room for complacency.</p><p>We also heard about the discussion of the terms &#8220;complainer&#8221; versus &#8220;victim&#8221;. I support and encourage others to support the position of the children&#8217;s commissioner that child victims must be believed and they are believed by being given that tag. Perhaps the committee became more hooked up on that point than the general public would be.</p><p>In recent days, I have written to the justice secretary and the health secretary asking for Victim Support Scotland to play a lead role in implementing the legislation. It is important that that organisation is involved from the very start. Police liaison officers have a specific case-related role to discharge, and it is not a criticism of that role to say that it is not the same as the hands-on, practical role that VSS can and should have.</p><p>As members know, VSS administers the victims&#8217; fund for harrowing cases to provide for things such as a replacement bed for a rape victim or glasses for an older person who has been the victim of a robbery. That is an important early contact for victims, and I would put it in line with the preventative spend that the Scottish Government is following. If we can get the issues right, the cost of individual and family health and employment can be dealt with. That will come if we provide adequate support.</p><p>There is a range of other issues, but I do not have time to touch on them. It is fair to say that there are challenges connected with the information technology system and the support that it can give to victims. Graeme Pearson&#8217;s comments on that are right. There are also particular challenges in the issue of gender-specific interviewers, not least in rural areas.</p><p>I support the principles of the bill, and I look forward to scrutinising it at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694151", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "How we deal with victims and witnesses marks the sort of society that we are.

As we heard in the minister&#8217;s very positive response, and as we read in the committee report, local authorities are working collaboratively. We also know that good work is happening in the voluntary sector.</p><p>The report reflects the good work that continues to take place, on a consensual and factual basis, among members of the Equal Opportunities Committee. For that reason, I was very disappointed by Alex Johnstone&#8217;s speech. If the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party&#8217;s view is that homelessness is a lifestyle choice, that just shows how out of touch the Tories are.</p><p>When the committee took up its inquiry, I was very keen that we should not lose the rural dimension&#8212;I frequently go on about that&#8212;so I was delighted that we took evidence from Highland Homeless Trust. We heard the strategic line from Dr Paul Monaghan, we heard the front-line manager&#8217;s view from Gordon Fleming and, most important, we heard the first-hand experiences of residents Julia Edgar, Matthew Friess and Rhea Nicholson. We heard, similarly, from residents from Quarriers.</p><p>The rural dimension is no different from the urban dimension, in that if someone does not have a house, they do not have a house. It is very simple. However, in rural areas, services are invariably centralised and the absence of wider support from the community or family can lead to many challenges. We heard about the challenges for Rhea Nicolson&#8217;s mother, who is a single parent, and that, because of benefits implications, Rhea could no longer stay with her. That is part of a vicious welfare attack, which we heard about from Linda Fabiani and others.</p><p>Family breakdown has been mentioned a lot, although overcrowding has not been mentioned so much. I have similar experience to that of Dick Lyle. As a councillor, I represented the largest area of social housing in the north of Scotland. Highland Council has 11,000 people on its waiting list and there are 36 communities that have no single-bedroom accommodation whatever. Overcrowding is a significant issue. I had officials consider house design to see whether something could be done. When three generations of a family live in a two-bedroom house, there will be tensions, regardless of the other circumstances.</p><p>Support services are terribly important, as is mediation. The report talks about linking mediation with respite, perhaps because mediation has a greater potential to fail if it is not coupled with respite. It is important that a risk assessment is done. The getting it right for every child philosophy is important and it should apply across the board. In my experience, housing was not always taken into account, which was disappointing, given that we all have to live somewhere. I hope that that has changed, because a residence is as important to a child as it is to an adult, and the same pressures are brought to bear. Under GIRFEC, the wellbeing of the child and young person is at the centre of everything. If we have that in mind, we will not go too far wrong.</p><p>Truancy is an issue, and I see a positive role for the police in supporting other agencies with it. That would be not a punitive role, but a child protection role.</p><p>Throughcare and aftercare have been referred to. We are all corporate parents. The situation that has occurred of corporate parents leading their child to the service point to have them declared homeless does not seem to me to be the appropriate way to go about business. The report refers to the comment from the Scottish Council for Single Homeless that it is not a surprise when someone leaves care. Good grief! We all plan, and if we cannot plan for vulnerable people who are in our care, there is a problem. Local authorities are critical of the way in which individuals have conducted themselves with regard to families, so perhaps a bit of introspection is important, too.</p><p>The Scottish Government has talked about strengthening the legislation on vulnerable groups, which is to be welcomed. We have heard many comments about the life-skills deficiencies and lack of educational attainment that are often associated with looked-after children. Those issues are a corporate responsibility.</p><p>The committee clerks asked for updates from various participants in the inquiry. I would not normally discuss individual cases, but some people were happy to report and give us an update. Julia Edgar and Rhea Nicolson, who come from the Highlands, have moved from supported accommodation to take up tenancies. We all know the challenges that are associated with that&#8212;the issue is often not just housekeeping, but door-keeping&#8212;but they continue to receive support, which is important, and are doing relatively well, which I would say is not bad in this day and age. Matthew Friess, who also gave evidence, is still in supported accommodation and fancies a career in politics. He has not nailed his colours to any particular mast, but he was impressed with the Parliament building.</p><p>The Highland Homeless Trust welcomed the Scottish Government&#8217;s amendment to legislation that creates new duties to assess households and to meet needs. There are challenges with the community care grant. As many members have said, collaborative work with the third sector is important. I commend the work of New Start Highland, through which basic furnishing and starting packs are available, so that young people can move into semi-furnished, rather than unfurnished, accommodation. There is sometimes an important role for people to assist in a positive way, even with decoration. The additional moneys to the Scottish welfare fund are to be welcomed.</p><p>It is apparent that the issue crosses portfolios. Although it is probably appropriate for the housing minister to be here, I know&#8212;from correspondence that we have received on this and other matters&#8212;that there is a recognition that the issue crosses portfolios. It would be wrong just to leave it to one minister.</p><p>Education has a key role to play. Reference was made to some programmes. One of them was called &#8220;on the money&#8221; and the other was called &#8220;skint&#8221;. One was for young folk and the other was for old folk. It is clear that skint is the more appropriate one at this time.</p><p>On prevention, building houses will prevent homelessness. It is a long-term approach and only part of the solution, but I would like to see a massive house-building programme. There are communities the length and breadth of Scotland that lack single-bedroom accommodation and so face the problems that are associated with that. A massive house-building programme would be a welcome boost to local economies.</p><p>On housing options and overcrowding, many people in the council area that I represented previously were in two-bedroom houses. There was overcrowding there, so it is clear that more houses and a better range of houses would play an important role in keeping families together.</p><p>I look forward to support from across the chamber&#8212;including from Mr Johnstone&#8212;on addressing the issue of removal of housing benefit for people who are in education. It is crucial that we have active progress for people who are moving on.</p><p>I commend the response to the report.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Having and Keeping a Home"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests as a director of Highland Homeless Trust.

I will come back to that.</p><p>Market fundamentalism&#8212;the price of everything and value of nothing&#8212;was touched on. Patrick Harvie talked about dependence on growth and the resource depletion, economic injustice and environmental crisis that that gives rise to. There was also mention of the &#163;70 billion of North Sea oil reserves.</p><p>The reality is that successive London Governments have continued Thatcher&#8217;s approach. The other day, the UK Prime Minister made the bizarre assertion that &#8220;we are all Thatcherites&#8221;. I do not think that that phrase has much resonance in Scotland. We will have an opportunity to change that approach.</p><p>The next speaker in the debate was the Minister for Local Government and Planning, who touched on society, internationalism and equality. If I noted down correctly what he said, it was that we should</p><p>&#8220;use the wealth to build a strong and fairer society.&#8221;</p><p>I think that we would all agree with that. The references that I heard seemed to reflect Oxfam&#8217;s humankind index.</p><p>Margo MacDonald intervened to encourage us all to think creatively, and thereafter the minister talked about Jimmy Reid. The debate would have been greatly enhanced had Mr Reid been here to contribute to it. Although he would share a lot of the views expressed, the present Government&#8217;s policy on corporation tax, for instance, would not enjoy his support&#8212;nor does it enjoy mine.</p><p>James Kelly gave an excellent speech&#8212;one of the best that we heard today. It was very much from the heart. He spoke about the implications for his neighbours and friends and talked about desolate lives. Hanzala Malik and Malcolm Chisholm also touched on the implications for the steel community.</p><p>Thereafter, Ruth Davidson talked about the living tapestry. I do not know whether that tapestry was intended to include the mining villages or the steelworkers&#8212;Christine Grahame alluded to that. If there was a tapestry, it was ripped apart in many communities.</p><p>I warmed to the speech that Alison McInnes gave. Thereafter we had Joan McAlpine, very much speaking for herself and no other man or woman. It was an excellent critique, in which she used the phrase</p><p>&#8220;all shock and no therapy&#8221;,</p><p>with which we can all readily identify.</p><p>A number of members, including Gordon MacDonald and Jamie Hepburn, spoke about communities, which clearly are societies. Elaine Murray made another excellent speech, in which she said that Mrs Thatcher believed that assertion trumped evidence. Certainly, Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s strident style lent itself to that.</p><p>John Lamont talked about pain, which was a very gracious acknowledgement. Mark McDonald picked up on that point when he talked about the analogy of &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; and the role of the state as being the bedrock in many instances. The story of Baxter Dick&#8217;s buggy was important and salutary, because I would look for Baxter to be provided with a buggy by the state rather than by the generosity of others through social media.</p><p>In the time that is left I will touch on a number of areas in which the legacy lives on, one of which is the banking industry, where unregulated greed has led us to the crisis we are in at the moment and obscene private profit has seen us all become bank owners. We did not use to, but we own two banks now&#8212;not that small businesses would be aware of that, because there is still a reluctance to lend to them.</p><p>Recently, the UK Prime Minster referred to equality impact assessments as &#8220;nonsense&#8221; and he takes a similar approach to health and safety, which is another example of the legacy living on. In the area of health and safety, reduced inspections, investigations and prosecutions can only make our workers and our workplaces more vulnerable.</p><p>There was a lot of discussion on housing and the sell-off of housing and Margo MacDonald&#8217;s point about the receipts, which others picked up on, is very relevant. With 11,000 folk on the waiting list in Highland, the overcrowding of properties, the absence of sufficient three-bedroom properties and a significant dearth of one-bedroom properties have all been compounded by the bedroom tax. I am sure that Mrs Thatcher would have been very proud of the bedroom tax. I for one am delighted that that is being addressed by an increase in social housing.</p><p>Ruth Davidson talked about nationalisation. We have fuel poverty in the energy-rich country of Scotland and a 10-year inquiry into SSE, which has refused to accept blame for ripping off customers despite the fact that it was fined &#163;10.5 million that has gone straight to the Treasury. That is an insignificant sum given the &#163;1.3 billion profit that it has made. That was a racket that was revealed by the regulator, the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets.</p><p>If we look at transport, the east coast service was being run very well by the state after two failed attempts by the private sector. After three years and &#163;600 million in premiums and profits, the plan is to return it to the private sector that failed on two occasions. I should say that that was without any reference to Scotland&#8217;s Minister for Transport and Veterans.</p><p>The greatest legacy of Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s era is probably in welfare. Most of us believe that there is a requirement to assess need and then put in place mechanisms to meet that need. Those mechanisms&#8212;I welcome the discussions that we have had on universalism&#8212;include progressive taxation to meet those needs. That would clearly rule out the recent reduction in the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p and it would also rule out cuts in corporation tax for multinationals.</p><p>Policing is another area in which we have a very clear assurance from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Scotland that there will be no privatisation. The police workforce terms and conditions have been protected. It is quite the reverse in England where we see a greater intrusion by the private sector into a very important public service, which is to be regretted.</p><p>We also have Virgin healthcare in the health service south of the border, where there will be an absence of public scrutiny because we will be told that it is a commercial and confidential deal. Similarly, the fact that Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust was declared bankrupt this week shows that the legacy is very much alive.</p><p>I turn to the question of attitudes and, unusually, find myself quoting Boris Johnson who said:</p><p>&#8220;Thatcherism was not about exalting the rich and grinding the faces of the poor. It was the exact opposite.&#8221;</p><p>My assertion is that successive London Governments have serviced Britain&#8217;s elites&#8212;the bankers, the public schools, the military and the arms dealers. There is an opportunity next year and, in the meantime, there is an opportunity for debate&#8212;as in Iceland&#8212;about a written constitution to enshrine and respect human rights, education and housing, and to ensure that our country is nuclear free and committed to no wars of aggression and that we have an elected head of state.</p><p>We all have a choice: the continuing mindless pursuit of self and wealth or the chance to prioritise the common good&#8212;because there is such a thing as society.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688868", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Society"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes, I certainly would be fully in support of nationalising, which I will come to later.

It is important for everyone who is elected to represent the public to articulate the concerns in their communities. Genuine and heartfelt concerns are properly being addressed today.</p><p>The motion asks whether lessons can be learned, and it is clear that they can be. I will not go over a lot of them; I will approach the issue from a slightly different and&#8212;given that Graeme Pearson is not here&#8212;perhaps unique position. I am a former police officer and former full-time official of the Scottish Police Federation, where my role was to defend people who were accused of misconduct and disciplinary offences.</p><p>What have been alleged are serious offences, which would be outwith the remit that I described and which the courts would&#8212;rightly&#8212;deal with. I certainly do not condone any wrongdoing, not just on a personal basis but because to do so would undermine the fabric of the criminal justice system.</p><p>There were 1,424 arrests, which is a significant number. Were they all superbly executed? That is highly unlikely. Neil Findlay asked in his questionnaire about fabricated, bogus or exaggerated charges, which are possible when emotions are high.</p><p>I found targeting of strike leaders to be perhaps the most concerning aspect. When we hear of the pernicious influence of the UK security services&#8212;the people who decide who the goodies and the baddies are&#8212;and subsequent events such as blacklisting, there is every likelihood that targeting took place.</p><p>I am keen to defend workers&#8217; right to strike. I favour the reversal of some of the anti-union laws on matters such as secondary action and picket numbers and locations. We must try to look ahead.</p><p>The situation in Scotland was different from that in South Yorkshire, but the situation in North Yorkshire was different from that in South Yorkshire. The Metropolitan Police&#8217;s negative influence was often a factor. However, there was United Kingdom co-ordination. People will say that that was about mutual aid and communications, but there was clearly politicisation of the police role, and that causes understandable concern to many people, including me.</p><p>I have a number of queries about having a review of all cases. I certainly favour&#8212;and I have briefly discussed this with Neil&#8212;due process being exhausted. That has been outlined. The questionnaire that was issued covers appeals, but does not say how many complained to the police and what the response was. Having said that, I well understand that miners would have good cause to believe that there would be little value in complaining, with the state having been involved in the miners&#8217; dispute to the extent that it was.</p><p>What form would a review take? Would competent witnesses be compellable? The right to not self-incriminate would apply to not only police officers, but miners. The relationship with the criminal justice system cannot be bypassed. If someone has done wrong, we have courts, not reviews, to deal with that. There is also the right to defend accusations that have been levied against someone who is dead. That applies to officers and mineworkers.</p><p>I am not reticent about challenging the authorities; indeed, I have been pursuing the issue of how one make an individual complaint against the Lord Advocate acting as an individual. Do I accept that there are issues to be addressed? Yes&#8212;if the process is exhausted. Do I think that a review of the whole event would help? Given what we have heard, it clearly would. Do I support an independent inquiry? Well, it depends on what that would mean.</p><p>My personal preference is for clarification of events rather than recrimination. Events elsewhere, whether in the north of Ireland or South Africa, show the benefit of truth and reconciliation, but that approach might be very challenging in this instance, because it is clear that the concerns that have been voiced are not going away.

I want to talk about the connection between people and the land, which is difficult to put down on paper the world over, whether we are talking about native Americans or aboriginal Australians. It is incumbent on legislators to shape policies that recognise that connection, whether with regard to the older people of north-west Sutherland not wishing to be institutionalised and coming up with models that will retain them in their own area, linked to the land, or with regard to crofting. Legislation on land reform has helped, but parliamentary draftspeople are not always capable of capturing the very essence of that relationship.</p><p>As a native Highlander and former police officer, I give the poaching laws as an example. Highlanders have great difficulty recognising that someone who is resident in London for 50 weeks of the year, or a multinational from the Netherlands, can own wild fish or wild deer, so it is important to remember that things have to be relevant.</p><p>The Highlands have a troubled history connected with land, and women have played a significant role in that history, for example M&#224;iri Mh&#242;r with her song &#8220;The Battle of the Braes&#8221;. The crofting legislation and land reform have helped, but as recent events in Harris have shown, we are not quite there yet. Attitudes of greed and ownership need to be resolved.</p><p>Crofting has a distinguished past and it has to have a distinguished future. The motion talks about crofts being</p><p>&#8220;a valuable source of high-health status animals for larger agricultural food producers&#8221;.</p><p>For me, the link to the local butcher is more important than that. Our earlier debate on food policy covered a lot of issues that affect crofters. Some of the things that were mentioned included the modern globalised food supply chain, an unsustainable food culture, the domination of multinational corporations, and community-driven initiatives. I think that we all recognise that the community around crofters is the one that we want to see promoted.</p><p>The motion also talks about the key role of crofters</p><p>&#8220;through the production of store animals for the agricultural supply chain&#8221;.</p><p>It is about quality and it is about staying local&#8212;it is vital for the planet that food production and consumption take place as close to each other as possible. The Scottish Government&#8217;s food policy recognises that.</p><p>The Scottish Crofting Federation produced a report in 2008 that prompted some discussion about the indigenous people of the Highlands and Islands. It contains a lot of pleasing radical language. It says that sustainable local agricultural systems such as crofting must be supported ahead of unsustainable agri-industry, which the UK Government would export, along with the environmental consequences for places overseas. It goes on to say that crofts have a vital role to play and that there is a fear in some quarters that the very idea of crofting is the subject of official hostility.</p><p>Other members have alluded to the fact that most crofters rely on common agricultural policy subsidies to earn a marginal income. In 2008, there was talk about the less favoured area support scheme, a policy that saw areas such as East Lothian and the Black Isle, with fine agricultural land, being treated the same as the rocky slopes of Harris, as the report mentions. Of course, the farmers in East Lothian and the Black Isle did not have second jobs&#8212;most crofters do. In Lochaber, I well remember neighbours who worked for the Forestry Commission having crofts and having time off to work on them.</p><p>We have moved on in some areas. There has been talk of efforts to remove the bull hire scheme, but that scheme will be retained. I hope that community use can be made of Knocknagael, where land is being freed, and ideally there will be a combination with what is in the existing plan.</p><p>Recent events on Raasay have led to a high level of interest in crofting. I ask people to act with good grace, in the terms that Dave Thomson outlined, in relation to those events. The situation was not ideal, but I think that the best has been made of it.

What people want are the services.</p><p>The cabinet secretary talked about the GIRFEC approach, which has certainly helped. More and more elements of the public sector are working together, although there is some way to go. We lose sight of the needs of citizens at our peril. An outcomes-based approach is a good way of addressing things.</p><p>Seeking economies of scale must not mean disregard for public sector workers&#8217; terms and conditions. It is important that we have a level playing field, whereby training, quality of work and sustainability are valued. Of course, best value does not mean the cheapest tender or the highest bid. I would be grateful if the minister could confirm that in his summing up, not least for the benefit of the crofters of Raasay.</p><p>Many politicians in local government have welcomed job evaluation, equal pay and the living wage. Therefore, I consider it rank hypocrisy for the same politicians to outsource public sector work to people on the minimum wage and poor terms and conditions. We know that, when the profits in the care sector went, some care sector providers went, too. What did not go was the statutory obligation of local authorities, along with the NHS, to meet the assessed needs of the people concerned.</p><p>Benchmarking has been touched on. There are complications with benchmarking when it comes to some of the work that is undertaken by the private sector, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>There is a procurement bill coming. I hope that due regard will be paid to the work that is undertaken on behalf of the public, particularly in the context of things such as equality policies, health and safety policies, and apprenticeships, which others have mentioned.</p><p>When it comes to the delivery of public services, I am unequivocal. I like them to be delivered first and foremost by public servants and secondly by the voluntary sector or social enterprises. They come well ahead of the private sector, because of their link to democratic accountability.</p><p>We must learn from elsewhere&#8212;I am thinking, in particular, of the NHS in England. With the previous UK Government&#8217;s foundation hospitals and the big spread of privatisation that is taking place at the moment, issues are arising to do with democratic accountability and freedom of information. Access to health board minutes is limited as they are being described as commercially confidential.</p><p>I suggest that we have a similar issue in Scotland with the arm&#8217;s-length organisations. I am sorry that the recent Freedom of Information (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill did not go far enough. If ALEOs are about rates savings, where does the wider public sector financial perspective come in? How does that relate to the &#8220;benchmarking and performance measurement&#8221; that the motion refers to?</p><p>There has not been much discussion of funding. A number of people feel that the council tax should be reviewed. I favour a local income tax; I do not favour the corporation tax approach. There needs to be continuing discussion between local government and the Scottish Government. The concordat has given us the framework for that to happen.</p><p>I mention funding against the background of growing demands and demographic change, to which a number of members have referred. If we want the same level of service from a reducing pot, that suggests that the revenue will have to come from somewhere.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684930", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Services Reform (Developing New Ways of Delivering Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The purpose of public services might be self-evident but, in case it is not, I note that their purpose is to serve the public, to discharge the statutory obligations of the local authority, and not to generate profit.

In his defence, as other members have mentioned, it has been said that he is a decent chap who would not overstep the mark. I, too, have no cause to doubt that, but we must understand that the powers are given to the postholder and not just to the present incumbent. As Malcolm Chisholm said, there are no guarantees about what might happen in future. Just this week, concerns have been expressed about a significant public appointment by the new Scottish Police Authority. Therefore, I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s assurance that there will be scrutiny of how things progress in that regard.</p><p>I am particularly pleased that the Scottish Government took on board points about public appointments, that a fair, open and accessible appointment process has been adopted and that the Lord President will be required to publish a statement on how he will achieve that.</p><p>Openness is terribly important. Malcolm Chisholm talked about assurances and, if he checks through the debates, he will find a lot of assurances. The Lord President gave the assurance that it was extremely unlikely that the Court of Session would object to rules that were drawn up. I note that the Lord President has a role in the Court of Session and the new council. The Justice Committee was also assured that the Lord President would reflect a wide range of interests when appointing council members. Many individuals have paid a lot of attention to those assurances.</p><p>I supported one amendment from Jenny Marra, which was on the council&#8217;s composition. It is important that the council&#8217;s members represent a cross-section. I have used the term &#8220;lawyers club&#8221; and I feared the potential for a lawyers club to be created. It is important to involve users. We have heard that people would not be up to it and we have heard promises of change in the future. Many members will have heard such statements in another forum in relation to another debate.</p><p>As for participation, no matter how the numbers are juggled, the Lord President should be in no doubt that people are very interested in his discretionary appointments. Most effective organisations value rather than fear participation. The best employers consult their employees and unions and value their participation; the best shops value their customers; and the best public bodies listen and engage. I hope that the Lord President will do that in relation to his appointments.</p><p>Accountability, openness and participation are required. The civil legal system&#8217;s customers hope for active involvement. I hope for active involvement from consumer and environmental groups as a step towards bringing Aarhus convention compliance closer.

The minister repeatedly used the term &#8220;sustainable economic growth&#8221;, but to my mind that should not be about the blind pursuit of profit. With profit, as with all other things in life, enough is as good as a feast, but greed has led us to the situation in which we are seeing a reduction in vital public services. However, I ask the minister to take cognisance of the challenges that are posed by rurality and supersparsity, some of which have already been alluded to.</p><p>On sustaining landscape and natural heritage, for that we need people, and people need homes. Whose interests are being served by the planning policies of councils and national parks if the only homes in large areas of the landscape are second homes? There needs to be linkage across the planning process, but that linkage must include continuing land reform, which I know is coming up.</p><p>Many people in the Highlands have welcomed the broadband that is being provided along the rail network, but they contrast that with the difficulties that they still face in getting a broadband connection. I know that a lot of work on that is going on, but broadband improvements are a significant element that should link into planning processes.</p><p>Another phrase that is used&#8212;both in the documentation and by members today&#8212;is place making, which has been emphasised. Well&#8212;the Highlands and Islands are full of places, so no making is required. It would emphasise the worth of those places if public policies&#8212;I absolutely accept the need for central planning&#8212;recognised the worth of rural communities. By way of example, 60 houses being built any distance from Holyrood would of course be welcomed, but they would not be significant statistically, but six houses being built in a village or township in the Highlands and Islands would emphasise place making and sustain the local community. They would help to retain the local school, the post office, the pub and the bus service, all of which are vital to sustaining communities and rural economies.</p><p>I, too, am a former member of a planning committee and, like Mark Griffin, I have seen communities being galvanised both in support of and in opposition to major local developments.

Cynicism has quite clearly peppered the entire process and has been very destructive.</p><p>We heard from Mark McDonald about the UK Government being uninterested. That is extremely disappointing.</p><p>On a more positive note&#8212;I am grateful to the organisations that provided briefings for the debate&#8212;the Community trade union talks about &#8220;the right political will&#8221; being the way forward. I am delighted that the minister accepts the inclusive Labour amendment, which provides an opportunity to involve a wide range of folk, not least the unions. That is the way forward.</p><p>Ideology also plays its part: it is the UK Government&#8217;s aversion to quangos that sees Remploy under attack.</p><p>We heard about the creation of Remploy at the end of the second world war. We also heard some very positive words: sheltered employment and rehabilitation are very positive things. There are the two strands of the factory network and the various figures for people who have been put under threat, which I will not repeat. Then we heard about employment services. The figures that I have show that, in the past year, employment services have assisted 20,000 people into mainstream employment. Those services will have to redouble their efforts if the closure programme is continued.</p><p>I will pick up on Graeme Pearson&#8217;s points about CCTV and the key role that its operators play in policing operations. That is a very good example of a role. Front-line crime is fought not only by police officers; CCTV operators also have an important role. That is the case in Fort William, Inverness and Tain in my area.</p><p>It is important to be aware of the attitude and language in the UK Government&#8217;s approach to health and safety at work. Clare Adamson talked about a tragedy, and we all share her sympathetic response. A University of Stirling report has talked about the erosion of the Health and Safety Executive&#8217;s role that has made it almost exclusively reactive, rather than proactive and reduced the number of investigations and, consequently, the number of prosecutions. That comes from a UK Government whose Prime Minister describes equality impact assessments as &#8220;nonsense&#8221;. That is important language and gives a clear indication of where the UK Government is coming from.</p><p>One argument that could be made and perhaps has been&#8212;it is certainly implied in the Conservative amendment&#8212;is that the issue is not about premises; it is about people. That would be fine were it not for the attack on the welfare system, to which several speakers have referred, involving disability assessments and the approach of Atos Healthcare. As we have heard, the welfare reform is predicated on savings, not on assessed need.</p><p>The word &#8220;contrast&#8221; has been used a few times. I, too, would like to contrast the approaches of the UK and Scottish Governments on the issue. This morning, the Equal Opportunities Committee heard from the minister, Fergus Ewing, about the positive approach that has been adopted. Again, the language is important. Like other members, I was pleased to hear that the minister has visited a number of factories. It is apparent that those were not visits to the boardroom, but that they involved positive engagement with people on the shop floor. We heard about particular worries that we would all understand to do with Christmas and so on. That is important, because the issue is about people. We can talk about statistics all day long, but everything is about people. I am also pleased about the engagement with potential customers, particularly in the oil and offshore sector.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s concerns about the UK Government&#8217;s handling of the issue are understandable. There has been unnecessary secrecy. Patricia Ferguson talked about freedom of information requests. If we are to make progress, it is absolutely crucial that everyone is as open and transparent as possible. Information must be relevant and there must be sufficient information available to people to allow them to meet their obligations.</p><p>I agree with five words in the Conservative amendment, which are</p><p>&#8220;Partnership Action for Continuing Employment&#8221;.</p><p>As we know, PACE was not allowed access to the employees. However, as we heard from the minister, early intervention and one-to-one counselling are vital if we are to address individual needs in local circumstances. A range of options can and should be considered. The models include employee buy-outs, social enterprises and co-operatives, but there are others.</p><p>Staff feel uninformed. Someone told the minister that they do not understand how things happened. A &#163;2,500 stipend from the Department for Work and Pensions will come as cold comfort, particularly at this time of year.</p><p>The minister and others talked about good businesses and quality products, but said that the prospects are undermined by the approach that the UK Government has adopted. I am delighted that the priority is the continuation of businesses and that employees are central to that. Working with the trade unions, we can make progress. Like other members, I look forward to the minister&#8217;s statement later in the year.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678593", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Remploy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Remploy debate is about attitudes and language.

At the outset, the minister talked about some of its benefits, and I know of individuals who have gone through methadone programmes who are now leading positive lifestyles.</p><p>I am pleased that the motion pays tribute to addiction workers, who have a very testing job. As we know from the briefing from the Scottish Drugs Forum, the long-lasting therapeutic relationship is key and many of the workers go above and beyond the call of duty in the way that they treat their clients. They not only get the client through the door but retain them there, which is very important.</p><p>Harm reduction seems to be considered by some as a negative, but to me it is a positive thing. We have heard about the benefits of syringe exchanges, which are benefits not just for the individuals but for their families, friends and the wider community in preventing the spread of hepatitis C and HIV.</p><p>I will pick up on a couple of issues that I do not think anyone else has picked up on. The first of those is the issuing of drug warnings. We had a series of tragic deaths in the Highlands. I understand that drug users have an extensive knowledge not just of market availability but of market strength. They also know the clear sequence in which substances must be taken to get them where they want to go and get them back down again. Drug deaths are, therefore, often complicated&#8212;the term &#8220;cocktail&#8221; is sometimes used. Sensationalism does not help, but drug warnings do. I am aware of the frustration at what was a logjam between the agencies in putting information out. Indeed, I have asked a parliamentary question on the subject. No one will be sued if they say that there may be difficult things out there. It is a bit like an avalanche warning: anyone will say that it is unsafe to go up a hill and no one will say that it is safe to go up in the winter, but there is no avalanche threat unless there is heavy snow. We need to address that issue.</p><p>The second issue is the danger of legal highs. I raised the issue of legal highs with the police but they told me that they had no intelligence on the subject, so I gave them names, locations and car numbers. I encourage everyone else to do that, as legal highs are invariably linked to the issues of controlled drugs.</p><p>Neil Findlay&#8217;s point about housing is key. We need to recognise the link between drug abuse and poverty and realise whom we are serving. There are wider implications of putting drug users into communities when they are ill equipped to deal with the situations that they are confronted with.</p><p>Naloxone saves lives&#8212;that is the simple message. I welcome the roll-out and think that it should be extended to include the police service. Naloxone saves lives, and I hope that it can save more in the coming months.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676313", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For me, the motion is about people and their individual needs, which should be assessed and, wherever possible, met.

Only a few people picked Gaelic as a subject. Why? For most people, Gaelic, Highlanders and Highland culture were not important. That has been the situation throughout Scotland&#8217;s history.

Police investigations are key in criminal matters, and the clarification of the distinction between detention and arrest on suspicion is helpful.</p><p>I support the robust application of a rights-based system, with regard not only to Lord Carloway&#8217;s recommendations but to the forthcoming legislation that a number of members have mentioned. I will concentrate on a couple of rights&#8212;article 5, which is the right to liberty, and article 6, which is the right to a fair trial&#8212;from the perspective of Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid, which is an important and informed user of the criminal justice system.</p><p>The emphasis is on a presumption in favour of liberty. That may seem self-evident in any system, but it requires to be mentioned and regarded, and I will refer to it later. Indeed, one or two members&#8212;such as Margaret Mitchell&#8212;have already mentioned it in relation to concerns about the release of the accused.</p><p>A letter of rights will be provided to every suspect, who will be able to choose their solicitor or waive their right to a solicitor, and appropriate protections will be put in place for children and vulnerable adults, which is important.</p><p>As members have mentioned, training will be required not just for police officers but for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and solicitors. That will bring about some consistency and comprehension of each participant&#8217;s role in the proceedings.</p><p>It is important that if a suspect is charged, they should be brought to court within 36 hours of arrest. The implications for our courts have been mentioned, but I certainly do not see any problem with the courts responding by holding weekend, public holiday or&#8212;dare I say it&#8212;evening sittings. The additional clarification around the idea of a suspect being liberated to allow time for further investigation by the police before further questioning is very important, not least in relation to issues concerning the forensic examination of computers and accounting systems.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reforming Scots Criminal Law and Practice (Public Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Lord Carloway described the Cadder judgment as &#8220;a serious shock to the system&#8221;.

For historical, personal and other reasons, there has been a reluctance for the system to be used, often because it is seen as a sign of escalation.

The STUC is clearly concerned about the issue, especially as women&#8217;s unemployment has increased by 19 per cent in the past year, while male unemployment has declined. The general secretary of the STUC, Grahame Smith, said:</p><p>&#8220;The STUC looks forward to working constructively with the Scottish Government on this key issue over the coming months.&#8221;</p><p>I am delighted that it will be involved in the first women&#8217;s employment summit, which will be held later this year. The agenda certainly sounds interesting.</p><p>We cannot rewrite history, undo the wrongs or change the assumptions that have been made&#8212;assumptions that are often forgotten in a time of war. The post-war treatment of women is a clear example of hypocrisy in our society.</p><p>We know that women are more likely to have primary caring responsibilities, to work part time, to be in lower-paid jobs, to be in insecure and lower-status jobs, and to be lone parents. Those factors all impact greatly on what we are discussing. Many academic studies have covered the issues, and I am grateful to all the organisations that have provided briefings.</p><p>I will quote from an informal briefing that was provided to me following a conversation at the weekend with a young mother of twins in Inverness. Following a meeting with two other young mothers&#8212;she will like me calling her young&#8212;she provided me with some information about their concerns. I will tell members about them by quoting their words. As background, I note that they both work for the national health service and both have a child under one. One of the mothers has returned to work and the other has not.</p><p>Their concerns related to the following:</p><p>&#8220;Flexible working including the option to work weekends.</p><p>Lack of affordable and flexible childcare - only available 8 to 6, Monday to Friday.</p><p>Requirement to pay a month up front before a child starts with childminder/nursery - can be hundreds of pounds.</p><p>Employer attitudes to request to reduce hours on return from maternity leave - not always positive.</p><p>Complicated benefits/tax credits system that offers no assistance to middle income families.</p><p>Sheer number of firms offering childcare vouchers - one or two companies would simplify system both for parents and childcare providers.</p><p>Need for employers where possible to offer flexible working to fathers not just mothers.&#8221;</p><p>I am grateful to the convener of the Equal Opportunities Committee for mentioning the committee&#8217;s round-table discussion, at which we heard a flavour of the problems that exist. The convener mentioned as an example short-notice changes of shift for women who have primary childcare responsibilities, who often care for other family members as well. The significance of that is shown by the fact that it was discussed at the STUC women&#8217;s conference, and we had some very good input on it at the round-table discussion.</p><p>We also heard that there is a huge gulf between employers&#8217; agreed policies and what happens in practice. I am grateful to the Equality and Human Rights Commission for highlighting the following, which is another issue:</p><p>&#8220;Work-life balance and diversity initiatives, as well as the right to request flexible working, are likely to be given lower priority by employers during the current recession.&#8221;</p><p>It is for that reason, and because of the well-documented concern that some people have about people&#8217;s ability to challenge malpractice, that we need strong trade unions and staff associations more than ever, not just to ensure that people are properly represented but to ensure that hard-fought-for workplace gains are not lost.</p><p>There is much that can be done. It is significant that neither of the two young women whom I mentioned knew about some of the Scottish Government initiatives. It is important that we get information out there.

As we know, the background of their appeal was the time that those who have been given discretionary life sentences or orders of lifelong restriction must serve before becoming eligible for parole. Clearly, the anomaly was unforeseen. However, by way of reassuring the general public, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice made it clear that such individuals still had to satisfy the Parole Board for Scotland that they pose no risk to the public. The bill will reinstate the judicial discretion that was removed by the appeal court ruling and will reduce the risk of decisions being overturned on appeal.</p><p>ECHR law has decreed that non-mandatory life sentences are different from other types of sentences and are imposed by courts after an assessment of risk to the public. The bill sets a framework for the punishment part of non-mandatory life sentences. First, the court must assess the appropriate period of imprisonment had the prisoner not been sentenced to life imprisonment or been made the subject of an order of lifelong restriction. That period ignores any period of confinement that is necessary for protection of the public. The court must then assess the appropriate period for satisfying the requirements of retribution and deterrence.</p><p>Under the bill, that part of the period of imprisonment&#8212;known as the punishment part&#8212;must be either half or some greater proportion of the period specified, up to the entire period of imprisonment. At that point, judicial discretion kicks in. A greater proportion than half can be specified only if the court considers it appropriate after considering the seriousness of the offence, or of the offence combined with other offences of which the prisoner has been convicted on the same indictment as that offence; after its considering whether the offence was committed when the prisoner was serving a period of imprisonment for another offence; and after its considering the prisoner&#8217;s previous convictions.</p><p>Any legislation that closes a gap must be welcomed. There has been much discussion about the complexity of the bill; indeed, the Justice Committee debated whether or not it is ECHR compliant. However, it was very much assured by the Scottish Human Rights Commission&#8217;s response that the bill meets the specific terms of the convention.</p><p>No one said that this was going to be easy. In its response to the committee, the Scottish Government made it very clear that it would consider any alternatives that were offered, but none was forthcoming. There is no simple ready reckoner. As I have pointed out, judges will have to consider a range of factors, but we suggest at our peril that our High Court judges have neither the wisdom nor the guile to make their way through the legislation.</p><p>Proportionality is as important in our judicial system as it is in life and is certainly vital to our sentencing policy. The public rightly expect assurances that they will be protected. However, as I said to Ms Marra, I do not believe that victims need to understand the minutiae of sentencing law; after all, they receive support from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and from the victim information and advice service.

It is clearly important that every part and every level of the justice system works.</p><p>We have heard a number of members say that victims need witnesses: there can be no justice without them. That seems self-evident, but it is worth repeating.</p><p>I listened intently to what Lewis Macdonald said about the evolving nature of changes in this area of the criminal justice system. I see the consultation as part of that evolution in advancing the treatment of witnesses and victims, building on the discussions to which the cabinet secretary alluded.</p><p>The police practices with which I am familiar from a previous career have evolved, too. I give the example of domestic abuse. In the mid-1970s, the options for dealing with an offender were their removal from the house by way of arrest if there was sufficient evidence&#8212;invariably, there was not&#8212;or encouraging them to go elsewhere. That was totally unsatisfactory. It is clear that the wellbeing of the victim, multi-agency efforts to ensure that there is no repetition and the awareness of the effects on the wider household, not least the children, are now seen as important. I noted with interest Mary Fee&#8217;s remarks about the difficulties that children face, and concur with many, but not all, of them. Even the community suffers as a result, so the question of who is a victim is important.</p><p>We have seen improvements in the treatment of victims of sexual assault, rape and child abuse. A multi-agency approach, in line with the getting it right for every child programme, is perhaps a model that can be built on.</p><p>The ministerial foreword to the consultation document states:</p><p>&#8220;Being a witness is an important civic duty&#8221;.</p><p>Is that civic duty being discharged? I have long held concerns about people being referred to Crimestoppers as the first port of call for the police service. It is clear that there is a place for anonymous calls, but we must empower communities to defend themselves. Previously, as a councillor, and now, as an MSP, I have forwarded on a number of occasions criminal intelligence that has been provided to me by constituents on a confidential basis, and I will continue to do so. It is very easy for me to say, &#8220;Give your name to the police,&#8221; but I do not knowingly live beside a drug-dealing neighbour who has visited violence on people who call at their house, often with the use of weapons. I appreciate that it is not easy for victims.</p><p>The police are often the first port of call for both witnesses and victims, and the police service needs to have understanding. It is clear that there can be a conflict of interests. For instance, a householder who wants a drug-dealing neighbour to be dealt with will want them to be dealt with immediately, whereas the police&#8212;perhaps understandably on occasions&#8212;will want to find the optimum time to raid the premises so that they can have the best possible impact on drug dealing in the area. The initial response from the police is crucial to victims and witnesses. They do not need to know how busy the police are; they do not need a lecture on the law of corroboration; and they do not need to know how frustrating it is for police officers to deal with juveniles. Rather, they need to be listened to and responded to positively.</p><p>Again, I pose the question: who are the victims? An individual criminal act in a household can produce many victims. As we know to our peril, if we do not get things right, entire neighbourhoods can be victims. We can place all the measures that we like into supporting victims through health, social care and the third sector, but the criminal justice system needs witnesses, and how we treat them is very important. Police officers in the houses of people who have come forward as witnesses must deal with those people sensitively. A flagging system for persistent witnesses should be utilised so that they are not continually asked the same questions when they phone. I know of constituents who no longer phone because they do not want to go through the rigmarole.</p><p>Preventative spend is key to everything. We need to avoid creating victims. There is certainly a record number of police officers that is in some way contributing towards what is a 35-year crime low. The consultation paper says:</p><p>&#8220;Victims and witnesses should feel confident in coming forward and that their personal safety will be protected&#8221;.</p><p>It is clear that visible police patrols can play a part in that.</p><p>Prevention work with young people and advice provided to schools are very important, as it is often forgotten that young people are disproportionately the victims of crime. Action can be taken on cyber-crime and bullying.</p><p>I turn to some of the key proposals. On the victim surcharge, I recall the publicity around the introduction of compensation orders, and I therefore believe that it is important that, after an initial peak, we do not lose the meaningful contribution that such a move could make to the process. It is important that the surcharge is a credible alternative to criminal injuries compensation. It is significant that the criminal, rather than the public purse, pays that compensation.</p><p>Special measures, which have been mentioned, are very important, particularly for victims of sexual and domestic abuse. We heard from Roderick Campbell how special measures can be a positive experience. It is important that we embrace technology, and I make a plea for rural areas not to be disadvantaged. We should harness the opportunities for videoconferencing: it should not in any way undermine the rights of the accused person, but we need to use it to best effect. If it proves to be an inconvenience, it should be an inconvenience to the accused rather than to the victim or the witnesses. In the longer term, issues such as court design must be taken on board.</p><p>With regard to restitution orders, it is shocking that there were nearly 5,000 convictions for assaults on police officers between January 2010 and March 2012. That figure is for convictions: it is not the overall figure for prosecutions, nor does it include assaults that were never reported.</p><p>An attack on a police officer in the course of their duty is an attack on the criminal justice system. Restitution orders, which would involve compensation being paid to a treatment and rehabilitation centre, would send a significant signal not only to the accused but to police officers.</p><p>I welcome the consultation, and I hope for the fullest engagement.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Improving Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The aim of making justice work is laudable but will not be without its challenges.

I am also grateful to Glasgow gurdwara for its briefing.</p><p>It is evident that, in 1995, Bhai Balwant Singh Rajoana witnessed vile acts, which would shock any decent human. I was shocked by references to the systematic pattern of abuse against the Sikh community. Extrajudicial murders&#8212;the acts of the very people who are charged with protecting the community&#8212;undermine any society.</p><p>As we have heard, Amnesty opposes the death penalty for two fundamental reasons, articles 3 and 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#8212;&#8220;the right to life&#8221; and the right not to be tortured or subjected to any &#8220;cruel, inhuman or degrading&#8221; punishment. Amnesty states:</p><p>&#8220;The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. It is irrevocable and can be inflicted on the innocent. It has never been shown to deter crime more effectively than other punishments.&#8221;</p><p>As John Mason also mentioned, the effect on the mental wellbeing of someone who has been sentenced to death is significant&#8212;the experience of that Japanese gentleman is surely beyond our comprehension.</p><p>The briefings that we were given have some graphic detail and some alarming information about the execution process. I was taken by the following definition from Amnesty:</p><p>&#8220;An execution, like physical forms of torture, involves a deliberate assault on a prisoner. The only difference is that the assault is continued until a person is killed.&#8221;</p><p>That is a telling explanation. In India, a number of executions have been suspended by courts to allow for the consideration of separate legal challenges on the delay in deciding mercy petitions, and the constitutionality of a prolonged stay on death row&#8212;that is important.</p><p>It is also important to understand the issue of revenge that Humza Yousaf mentioned. What is the purpose of punishment? Is it retribution? Is it to bring about reform? Certainly, as a child I was told that two wrongs do not make a right, which stands me in good stead in my views on other matters, too.</p><p>The state of Georgia was referred to. We can talk in abstract terms about the death penalty, but linking it to an individual provides a graphic example. Many of us will recall the death last year of Troy Davis who, by any stretch of the imagination, was far from compellingly convicted&#8212;there were serious doubts about his guilt. That was one of the 676 executions that took place worldwide in 2011.</p><p>According to the Amnesty International 2012 annual report on human rights, which was released last Friday, India&#8217;s growing influence in the world was marked by its election to the UN Security Council and the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>I did some research&#8212;I hope that I got this right and certainly do not wish to offend if I got it wrong&#8212;and I understand that the Sikh turban symbolises discipline, integrity, humility and spirituality. I hope that India will think again, display discipline, integrity, humility and spirituality, and dispense with the barbarity of the death sentence.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669062", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Death Penalty in India"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate John Mason and thank him for lodging this significant motion.

We already have a commitment to maintain 17,234 officers, and we need a similar commitment to a baseline for front-line fire and rescue officers that will allow scrutiny to be carried out. I think that it is remiss of the committee&#8217;s report not to pick up on the fact that security in that respect partly comes down to something that is formally called regulation 19, which many police officers will be very familiar with. In my opinion, the bill alters that regulation unnecessarily, and I hope that that issue will be addressed.</p><p>The committee spent a lot of time discussing resources and resource allocation models. I should point out that, in each of the forces, tensions already exist between the localities and the centre, and we need to understand how they will be dealt with in the allocation of resources. Assistant Chief Constable Finlay of the Police Service of Northern Ireland told us in evidence that, under its current tactical tasking model, it is the merit of the individual bid for additional resources, not the rank of the person who makes it or the locality from which it comes, that is important. We also heard about the sharing of specialist services, which is important, particularly in a large landward area such as the one that I represent.</p><p>The appointment of the chief constable and chairs is important. We know that the boards&#8217; primary function will be to oversee the new services and hold the chief officers to account. The composition of the boards will therefore be important. There should not be a bidding war, as happened at one time, to see whose area can be represented. We need people with the appropriate skills to do that work in very public bodies.</p><p>We have heard about early appointments in autumn 2012. That is quite right.

That was a lost opportunity, because Sir John Dewar would have been an excellent role model for us all, so I am grateful to Dave Thompson for highlighting the issue. Lloyd George is to be commended for setting up the Dewar committee. The terms of reference clearly indicate the humanity that underpinned the process.</p><p>I am grateful to the British Medical Association for the briefing that it has provided, and which makes terrible reading in that it describes appalling squalid conditions, malnourished children and high infant mortality. Those aspects, and the fact that one in five deaths went uncertificated by a doctor, is what concerns me. Certification is not a cold administrative process&#8212;we value life by determining issues about death.</p><p>It would not have been called a road show or focus groups, but the Dewar committee went on a tour and took evidence. It would have been fascinating to listen to that. We cannot change the geography of the Highlands and nor would we seek to do so; people have a right to live and prosper in challenging environments. The Highlands and Islands are full of vibrant communities. As the Dewar report indicated, the Government has a duty to provide and, as David Thomson eloquently said, parties across Parliament support the work of the NHS in Scotland.</p><p>I am proud that the report introduced the first public healthcare system in the world and that it formed the basis of the start of the NHS in 1948. I wonder what Sir John Dewar would think of the service today. We had a temporary blip yesterday, with the air ambulances being out of service and cover being provided by the military and the coastguard. He would have felt that such provision goes a long way towards dealing with the transport problems to which David Thompson alluded.</p><p>We still have poor housing and poverty, and rural deprivation is not always recognised. As has been said with reference to west Ardnamurchan, the delivery of healthcare remains challenging, and that is also the case in Wester Ross. Clearly, we cannot have a specialist in every town or township, so people&#8217;s expectations must be realistic. However, there are creative ways of meeting the challenges, and the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy has addressed the issues in those locations.</p><p>The equal top measures in Oxfam&#8217;s humankind index are &#8220;Affordable, decent and safe home&#8221; and &#8220;Physical and mental health&#8221;. Dave Thompson talked about free and accessible healthcare, which we should strive to ensure remains a foundation stone of Scottish society.

My role is extremely minor and involves attending meetings and the odd event. The true spirit of what is done there is in the manager, Jackie McIntosh, and in the staff and the volunteers.</p><p>MS is a pernicious disease and the symptoms differ from person to person. The one thing that unites them is the devastation that is caused by the diagnosis. In a previous career, I assisted someone who had work-related issues and I distinctly recall the mixed feelings that that individual had when they were finally given a definitive diagnosis. The report that we all received in our e-mail inboxes&#8212;&#8220;Fighting Back: Ordinary people battling the everyday effects of MS&#8221;&#8212;mentions the emotional impact, which struck me as being important. The report also touches on the mental wellbeing not only of the individual who is unfortunate enough to have the disease&#8212;I, too, would use the term &#8220;sufferer&#8221;&#8212;but of the family, friends and loved ones. It is devastating.</p><p>I will touch on a few points. George Adam mentioned relapsing-remitting MS. The report talks about &#8220;a rollercoaster of emotions&#8221;, which that form of MS must be. I know individuals who feel that that is the case.</p><p>As a councillor and an MSP, I have asked about research into MS and have received good and detailed responses from the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy on that and on the level of national health service support. We all hope that as much support as possible is given to people with the disease.</p><p>It is a cruel fact that&#8212;as the report mentions&#8212;people with MS feel stigmatised as a result of having the disease. Unfortunately, that feeling is not exclusive to MS sufferers. It has a significant impact on people&#8217;s wellbeing. The report says that there is no evidence to support those feelings of stigmatisation, but that is not the point: the point is that people should not feel stigmatised.</p><p>George Adam touched on the UK Government&#8217;s attack on welfare. I share the view that it is shocking. I have assisted a person in relation to childcare issues and recall the trauma that was associated with the assessment process. Again, that trauma not only affected the individual but had wider implications. He is to be commended for his motion, which lays out why MS sufferers will be among those who are hardest hit by the welfare reforms which, as we have heard, are money driven rather than being about assessed need.</p><p>Scotland has the highest prevalence of MS in the world, but we need not be insular about that. The disease is very much an international issue and some of the research that has taken place worldwide is to be commended. The international community will deal with the condition.</p><p>I congratulate the MS Society, its branches and the therapy centres throughout Scotland. In any fight, we need resilience and strength of mind, and in my experience that is to be found in abundance among MS sufferers and their supporters. The fightback will never stop until a cure is found. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in tonight&#8217;s debate.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666310", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Multiple Sclerosis Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate George Adam on the motion.

The commission was set up to provide a fresh and independent perspective and to bring forward solutions this session and, for the reasons that members have highlighted, it is very important that the Government takes time to reflect on the report. After all, there have been many such reports before and people now want action. I look forward to getting the Government&#8217;s detailed response before the summer recess. We should certainly congratulate the individuals who have made an input to the report.</p><p>The man or woman on the street might well ask why there has been such a focus on women when, after all, we certainly need to address offending behaviour by both genders. I make no apology for repeating many of the statistics that we have already heard. For example, compared with men, women are more likely to be a lower risk to public safety, with only 2 per cent involved in serious crime. They are more likely to be in prison for dishonesty offences, by which I mean acquisitive crime as a result not only of addiction&#8212;if that were properly addressed, people might be prevented from coming into the justice system&#8212;but, dare I say it, of poverty. With the attack on the benefits system, that is likely to become more and more of a factor.</p><p>Women are also more likely to be placed on remand. In fact, a quarter of the women in prison are on remand and only 30 per cent of them receive a custodial sentence. I therefore agree with Lewis Macdonald that there seems to be a lack of logic in that respect.</p><p>There are also higher rates of mental health problems among women in prison. As we have heard, the inspectorate&#8217;s 2007 report said that 80 per cent of women in Cornton Vale had such problems. I think that it is important that this report refers to borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, and I might well come back to that issue later.</p><p>As if prison were not traumatic enough for inmates and those charged with looking after them, it has been suggested that women in prison are around 10 times more likely to self-harm. That is an alarming statistic.</p><p>We have also heard of the impact on families and children. Approximately 30 per cent of imprisoned parents will develop physical and mental problems and are more likely to end up in prison themselves. We in the Parliament have met many organisations that are doing sterling work in that respect.</p><p>I am grateful to Equality and Human Rights Commission Scotland for its briefing paper on what it calls a case for a different approach. It says that</p><p>&#8220;women demonstrate different predictors of reoffending than men ... women are more likely than men to lose their homes.&#8221;</p><p>It also says that</p><p>&#8220;Women offenders are more likely than men who offend to have dependent children ... and less likely to rely on a partner outside to look after their children while they are in custody&#8221;,</p><p>which increases the potential for greater adverse impacts on children of women prisoners. So there is a range of gender issues inherent in what is being said today.</p><p>Cornton Vale is not everyone&#8217;s favourite establishment and there has been much consideration of the recommendation to replace it. I visited Cornton Vale with Alison McInnes, and I have to tell members that I think that the establishment is suffering a bit from visitor fatigue, which is probably what gave rise to many of the reports. There is a continual focus on the facility, which may have affected the morale of the staff who work there. Prison officers and their civilian colleagues apply the highest possible standards and should be commended for their work.</p><p>A lot of comment has been made about the 218 project and I am grateful that the Government has funded it to the tune of &#163;8.5 million over five years. There is a very good reason for that investment. As Christina McKelvie said, there is evidence that, for every pound that is invested, the potential saving is &#163;2.50 across healthcare, criminal justice and social care. However, this is not just about money. We are talking about the approach that we take. Reference has been made to the multidisciplinary teams&#8212;criminal justice, social workers, health professionals, addiction workers&#8212;and the tailored support that the 218 project can provide.</p><p>The report also talks about service redesign and doing things in a different way. Perhaps the more radical suggestion is to have a national service. We have all heard about the fragmentation of the service and I fear that, in some cases, out of sight means out of mind. Some of the information that we were given at Cornton Vale about the on-going involvement of the 32 local authorities&#8212;or, in most cases, lack of on-going involvement&#8212;suggests that something needs to be done. I hope that consideration will be given to that.</p><p>It is important to note that we are talking about reintegration into the community, and housing is a key part of that. That means an important role for the third sector. The report refers to the benefits system, which I think is pertinent. This is not a party-political issue and, clearly, integration will not be achieved if someone who leaves prison has their housing arrangements sorted but does not have their benefit sorted. Planning needs to go into that and I hope to see a positive role for the benefits agency.</p><p>Mentoring, to which Christina McKelvie and others have alluded, is also key, not just to deal with reoffending but to ensure that court orders are adhered to.</p><p>The report makes the interesting point that males and females breach court orders for differing reasons. Males generally breach court orders when they reoffend; with females, it is generally because of their chaotic lifestyle and the implications of distance, cost and childcare. There is a clear difference there and we cannot afford to do nothing about it. The report is a very positive start and I look forward to hearing the Government&#8217;s response.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, commend the commission for its report and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice for setting it up in the first place.

We know that the subject is complex and that the appeal court did not reach agreement on the terms of the judgment in the Petch and Foye case, which was decided by a majority of five to two.</p><p>Part 1 will introduce a clear framework for judges to calculate sentences and make the process easier to understand. Petch and Foye are two particularly unpleasant individuals. Petch was found guilty of two charges of rape and was given a discretionary life sentence. Foye pled guilty to a charge of rape and was given an order for lifelong restriction. Both appealed the punishment elements of the sentences. As we have heard on a number of occasions, the punishment part is the period that must be served before a prisoner is eligible for parole. In 2011, the appeal court ruled on the periods that Petch and Foye had to serve before being eligible for parole.</p><p>We have heard the situation being described as &#8220;an anomaly&#8221;. I do not know whether it is a simple or a complex anomaly, but it has certainly required a complex solution.</p><p>We heard from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice that approximately 75 people have been given discretionary life sentences in the past six years. The important point to note is that such people could become eligible for parole earlier than prisoners who have been given determinate sentences for like crimes. That comparison is important. However, as the cabinet secretary confirmed, that has posed no risk to the public, because the requirement to satisfy the Parole Board for Scotland about safety has remained.</p><p>Given that, people might say, &#8220;So what?&#8221; and ask whether the issue is important. It is extremely important. We have heard about the sort of crimes that draw a life sentence&#8212;they include murder and a few others. Courts must have the discretion to impose significant penalties. Non-mandatory life sentences and orders for lifelong restriction are given to the most dangerous offenders, who will be subject to varying degrees of monitoring and supervisory regimes for the remainder of their lives.</p><p>A recipient is given a non-mandatory life sentence not as a more severe punishment for their crime or offence but because the judge believes that they are likely to pose a high risk to public safety in the future. Persons who do not pose a high risk would receive a fixed determinate sentence. Given that, the fact that someone who is deemed to pose a risk to the public and who has been sentenced accordingly can be eligible for release ahead of someone who has received a fixed sentence for a similar crime is clearly wrong. The committee heard no evidence to the contrary on that.</p><p>We have heard that the Petch and Foye ruling removed judicial discretion. Part 1 will return that discretion and reduce the risk that decisions will be overturned on appeal.</p><p>Perhaps predictably, Mr McLetchie brought up sentencing law. A rewrite is not required. The bill is a specific response to a specific problem. As we have heard, it draws on ECHR, domestic law and the framework of existing legislation. The committee supported the aims of part 1.</p><p>I will try to outline a very simple version of the solution; it will not be as complex as the convener&#8217;s explanation. ECHR laws decree that non-mandatory life sentences are different from other types of sentences because, as we have heard, they are imposed by courts based on the assessed risk to public safety. The bill addresses the problem through providing a framework for the court to set the punishment part of non-mandatory life sentences.</p><p>The court must first assess the period of imprisonment that it considers would have been appropriate for the offence had the prisoner not been sentenced to life imprisonment or been the subject of an order for lifelong restriction. That period of imprisonment must ignore any period of confinement that may be necessary for the protection of the public. The court must then assess the part of that period of imprisonment that would represent an appropriate period to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence&#8212;I do not think that we have heard those terms in the debate, but they are a component part of the sentencing regime in Scotland. The bill requires that that part of the period of imprisonment, which will be the punishment part, is to be either one half or a greater portion of that period specified, up to the entire period of imprisonment.</p><p>That is where judicial discretion kicks in, because between 50 and 100 per cent can be levied, provided that certain criteria are satisfied. The criteria, which exist already, relate to the seriousness of the offence or the offence being combined with other offences of which the prisoner is convicted on the same indictment, the offence being committed when the prisoner was serving a period of imprisonment for another offence and, understandably, any previous convictions.</p><p>The situation arises out of an anomaly&#8212;no one is to blame for it. Part 1 of the bill will remedy the problem and should enjoy full support.</p><p>I do not think that victims needs to understand the minutiae of sentencing law. They receive support from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and from the victim information and advice service. We can all look forward to the implications of the bill and, more important, to the victims and witnesses bill that will be introduced in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665465", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Cases (Punishment and Review) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will concentrate on part 1 of the bill&#8212;the easy bit.

It goes on to talk about how</p><p>&#8220;A modern legal framework commands public confidence&#8221;.</p><p>Some of the previous speakers&#8217; remarks show how that is important because one of the purposes of the tribunals&#8212;again, this is referred to in the ministerial foreword&#8212;is that they protect</p><p>&#8220;people from unfair treatment by the state, by businesses or by other people.&#8221;</p><p>Social justice should be at the heart of everything that we do, and those aims are very commendable.</p><p>Judicial independence has been referred to. The minister talked about being fair, open and impartial, and I welcome the oversight of the Lord President, which will be important as we move forward.</p><p>In improving the system, it is important to retain the benefits of the existing system and to protect the unique and specific elements that will transfer to the first tier. Given the caveat of right of appeal to the court or a judicial review, it is correct that the first tier will hear and make decisions on appeals. Reference has been made to the speed of appeals and, again, that is important so long as it does not come at the expense of justice. Distress is often felt by the appellant&#8217;s partner or family because of the inherent delays in the existing system. With the first tier, it is important to recognise that a confident organisation will reconsider its decisions and correct, amend or set them aside if that is appropriate.</p><p>On a practical aspect, I am reassured that existing terms and conditions will be transferred, and that specific workloads will go with the tribunals.</p><p>The tribunals package is set within the wider context of the making justice work programme, which was launched last year. We have heard from the minister about shared venues and administrative support leading to continuous improvement and savings, which can be redirected.</p><p>Since 2010, the Scottish Tribunals Service has supported six tribunals&#8212;I do not think that I need to mention them all&#8212;and they are all vital to our communities, so they must be properly resourced. In 2011-12, &#163;1 million has been saved and there is prospect of saving &#163;5 million overall; some of those savings will transfer immediately to the tier 1 system. The system must be resilient; that is very important.</p><p>The minister referred to the Scottish committee of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council&#8212;a snappy title&#8212;and its report, &#8220;Tribunal Reform in Scotland - A Vision for the Future&#8221;. I will focus on accessibility, which is one aspect of that report.</p><p>With some tribunals, the impression from the outset was that they would be for the layperson. However, that is certainly not my experience of employment tribunals, where there is discomfort about parity of representation and lack of legal representation. Such issues invariably turn a tribunal into the reverse of a layperson&#8217;s forum: a legal forum.</p><p>Accessibility relates not only to geography. There is an opportunity to use technological advances that do not disadvantage rural communities or people with mobility or language issues. That is referred to in the consultation document. The equality impact assessment will consider that. That is again in line with Lord Gill&#8217;s principles in the civil courts review. I make a specific plea for a role for Gaelic in the Lands Tribunal, if not in the other forums.</p><p>I welcome the standardisation of the appointment of tribunal chairs and members. As we have heard, the approach in the past has been fragmented. Resilience is required to deal with the developments to which Mr McLetchie alluded&#8212;the absorption from other jurisdictions&#8212;and future creations of this Parliament or elsewhere. On the exchange between the minister and Mr McLetchie, the discussions that the minister mentioned, which are on-going, follow on from the merger of courts and tribunals in England and Wales in April last year. Although the tribunal arm of that new body can be effective in Scotland, the court arm cannot, so we await with interest the formal consultation on that from the Ministry of Justice this year. I am sure that, through the discussions that have been alluded to, we can agree on budget transfer and the timetable for implementation.</p><p>Another of Lord Gill&#8217;s principles is the encouragement of early resolution. Certainly in my time, employment tribunals latterly operated on the basis that they would not deal with any case in which in-house procedure had not been exhausted. It is important that we have good employer-employee relations and robust grievance procedures and that mediation and management training take place. I mention mediation services and training because those are often the focus of cuts. However, if we are focusing on preventative spend, those are important elements that certainly should not be cut.</p><p>It is welcome that there is to be judicial involvement in the upper-tier tribunal. It is important that the term &#8220;leadership&#8221; is used in relation to the Lord President, given the roles that the Lord President will be expected to undertake, which include training, welfare, guidance, appraisal and discipline of the tribunal judiciary, chairs and members&#8212;I hope that that task will not have to be done with any frequency. Importantly, the Lord President will also have a role in the allocation of cases.</p><p>I commend a phrase from one of the documents with which we have been provided, which states that we need a system that will</p><p>&#8220;be fair and accessible, cost effective and efficient and make proportionate use of resources.&#8221;</p><p>I commend the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664830", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunal System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a potentially interesting subject for someone who happens to be one of the many users of the tribunals service.

Last week, a meeting of the group, which was well attended by members from a variety of parties, dealt with the same issue that we are dealing with today. Such a consensual approach needs to be adopted both within this nation and further afield.</p><p>At that meeting last week, we heard from Amnesty International Scotland, Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and TARA. All made excellent contributions, many of which have been referred to today.</p><p>We heard from Amnesty about its groundbreaking report in 2008, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Slaves&#8221;. The report highlighted the prevalence of human trafficking in Scotland, focusing on women and girls who are trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation and domestic servitude.</p><p>The children&#8217;s commissioner spoke about identifying the number of children involved. Without in any way seeking to minimise the importance of the matter, I would say that the figure given earlier does not tally with a figure that was sent to me in a briefing yesterday&#8212;80 children in the past 18 months, which is clearly 80 too many. The clear consensus is that quantifying the issue is proving to be very difficult.</p><p>We also heard from TARA. It is unfortunate that Malcolm Chisholm is not still in the chamber, because TARA gave examples of the support that is given across the central belt and beyond, and the complexities involved in that. TARA also gave us a very harrowing report about the horrendous circumstances in which some people find themselves, the impact of their incarceration on people who are still in their country of origin, and the predatory individuals who deal with them. Migrant Help works closely with TARA&#8212;both organisations are funded by the Scottish Government&#8212;and last year helped 130 individuals.</p><p>We have heard trafficking described as modern-day slavery. The Equality and Human Rights Commission describes it as &#8220;the underbelly of globalisation&#8221;. It is a global problem, and it is shameful that I can use the words &#8220;Russian mafia&#8221; and &#8220;Isle of Skye&#8221; in the same sentence. That is the reach of the problem, and a global effort from a variety of agencies will be required to tackle the many problems that create the environment in which trafficking flourishes.</p><p>The situation is not helped by the withdrawal of the three specialist UKBA officers who were assigned to Stranraer. The connection between Scotland, the north of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is well understood; trafficking flows in both directions, and was the subject of a prosecution. I was delighted to hear the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments about his discussions.</p><p>There is a contrast in respect of the additional &#163;4 million that the Scottish Government has put into the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency. There is important expertise within the agency, which can deal with international policing and drugs-related issues. Of course, organised crime is not always involved, but it is clear that serious crime, which comes under the SCDEA&#8217;s remit, is involved. The opportunity to stop money laundering and confiscate assets cannot be lost.</p><p>The international dimension is very important. The Serious and Organised Crime Agency leads on that for the UK and runs the trafficking centre. It is important to co-operate across boundaries, not least the boundaries between the nations of these islands.</p><p>Much has been made of the fact that there has been only a single prosecution, although the sentences were certainly salutary. The reality is that there have been related prosecutions for offences involving people living off immoral earnings or for identity card offences and fraud. The issues are not simple. As Roderick Campbell alluded to, many of them were picked up in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010.</p><p>There are limitations on what can be done, given that certain matters are reserved. However, a statutory aggravation for trafficking would be an excellent way of dealing with the issue. It might be a swifter solution, as it could be appended to a variety of already serious crimes. I think that the judiciary would respond accordingly.</p><p>I was reassured by an answer to a parliamentary question to the Lord Advocate, who said:</p><p>&#8220;all human trafficking offences are ... considered by specialist prosecutors at a very early stage to ensure that a specialist and consistent approach is applied to maximise the quality of the investigation and outcome.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 23 June 2011; c 1039.]</p><p>There is so much to say on the subject and so little time.

This is an important debate, but it is not about altering structures, many of which have existed for a long time. Victims and Victim Support are right to highlight some of the concerns that they have expressed. However, they have highlighted to me long-standing concerns about, for example, court structures that see vulnerable witnesses&#8212;albeit that they are escorted, due to the support that is now in place&#8212;going upstairs to the court with a queue standing at the top of the stairs. Some of the buildings are simply not suitable. There are opportunities for shared facilities and for videoconferencing, which is much used in rural areas.</p><p>The motion is about access to justice. The reality is that no one wants to go to court. Access to justice in its broadest sense has been brought about by the reduced likelihood of the requirement to go to court, as a result of the 35-year low in the crime rate. The use of fixed-penalty notices, which has been alluded to, has also reduced the likelihood of people going to court.</p><p>A number of options relate to opening hours and the frequency of court sittings, which can relate to workloads and locations.

One of the most important things that we can do is be positive about our cities. We need some innovation in the economic climate that we face.</p><p>I will speak unashamedly about the Highland capital&#8212;the city in the Highlands, which is a popular destination for many&#8212;and refer to a Highland Council document, &#8220;Inverness City Vision: thinking about the Inverness of the future&#8221;. It is significant that that document was the subject of widespread consultation in conjunction with the Highlands-wide local development plan. The contribution from organisations such as Architecture and Design Scotland was welcome. Significantly, there was a lot of public interest in the consultation. Some of that was reflected in Scotland&#8217;s housing expo, which took place in Inverness and was a great success.</p><p>The first point of the Inverness city vision is that the economy should be at the heart of everything. That priority is shared with the Scottish Government&#8212;indeed, it is the bedrock of everything that we are trying to achieve&#8212;and we know that cities play a significant role in economic growth not only for the nation but for their surrounding regions.</p><p>Collaboration is mentioned in the vision. It is important that not only the Scottish Government and local authorities but&#8212;in the Highlands&#8212;Highlands and Islands Enterprise collaborate. I look forward to a significant chunk of the additional &#163;5&#160;million that the cabinet secretary announced making its way north.</p><p>We hope for positive involvement from the UK Government, but that will prove to be challenging, given the &#163;1.3&#160;billion that has been removed from the budget and the significant attack on capital expenditure.</p><p>Collaboration between the cities through the alliance is also important. In line with that, I commend Jimmy Gray, the Labour provost of Inverness, for the important role that he plays in the alliance for Inverness and, indeed, the Highlands.</p><p>Many other aspects of collaboration will help to bring our cities forward. I commend an initiative that is taking place under the cabinet secretary&#8217;s other portfolio with health and social care in the Highlands. That will improve the wellbeing of the Highlands and provide opportunities for asset management and the sharing of resources. For instance, if we get greater work across the public sector, it will result in the opportunity to free up resources such as Inverness castle.</p><p>I also commend of the role of the Inverness BID Ltd. It is a member-led organisation of large and small businesses that are involved in a constructive dialogue about the future.</p><p>We have heard about the enterprise areas. There is not time to go into all the benefit that will come to the city and the Highlands from that initiative. However, the cabinet secretary referred to life sciences, and Inverness is proud to have world experts in diabetes and world leaders in health research. Developing a niche in such matters provides cities with opportunities.</p><p>I will mention one site that was included in the enterprise area announcement: Nigg. It is not only of Highland, Scottish and UK significance, but of western European significance. The investment in that site will bring rich rewards not only to the immediate Nigg area but to the city of Inverness and the wider region. It will provide the opportunity for growth in the city. There are 111,000 people in the travel-to-work area of Dingwall and Inverness, so that opportunity will be welcome.</p><p>The investment will also be an opportunity to repatriate many of our workers who were involved in the initial oil boom of the 1970s and who now work overseas in, for example, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. It would be really good to see those families return.</p><p>The other matter that is mentioned in the Inverness city vision is strengthening the city centre. There are always negative comments about its city centre, but we need to be positive. One of the positive things that we can say is that, in the Highland Council area, nearly 8,000 businesses no longer pay rates. Whatever the challenges, that is something with which we have been able to help.</p><p>It is important to recognise that, as is mentioned in the Labour amendment, we must build on the city centre regeneration that took place previously. Part of the regeneration in Inverness concerned the visual appearance, which is hugely important to an area that relies on tourism.</p><p>I will race through a few other points. A better connected Inverness is what is sought. The infrastructure plan highlights firm commitments relating to the A9 and the A96. The plans are ambitious, but there is a solid commitment. I hope that Highland Council will meet its end of the commitment by completing the southern distributor road, with the eastern end being funded by the Scottish Government.</p><p>The A96 corridor is an ambitious plan to develop to the east out towards Nairn. That is an area of excellent agricultural land so, although I support the plan in general, I hope that we keep some quality agricultural land, because we all need tatties.</p><p>Improved rail times to the central belt, which require line upgrades, are important. I am a huge supporter of rail. The announcement of the &#163;50&#160;million investment in the Caledonian sleeper is very welcome. That helps with our carbon emissions and there have traditionally been difficulties with the flights to London getting slots anyway, so the sleeper will be a sound investment. I also welcome the commuter trains from Moray, Badenoch and Easter Ross.</p><p>The city benefits from a &#163;51&#160;million investment in Inverness College, which forms part of the University of the Highlands and Islands college system. That will not only retain our young folk but will, I hope, encourage others to come in.</p><p>Much more could be said about the culture of Inverness. We are very proud of Eden Court theatre, the city arts, Inverness Caledonian Thistle&#8212;which attracts people and has raised the city&#8217;s profile&#8212;and the Gaelic hub that we hope to develop.</p><p>It is important to have families living in city centres; we need to have them living above the shops and in other currently empty spaces. There is a lot to be positive about and I hope that everyone will continue to be positive.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agenda for Cities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been an interesting debate.

I would like to pose the question: whose interests are served by the proposals in the report?</p><p>I commend the chapter in the report on the historical background. I joined the police service in 1976 and, as my colleague Graeme Pearson will know, the situation for suspects of crime at that time was&#8212;shall we say it?&#8212;interesting. The report states that the Thomson committee recognised that</p><p>&#8220;By 1980, the situation had ... become unsatisfactory ... suspects were continuing to be effectively held in custody without charge and described somewhat euphemistically as &#8216;helping the police with their enquiries&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>The report also states that the Thomson committee</p><p>&#8220;stressed that Scots law on police questioning was ... grounded ... on a conception of fairness and the need for the courts to control police activity.&#8221;</p><p>The introduction of the legislation that flowed from that committee caused consternation not only among police &#8220;customers&#8221;&#8212;as we might call them nowadays&#8212;but civil libertarians. It was seen as being open to abuse that someone could ordinarily be locked up for six hours. Ironically, those who were previously &#8220;encouraged&#8221; to assist the police with their inquiries found that the legislation brought clarity&#8212;indeed, documented clarity&#8212;about what was going on. I suggest that perhaps, in years hence, Lord Carloway&#8217;s proposals, or at least some of them, might be viewed in a similar light.</p><p>In a liberal democracy, a person&#8217;s status as a witness, suspect or accused cannot be in doubt&#8212;that is a cornerstone of the system. The proposal to have a straight arrest, the abolition of section 14 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and the introduction of an approach in which</p><p>&#8220;the only general power to take a suspect into custody should be the power of arrest&#8221;</p><p>can bring some welcome clarity. I support Lord Carloway&#8217;s recommendations on defining those statuses.</p><p>Graeme Pearson quoted from the report&#8217;s comments on human rights, which is an important issue. Recent cases have caused some concern about the status that human rights have in the Scottish criminal justice system. They have a very high priority. Lest anyone is in any doubt of that, I will repeat what Lord Carloway said. His report states that we</p><p>&#8220;must respect, promote and protect human rights in an effective manner.&#8221;</p><p>It is good to see that in print, and it is also good to see the warning not to bury</p><p>&#8220;human rights deep within legal architecture.&#8221;</p><p>That overt declaration is welcome, because whether it is 12 minutes, 12 hours or 12 days, if we deprive someone of their liberty, there must be checks and balances.</p><p>The clear and unequivocal statement that</p><p>&#8220;a suspect should not be detained unless it is necessary and proportionate&#8221;</p><p>and a similar statement in relation to their detention in custody provide further reassurance.</p><p>As we heard from the cabinet secretary, there are checks and balances along the way, as there is a review by an inspector.</p><p>The additional powers to be granted to the police on the liberation of a suspect must also be welcome. In our future scrutiny, we should also look at voluntary attendance at police stations.</p><p>Hugh Henry touched on the subject of weekend courts in reference to article 5 and the requirement for a suspect to appear promptly. The report refers to the historical situation that anyone who was arrested prior to the conclusion of the court day would expect to appear in court that day, but warns that despite all the advances in transportation and communications, that is not happening. I welcome Lord Carloway&#8217;s comments about minimising detention of people in custody.</p><p>Corroboration has been much discussed in the debate. I have had informal discussions with police representatives who are, some people may be surprised to hear, very content with the law of corroboration. However, I think that that very much reflects the fact that people are often comfortable with the status quo and are resistant to change. Certainly, if there were to be change, there would have to be significant training and a strategy to roll out such training to ensure public confidence.</p><p>We should not underestimate the preventative aspect of the removal of corroboration. If that deterred even a handful of folk from doing something that they might otherwise do and so end up in court, that is to be welcomed. However, as with double jeopardy, we must ensure that the public have a clear understanding of the issue. Part of the police concern is that removal of corroboration would mean that the police would be more vulnerable to complaints against them.</p><p>A key test for me is public confidence. It is important that the public have confidence in the integrity of our system and that they are aware of its limitations and the checks and balances that go with it. I asked Lord Carloway about the issue of public interest, which is clearly not a static thing&#8212;like our law, it evolves. We need to address the issue of unreported crime, to which James Kelly and others referred. We need to encourage people to come forward and report crime.</p><p>As we have heard, further reassurance has been given on the human rights of children and vulnerable adults. There is also the issue of continuity of evidence. In that regard, the practice of two police officers having to go to pick up an item because of corroboration should certainly be dispensed with.</p><p>Whose interests are being served by all this?

It is about respect for the unique features of Scots law.</p><p>When the UK Supreme Court commenced operations on 1 October 2009, it took on the judicial functions of the House of Lords: appeals from England, Scotland and Wales, including human rights issues.</p><p>With regard to Scotland, it was envisaged that the UK Supreme Court would hear civil appeals from the Court of Session. The intention was that the High Court of Justiciary remained the highest court of criminal appeal. One unintended consequence of the inauguration of the UK Supreme Court has been that Scottish criminal case defendants can appeal to the Supreme Court on human rights grounds. That was never imagined when the court was established.</p><p>As we have heard many times, unlike English and Welsh defendants, Scottish defendants can appeal to the Supreme Court without leave to appeal from the High Court. That clearly puts Scots law on a different footing from legal systems elsewhere in the UK.</p><p>I quote Paul McBride QC, who is a much-quoted man in this chamber. He states:</p><p>&#8220;the truth of the matter is&#8212;you can get to the Supreme Court in Scotland by-passing our Scottish courts, you can&#8217;t do that in England. That&#8217;s unacceptable.&#8221;</p><p>I agree that it is unacceptable and it is also unacceptable that the UK Supreme Court has overturned decisions of the High Court of Justiciary.</p><p>The UK Supreme Court should not be ruling on remedy as an ordinary court of appeal. It should be fulfilling its function as a constitutional court: interpreting and defining convention rights and relaying those judgments back to the High Court to determine remedy. This is clearly a matter of devolution not functioning correctly. The original provision in the Scotland Act 1998 never intended matters of criminality to be considered under the locus of devolution issues.</p><p>A matter of Scots identity is at stake. The UK Supreme Court interferes in Scots criminal law and that impacts on the distinctive nature of Scots law. The Scottish Government seeks a position in the Scotland Bill whereby the UK Supreme Court should not have any general jurisdiction in matters relating to criminal law.</p><p>My colleague Rod Campbell quoted from the Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s submission to the Advocate General&#8217;s review of devolution issues. The submission goes on to state:</p><p>&#8220;The European Court of Human Rights has recognised the ... inadvisability of attempting to introduce a &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; approach to disparate systems of criminal justice.&#8221;</p><p>That is something that the chamber should recognise. I hope that the chamber will stand up for Scotland&#8217;s distinctive legal system and prevent further interference.</p><p>I, too, welcome the report published by Lord McCluskey and his colleagues. It was announced on 5 June that there would be a review of the law and practice that currently governs the respective jurisdictions of the High Court of Justiciary and the UK Supreme Court.</p><p>It is important to note that Lord McCluskey and his colleagues considered the issues within the current constitutional settlement. We have heard from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice that that is not necessarily how we will see things in the future.</p><p>We have also heard that we wish the recommendations to be implemented. It is agreed that the Supreme Court should continue to have</p><p>&#8220;an appellate jurisdiction in relation to issues of convention rights arising in Scottish criminal cases&#8221;.</p><p>However, it is important that the extent of its role should be clearly defined and limited. The High Court of Justiciary should remain the final court of appeal in Scottish criminal cases.</p><p>I strongly support the view that an appeal to the Supreme Court from the High Court should require the granting of a certificate that the case raises a point of law of general importance or concerns the victim of a violation of convention rights under the ECHR.</p><p>The existing system whereby the UK Supreme Court is a court of appeal within the criminal justice system is constitutionally problematic and affects the historical independence of Scots law. The Supreme Court&#8217;s role clearly needs to be defined.</p><p>As we have heard, the current Scotland Bill proposals are profoundly flawed and require significant recasting to maintain the High Court of Justiciary as the apex of the Scots legal system. There is no reason to make the position of the High Court different from the position of courts elsewhere in the UK.</p><p>It is disappointing that issues have been raised about the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to human rights. The Government remains fully committed to human rights. My colleague Alison McInnes, along with other members and the Law Society of Scotland, has raised issues about the need for an audit of Scots criminal law to ensure compatibility with the ECHR and avoid costly compensation claims. We all support that. Indeed, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has indicated that that will occur. As we have heard, in any case, that forms part of the scrutiny of any proposed legislation that passes through the Parliament.</p><p>It is important to note that the Scottish Government is not inward looking&#8212;it is outward looking. As my colleagues have said, we have learned from abroad and will continue to do so. It is important that we play our part in international law. We, like all members, are supportive of human rights and social justice, but that does not mean that we will not defend our unique legal system and prevent further interference.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Criminal Law (Integrity)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is about Scots law, not about any other system.

It must improve our children&#8217;s knowledge. I also suggest that it is like the opportunity to clarify, strengthen and consolidate in law reform. That is the route that we are on. No one denies that much work has been done already and that it needs to be built on.</p><p>The curriculum for excellence talks about &#8220;connected learning experience&#8221;. The connection that I would like to be made concerns Scotland&#8217;s place in the world&#8212;how we connect with the world and, indeed, how we connect within the complex society that is Scotland. Who could take exception to</p><p>&#8220;developing a sense of identity, confidence and wellbeing&#8221;?</p><p>Like most nationalists, I am first and foremost an internationalist and I welcome the move to broaden knowledge.</p><p>We must recognise the different traditions within Scotland. Rob Gibson, who is unfortunately not in the chamber, touched on the situation in Caithness, where there is a conflict between some people who wish to term themselves Norse and some who wish to term themselves Gaels. We need to recognise the local dimension that learning can have.</p><p>We also have the Lowland Scots and the rich mix that later joined to make Scotland: people from elsewhere in these islands, such as the two traditions in Ireland; people from the Indian subcontinent; and, more recently, people from Europe. To my mind, they should all be part of Scottish studies. Scotland has always been a refuge for people fleeing from oppression and, notwithstanding what I consider to be the heavy-handed UK Border Agency, long may that continue to be the case. That is an area worth highlighting.</p><p>At lunch time, along with other people, I was part of the celebration of Show Racism the Red Card, which is an excellent example of learning that has a very clear Scottish dimension.</p><p>I am delighted that Arthur Cormack, a well-respected musician and Gaelic authority is on the Scottish studies working group. There is clearly an opportunity to influence what the public thinks should contribute to teaching. A number of members have mentioned Culloden. I would like to see some concentration on Culloden, although not the misty-eyed version that we have heard referred to but the version that highlights the individual greed of aspirant monarchs, the duplicity of clan chiefs and indeed the sacrifice of the indigenous population. Jean Urquhart touched on the aftermath of Culloden; the shameful role played in that by the church and the law as it was at the time needs to be looked at too.</p><p>We know that those dispossessed people were part of a positive advancement across the world, but they were also complicit in some brutal treatment of native Americans, aboriginal peoples, Maoris and the like. I wonder whether there will be a place in Scottish studies for M&#224;iri Mh&#242;r and the battle of the braes in Skye. I hope that there will also be mention of the tanks in George Square, but will there be mention of the British ships that were sent to quell the natives of Skye?</p><p>It is important that we move away from the tea-towel representation of our citizens, despite all their many achievements, and concentrate on the broader aspects, such as the relationship with the Baltic states and Russia, and the role of mercenaries, traders and academics. We also need to look behind those roles for the shared educational experiences that continue to this day through trading with the European Union and the peace that it has brought through our role then and now.</p><p>The minister touched on linguistics. There is well-documented research to show the benefit of bilingualism. It is evident in the Highlands, where there has been a Gaelic renaissance. Perhaps the curriculum could pick up on aspects of that such as the revitalisation of entire communities, particularly in the south end of Skye&#8212;the employment opportunities that have been created there; the little-known fact that some of the courses are so popular that they are provided for German speakers only; the internet opportunities; and the fact that one of the most innovative parts of the globe is in the south of Skye.</p><p>I was brought up in the Highlands amid all the hydro schemes that were the excellent pioneering work of Tom Johnston, the visionary Labour Secretary of State for Scotland at the end of the second world war, but that was never taught to me. It was thought to be more appropriate that I know about Tudor England and the Romans.</p><p>It is important that we all throw our weight behind Scottish studies. I am certain that the concerns about it have been dispelled. I plead that we should not do a disservice to our educational or political structure. Let us dispel the myth that any political party, even one with a majority, could or would wish to pervert our children&#8217;s minds.

There is nothing more embarrassing than seeing the UK Prime Minister peddling arms at a time when nations in the middle east are trying to bring about a peaceful resolution to their difficulties.</p><p>Armaments are a very big business, as is waging wars. Although we all aspire to seeing peace become big business, the reality is that not only war, but aid, is big business&#8212;just ask Halliburton, which does so well out of it. One may ask why big business is so relaxed about wars. It is relaxed about wars as long as the theatre of war is away from the US or the UK.</p><p>I had a few thoughts about peace and I wondered whether an illegal war could result in a legitimate peace. Indeed, what is peace? It will vary. Many oppressive regimes have provided at least basic services for their citizens, whereas replacing the regime with &#8216;freedom&#8217; has resulted in survival of the fittest.</p><p>My instinct remains to support the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, but I wonder whether that will bring about peace. There are obligations placed on the invader, obviously. Does peace mean peace at any price? Quite clearly peace means different things to different people. If there is a withdrawal of troops, there will certainly be trauma associated with that, not least for the women and girls of Afghanistan. The dodgy deal that will bring about the ultimate withdrawal will see intolerant bigots revisit the grief on women and girls there. I wonder whether the west is interested in that. Indeed, is it interested in lasting peace? It is important&#8212;touching on the comments made by other members&#8212;that we look at what we do here, because poverty creates a lot of difficulties.</p><p>When, in any country, the oppressor stops its bullying, that is not real peace. To my mind, that is just a cessation of violence. Some horrendous terms have been associated with peace, including &#8220;shock and awe&#8221; and &#8220;the surge&#8221;. Those are euphemisms for death and few were spared the ravages, although, of course, the oil ministry in Baghdad was.</p><p>Real peace is food, warmth, compassion and social justice. Despite the differences of opinion in the Parliament, I am sure that there is a great wish to see that. The UN has a very important peacekeeping corps. Those are the only soldiers that I would like to see on our planet.</p><p>I have come across some other phrases. Peace building is an interesting phrase, so I will read out one of its lengthy definitions:</p><p>&#8220;Peace building is different from &#8216;peace-making&#8217; and &#8216;peacekeeping&#8217; in that it focuses on creating a long-term culture of peace, rather than solving existing conflicts or preventing old ones from re-occurring.&#8221;</p><p>There are many conflicts around the globe, but I will touch on three: Palestine, Kashmir and Chechnya. If those conflicts were resolved, that might be a step in the right direction.</p><p>Hugh Henry asked what the Parliament can do about the issue. The mere discussion of the subject is very important.

As a police officer, I attended many road accidents in advance of an excellent campaign that I am sure David Stewart is familiar with&#8212;indeed, his colleague Councillor Deirdre Mackay spoke about it in the media last week. Driving ambition is a scheme&#8212;no doubt replicated elsewhere&#8212;through which every effort is made to encourage responsible driver behaviour. Significantly, it also encourages responsible passenger behaviour.

As Jackson Carlaw said, advances in vehicle design have greatly improved the situation. In the past, officers had to attend harrowing scenes involving crushed vehicles. I once dealt with five deaths in a submerged vehicle&#8212;thankfully, such incidents are extremely unusual&#8212;and the complications surrounding that.</p><p>Of course, that was just part of the process. The follow-up to accidents often involved trying to deliver a death message. I have had various responses to that, from having a door slammed in my face to a situation in which I had to establish which of the male relatives in the household was the fatality in the car. Those are all harrowing situations. The statistics are frightening, but the statistics are people&#8212;they are neighbours and loved ones. It is important to say that.</p><p>I am not impressed with the cost figures, although they are important. A cost can be put to some things but what cost do we put on a life? I had a brief discussion with David Stewart about that yesterday. Like me, he attended two funerals last year, those of Callum Matheson and one other young man. Schoolchildren should not be attending funerals in such numbers. If anything can be done to avoid the tragedy that unfolded in both of those cases, that is the route that we have to take. We should rule nothing out.</p><p>To be unashamedly parochial again, suicide is a problem in the Highlands. An awful lot of young people&#8212;far too many young men&#8212;take their own life.

Those who are most affected are, as always, the public sector workers: the very workers who, as we have heard, provide the services that are most vital to our communities. In my view, they should be our most valued workers.</p><p>Is the economy threatened? It is not if you are an international speculator with offshore accounts, given the outsourcing that is going on.

I am delighted that Northern Constabulary now has 300 more officers that it did at the time of amalgamation.</p><p>Now that police officer numbers have been built to a record level, no one wants to see an erosion of the very front line that has delivered a 32-year record low crime rate. Although we are very keen to sustain police officer numbers, that must not&#8212;as our Labour colleague mentioned&#8212;be done at the expense of sacking loyal support staff who have served their communities well, too.</p><p>Funding for the additional 1,000 officers was not provided to have officers sit in offices to replace support staff who were paid much less. It was given to ensure that those officers were out in our cities, towns and villages undertaking their statutory duty to guard, watch and patrol. That 32-year record low crime rate is more than a statistic. It has improved quality of life for our citizens: fewer constituents are assaulted or are the victims of dishonesty, and there is less knife crime. It means safer communities.</p><p>Perceptions of crime are important so, although antisocial behaviour continues to blight many of our communities, it is pleasing to know that the fear of crime is falling for the first time since devolution. That is due in no small part to constables patrolling and reassuring our communities. However, there is no room for complacency, and no reason not to consider whether we can bring about an even more effective police service for our communities, whether they are rural or urban.</p><p>The present structure of the Scottish police service has existed for the past 35 years, and the time is right to review it. The Government has retained an open mind on the future, and is rightly willing to consider all options that can demonstrate long-term sustainability. As with any potential reform, it is important to have meaningful consultation with the staff associations and trade unions. The Scottish Police Federation represents 98 per cent of officers and plays a key role in feeding in front-line officers&#8217; views. Its views are important, whereas the shifting sands of opinion of the chief officer ranks that are represented by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland suggest an element of opportunism that we should treat with caution.</p><p>Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of constabulary for Scotland reported that the country&#8217;s &#8220;smaller&#8221; forces</p><p>&#8220;are unable to afford capacity and capability in all policing specialisms, and to do so would be inefficient ... To maintain their existence as an independent force, they need to protect the core corporate and HQ functions, which are fairly small to start with.&#8221;</p><p>The report indicated that retaining those would have a disproportionate impact on front-line resources. It said that ad hoc collaborations with other forces are appreciated at one level but that they</p><p>&#8220;are not well documented and often sit outside any system of governance by police authorities or the Scottish Government&#8221;.</p><p>There is genuine concern about the issue.</p><p>Just going from eight chauffeur-driven chief constables to one chief constable would save almost &#163;1 million&#8212;enough to pay for 36 new officers. I am sure that that is one option that the public would support. We cannot encourage greater partnership working across the public sector and have eight police empires&#8212;it has to be bobbies, not boundaries.</p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to a transparent and efficient way of providing equal access to policing services across Scotland. Crime is no respecter of boundaries, be they local or national. Democratic accountability is vital, but it is hard to evidence in the present police boards, where there is excessive deference to chief constables, who all too often hide behind statements about their &#8220;operational independence&#8221;. It cannot be right that chief constables should not be subject to the same level of scrutiny from elected representatives as directors of finance or education. They are extremely well remunerated from the public purse, hold an important place in our communities and should be accountable.</p><p>Local accountability is key to local policing. The present eight forces are made up of 27 divisions. Those 27 areas could form the framework for genuine local accountability. For that to be meaningful, it would be important for the officer in charge of each division to be a budget holder, with operational autonomy. Their accountability could be to locally elected councillors.</p><p>The existing police boards are not constituted in such a way as to manage national risks. Local policing must have regard to a national dimension, so the national level, too, will require an accountability structure that is open and transparent and always has clear separation between politicians and practitioners on operational police decisions.</p><p>The outcome of any review will provide an opportunity to consider wider matters, such as how any new structure links with other European forces. It is also time to remove the anomaly of the Scottish Parliament not having control over Scottish police officers&#8217; terms and conditions. It is time to constitute a Scottish police negotiating board.</p><p>In the days of terrorism, international crime and cyber-crime, it is perhaps ironic that the public largely want to see the bobby on the beat. Although the preventive nature of policing is often considered difficult to quantify, it is prevention&#8212;a visible, uniformed deterrent&#8212;that the public want.

There is no dancing around the point: the debate gets straight to the nub of a pernicious issue that affects not just central Scotland. Sadly, it affects people in Scotland and beyond.</p><p>I believe that humans are more tribal than we are perhaps willing to admit, and we often retain a deep interest in other tribes. Some people believe that our tribes are obvious&#8212;being visually apparent by colour of skin and/or mode of dress. Of course, we can never really be sure whether someone is totally loyal to one tribe.</p><p>Ethnicity classification is an important part of our administrative process, but it does not tell the entire story. I have been annoyed on many occasions that a form will not allow me to say what tribe I am from. It is important not to disenfranchise anyone or their tribe.</p><p>Self-classification is important. We all have our identities, and that is particularly true of children from mixed tribes&#8212;if I can use that phrase&#8212;who might elect to alter their identity, depending on parental relationships, at any given time.</p><p>I like to think that I am tolerant, but I have to work at it. I like to think of myself as a civil libertarian. If truth be known, I would be happy to ban some marches&#8212;the marches that I find offensive&#8212;and I therefore have to acknowledge that inconsistency. There is a clear balance to be struck between the right to hold views that others find offensive and the right to voice them publicly with the intention of offending.</p><p>The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles has two entrances: one marked &#8220;For those with prejudice&#8221;, the other marked &#8220;For those without prejudice&#8221;. If someone elects to enter through the door marked &#8220;without prejudice&#8221;, they are directed straight back out on to the street. That is very telling.</p><p>Following the tragic death of Stephen Lawrence, the Macpherson inquiry made a recommendation on the definition of a racist incident, which is that it should be</p><p>&#8220;any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person.&#8221;</p><p>There are therefore clear lines for offence, which we would all recognise, and for perceptions of offence. Of course, my perceptions and sensitivities are worth the same as yours; they are not worth any more than yours.</p><p>I am not an adherent of any religious grouping, but I believe that a longer view must be taken about how we have ended up where we are. When one system largely replaces another, the &#8220;We are better than them&#8221; mentality becomes an important factor for the new adherents. Those who are familiar with the blue-eyed/brown-eyed experiment by Jane Elliott, the American anti-racist activist, will understand how easy it is to corrupt minds. The reformation created anti-Catholic animosity that exists to this day and which I believe contributes to anti-Irishness, too.</p><p>With no wish unwittingly to offend anyone, I warm to a comedian who expresses the view that the world&#8217;s major religions cannot all be right. What I do not find funny is the BBC&#8217;s so-called football comedy programmes that make light of religious intolerance. That attitude of playing down intolerance must end. I also remain deeply uncomfortable about the separation of our young folk on religious grounds for schooling, and about the undemocratic involvement of clergy in our local authority education committees. I believe that an independent Scotland must be a secular Scotland, if we are to have real social justice. I welcome the proposal to introduce new legislation to tackle sectarianism. The changes will be measured, enforceable and specific and will remove anomalies.</p><p>For those who are wondering about my tribe, it is a mish-mash of all sorts, which is the way I want to see a modern Scotland.

The full implications of the United Kingdom coalition's benefits changes may not yet be clear, but our older folk will not escape the attack on the vulnerable, and they will not, of course, be spared the fuel poverty that continues to blight communities in our energy-rich nation while the energy companies make obscene profits. Scottish Power&#8217;s 19 per cent price rise is a case in point.</p><p>I am proud to represent the Highlands and Islands and am very aware of the challenges that its geography poses for the delivery of public services, not least health and social care services. The First Minister&#8217;s assurance of continuity of care for Southern Cross residents has been welcomed in the Highlands, where the company has four homes and the local authority is a key customer. Last year, one of Southern Cross&#8217;s Highland homes was completely destroyed by fire&#8212;thankfully, the 59 residents were unharmed. That home is not to be rebuilt, which perhaps reflects the flawed business model. It was, of course, Highland Council that arranged continuity of care for the residents after the fire.</p><p>It has been said many times in the debate&#8212;and I have no doubt that it will be said again&#8212;that a society is judged by how it treats its older people. I welcome the increased scrutiny that is being placed on those who provide care, not least the unannounced inspections of care homes and the valuable unofficial monitoring role that is undertaken by the various friends-of groups and, in my area, the excellent Highland Senior Citizens Network.</p><p>Scotland has an ageing population, and we have a statutory requirement and, more important, a moral obligation to provide high-quality, publicly funded health and social care for them. There is no doubt that that will prove challenging in the face of unprecedented cuts from London. The largest portion of the NHS&#8217;s &#163;3&#160;billion-plus spend on older people is on emergency admissions, which no one wants. That compares with 7 per cent of the older people&#8217;s budget that is directed to care at home, which everyone wants.</p><p>Care at home and care homes are part of our so-called mixed economy, but I am uncomfortable about profit being associated with care and would welcome greater public sector provision in both areas. I hope that local authorities&#8217; risk registers recognise that, unlike the reassuring words of our First Minister, the market gives no guarantee of continuity of care for residents whom authorities place in private care homes.</p><p>That mixed care economy works only where there is volume, of course. There was no shortage of bidders for Highland&#8217;s care at home contract for the 20-minute home visits in the towns and villages around the Moray Firth, but it is, of course, the council that continues to deal with the person with complex needs who lives miles up a glen that is accessed by a single-track road. Any public sector comparator for future work looks ridiculously expensive when compared with the apparently efficient private sector folk. I regret that care of our older folk is dealt with like grass-cutting or information technology contracts. Let no one be in any doubt that those companies&#8217; primary statutory obligation is to maximise profit for their shareholders.</p><p>The statutory obligation in relation to care rests with the local authority. Although those who become dissatisfied with the level of profit&#8212;invariably, they are the same folk who seek light-touch regulation&#8212;might come and go, the public sector must and will be there to care. In some of our remote communities, there are examples of not-for-profit models of community care working and delivering the quality care at home that reduces emergency admissions. If somebody has to be taken into hospital, any discharge is accelerated by virtue of the additional support at home.</p><p>Welcome, too, are the telehealth advances, which respect people&#8217;s privacy and reduce the need for human interventions. However, although the technology has its place, social contact is vital for our older people. Lunch clubs and social groups, which are often run by volunteers, must continue to enjoy public funding. Their benefits are significant and their closure is devastating to users and to their friends and families. The social mobility that concessionary travel has given our older folk is another positive example of support.</p><p>There is no disputing that we must work to move moneys from dealing with unnecessary emergency admissions to providing quality care at home, in houses that are suitable for our older people. There are good examples of that across the Highlands and Islands where, thanks to funding from the previous Government, the first council houses in a generation have been built, with more to follow. I commend the work that Highland Council and NHS Highland have done on the lead commissioning model and the support that the Government has given that project. However, it is vital that any such major change enjoys the support of staff and their unions. It is fair to report that there might be some way to go with that yet.</p><p>Reassurance is key to caring. The Government cares dearly about the NHS. If the public sector focuses on agreed outcomes, any perceived barriers to integrating social care and healthcare will be avoided. I believe that the results that we should focus on will not be found in the share listing of those who are engaged in profiting from care; instead, they will be found in ensuring that person-centred, safe and efficient care is delivered to our older people, regardless of their location.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Caring for Scotland&#8217;s Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Care of our older people has always been a priority, and older people were the major beneficiaries of the achievements of the previous Government, which delivered the lowest-ever waiting times, a fall in hospital infections and more nurses than ever.
