There will be a partnership between parents and the Parliament, and I thank John Swinney for the work that he has done with me to achieve a really good outcome.</p><p>We underestimate the ability and potential of young children, and we should remember what the nursery education provision will do. There are three primary reasons why we want to increase nursery education for two-year-olds. First, it supplements the excellent work that is undertaken by parents. We should not underestimate the role of parents or undervalue their contribution to their child&#8217;s upbringing.</p><p>Secondly, it is a route out of poverty. I believe, as a liberal, that education is the route out of poverty, and the way to tackle the inequality that we see every day in our communities but are desperate to change. It gives children the crucial extra support that they need.</p><p>James Heckman, whom I have mentioned to John Swinney previously, said that the best investment that we can make in education is before the age of three. The former chief medical officer has talked about brain development and how the relationships between a child and their family and community are crucial at the earliest stages. It is clear that making that investment is essential.</p><p>Finally, the increased provision gives parents the opportunity to get back to work. It is only a small number of hours every week, but the extra step back into the workplace will boost their income and employment. Ultimately, work is good, and we should encourage it.</p><p>So, there are three excellent reasons why we should support the increased provision of nursery education. I am slightly disappointed that it has taken so long to get there, and I hope that fewer barriers are put up next time round. First, we were told that the policy would not work in England; then we were told that we had family nurse partnerships, which were the equivalent, so we did not need to increase provision; then we were told that we could do it only through independence; and then there was no money. We have managed to knock down each barrier. I thank John Swinney for overcoming each of them and for making the decision.</p><p>That would not have happened without the persistence of members such as Malcolm Chisholm and Bob Doris, who is obviously too embarrassed to be here today to have more praise heaped on him by me. Some members have been persistent on the policy since before it was the popular thing to do. I commend the work that they have undertaken.</p><p>Before Christmas, I wrote to John Swinney with five reasonable recommendations and costed proposals on the budget. I have written similar letters in every budget process since I became a member of the Parliament. The first of our proposals was on nursery education, and I am delighted that we have made progress on that. The second was on free school meals, a policy that was announced by Nick Clegg in Glasgow last autumn and which is now being delivered throughout the United Kingdom. On social housing, we suggested an innovative way of using the financial transactions money, and I hope to have further discussions with John Swinney as we progress on that. Colleges have been hit significantly by reductions in spending, so the extra &#163;3.5 million for nursery staff support and development is welcome. We have also had good and constructive discussions with John Swinney on Shetland&#8217;s housing debt and the unique circumstances in which Shetland finds itself on that.</p><p>On all five areas, significant progress has been made and there has been constructive engagement with John Swinney, which leads the Lib Dem group to believe that we can support the budget at decision time tonight. The budget is not the one that we would deliver if we miraculously changed from a group of five members to a majority group in the Parliament, but it is good enough for us to support. As John Swinney knows, we would make radical changes to Scottish Water to release funds to invest in regional development banks, broadband, energy conservation, science and infrastructure. We think that that would be a big investment in the economy and would create 100,000 jobs. Nevertheless, we recognise the position that we are in.</p><p>We recognise the engagement by John Swinney and the improvements that have been made on all five areas that we raised. I am pleased that John Swinney has invited me to be part of the implementation of the nursery education roll-out for two-year-olds. I will work constructively with Aileen Campbell and her officials to ensure that we implement the policy effectively.</p><p>The budget is good enough because John Swinney engaged in the process. It is worth noting, as John Swinney did, the progress on the economy. Growth is up, unemployment is down and employment is up, with 130,000 extra jobs in Scotland and 1.4 million more across the UK. Many members who said that the UK coalition&#8217;s plan would not work are now keen to say that it was their plan all along. Much more needs to be done, however, and we cannot be complacent. We need to continue to make progress on recruiting more people into companies in Scotland. However, today&#8217;s budget is a step in the right direction on nursery education, school meals, social housing, college funding and Shetland&#8217;s housing debt.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today is a good day for young children, as the budget gives us a chance to change their fortunes and enable them to reach their potential.

That is significant progress for a plan that Kenny Gibson and his colleagues said would not work.</p><p>I praise John Swinney for his approach to the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget. He is very open, he is prepared to have discussions and he listens very carefully to our proposals. I am grateful for that approach. We sent him a letter before Christmas in which we set out how we would like the consequentials to be spent and his budget to be shaped. The process does not always work&#8212;we voted against the budget last year although we voted to support it the year before&#8212;but we have already seen significant movement.</p><p>John Swinney knows that I have praised the Scottish Government for getting it right on nursery education and free school meals. Save the Children has warmly welcomed the developments on nursery education&#8212;for which we have been calling for some time and which we are pleased are being introduced&#8212;and free school meals. The fact that so many children in Scotland&#8212;an estimated 40,000&#8212;do not receive free school meals even though they are classed as being in poverty means that something is not right and needs to be reformed, which is why we are in favour of the Government&#8217;s proposals.</p><p>In the letter that we sent to Mr Swinney before Christmas, we made a number of other suggestions, which included match funding for Shetland to deal with its housing debts so that it can invest more in infrastructure. We also suggested extra funding for colleges to make up for the significant drop in funding between 2011-12, when college funding stood at &#163;544 million, and 2014-15, when the proposed funding will be &#163;521 million. We would like college funding to be restored so that some of the damage can be undone.</p><p>The Scottish Government has described financial transactions funding as &#8220;funny money&#8221; and said that it is a con. However, I distinctly remember seeing Nicola Sturgeon in a fluorescent jacket earlier this week, when she praised that &#8220;funny money&#8221; as crucial in helping people to buy housing. The policy&#8217;s popularity is evident&#8212;it is amazing what a difference a year can make, with another Scottish Government conversion to a UK Government proposal. We would like that money to be diverted to increase the amount of social housing that is built in Scotland, as there has been a reduction in spending on that in recent years. We have made that suggestion to Mr Swinney.</p><p>Even so, the budget will not be perfect. It might be good enough for us to vote for it, but we will have to see how discussions develop in the coming weeks. If we were running the budget by ourselves, we would do some things differently. We would use Scottish Water borrowing differently. Rather than lending &#163;150 million to Scottish Water this year, we would allow it to source that funding from the markets because we believe that, as a solid company, it would be able to access that finance elsewhere. That would allow us to undertake some of the actions on fuel poverty and active travel that WWF Scotland is calling for. We need to invest in those areas. It would also allow us to extend nursery provision to the 40 per cent of two-year-olds who are currently being provided for in England.</p><p>That is the progress that we would make. I can say to Mr Swinney that the discussions will continue and that we will be constructive. We look forward to finding ways of reaching agreement on those issues.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22858354", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have admitted that there is a long way to go yet.

By my calculation, the SNP has agreed to reverse only 2 per cent of that &#163;2.5 billion cut, leaving 98 per cent of Iain Duncan Smith&#8217;s budget cuts in place.

That letter set out our reasonable, costed and constructive proposals. I have to say to the finance secretary that his First Minister has rather circumvented those discussions with his announcements on childcare and free school meals. However, I welcome that circumvention. I do not know whether the First Minister is bidding for the finance secretary&#8217;s position as well as everything else, but it is a good step in the right direction.</p><p>It is striking that the debate has not been about whether we increase childcare and nursery education for two-year-olds but about how we do it and what is the constitutional settlement under which we can best achieve that. As a Liberal, I find it heartening that there is a consensus across the Parliament for early intervention to create a life-changing chance for young children, because that has not always been the case. Not everybody has supported the policy. Some people find it quite odd to send two-year-olds into nursery education. They believe that it is quite a young age to do that. I believe that it is the chance for us, together with families, to make a big difference to their life chances.</p><p>As a Liberal, I believe that the way to tackle the ingrained poverty in many parts of Scotland is education. That is why we have supported a pupil premium down south and have been strong advocates of the college education system. It is also why I am pleased that we have the nursery education commitment. It is not quite as much as I would like&#8212;15 per cent in the first year rising to 27 per cent in the second, when I wanted 20 per cent and 40 per cent&#8212;but I am not quibbling because it is a big step in the right direction after 18 months of repeated questions about it. I am delighted.</p><p>I think that Stewart Maxwell&#8217;s contribution to the debate was one of the best. It set out very well the arguments in favour of nursery education&#8212;the impact that it can have on offending rates among children who otherwise would be embedded in crime because of the start that they have had in life, on the work chances for those very same people, and on the opportunities that it gives parents to get back to work because of the relief that it provides.</p><p>However, it is not just about the extra hours. Many professionals in the sector are anxious that we do not just shove children into nursery education establishments without quality being attached to that education. The early years collaborative and the work that Aileen Campbell is doing on this is excellent. We need to focus on quality as much as quantity. Everybody in the chamber should hear about Suzanne Zeedyk&#8217;s work and philosophy on attachment, the excellent lectures that Harry Burns gives on brain development and James Heckman&#8217;s work. Given all that work, I am very pleased that we are taking steps in the right direction.</p><p>I was also pleased to hear what was said about free school meals. The Child Poverty Action Group has advocated guaranteeing young kids a good meal in school every day, so we are happy to support that measure. Good steps in the right direction are being taken.</p><p>We all want to tackle poverty. I do not think that anybody in the chamber is in favour of poverty&#8212;Patrick Harvie is right in that regard&#8212;we just disagree on the mechanism to tackle it. The measure that I favour is that we should make work pay, which is why I am particularly pleased about the progress that we are making on cutting tax for people on low and middle incomes. That makes work pay; it incentivises work when otherwise the decision on whether work pays might be marginal. Those are good steps and I wish that the SNP would support them, so I greatly regret that it does not. Perhaps if I work on the SNP for 18 months I might persuade it on that issue, as well.</p><p>The offers that SNP members have made today&#8212;many of which I agree with&#8212;are predicated on the basis that we will automatically become wealthier if we are independent. Not everybody in the nationalist camp agrees with that; some believe that things are a bit more uncertain and that it is not guaranteed that we will be wealthier, certainly given volatile oil revenues and the fact that our population is ageing faster than that of the rest of the UK&#8212;[Interruption.] The SNP members like to cheer me on when they agree but not when they do not. Perhaps there should be a bit more consistency.</p><p>The important factor is that we cannot simply assume that Scotland will be wealthier, especially when we consider the progress that we are making at UK level&#8212;1.3&#160;million extra jobs in the past three years and 110,000 in Scotland. The increase in Scotland is mirrored; it is almost exactly the same increase as in the rest of the UK. Growth is up and business confidence is up. I would rather base my opportunities and the progress that we are going to make on that economic model than on the precarious economic model that is proposed by the SNP.</p><p>Mark McDonald said that I had junked my speech. I had junked my speech, but that was only when his party junked his policy. I recognise that things have changed today and that good progress is being made in the right direction. I hope that everybody in the chamber embraces it.</p><p>To be serious in conclusion, I am grateful to the First Minister for the announcement that he has made today. I think there is an opportunity for us to work together to ensure that the policy is implemented effectively, because it is important for young children that they are given the best start in life, so that we can say in 20, 30 or 40 years that today in this Parliament we made the right decision.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22825309", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This morning, I received an email from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth&#8217;s office inviting me to come and discuss the budget letter that I sent him before Christmas.

At that time, we had the iron curtain in Europe, the cold war across the world and apartheid in South Africa. Then there was that brief, remarkable time, when Nelson Mandela was out of prison and president of South Africa; V&#225;clav Havel was out of prison and president of the Czech Republic; and Lech Walesa was president of Poland&#8212;three things that had seemed impossible just five years earlier. I can only imagine the impact on those individuals and on the people who had campaigned for decades.</p><p>First among those campaigners in the context of the Scottish Parliament was David Steel, who was a member of the Anti-Apartheid Movement&#8212;he became the movement&#8217;s president&#8212;from his first days in politics in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1986, when he was leader of the Liberal Party, he delivered the annual freedom speech at the University of Cape Town. He has written about that in the past few days, saying that the South African foreign minister, Pik Botha, refused him permission to visit Nelson Mandela and asked why the west was so obsessed with &#8220;this chap&#8221;. Within five years, he knew why. Nelson Mandela led a peaceful but fundamental change to democracy in South Africa.</p><p>We no longer hear the word &#8220;apartheid&#8221;, with all the evil, cruelty, division and injustice that was its true meaning and at the core of that rotten system. The world is a better place for that. Apartheid South Africa was almost alone in the world. We boycotted its goods and shunned its businesses and spokespeople. We can now be proud of the South African embassy in Trafalgar Square in London, but back then people went there only to protest about injustice and to demand Mandela&#8217;s freedom and an end to apartheid.</p><p>Mandela was a leader, a statesman and certainly an inspiration, but he suffered as a man. His daughter Makaziwe spoke yesterday, with something of her father&#8217;s uplifting manner, about how her father sought not just political but spiritual freedom. She spoke about how Mandela thought that if he did not forgive others he would remain imprisoned.</p><p>Such spiritual freedom has been a feature of these days of mourning. There have been personal stories of kindness. I was particularly moved by what Gordon Brown said on the radio a few days ago. He said that after his son was born he received a call, at home, from Nelson Mandela. It was not a routine call of congratulation but a call from a father to a father; an intimate call, from a parent who had lost a son to another who had lost a daughter&#8212;a human touch.</p><p>As Makaziwe reminded us, to her dad was given the strength that enabled him to be the champion of forgiveness and reconciliation. Mandela did not want the hurt that he had suffered to be part of anyone else&#8217;s life. Through his strength, he gave a future to the country of South Africa, which could so easily have failed. He also inspired reconciliation after other conflicts, not least in Northern Ireland, where many brave individuals have put their losses and tragedies behind them.</p><p>In captivity, Nelson Mandela inspired us with his struggle, and on his release he gave us hope across the world. Today, as we reflect on his life, he lifts us again, to work for a better world, where, as he said, we &#8220;close the circle&#8221; and</p><p>&#8220;herald the advent of a glorious summer of a partnership for freedom, peace, prosperity and friendship.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22798425", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Motion of Condolence (Nelson Mandela)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like so many others, I saw today&#8217;s remarkable scenes from Johannesburg, with presidents and prime ministers, archbishops and cardinals, and village choirs and children from Soweto gathered in one place.

The issue was probably all sparked off, to David Clegg&#8217;s great delight, by the Daily Record, which targeted what it called the methadone millionaires.</p><p>I met Mr Houlihan who was a so-called methadone millionaire. He is a pharmacist who has built up his business and works in some of the hardest communities in the west of Scotland. I have never seen a pharmacist more engaged in the interests of the people whom he serves. He wants to change their lives, and I was inspired by his commitment to his community, so I did not recognise him as a methadone millionaire. I think that the profit and the turnover were mixed up on that. He was not, as he was characterised in the Daily Record, somebody who did not care about the people whom he served.</p><p>The report was also inspired by the concern that methadone was triggering a number of deaths from drugs. It should be recognised that many commentators said that it was really about a heroin drought that, in that period, was forcing drug users to experiment with different types of drugs. When people experiment, sometimes things go wrong. Methadone itself was not the problem; there were wider issues at play as well.</p><p>We were also dealing with a group of people who dropped in and out of services and had chaotic lives. I will not say that it is natural for such events to happen to such people, but we could understand the reasons why they happened, which is why a superficial look at the figures was not helpful.</p><p>I am glad that we have got to the bottom of why the number of deaths was increasing, because I am clear that methadone is part of the solution, not part of the problem. If we compare Russia, which does not have a similar needle-exchange and methadone programme, with the United Kingdom and Scotland, we see that the blood-borne virus problems there are far greater than they are here. We should recognise the differences that we have made over time, and I am glad that the Kidd report endorsed the point of view that methadone is part of the solution, not part of the problem.</p><p>I was recently at the Phoenix Futures graduation ceremony in Glasgow. I was a wee bit daunted by going into the Woodside halls in Glasgow, I have to say. There were a lot of people who&#8212;how can I put it?&#8212;have seen the hard end of life. Many of them had tattoos on their knuckles and had various other marks. However, when I went in, it struck me that they were all hugging one another. They were hard people and had seen difficult bits of their communities, but they were hugging one another.</p><p>That was a mark of the success of Phoenix Futures. The organisation has created recovery communities&#8212;people who look after the emotional side of one another&#8217;s needs. It was a tremendous recommendation. Those people were delighted to have graduated out of drugs misuse, and that is the kind of project that we should celebrate.</p><p>I also attended a project in Kirkcaldy not long ago and met a young man who said that he was more frightened of recovery than he was of drugs misuse. He was recovering but he said that, having come off drugs, he now saw the world and had to face up to all his demons, from which he had managed to hide in the past. He said that it was getting more difficult being in recovery. Members can understand why people dip in and out of recovery over time and that it is not easy to progress naturally from methadone to abstinence.</p><p>Yesterday&#8217;s Scottish Drugs Forum conference was an excellent event that focused on trauma. Jim Eadie is right that poverty and deprivation are major contributory factors to drug misuse, but traumatic events in people&#8217;s lives&#8212;regardless of the background that they come from; people from wealthy backgrounds as well as people from poor backgrounds are affected&#8212;are significant, too. The SDF&#8217;s event focused on the effect of trauma&#8212;not just the trauma of one-off events, but longer-term trauma.</p><p>Elaine Murray is right that there is still a bit of debate about what recovery is. I think that there is a general understanding that recovery means improvement and that it is different for everyone. Some people in the sector view recovery as complete abstinence, although I would not say that they are the majority. I think that that is a healthy debate. When I was at the Phoenix Futures event, someone said that they condemned methadone&#8212;they did not like touching it one bit&#8212;but the majority of people I meet in the drug misuse community recognise that it has a role to play.</p><p>The issue is not just about medicine; it is also about the mind and the wider factors in life. Another consideration is the degree of compulsion that should be involved. To what extent should we encourage drug users to undergo treatment? People would never be compelled to undergo treatment, but how far along the track from encouragement to compulsion should we go? That is critical. There is also a lively debate about residential treatment versus community treatment.</p><p>I think that the biggest shake-up that is needed is in the NHS. We need to try to get the NHS in the wider sense to engage properly. Drug abuse affects a range of services from housing to health to justice. Justice takes the lead, but the NHS needs to take a lead, too. That is why it is important that the medical director should be the lead person when it comes to opioid replacement. We need a person in the NHS to take a much more comprehensive lead on such matters.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22768223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Expert Review of Opioid Replacement Therapies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The change in the debate on this subject compared with last year is remarkable and I welcome the fact that we have got back to more of a consensus on drugs misuse.

She was very firm. No matter what happened around her, she was determined to carry on and achieve what she had set out to achieve.</p><p>I shared a constituency with Helen for four years, and I saw at first hand the quality of service that she provided to her constituents. It was therefore no surprise when I turned up&#8212;early, I thought&#8212;at the service at Dalgety Bay and found that the hall was already packed. There were several rooms to go into, and people were standing outside. To me, that showed the respect that people in the constituency and in the Labour Party had for her. She attracted the great and good of the Labour Party, with a former Prime Minister making a tribute and her friend Baroness Ramsay making such a personal contribution to the service. We also had Cathy Peattie singing a beautiful song and members of her family doing a reading during the service. That showed that she had so many dimensions to her life, and there was clear affection from her constituents.</p><p>Like Ruth Davidson and many others, I feared Helen Eadie. It was not a secret that she did not really like Liberal Democrats. She did not like Jim Tolson&#8212;[Laughter.] Now, now. I do not think that she liked me too often, or certainly not my views on proportional representation, and I do not think that she was the greatest fan of the coalition between the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and she certainly let me know it. In what I think was her last speech in the Parliament, she accused me of several things, but the very next day she was out being kind and warm and smiling, with that huge grin that immediately put people at ease. She was able to separate the personal from the political. Some of us find that hard, because we have great passion for our politics, but not Helen&#8212;she could separate the two.</p><p>I remember once campaigning in Cardenden in the Glenrothes by-election when it was bucketing with rain. A car screeched to a halt, and I saw Bob Eadie in the driving seat, then Helen bounced out to berate me about my latest misdemeanour in the constituency. However, the very next day, she had a big smile and a kind heart&#8212;she recognised that we were politicians together and we had a battle together.</p><p>Helen was colourful. I have laughed many times and so fondly at some of her enterprises, such as her demand about the Equal Opportunities Committee and her escapade in Cowdenbeath when she challenged young people on an estate, managed to escape and then called for a curfew in Cowdenbeath. She had a one-woman campaign to ban the amber traffic light to bring Scotland in line with Bulgaria, which she loved so much. She was not afraid of sticking out, saying different things and being colourful. We need colourful politicians like Helen, as they contribute so much.</p><p>Helen was clearly a socialist. I am not a socialist, but her commitment to socialism inspired me. She was never cynical at all, and she always believed and was optimistic. She was driven, passionate and optimistic and she cared for her constituents. I saw that at first hand as an MP in the constituency that we shared&#8212;she was often there before me on issues. She cared and she delivered results. She was a warm personality, with that huge big grin of hers.</p><p>Helen, today, we are celebrating your life.

The appropriate measures will be taken at Westminster to introduce changes to the Equality Act 2010, which will protect the individuals about whom John Mason talked. We need to ensure that Scotland joins the nations of the world that have equal marriage on the statute book, because it is a mark of the modern society that I want Scotland to become.</p><p>I would like the Scottish Parliament to match what is happening on childcare in England. This week, thousands of two-year-olds in England will get the chance&#8212;the right&#8212;to have 15 hours of nursery education each week. The First Minister has denied Scottish children that, but he could change all that. He could concede that Professor James Heckman is right when he says that the best education investment takes place before the age of three. There is an opportunity to improve young people&#8217;s life chances through education. If the First Minister wanted to, he could include such a proposal in his legislative programme.</p><p>In his statement, the First Minister spent much time on outlining new&#8212;and sometimes old&#8212;initiatives on community empowerment, which is close to my heart. I am sure that we will look carefully at the proposals that he makes, and that we will support measures to give communities more powers. However, the reality and the record are something different, after the centralisation of our police and fire services, which was one of the biggest transfers of power from local government to central Government since devolution&#8212;so much for community empowerment.</p><p>Recent news has shown that the economy is on the mend and that we are moving towards recovery. This morning, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development gave a positive assessment of growth. Substantial progress has been made on the UK Government&#8217;s plan to cut the deficit, which has since 2010 reduced by a third as a percentage of gross domestic product.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in the past year on job creation and reducing unemployment. Although the Scottish figures wobble from month to month, it is clear that we are benefiting from the 1&#160;million new private sector jobs that have been created across the UK.</p><p>The challenges that are faced by the hundreds of thousands of people in Scotland who are still out of work need to be met by our two Governments working together. I support much of what the Scottish Government does on growth and employment, but it is important that it and its agencies promote the UK schemes that are available in Scotland, too. For example, the UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey shows that there are fewer companies in Scotland with apprentices than there are in the rest of the UK.</p><p>Scottish businesses will get &#163;2,000 off their national insurance from next April because of the changes that the UK Government is making. I want ministers in both Governments to promote that so that small businesses think about using the savings to take on an apprentice or another employee.</p><p>I also want to hear Scottish ministers telling Scottish companies about the &#163;1&#160;billion youth contract that provides businesses with up to &#163;2,275 per person for a job, training or work experience, and about the funding-for-lending scheme and the business bank, which will provide billions of pounds of low-cost capital.</p><p>There is also the UK enterprise capital fund, which is worth &#163;200&#160;million, and the annual investment allowance for plant and machinery, which is being increased from &#163;25,000 to &#163;250,000 for two years. The UK Green Investment Bank, which is based in Edinburgh, has &#163;3.8&#160;billion-worth of UK Government money to help to unblock the financing of renewables projects. It is my hope that the Scottish Government will work closely with the UK Government to maximise those opportunities for Scotland.</p><p>The next 12 months will set the course of this country for the next 300 years and more. The power that is vested in the hands of the people who live in our great nation is immense. I am in no doubt that everyone in this chamber wants the best for Scotland; we just disagree on how we want to achieve it. My support for a strong Scottish Parliament with home rule in a strong partnership with the United Kingdom is on the record. The stakes are high and the risks are great, but the opportunity of a renewed constitutional settlement within the UK is within our grasp.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am.

He transferred that result&#8212;a majority of 500&#8212;to a majority of 7,000 in subsequent elections. In every successive election, he increased his majority.

Here, however, it was very calm, in part due to Brian&#8217;s skill and determination. He made a success of it, and he did so in his own gentle but firm characteristic way. He was quite a man; he was quite a character.</p><p>I am sure that bucking trends was quite tiring, but what impressed me most throughout was that he managed to remain a good and decent man, a man of whom his family and friends will forever be proud. In the worlds of science, elections and Parliament and, most of all, at home, Brian was valued and appreciated.</p><p>We need more people like Brian in politics&#8212;trusted, respected and good.

That is another priority for the Government.</p><p>I accept that freezing the council tax is a good thing in good times, but it does not really address climate change, the demographic challenge or poverty. That is why Gavin Brown is absolutely right when he says that we need 10-year projections so that we can look into the future to see the sustainability of the policies and review them individually and collectively, so that they stay sustainable and continue to address the big challenges that we face on age, climate change and poverty.

He should always be proud of doing so and I will give him any encouragement that he needs at any time for that.</p><p>I think that in what has been a reasonable debate, three main arguments were drawn out about universalism as a principle and as a policy. One was from Clare Adamson, who talked about buy-in. The argument that, in order for society as a whole to buy in and contribute to taxation, people need to get something back from doing so, is quite compelling. There is a strong argument in favour of things being free in order for people to feel that they are part of that wider society.</p><p>However, I do not think that we should allow people to believe that other services are not universal. If we concede that only things that were once charged for but are now free are the universal services, that ignores roads, schools, hospitals and the police service, for instance. I regard all those as being universal services that are available to everybody. We have never charged for those services&#8212;except, I presume, before the NHS&#8212;but people do not regard them as &#8220;universal&#8221;. As part of the argument, we need to be able to explain to people that universal services go beyond prescription charges, bus services and tuition fees. That is important; however, Clare Adamson made a valid point.</p><p>Mark McDonald&#8217;s point about stigma was also interesting. One of the main arguments for free school meals was that kids seeing their friends getting free meals when they are not getting free meals causes a divide within the school. I accept that part of the argument. However, as Malcolm Chisholm pointed out, most of the welfare benefits that are reserved to Westminster are targeted, not universal, so we need to be careful with that principle. We accept that it is an issue that should be factored into the debate, but it is not an absolute that we would apply at all times, otherwise the cost would be extortionate.</p><p>The other argument is that it costs more to means test. I am sure that, under some circumstances&#8212;perhaps for prescriptions&#8212;that is the case. If the overall cost is not significant, means testing may not be of value. However, again, we should not extrapolate that principle from the limited areas that it covers just now, otherwise everything would be free because means testing would be so expensive that it would not be worth doing. Those were important points to raise, but they should not be taken as broader golden principles that should never be breached.</p><p>Although, as Bob Doris was, everybody has been reasonable in saying that the debate is all about choices, many members have talked about universalism as a principle, but I heard nobody say that the principle of universalism should apply to the services that I mentioned earlier&#8212;dental treatment, eye treatment and home care up in Perth and Kinross&#8212;or to legal aid, which others have mentioned. Nobody has proposed going further. I take Jamie Hepburn&#8217;s point that the debate is perhaps about how far we take universalism. If that had been publicly stated by the First Minister today in his speech to the Scottish Trades Union Congress, I would have more respect for the position. However, the position is being presented as a golden principle that has never been breached and which only the SNP can protect. We know that that is simply not the case; other parties support universal services in many areas, including the NHS, schools, the police, nurseries and roads.</p><p>Welfare reform has been mentioned by several members. I agree with Christine Grahame about the rhetoric about &#8220;strivers and skivers&#8221;. I do not buy into that, and it does not help for politicians at Westminster to make the case that such a divide exists. Many people need that safety net and should never be considered as skivers.</p><p>However, along with Christina McKelvie, Christine Grahame did not propose any change to the welfare budget at Westminster. I accept that a big proportion of the welfare budget is pensions, but the rest of it is welfare and it is very expensive. We need to find a way to reform it. Everybody says that we need to reform it, but nobody says how we should reform it. Those who are not in favour of any reform need to consider that the cost of restoring welfare benefits in Scotland would be &#163;2.5&#160;billion. I have not heard anybody in the chamber today suggest how they would pay for that, although what Parliament has to deal with is how to pay for things.</p><p>As Graeme Pearson and Liz Smith said, this is about affordability. We need to grapple with the competing and conflicting choices that we face. If we do not do that as a Parliament, we are letting the country down.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688369", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Universal Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Bob Doris should never be embarrassed about praising the UK Government for some of its tax changes.

They had become accustomed to the sirens and the missiles.</p><p>That was repeated over and over again during the three-day visit of the House of Commons Defence Committee to Basra, Umm Qasr and Baghdad. During that visit, 40 missiles fell within range. Even the green zone in Baghdad was not spared the infringements. We were due to meet the Iraqi president, but his house had been hit that very day. The missiles were a normal, daily occurrence. They were a matter of fact.</p><p>That was in 2007&#8212;four years after Tony Blair and George Bush made that fateful decision to invade.</p><p>A few weeks after I visited Iraq, I was at the funeral of Scott Kennedy. He was a young soldier who died in Iraq, blown up by a roadside bomb. His funeral was in Oakley, in my constituency. The community turned out en masse to show their support for the family. They recognised the difference between the armed forces and the Government. They recognised the talent and commitment of their soldiers, but disagreed with the war.</p><p>A normal occurrence in Iraq, which happened every day of the week at the time, cost Scott Kennedy his life, and it cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, friends and relatives. We felt it in Fife that Scott Kennedy had lost his life, but in Iraq many others whom we did not know also lost their lives. Just today, another 48 people have died and scores have been injured in bomb attacks in Baghdad. The war cost us &#163;1 trillion but, a decade on, Iraq is still rocked with instability and division. The war was based on a false premise. It was illegal, costly, bloody and just plain wrong. [Applause.]</p><p>Although I am proud that our party opposed the war, I am more ashamed that our country went to war in Iraq. It was a war that secured the support of the UK Parliament and this Parliament. I am ashamed that that happened, and of the intervention by the Labour Government, with the support of the Conservatives. I praise John Lamont for his contribution. I disagree with what he said, but I commend him for standing up and saying it because people need to hear why the case was made for the Iraq war.</p><p>Back in 1999, Tony Blair laid out new criteria for what he believed was humanitarian intervention. Those principles were not wrong; he just did not stick to them. His failure to adhere to those principles damaged not just the principles but, as we have heard, lives.</p><p>It is often said that countries, generals and leaders fight the last war rather than the next one. Decisions taken often reflect more the success or failure of previous conflicts rather than the special circumstances of the next. Iraq was affected by the success of Kosovo, Sierra Leone and, to a limited extent at the time, Afghanistan. However, failure in Iraq should not preclude future action elsewhere. It should not alter our collective responsibility to support freedom and protect human rights around the world. Doing nothing can be as bad as cavalier adventurism. No war is ever won; it is just that some are less bad than others. However, always sitting on our hands can be even worse.</p><p>What tests, then, would we apply to future military action? If we are to have a serious debate, that is what we should focus on. I have four simple tests. The first is whether military action is legal under international law. Secondly, does it command local and regional support? That is also important. Thirdly, are we confident that it will alleviate suffering? Finally, and often most controversially, is the United Nations behind it, or, in the absence of that support, are there reasons to intervene on clear humanitarian grounds?</p><p>Those are the questions that we need to apply to future conflicts. In Libya, I would say that the limited special forces action and air strikes relieved suffering. We secured the support of Arab countries surrounding Libya. We also secured a strong mandate from the UN and our action was judged legal. I would say that it passed the test. We also passed the test in Mali.</p><p>Syria is the biggest test because the United Nations is clearly divided. With Russia standing firmly behind its ally, we have been limited to humanitarian aid. However, thousands of people are suffering and lots of people have died. Many more will die in future. The UK Government, along with many other European Union countries, has agreed to provide non-lethal equipment to the Opposition in Syria but has refused to rule out further support. It is a really difficult test. Do we stand aside when more people die in Syria? We need constantly to reapply the tests that I set out, which are whether we have regional support, whether action is legal and whether we have UN support.</p><p>I supported the 1 million British people who marched against the war in 2003. They were not duped by Saddam Hussein and his deception and cruelty, but what they could not understand was why the containment and deterrence approach was to be abandoned; nor did they accept that military intervention was justified. They did not believe that Saddam Hussein was a good guy. They believed that the measures that were being taken were sufficient at the time and they were not convinced of the need for military action. They feared the wider consequences in the middle east, for Israel and Palestine, but also for the Iraqi people. They were anxious about Bush adventurism and revenge for the perceived failures of his father. They were concerned by the actions of a seemingly overcompliant UK Administration that was too eager to please George Bush. It is a shame that this Parliament and the Westminster Parliament did not listen to those people more carefully.</p><p>For Scott Kennedy and the hundreds of thousands of others who have lost their lives, it is imperative that we study our history and learn our lessons. That could be their legacy.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-05981.1, to insert after &#8220;UN resolution&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;; regrets the decision of the Labour government, with the support of the Conservatives, to press ahead with the invasion despite considerable opposition and many warnings about the danger of armed conflict; is of the view that the intervention was illegal under international law&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq Invasion (10th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When the sirens whined, we dived to the floor, struggling with our flak jackets and helmets, yet the local politicians carried on as if nothing had happened, despite the risk.

He was speaking to a man who had been sentenced by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime to a punishment for mistakenly writing on Saddam Hussein&#8217;s head on a currency note. The punishment was to be death by acid bath. That was Saddam Hussein. That was the brutal dictator who we were dealing with at the time. I therefore have a huge amount of sympathy for those who found it to be a difficult decision to make when they supported the Iraq war.</p><p>I fully accept that Ann Clwyd, with her stories&#8212;and I have listened to Ann Clwyd on this in the House of Commons&#8212;makes a compelling case about the minorities who were punished in Iraq. I have heard the stories that John Lamont mentioned about the thousands of Kurds and Shias who were put to death under Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime. I have heard the stories about the marsh Arabs, who suffered after they were left high and dry after the first Gulf war. They thought that they were going to get the full support of the allies against Saddam Hussein at that time, only to be left in the lurch. I understand all those stories, but the four tests that I mentioned earlier&#8212;that were absolutely required to be met in order to go ahead with the war&#8212;were not followed.</p><p>Tony Blair made a compelling case; the simplistic argument&#8212;&#8220;If you knew what I knew&#8221;&#8212;is very compelling. He tried to tempt us into believing that he knew much more than he was able to tell us. It was quite an attractive argument and I can understand how so many were seduced by it. I do not condemn those who took the decision to support the war. I disagreed with them fundamentally. I was opposed to the war, my party was opposed to the war and I am glad that we were opposed to the war, because we did not believe that there was justification for the war.</p><p>Kevin Stewart made an excellent speech, with his remarks about Allan Douglas and the turmoil that Allan Douglas&#8217;s family has gone through since. I have had to sit in the House of Commons when Gordon Brown&#8212;and Tony Blair before him&#8212;read out the weekly roll-call of the dead. It was a sobering experience. It brought it home that we had made a decision in the House of Commons to go to war and as a result, this roll-call was now being read out and 179 men and women died in Iraq. Allan Douglas was one of them&#8212;one of the brave. We need to remind ourselves of those personal stories. Joan McAlpine&#8217;s story about a victim on the other side, Ali Abbas, was equally compelling. He was one of hundreds of thousands who suffered as a result of what happened in Iraq.</p><p>Those stories are important. We should not just think of such things in geostrategic and geopolitical terms. It is all about the individual&#8212;what does it do to the individual? Drew Smith made a good speech about veterans. Again, this is one of the lessons that we have to learn&#8212;about looking after the people who fought for the nation on our behalf. The problems around alcohol, prison and homelessness are well recognised. The Scottish Government and the UK Government have made good progress. The priority treatment for veterans is excellent. Headley Court down in the south-east of England is a fantastic facility. If members ever get a chance to go and see it, please go and see it. Veterans first point, at the other end of Princes Street, provides an excellent service, in particular for people who are suffering from mental health problems and also from combat stress, down in Ayr and elsewhere in the UK. It provides excellent facilities to deal with the problems that Drew Smith rightly highlighted. That is one of the lessons from Iraq&#8212;that we improve the support for those who have fought on our behalf.</p><p>Iraq has been unstable since the start of the war. The shift in the balance of power between Iraq and Iran has been quite significant. Iran is quite a manipulative nation; it gets its tentacles all over that part of the world. When I was in Basra, I saw the effect of Iran&#8217;s influence in the south of Iraq. It was funding some of the terrorist groups in the south. It managed to kidnap some of our sailors in the Gulf. We should be wary whenever we intervene within a region; we have to be conscious of the balance of power between all the different stakeholders and countries, because if we unsettle that balance, there are unintended consequences.</p><p>I disagree with Fiona McLeod.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq Invasion (10th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Back to the Liberal party days&#8212;that would be wonderful.

I had been quite attracted to that new technology&#8212;until 5 o&#8217;clock this morning, when I was woken by the battery dying on my carbon monoxide detector.</p><p>The second time I woke up, I listened to a radio discussion of an issue that is relevant to the debate: that the UK is lagging behind other countries in both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. There has been much mention of the shocking disparity in healthy life expectancy between Scotland&#8217;s poorest and wealthiest areas, ranging from 56 years in the east end of Glasgow to 70 just up the road in East Dunbartonshire. However, although we acknowledge such differences, we should not forget that we are probably lagging behind other countries&#8212;most significantly, Japan&#8212;that are making overall progress on health. The difference in healthy life expectancy between East Dunbartonshire and Japan is 10 years, so we should not take for granted or be complacent about the progress that we still need to make. This is not just about health inequalities, but about our overall health. After all, we celebrate the health improvements that we have made but the fact is that there is still an awful lot more work to do.</p><p>Early signs are emerging that we are not really prepared for this change in the demographic. My colleague Jim Hume has raised many times the issue of emergency hospital admissions, which he found to be at a 10-year high for elderly people. That significant number suggests that we are not prepared for what we knew to be coming. Like Malcolm Chisholm, I accept that previous Governments have not done enough in this regard and just hope that we can get things right now. Lord Sutherland was right to point out that although &#163;4.5&#160;billion is spent on social care for the elderly, &#163;1.5&#160;billion of that goes on emergency admissions. We need to make better use of that &#163;1.5&#160;billion to prevent such admissions and give elderly people the better quality of life that they deserve.</p><p>I do not minimise the challenge that faces the Scottish Government and I acknowledge the financial pressures that it is under, especially with the&#8212;I believe, necessary&#8212;reductions in its finance. That said, even if we were to have maintained the increases in finances that the Labour Government delivered over a number of years, we would still have a significant gap between demand and the money that would be available to meet it. We are going to have to change how the country works, which is why I acknowledge in many ways John Swinney&#8217;s comment about the need to find new ways of delivering services. Carrying on with the current model is neither financially sustainable nor sustainable in personnel, and we need a radical change.</p><p>We talk a lot about planning for the future, but the fact is that our consideration of these matters has a very short lifespan or takes place in a very short timescale. Many councils still work to three-year cycles; it is good that the City of Edinburgh Council has taken a 10-year view, but we all need to be looking way beyond that to ensure that we future-proof the available services.</p><p>John Swinney made a very good point about the need to shift from the old model of delivering services to the new one. It is tough to do those things, because when outdated services are shut down to create space for new services, people object. That is where the challenge is, and that is why it is important that Parliaments such as this come together when we recognise that the old delivery models are unsustainable and that we need to move towards a new model. People get attracted to buildings and old-style services, so we need to explain that we need, in order to be sustainable and maintain standards, to deliver new service models.</p><p>One of those models is to keep people at home. The case manager model has been delivered, although I am not sure how widespread it is now. Case managers would be closely involved in ensuring that people could stay in their own homes, by integrating services for that individual and pooling social services, healthcare and transport. Service models such as that are required to move towards sustainable service. That is the immediate issue for preventative spend. A lot of this is about prevention. How do we deal with the immediate crisis and avoid that &#163;1.5&#160;billion cost of emergency admissions to hospital?</p><p>We also need to consider medium-term measures, which I would class as things such as public health initiatives on smoking, diet and minimum pricing on alcohol, which we supported. It is important that the smoking strategy comes out with meaningful targets and measures, and that we do not set targets that will not be delivered because action is not taken. Dr Harry Burns is interesting in that regard. He said that it is important to do that work on smoking, diet and alcohol minimum pricing.</p><p>However, that is only medium-term work. We need to do much more over the longer term to change people&#8217;s life chances. Harry Burns is very aware that we need to move towards enriching early life, because that gives the best hope of intervening in the irrational cycle of disadvantage that can continue over a long period. We think that we need things such as nursery education for three-year-olds, which many members will have heard me talk about before, to try to break the cycle of disadvantage. If we can give people the tools to look after themselves and earn, we can look towards ensuring that they do not fall into the disadvantage that many others fall into. Therefore, our immediate crisis measures and the medium-term measures that we take on smoking and alcohol minimum pricing will not be required, because we will have managed to change the way that people progress through their lives.</p><p>The Carnegie UK Trust has done some very good work on proposing changes to the way that public services work so that we do not just provide services to people&#8212;so that we do not do things to people, but do things with people to enable them to do things for themselves, rather than always be provided with a service. I think that we should be moving towards the enabling state. That is not the style in which public services currently operate; we tend to think of commissioning a service for somebody that needs something, rather than working with them to deliver a new kind of service.</p><p>It is important that Nesta&#8217;s work is respected and supported, because it is looking at trying to improve community capacity&#8212;the ability of a family in a community to look after itself, rather than always to rely on the state to provide support.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Several members have mentioned telecare and other new technology that allows elderly people to stay in their own homes.

I know that many members in the chamber oppose the cuts at Westminster, but even if those cuts had not happened, there would still be an enormous challenge to overcome. If we want to maintain the standards of services to which we have become accustomed, we are going to have to change the way that we supply those services.</p><p>That is why the Carnegie Trust&#8217;s report &#8220;The Enabling State&#8221; was welcome.

If members can put up with John Seddon&#8217;s criticisms, it is worth listening to what he has to say.</p><p>I am concerned about how far we are going to go with shared services. I accept that we need to deal with bed blocking and the integration of social care services and health services. However, how far do we go with dealing with the problems at the interface? Bed blocking is the issue just now, but if we get problems in community transport or housing in the future, will the answer be simply to enlarge the organisation to include them? We need to be careful about how much we believe that straightforward structural reorganisation to create bigger structures will necessarily deal with the problems.

Mr Swinney promised that the funding floor would be 85 per cent. He gives a long explanation of his thinking, which, I am sure, convinces some people.

That will have a significant impact over the years to come. When John Swinney winds up the debate, I hope that he will at least reflect on the fact that the commitment has not been maintained, and I hope that it will be maintained in future settlements. Such commitments are important.</p><p>In the few seconds that I have left, I will reflect on what I think should be the direction of travel in Scottish politics in years to come. Many parties in the Parliament are in favour of more powers for this Parliament, some more than others. I do not think that it should necessarily stop at Holyrood. We also need to consider the transfer of powers to local government. That is why, in our proposals for home rule in a federal UK, we have set out that council tax and business rate powers should be much more in the hands of local government, so that it, too, can have control over the purse strings. Holding the purse strings brings fiscal responsibility in the same way that holding the purse strings in this place, in partnership with the UK, is what we should be trying to achieve.

It cannot both claim to be fiscally responsible and, at the same time, not deal with the welfare state. It needs to be dealt with because it is not sustainable and it is not possible to carry on as we are. The SNP&#8217;s continuing claim that no reform is required lacks credibility.</p><p>I recognise that the child benefit changes are not ideal. It is a bit of a crude way of changing the system, but it avoids an expensive means-testing process. I do not think that we can really argue that the top priority should be to protect the highest earners in the country&#8212;the wealthiest 15 per cent. I think that it is reasonable to target that group if we are reforming other parts of the welfare state. Although it is not ideal and I would prefer not to do it, I believe that needs must as we reform the welfare state.</p><p>Having listened to the speeches from the SNP benches, and some from the Labour benches, one might think that all reform is bad and that nothing should ever change. To me, some of the changes to the welfare state are pretty good.</p><p>We all have our own examples of people who we meet in our constituencies and who tell us their story about the welfare system and the changes. Not so long ago, I met a family who told me that they would like to work but it would not pay and it would be difficult to go out to work. They have their family interests at heart&#8212;I commend them for that&#8212;but they have decided to stay on benefits because it is too difficult and they would not earn enough to work.</p><p>The welfare state traps on benefits people who would like to go to work. We have a situation in which someone has to wait five weeks before they get their benefits back if they do not keep the job that they have sought. That happens on many occasions. People fear losing the job that they are going for, so it is not financially worth it to go for it. That is why we have made changes to make work pay, to cut tax on low and middle incomes, and to cap the welfare benefits. In itself, that reform will encourage people into work&#8212;and we must all agree in this chamber that work is good for families. We need to encourage people to go to work: it is a good thing. We seem to hear from some people that work is a bad thing that we do not want to encourage or incentivise, but I believe that we need to create a welfare state that encourages.</p><p>Let me gently respond to Christina McKelvie. She said that we are attacking women, but she needs to look at just two things. First, the improvements to maternity entitlements have made a significant change to women in work. Secondly, she should consider nursery education for two-year-olds.

We would support such extra investment to give 40 per cent of the poorest two-year-olds in Scotland 15 hours of nursery education each week. The Nobel laureate James Heckman, whom I have mentioned on numerous occasions, says that the highest return on investment in education is on investment in education before the age of three. That is when the biggest impact can be made. If we make the right investment at that time in a person&#8217;s life, we can determine what the outcome for them will be at the age of 26.</p><p>So far, the Scottish Government has committed to free childcare and education for 1 per cent of two-year-olds. We think that that is good, but that the figure needs to be increased to 40 per cent. We recognise that that cannot be done in one fell swoop and that such a move has to be phased in over a period of time. In England, the UK Government is looking to extend such provision to 20 per cent of two-year-olds by September this year, and to increase that figure to 40 per cent at a later stage.

A guarantee was made to Aberdeen City Council that it would receive 85 per cent of the average figure for council funding in Scotland. However, there has been a drop to 79 per cent. Mr Swinney has tried to explain why that calculation can be made only at the start of the spending process, but I find that explanation difficult to understand. The guarantee was given that no council would receive less than 85 per cent of the average figure, but next year Aberdeen City Council will receive only 79 per cent of that amount. As 79 per cent is less than 85 per cent, its funding has gone through the floor. I hope that Mr Swinney will reflect on that.

The vote on Iain Gray&#8217;s amendment was disappointing because the Government did not take the opportunity to send out a clear signal that the housing associations are going to be included. It could have also done that for schools and public-private partnership contractors because the public has a right to know.

I do not doubt that it is complicated, but I am puzzled as to why, at that time, he boasted about the amount of money that he was going to spend through the complicated and difficult NPD process. Nothing substantial has changed since then. There was a Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government at that time, so he knew what the landscape was going to look like, yet he ploughed ahead and predicted. This year, he is having to make significant reductions, as Gavin Brown said, from &#163;353&#160;million to &#163;20&#160;million. I am not sure what has changed in that time. Perhaps the finance secretary could set that out in his summing up.</p><p>The Finance Committee&#8217;s report is a very good one. It is pretty thorough and looks at the detail in identifying from where the extra capital from revenue has come. The committee is right to have identified that there does not seem to be much clarity about which revenue areas have suffered.</p><p>On the change funds, the committee is right to ask exactly what the benefit of the extra investment has been. Some groups, including the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations&#8212;which, I must say, I am not used to quoting&#8212;have highlighted concern about where that money is going and where it is coming from. The committee is right to have identified that we need greater monitoring and evaluation of those funds. If we are to convince the sceptics that early intervention is worth while, we need to have the evidence to prove it.</p><p>An explanation is also needed for why the early years fund seems to have been cut by &#163;14&#160;million. There does not seem to be an explanation from the Government on that, so perhaps the finance secretary could set that out.</p><p>The committee rightly requests information on whether the Government intends to progress with the Christie commission&#8217;s recommendation on a duty to consider preventative measures in budgets. Again, I would welcome a response from the finance secretary on whether there will be a duty on local authorities to consider such matters.</p><p>The NUS is running its&#8212;almost annual&#8212;campaign to secure a reversal of the &#163;35&#160;million cut in this year&#8217;s funding for further education colleges. That is worthy of support. We have campaigned with the NUS in the past and we will do so again, and we hope that the finance secretary listens.</p><p>On the funding for Aberdeen City Council, when I asked the finance secretary previously about the floor that the Scottish Government set in previous years whereby each council would receive at least 85 per cent of the Scottish average revenue funding, he reassured me that that would be met. However, nothing seems to be forthcoming on how the Government will meet Aberdeen&#8217;s &#163;25&#160;million shortfall. Aberdeen City Council&#8217;s current level of funding seems to be at 78 per cent of the Scottish average, which is well short of the 85 per cent floor&#8212;hence the &#163;25&#160;million shortfall.</p><p>We welcome the extra money for social housing that was announced yesterday, but I want to be reassured that the new money will go into genuinely affordable housing. There is concern in the sector about where the money will be targeted.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On what Mark McDonald just said, I wonder why, if independence would deliver so many jobs and so much success, recovery and prosperity, the SNP is waiting for two years.

We were sceptical about the proposed mechanism in that regard, but we support the policy and are pleased that it is moving forward.</p><p>The order also delivers a referendum that will be overseen by the Electoral Commission.

Treating the Electoral Commission with respect in that regard is especially important.</p><p>Fundamentally, as my colleague Michael Moore said, this is about delivering a legal, fair and decisive referendum, and I believe that the section 30 order does that.

That promise was to deliver a single-question referendum. We in the Liberal Democrats were pleased to be able to help our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament to deliver a manifesto promise.</p><p>We also commend Bruce Crawford for the work that he did in the early stages as a Government minister and in the latter stages as a member of the committee. There were extreme voices on either side of the debate: people such as Michael Forsyth in the House of Lords, who believed that it should all be done in London and that nobody in Scotland or in the SNP should be trusted to do any of it, and others who said that London should have nothing to do with it, that it should all be done here and that nobody else should have a say. Bruce Crawford and latterly Nicola Sturgeon, but also my colleague Michael Moore managed to calmly but determinedly see their way through the myriad difficulties in achieving this. They achieved it, and I am pleased that they have done so.</p><p>However, there is one thing that I want to address. I think that we are slightly exaggerating the significance of paragraph 30. Of course the Government of the remainder of the United Kingdom and the Scottish Government would work constructively. We would expect neighbours to work constructively, and that would be the case. However, it does not necessarily mean that a foreign Government&#8212;that of the remainder of the United Kingdom&#8212;would accede or agree to every single demand of the foreign Scottish Government. We need to get this in context. Of course there will be respect, and both Governments will respect the outcome.

In 1993, the Calcutt review concluded that the PCC was not an effective regulator of the press and recommended the setting up of a press complaints tribunal that was backed by statute. Only last year, David Cameron told the Commons:</p><p>&#8220;I accept we can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s the last-chance saloon all over again. We&#8217;ve done that.&#8221;</p><p>The press has had six chances over six decades. I would say that that is too many chances over too many decades. I heard the Prime Minister say this morning that</p><p>&#8220;the clock is ticking for this to be sorted out&#8221;,</p><p>but the clock has been ticking for six decades. We have had many chances over 60 years. Now is the time to legislate for an independent body.</p><p>Liberal Democrat members and our colleagues at Westminster support a vigorous free press that holds the powerful to account and which is not subject to political interference, but a free press does not and cannot mean a press that is free to bully innocent people or to abuse grieving families. People who feel that they have been mistreated by powerful newspapers need to know that there is someone who is prepared to stand up for them. If we are to uphold our responsibility and our duty, what the McCanns felt must not be felt by anyone else. That is why we need an independent watchdog that is underpinned by the law, to which people can turn and to which newspapers must listen, and in response to which they must act.</p><p>We support some of the specific recommendations in the Leveson report. We have some concerns about the role of Ofcom, to which the First Minister referred. We are not quite sure that its duty as a regulator of broadcast media fits well with a role as a recognising body for independent watchdogs. We do not think that that is necessarily the way ahead, but we need to have independent self-regulation overseen by an independent board, which needs to be appointed in an independent, fair, open and transparent way and must have carrots and sticks&#8212;incentives&#8212;available to it to ensure that people take part in the system. We also need a recognition body, although, as I said, I do not think that it necessarily should be Ofcom.</p><p>On the cross-border issues, I understand what the First Minister is saying about the responsibility in this Parliament in terms of defamation, but there is another aspect, which is the Ofcom aspect. We cannot have two authenticating or recognition bodies across the UK. If we did, it would mean that Scotland would be restricted to only having an independent watchdog in Scotland.</p><p>To me, the authentication or recognition body needs to be at a UK level, so that we have the option: if the press in Scotland decides that it will have an independent watchdog just for Scotland, it can choose to do that, because one of the possibilities is that a multitude of bodies might apply to be watchdogs. However, by saying that only this Parliament should authorise or legislate for the authentication body&#8212;not the defamation body&#8212;we are limiting options and reducing chances; in fact, we are ruling out the possibility of there being a UK-wide independent body.</p><p>If the First Minister wants to intervene, I will take his intervention.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Leveson Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, &#8220;We desperately wanted to shout out, &#8216;It&#8217;s not true, it&#8217;s not true,&#8217; but when it&#8217;s your voice against a powerful media, it just doesn&#8217;t have weight.&#8221; That was the voice of Kate McCann.

We often condemn others for generalising about society, groups and minorities. We should not generalise about the press. I hope that the press up in the gallery are still listening.</p><p>I was reassured by some of the First Minister&#8217;s remarks earlier about the potential for a cross-border independent watchdog. If he is saying that it could be the courts&#8212;and perhaps the Scottish courts&#8212;rather than Ofcom that authenticates or authorises the independent watchdog, and that there could be the potential for dual registration that would allow for UK-wide independent watchdog status for organisations, that would be a step forward. This Parliament does have to take responsibility, but we should recognise that we have passed legislative consent motions in the past and that Westminster is perfectly capable of doing so as well as legislating for Scotland. However, I think that we should see how this develops over time and, if we can do it here, we should do it here. The most important thing in this regard, though, is to consider members of the public who want to make a complaint against the media&#8212;doing so should be simple, quick and cheap. If they have to work out which regulatory body they have to go to and that increases the costs, that is something that we should be against.</p><p>I will look to have discussions on this with the First Minister on Thursday, but if we can achieve a UK-wide independent watchdog in order to make the process simple, that would be a positive thing that I would welcome. However, we should engage at a UK level. I encourage the First Minister to touch base with the UK party leaders and have a discussion with them. I think that his contribution to such a discussion would be helpful. It might help to persuade my colleagues in the UK coalition to see the light and perhaps agree to legislative underpinning of the process. I think that the First Minister&#8217;s involvement in that would be welcome.</p><p>The Prime Minister said back on 7 October that he would implement Leveson if it was not &#8220;bonkers&#8221;. I do not think that Leveson is bonkers and we have not heard anybody describe it as bonkers since. I therefore hope that the Prime Minister might just look back at what he said on 7 October and agree that legislative underpinning, as a central part of Leveson, is something that we should proceed with.</p><p>John Mason was right to say that we need to strike a careful balance. It is important that we recognise the freedom of the press as well as the freedom of the public&#8212;freedom of the public from bullying and intimidation by newspapers and the freedom of the press to scrutinise people such as me and others in the chamber. It is important that we protect that freedom. We should not go from one extreme to the other and condemn all the press and say that everything they do is wrong, because that is not the case. As Marco Biagi said, the press is already limited by the law&#8212;limitations are in place. What we are debating is what the extent of that and of the state&#8217;s involvement should be. I think that having legislative underpinning of an independent watchdog is something that we should support.</p><p>When we talk about independence, we should also recognise that the PCC is hardly independent of politics. Three of the past five chairs of the PCC have been Tory politicians. We could therefore argue that the independent watchdog that we support, underpinned by the law, would be a much more independent body than the PCC currently is. The media should welcome separating the politicians from the press in that regard. It would give the press protections as well. The carrots and sticks that we have talked about would provide protection for the media and would mean that lengthy court cases that cost them a lot of money would not drag on&#8212;it would give them some great advantages.</p><p>Hugh Henry was right when he said that we need a process that is available not just to the wealthy, who can afford to pursue it; it should be for all. Again, cheap, easy, quick redress for members of the public through a process that everybody recognises is something that we support.</p><p>I commend Colin Keir for being the only SNP back bencher who decided to defend the First Minister on the back of Leveson, but when the First Minister says &#8220;cannot be criticised&#8221;, he takes it out of context and is quoting selectively. The question for the First Minister is this: if he had his time over again, what would he do? If he was making that phone call to Jeremy Hunt or to Vince Cable, the secretaries of state, what would he do? Would he ask them to take jobs into account and act unlawfully, according to Lord Justice Leveson? That is not what I expect from a First Minister. He cannot simply say that it is their responsibility to take that into account; he needs to recognise that he, as First Minister, also has a responsibility.</p><p>I do not want to sour a reasonably hopeful and positive contribution&#8212;[Interruption.]</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Leveson Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Margo MacDonald made a good contribution, because what she managed to identify, along with many others, is that there are good journalists and that we should not generalise.

However, we have to ensure that management understands the position. I have heard lots of different examples of people trying to play games and withhold information. We need to encourage people to be much more open so that we can learn lessons from our mistakes.</p><p>We need to address that issue because, as the Deputy First Minister has said, there has been an erosion. Lots of public money is now no longer under public scrutiny. The public can access information about Barlinnie, but not about Kilmarnock prison. Tenants in South Lanarkshire can get information about their landlord, but Glasgow tenants cannot, because their landlord is a housing association. In East Lothian, responsibility for leisure facilities was transferred to an arm&#8217;s-length organisation, which meant, again, that the information was not available. Those are examples of the issues that we need to address.</p><p>I was pleased with the tone of the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s comments. I welcome what she said about there being an annual review. I hope that that is followed through quickly so that there can be a regular review and we can deal with the many organisations that have now fallen outwith public scrutiny.</p><p>However, I disagreed whole-heartedly with Bruce Crawford&#8217;s remarks about the economy. It was an argument almost against freedom of information. I know that he endorses FOI, but to argue that there are certain circumstances&#8212;including those that involve the economy&#8212;in which it should be suspended is not worthy. We need to embrace it. It is an issue that helps us to learn how to govern properly and no excuses, including the economy, should be used. FOI should be seen not as a burden, but as an opportunity.</p><p>There is an opportunity in the bill to make the necessary changes. I have suggested that there should be an opportunity for public authorities to make a designation at the time of the creation of new bodies, when they could consider whether they should be included in the FOI regime. That would mean that we would not have to play catch-up on an annual basis or even more frequently. We need to create the opportunity for that to be done at the time, which will require both an amendment to the bill and the annual review that the Deputy First Minister talked about.</p><p>The Deputy First Minister also mentioned the need to consider other avenues for public access to information. Kevin Dunion has commented on that. He said:</p><p>&#8220;My second concern is the view being expressed that other initiatives can improve access to information held by those bodies, so that designation is not necessary. However welcome efforts at greater transparency may be, none can provide the benefits of FOISA, namely a statutory right to information and in particular the right for a dissatisfied requester to appeal to the Commissioner.&#8221;</p><p>That process is well known, well tried and well tested. People know that they can use freedom of information legislation to get access to information. Other members, including Michael McMahon, have commented that the other mechanisms are not as tried and tested and that people are not as familiar with them.</p><p>I think that we should stick with what works. We should extend the coverage so that we make steps back to the ground that we have lost in recent months. Iain Gray is right when he says that there has been a loss of confidence in the Government on freedom of information because of numerous episodes, many of which he referred to. The one thing that the Government could do to dispel that perception is change the bill in the way that I have described and extend the coverage so that we can get the principle of following the money.

I met one of them, whom I will call Mary, when I visited Turning Point Scotland&#8217;s facility in Glasgow. She had a young son and her ambition was to be able to take her young son to school in the morning after giving him breakfast. That was her lofty ambition&#8212;something that for us would be quite normal. If we have kids, we do such things every day, but for her it was an amazing ambition, because she did not see in what circumstances she could achieve it. Her son was getting looked after by her brother on an almost permanent basis.</p><p>I said that about Mary because we talk about big numbers and big programmes, but at the end of the day people like Mary are normal people who deserve a chance like anyone else. Some of the ways in which we talk about them and whether they do or do not contribute to society demonise them but, for me, they deserve a chance. They would love to go back and have another chance, and we should respect them for the tremendously difficult challenges that they go through. They go in and out of drug use; sometimes they are in remission and sometimes they relapse and go back into serious drug use. Such is the chaotic life that those people lead.</p><p>Mary was on methadone, along with 24,000 other people. However, for me the central methadone issue is about health professionals choosing the right way to proceed. It is not for politicians to decide which treatments can and cannot be used; it is about giving the health professionals the tools. They have the evidence and the know-how and are the best people to make decisions to help people out of their circumstances. Recovery means different things for different people. Sometimes it is about being able to stay alive; for other people it is about getting back into work. For Mary, it is about being able to take her son to school in the morning. That is why it is regrettable to see some of the stuff that has been happening in the Daily Record, supported by some in the Labour Party. Demonising pharmacists just for doing their job is deeply regrettable.</p><p>Often, we focus only on the medical aspects of drug use, but much of the issue is to do with a person&#8217;s whole life experience. Perhaps they have mental health problems, housing problems or debt. Perhaps they have a chaotic family life and have been divorced. Perhaps they have had experiences in the military that have led them into drug use or alcohol use. We must sort out those issues as well if we expect people to recover long term. However, we must also recognise that sometimes people will have a chaotic lifestyle for some time. The simplistic view is that somehow we can get people into recovery automatically, if only we change one little thing, but that is just not going to happen.</p><p>I have been to some projects, including the Lothian and Edinburgh abstinence programme&#8212;LEAP&#8212;in Edinburgh. I saw its abstinence regime. It is not right for everybody, but it is right for some people. They brought the whole family in to share the experience and ensure that people were able to recover on a long-term basis.</p><p>It is a shame on this country that we have such a high proportion of drug users when we have such wealth. Poverty&#8212;the pockets of poverty that we have in many communities&#8212;is the root of much of the situation.

There is a big divide between drug users and the communities in which they live. I put up a Facebook posting about drug use the other day, and the response showed that a lot of people believe that drug users should be cut off. We need to recognise that there is a huge divide. People do not understand why drug users receive support, and we have a big job to do to convince people about the merits of providing support.</p><p>In many ways, the methadone programme and other support services are enlightened self-interest in ensuring that our communities are safe.

It is not possible for both what Nicola Sturgeon said and what Alex Salmond said to be right.

Did he mean the legal advice in terms of the debate that underpinned all Government documents that had ever been published in the past six years, or the legal advice that, even though it did not actually exist, he went to court to keep secret, wasting taxpayers&#8217; money and fighting the Scottish Information Commissioner?

The present situation is bad for Scotland; confidence in what ministers say to us has been shattered. Two ministers said opposite things. They cannot both be right, and scrutiny by a judge would allow the Scottish Government to regain trust. As a result, I support the Labour Party&#8217;s proposal.</p><p>Even more significant is what last week&#8217;s statement means for the wider debate on an independent Scotland&#8217;s membership of the EU. The SNP expects us to believe its assertions, but by its admission it has just been guessing. It did not have the legal advice that would have underpinned its assertions; it has just been guessing about Scotland&#8217;s continuing membership of the EU. This is so important because independence is not just like any other piece of legislation, which can be repealed. There is no going back. Once you become independent, there is no turning back.

We are just into a big guessing game now, and we cannot simply rely on guesses. If the SNP is wrong in its assertion that we would be an automatic member of the European Union, it could be extremely significant. [Interruption.] I said &#8220;automatic member&#8221;; SNP members should listen very carefully.</p><p>Perhaps, like any other new member of the European Union, we would have to join the euro and the fiscal stability pact. That means that the Scottish deficit would need to be reduced from 7.2 per cent&#8212;[Interruption.] Members should listen, because they might learn something. The deficit would need to be reduced from 7.2 to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. That would mean &#163;5 billion off the budget or &#163;5 billion on taxes.

No one would have thought that last week, given the hysterical reaction from the SNP benches. It was hysterical to the point of trying to shut down the debate, which is interesting because it was two reports that the SNP Government commissioned&#8212;the reports of the independent budget review and the Christie commission&#8212;that asked for a non-polarised debate and transparency, as Gavin Brown suggested, on the cost of universal benefits. The independent budget review also said that the universal benefits were commendable but may simply no longer be affordable and called for a debate. I am pleased that Jamie Hepburn now thinks that there should be a debate because I, too, think that there should be one.</p><p>That does not mean that we are against universal benefits. The Liberal Democrats and our colleagues in the Labour Party, when we were in government together, delivered many universal benefits including free dental and eye checks, free personal care, free tuition&#8212;I whisper that one&#8212;and free bus passes. We delivered many universal benefits together&#8212;it was not the SNP that delivered those, although one would not think that now. We delivered those things together, and we are not against universal benefits in principle. The issue is not universalism but what wider benefit we get from the investment, which must be evidence based.</p><p>For instance, we face big challenges on health&#8212;as one of the sickest nations in Europe, we need to tackle that&#8212;and on life chances and social mobility. We also face huge challenges on climate change and, with our ageing population, on demographics. Those are the principles that we should be addressing and the big goals that we should be trying to deal with.</p><p>On free eye checks, for example, there was a report by the Association of Optometrists&#8212;one might say that they would say this anyway, but the report includes some excellent figures&#8212;suggesting that the cost of poor-sightedness is around &#163;2 billion a year. Free eye checks costs around &#163;30 million, but the return is in the order of &#163;400 million because there are an extra 300,000 eye tests a year. That is a good thing to have. That is the wider benefit of preventive health; the principle there is about preventive health rather than universalism as the policy helps us to deal with a greater goal.</p><p>On life chances, the tax thresholds that we are changing at Westminster are taking a whole load of people who are on lower incomes scales out of tax altogether. That is a good thing. It is a social good to try to improve social mobility.</p><p>On nursery education for two-year-olds, we are failing miserably here in Scotland. In</p><p>England, 40 per cent of two-year-olds receive nursery education support whereas in Scotland only 1 per cent do. In England, the most disadvantaged receive support, whereas only 1 per cent do so up here. I want us to do more, and I welcome Nicola Sturgeon&#8217;s remarks on that last week.</p><p>Look also at the pupil premium that we are introducing down south, which is based on free school meal entitlement. A whole load of people from disadvantaged backgrounds are getting extra support, which improves their life chances.</p><p>On climate change, the insulation programme applies irrespective of income. We have a big challenge on the climate, so that is where the investment should go. It is not just about universalism. In some ways, the debate, although welcome, is actually not about universalism versus not&#8212;that is what Jackie Baillie was referring to&#8212;but about what other goals we are trying to achieve.</p><p>On free personal care&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673958", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is interesting that Jamie Hepburn started his sometimes reasonable speech by saying that he welcomed the debate.

I enjoy going to events such as the Fife show or to places such as Carnegie College. I enjoy meeting people on such occasions, but I think that I would find it hard if I faced doing that almost every day for the next 42 years, as I would have to do to match the Queen&#8217;s diary.

Across the country, when the Queen goes on visits, she brings joy to people&#8217;s faces and manages to create excitement and a real sense of celebrity. We should never ignore and should always admire that.</p><p>We should also remember how well judged her attendances at the Scottish Parliament always are.

It is pioneering legislation and she is out there in front, proposing a measure that a lot of people will not like. We talk about the bill in Parliament as if it will be immensely popular. However, if it is going to be effective, a lot of people will not like it. Introducing such legislation takes a certain amount of courage, so I thank Nicola Sturgeon for the effort that she has put in over a number of years, despite opposition from my party, from the Conservatives and from Labour.</p><p>I have always believed in minimum pricing. I had to be relatively quiet about that in the past, but I have always been supportive of it&#8212;I always was at Westminster. The party in Scotland was finely balanced&#8212;it was not absolutely against minimum pricing, but the decision that the party came to was that it did not support it. I had to charm party members and I had to work on them when I became leader. Fortunately, they agreed with me and they now support the bill. I am pleased that we have put our differences with the SNP aside and are now working for the bill.</p><p>For me, the evidence is quite clear. The important connections, as referred to by Kenneth Gibson, are the connection between price and consumption, and between consumption and harm. If we look back 30 years, drink is more affordable now by between 45 per cent and 70 per cent. Price has gone up by 22 per cent, but incomes have gone up dramatically more than that&#8212;by 97 per cent in that period&#8212;so drink is much more affordable.</p><p>In the same period, consumption has gone up by 20 to 22 per cent and the number of deaths has doubled. As I have mentioned previously, I used to work in my father&#8217;s shop and I cannot see a dramatic difference between the prices of whisky now and the prices that my father used to sell it at. That is simple and straightforward evidence that everybody can see.</p><p>I have seen at first hand in Dunfermline the problems in our communities. There is antisocial behaviour and families that are absolutely wrecked by alcohol abuse and the health problems that it causes. People are desperate to get into hospital to get treatment so that they can deal with their alcohol problems. That is clear evidence and a clear result.</p><p>We could easily go down the route of just doing the simple things that everybody suggests, such as education and information, but the reality is that the tougher we make the measures, the more impact they will have. I ask the Labour Party how long we have to wait for the perfect solution before we move ahead? The bill might not be exactly right and it might not have exactly the desired effect according to the predictions, but let us get on with it because the situation is dire.</p><p>I referred earlier to public concern. I am a frequent user of Facebook and whenever I put up something about alcohol minimum pricing, the negative reaction is considerable. People out there will be angry about the measure, but if they are not angry, that is because we are not having an effect. For measures to be effective in reducing alcohol abuse, some people will have to feel them. That is why it is important that we move ahead with the bill. We have to be prepared for the backlash that I am sure will come.</p><p>I am grateful for the support of the organisations that are represented in the public gallery. Health bodies such as the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and Alcohol Focus Scotland support the bill, but there are also some surprising supporters, including Tesco, as I have mentioned previously. That is the kind of backing that we will need to get us through the coming period. The battle to deal with the problem has just begun.

It is a significant step, for us as Liberal Democrats, towards a home rule Parliament in the United Kingdom. The details of the bill&#8212;which have been covered this afternoon and include income tax, air weapons, drink-drive limits, national speed limits, stamp duty, landfill tax and borrowing powers&#8212;are significant steps towards what we want to achieve.</p><p>Other members have referred to the fact that we have wanted other powers too, and there is no denying that. In fact, we are proud of our long tradition of campaigning for a home rule Parliament, and we have worked together with others to deliver that. Those changes will bring significant fiscal responsibility and control over our own affairs here to the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>We should remember that the Calman commission was set up by the Parliament not one year ago, but four years ago. Its work led, after much considered debate, to the white paper that the Labour Party presented to the House of Commons during the previous Parliament. Subsequently, all three of the parties that supported the Calman commission put the implementation of its recommendations in their manifestos.</p><p>One of the first acts of my colleague Danny Alexander, who was initially the Secretary of State for Scotland following the last general election, was to press ahead with the Scotland Bill. It has received extensive scrutiny from two committees of the Scottish Parliament and in an extended session at Westminster, and it has been the subject of endless debate in the media. The bill has been scrutinised endlessly.</p><p>We must contrast that with what the SNP has done. Initially, it refused to take part in the Calman process; it even refused to submit evidence to the commission. When it came to the Scottish elections, the SNP had six big demands. Although it whispered those demands during the election campaign, they were red lines that it insisted the UK Government had to agree to&#8212;but it failed to make its case.</p><p>Anyone who watched the proceedings of the Scotland Bill Committee will have been surprised at the level of ineffectiveness of the Scottish Government. The first paper that it produced was on the Crown estate. It was seven pages long, two of which were a history lesson; another page consisted of a map. The remaining pages were poorly argued proposals for the devolution of the Crown estate. The paper was not prepared properly.</p><p>I turn to broadcasting. Stewart Maxwell likes rugby, and most of the Scotland Bill Committee&#8217;s evidence session on the broadcasting element of the Scottish Government&#8217;s demands was about rugby and Stewart Maxwell&#8217;s interest in it. I do not have anything against rugby, but that is not what we were talking about.</p><p>We thought that the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals on corporation tax would be similar to those for Northern Ireland, but that turned out not to be the case. Northern Ireland wanted control of the headline rate, whereas the Scottish Government wanted full devolution of the tax. We did not discover that until much later in the process, when the Scottish Government presented its paper to the committee, by which time much discussion had already taken place. Again, the Government&#8217;s paper was flimsy, poorly argued and poorly prepared.</p><p>We have heard about what happened on excise duty. We were a long way into the process before we received the Scottish Government&#8217;s paper. We had already taken evidence from the alcohol groups, some of which said that devolution of excise duty would be a good thing, when we discovered that we were talking only about assignation rather than devolution, because of the implications for customs posts.

His remarks about the leader of the Liberal Democrats were absolutely spot on, and I will listen to him more carefully in future debates.</p><p>My dad was a grocer in Auchtermuchty and Strathmiglo, and I used to work in the shop in the evening after school and on Saturdays. The price of the drink that my dad sold&#8212;bottles of vodka and whisky&#8212;is not greatly different from the price of drink now, 30 years later. The evidence that has been produced for this debate shows that alcohol is between 44 and 69 per cent more affordable than it was at that time, which confirms my recollection of the prices at that period. The price of alcohol has gone up by 22 per cent, but incomes have gone up by 97 per cent, according to some of the studies, which means that alcohol is much more affordable than it used to be.</p><p>Those figures can be tied to consumption, which has risen by 22 per cent since 1980. The committee&#8217;s report says clearly that</p><p>&#8220;there is a body of evidence that links price to consumption, and consumption to harm.&#8221;</p><p>That is a simple, straightforward statement, and I agree with it.</p><p>When I worked in the shop, I saw alcoholics coming in. I could smell the drink on their breath and knew that they came in every day&#8212;sometimes at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning, buying their cans of Special Brew. They had serious problems with drink, even back then. The problem has multiplied since that time. When I was the MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, people would come traipsing through the door to ask about how they could get access to specialist support in hospitals for their severe alcohol problems. I saw a variety of other cases as well, including pensioners who were deeply concerned about antisocial behaviour outside their houses night after night.</p><p>The problem is severe. Since 1980, the annual alcohol-related death rate has doubled from 641 to more than 1,300. The evidence is clear, and we should accept that we need to put in place a serious measure.</p><p>There is a correlation between how difficult something is to do and the impact that can be made. Education is easy. Politicians can always call for more education. We can send out leaflets and give talks, but the impact of that is not great. The stuff that is hard to do politically is to rig prices, but that has the biggest impact. We have to bite the bullet. The devastation that cheap alcohol causes in communities&#8212;it sometimes has the biggest impact in the poorest communities&#8212;means that we have a duty to make an impact on the problem.</p><p>We have the evidence from the experts, who almost all agree with minimum pricing. The British Medical Association, Alcohol Focus Scotland and the Royal College of Psychiatrists have overwhelming evidence. Consider the time and effort that they have committed to the campaign and the number of doctors and nurses who write to me and say, &#8220;You have to do something about this.&#8221; That shows us their view. They have the evidence. There will be debates about the stuff on the edge, but if there will be fewer deaths&#8212;the evidence is there that there will be&#8212;we should support minimum pricing.</p><p>We have the expert groups on side, we know about the problem and we have part of the solution, which is to deal with price, so we need to get on with it. Even Tesco is on side. Lucy Neville Rolfe from Tesco stated:</p><p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t put up our prices because that would be commercial suicide, and we can&#8217;t act together to put up prices because that would be against competition law. The only safe solution is for the government to bring forward legislative proposals which Tesco and others in our industry can support.&#8221;</p><p>Tesco is asking for minimum pricing, although others disagree.

We have made a number of suggestions for changes to the budget. Not everything is there, but the priorities that the cabinet secretary has set out for the additional money reflect some of the priorities for which we have argued. For example, on colleges&#8212;it depends on how one reads the figures&#8212;I think that we have gone roughly halfway to the &#163;38&#160;million cut, depending on whether we include the &#163;15&#160;million, the &#163;6&#160;million for youth unemployment and some of the other figures that the cabinet secretary mentioned. It is a step in the right direction within the constraints of the budget settlement. We welcome that; it is quite a major step forward and a significant change from the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&#8217;s rhetoric last week, when he said that the settlement was &#8220;full, fair and final&#8221;. We are pleased that John Swinney prevailed and persuaded the education secretary that his Scottish colleges should get more money.

If we are pulling back from the 6,000 that were promised in the manifesto, we will not eat into those waiting lists, especially given the tough targets on homelessness that we need to meet by the end of year. Nevertheless, within the constraints of the spending review, it is a major step forward, although we would like to see much more on that.</p><p>Another area of concern for us is the air discount scheme for the islands. When he was a minister, Tavish Scott delivered the air discount scheme, which benefited charities, businesses and others. However, the SNP has withdrawn its use for work-related travel, which is having a significant impact on businesses.

Malcolm Chisholm was right: it is a mistake to conflate sovereignty of the people with the right of only this Parliament and only the SNP to determine the future of Scotland. That is a subtlety in the motion and the assertions made by SNP members&#8212;that only they have the right to ask the people and to ensure that the people&#8217;s sovereignty is protected. In fact, politicians of all parties, no matter whether they are in Westminster or here, have to be guardians of that sovereignty. It is not the responsibility of just the SNP; it is the responsibility of everybody.</p><p>That is why it is a positive step for the UK Government, in a constructive mode, to offer support to help the SNP deliver on its mandate. We recognise the mandate that it secured, but that does not mean that it has the right to do anything it wants to rig the referendum. That is critical.</p><p>That was perhaps a note of discord, but I am pleased to see that some consensus is developing. There is movement in the right direction on the Electoral Commission, and people think that it is reasonable that the franchise on which members were elected to this place should be the franchise for the referendum. Furthermore, as Malcolm Chisholm alluded to, academics from across the board now recognise that it is impossible to have a multi-option referendum. We would end up with the odd 99/51 situation&#8212;with the 51 per cent beating the 99 per cent. That is just not possible.</p><p>Most people now recognise that there has to be a straightforward yes/no question, with the current franchise and input from the Electoral Commission. Once that is agreed, we can get on to debate the substance.</p><p>As Liberal Democrats, we support home rule for Scotland so that we can determine our own destiny on the domestic agenda in Scotland while sharing risks and opportunities throughout the UK. When times are tough, we stick together; when times are good, we can share around the wins. To me, that is the benefit of the United Kingdom. We get the best of both worlds.</p><p>We have a strong track record on the issue. Over time, we have delivered with Labour and others the Scottish Parliament and now the Scotland Bill which, despite what Linda Fabiani says, provides a substantial transfer of power to the Scottish Parliament. We will continue to do that. With Ming Campbell&#8217;s commission, we will look to deliver as soon as we can, building consensus with others across society as we have done before.</p><p>That approach respects the will of the Scottish people.

A few fewer lessons from the SNP in that regard would be helpful.</p><p>The SNP demands more borrowing but wants to rely on the interest rates earned by a plan to reduce borrowing in the UK. An increase in Government bond interest rates, as seen in Greece and Italy, on a &#163;60 billion investment programme means a substantial amount of extra interest&#8212;billions, in fact. That would mean that schemes the length and breadth of Scotland would have to be cut or delayed. However, the SNP simply assumes that the hard-won UK credit rating and record low interest rates will roll forward into an independent Scotland.</p><p>The fact that that extra spending can be debated in this Parliament today is a direct result of the UK Government&#8217;s early effort to put the public finances back on a stable footing. It was the tough but necessary decisions taken 18 months ago that stabilised the international credit rating, kept interest rates low and supported the economy. If we had followed the SNP&#8217;s so-called plan B, we might well have been in a very different position today, with a poor credit rating and higher interest rates, which would have put up mortgage payments and cost families more, and which would have cost jobs. I would not recommend that course. I hope that the SNP might reflect on its advice, too.</p><p>I do not think that the Scottish Government is using all the powers and levers that it currently has at its disposal. It has ignored the views of its own independent budget review group and the Scottish Futures Trust, which both said that there was a better way for Scottish Water&#8212;a public body&#8212;to be structured to deliver substantial gains to the Scottish economy.</p><p>Under our plans, we would use that money to deliver transformational change through early intervention; accelerate plans for broadband; generate new science-based jobs and businesses; and boost energy installation work to cut fuel bills. Those are positive plans that would have a lasting effect on the Scottish economy and champion social justice, but it seems that we have missed that opportunity.</p><p>I repeat my call in relation to college funding, despite the &#163;15 million that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning announced on Radio Scotland this morning. He thinks that &#163;15 million off a &#163;74 million cut to colleges is a wand that will wave all the problems away. The money is there. He has the &#163;67 million. He could spend it&#8212;he could announce it this afternoon in his summing up. Will he take the opportunity to reverse the cuts to colleges and stop the cuts to college places?

He would probably have scoffed at the idea of becoming the First Minister of Scotland&#8212;twice. But perhaps that shy, retiring exterior is just a mask.</p><p>This is a big day for the First Minister, so I will begin on a note of consensus. The Liberal Democrats initially opposed the SNP&#8217;s plans to tackle the blight of alcohol, which holds back communities, but we have now reflected and considered, and we will support them. [Applause.] I did not think that I would ever hear that, to be honest. The approach is backed by a wide range of health bodies. Alcohol hits communities with antisocial behaviour, the health effects are severe, and it impacts on children and families. As a Liberal, I want to remove the barriers that hold people back from getting up and getting on in their lives, and the excessive drinking of alcohol is one of those barriers. The smoking ban, which Iain Gray mentioned, was a success. It was a bold measure by the previous majority Government, and I think that we can also tackle in the Parliament the blight of alcohol. My colleagues and I will work with the Government to make the proposals a success.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats have been prepared to reconsider our position on a major area of policy. I urge the First Minister to do likewise on the police and the fire service, but fear that he is destined to continue to ignore all opposition to the proposals that have been made. The Liberal Democrats are instinctive decentralisers; putting power in the hands of the minister at the centre is the exact opposite of decentralising. The Government&#8217;s plans will have an immediate increased cost in already challenging times, and will risk front-line policing. Big top-down reorganisations never save the money that they promise. Too much power will be put in the hands of only three people, and the opportunities to have complaints and discipline supervised by an independent force will be stripped away. Those are the reasons why 78 per cent of rank-and-file police officers and seven out of eight chief constables are against the proposals. I hope that the Government will have a change of heart.</p><p>Disregarding advice is one of the things that the Government has a habit of doing. It set up the Christie commission to advise on public services, which was a way to dodge and delay any decisions until after the election. There simply was not enough in the First Minister&#8217;s statement to show that he is taking forward the Christie vision. Where were the plans to enshrine localism in public services and put the user in control? Where were the plans to integrate local services rather than have top-down silos? Where is the legislation recommended by Christie to make it a duty on public bodies to take preventative action rather than simply pay up for solutions to problems that could have been avoided? The First Minister has not done the Christie commission justice.</p><p>I will need to be convinced that adding more laws will tackle the problem of sectarianism, which has been shown in recent weeks to be above simple law making. Legislating to send a message often makes bad law.</p><p>On the rest of the programme, I hope that I can encourage the Scottish Government to consider my party&#8217;s proposals on real reform to Scottish Water to create a future for Scotland fund and create jobs; its proposals to reform regulation and procurement to help Scottish businesses; its plans to make Scotland a science nation; and its proposals on action to tackle top pay and bonuses.</p><p>Those are solid plans for jobs and growth. We are not proud; we would be happy for the First Minister to pinch our ideas. Instead, for all his bluster today, his solution to the world&#8217;s economic problems stretches to two sides of A4. He did not even mention that he has chosen to strip &#163;250 million from transport capital investment to spend in other departments.</p><p>The biggest threat to Scotland&#8217;s economy is the First Minister&#8217;s plan to split Scotland from the rest of the UK. If Alex Salmond predicted 40 years ago that he would be First Minister with a majority, I am sure that he did not envisage that his first legislative programme would fail to include independence. Seventy years on from the creation of the SNP, the First Minister hardly even mentions the sole reason for that party&#8217;s existence.</p><p>Everything that this Government does has a purpose: securing independence. However, no answers have been offered and there is no timetable for answers. Last week, the Secretary of State for Scotland asked the SNP Government six simple questions about independence: what regulation would be applied to our banks and who would enforce it? Which currency would Scotland adopt? He also asked about membership of international organisations; our armed forces; pension liabilities; and, the bottom line, the cost of independence, but he did not get any answers. He was referred to a booklet from two years ago, but it did not have the answers either.</p><p>This session of Parliament will be dominated by independence, but that is the one issue that the SNP Government is determined to avoid discussing. While Scotland waits, the SNP refuses to declare, debate or even discuss the cost of independence. The only people who are stopping them trying for a separate state are themselves. That sense of dodge and delay marks so much of this Administration. After 70 years, the SNP finally has a majority. Now we need the answers.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not sure that the Alex Salmond of 40 years ago would have believed that he would lead his party or that he would be a member of a Scottish Parliament.

We can work together with the United Kingdom Parliament to achieve so much more for Scotland and the United Kingdom with our existing powers. I am sure that Michael Moore, my colleague at Westminster, will listen to Mr Swinney and his desire to get more powers for this Parliament, but we could do so much more now by working together across the Parliaments. I will be happy to discuss those plans, because we are always open to new ideas and are working to try to get a better Scotland.</p><p>I have three questions for the cabinet secretary. First, on university funding, we have a shared goal to have an excellent higher education sector in Scotland to train our young people and to compete on the international stage. Does Mr Swinney think that there is sufficient finance for our universities? He said before the election that the funding gap was roughly &#163;93 million, but since then we have heard of cuts&#8212;to jobs and to courses&#8212;at many universities throughout the country, such as Glasgow, Strathclyde, Stirling and Dundee. Has Mr Swinney revised his plans and will he review whether sufficient finance is available for our universities? We would like to discuss with him our plans to reform the higher education sector, but I would like to know whether he will review the finance that is available for our universities to ensure that they can compete.</p><p>The second question is on the council tax freeze, which I touched on last week, but we have still not had any answers on how we will pay for the five-year council tax freeze. Our suspicion is that there will be a pay freeze and that, for example, some nurses on modest earnings could lose around &#163;125,000 over the course of their career. I would like to hear from Mr Swinney exactly how he will pay for the five-year promise. The SNP shouted about that big prize during the election, but we have not heard much about the price.</p><p>The third question is on independence. As we now know that an independence referendum is coming, we would like the cabinet secretary to set out what the costs of independence might be, so that we can have a mature debate about the future of Scotland. For instance, that means working out what would be the cost of having separate diplomatic and foreign policy services, ensuring that we have costs for a separate welfare system and establishing the cost of insurance against a future banking crisis, which could take down the Scottish economy and the public sector. We would like to know the answers to those questions, so that we can have a mature debate in Scotland over the next few years.</p><p>I was a bit surprised that there was no mention of Professor Joseph Stiglitz in Mr Swinney&#8217;s opening remarks. Last October, at the SNP conference, the First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;Joseph Stiglitz has agreed to advise the Scottish Government on our country&#8217;s economic future. A Nobel prize winning economist backing Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>During the most recent budget process, my former colleague Jeremy Purvis, whom I mentioned earlier, asked Mr Swinney whether Professor Stiglitz was involved in the budget process. Mr Swinney said:</p><p>&#8220;Professor Stiglitz has not advised on the detail of the budget, but I have seen material that leads me to suspect that he would approve&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 14 December 2010; c 2887.]</p><p>I think that that means that Mr Swinney has read his book. I would like to know whether Professor Stiglitz has been involved in the current process. Why did we not hear from Professor Stiglitz before we had this debate, so that we could have the benefit of the words of wisdom of that great man?</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Swinney is very cunning, but I will not fall into his trap.

The deep suspicion is that a five-year council tax freeze will be at the price of a five-year pay freeze, which will cost public sector staff on modest wages very dearly. A nurse on an average salary will lose &#163;2,500 as a result, which will never be made up. For a 25-year-old, that will mean that they will lose &#163;125,000 over their career. Those are serious sums that need serious answers. People will want the answers about their future.</p><p>The people in Kelty who voted SNP did so because they heard the shouts about the three big prizes, not the whispers about the price to be paid. Their votes have been counted, and that is what they appear to have signed up to. They have not, however; the First Minister has saved them the trouble and has signed both sides of the social contract for himself, on their behalf.</p><p>We need to hear what the Scottish Government intends to do to measure the investment in Scotland&#8217;s universities, so as to ensure that they do not fall behind other institutions in the rest of the UK and around the world.</p><p>We also need to know when the First Minister expects to start his preparations for the local income tax. As regards the long and growing list of new powers that the First Minister wants, it is only fair for him to set out for us the full list of things for which he is claiming his mandate. At its heart, the SNP&#8217;s revised set of claims for a revised mandate is absurd. The SNP is solemnly promising to spend the first two years of the session working on the Scotland Bill, and it confidently expects to spend the last two years abolishing it. How absurd is that?</p><p>When the First Minister was renominated last week, I said that we would work with his Government where we agree with it.
