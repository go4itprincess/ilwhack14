I do so because this is a matter of the utmost importance. People have to experience adopting a child to know what couples go through. Social workers&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;ask many questions and my wife and I went through the process and eventually got a baby 32 years ago.</p><p>I am glad that the cabinet secretary is on the record as saying:</p><p>&#8220;It would not be appropriate for prospective and current foster carers who oppose same sex marriage to have their suitability to foster children questioned just because of opposition to same sex marriage.&#8221;</p><p>I do not doubt his sincerity for one minute. He went on to say that</p><p>&#8220;opposition to same sex marriage is not by itself sufficient to make a person unsuitable to provide foster care.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 12 November 2013; S4W-018023.]</p><p>I think that it is the phrase &#8220;by itself&#8221; that may trouble potential carers. It would be a genuine tragedy for everybody involved&#8212;especially the children&#8212;if prospective foster carers or adopters were turned down because their views on same-sex marriage led the authorities to question their suitability for the role. What is more likely, yet no less tragic, is that applicants with so-called traditional views on marriage will be put off applying in the first place, fearing that they will be branded homophobic.</p><p>It is worth emphasising that amendment 1 gives no special protection to people who disagree with same-sex marriage. Rather, it means that no views on the subject, whether for or against, should be factors in the approval process. My amendment would therefore provide equal protection for a couple who were passionately in favour of same-sex marriage and who found themselves in difficulty. That is why the bill should state that views on same-sex marriage cannot be taken into consideration during the approval process for prospective foster carers or adoptive parents. I therefore earnestly urge colleagues to lend me their support this afternoon.</p><p>Amendment 2 aims to ensure that an organisation&#8217;s charitable status is protected if it believes in the present definition of marriage. As every member knows, Scottish civic society is teeming with charitable organisations, many of them religious, which are engaged in all sorts of social activities in their communities such as food banks, homelessness services or debt advice.</p><p>It is also the case that many of those charities, due to their ethos, would not be supportive of same-sex marriage. That certainly does not mean that same-sex couples would be discriminated against with regard to the services that are provided by such bodies&#8212;to suggest otherwise is quite wrong and would be a terrible insult to those organisations. On the contrary, the issue at stake is that the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator may seek to use a charity&#8217;s opposition to same-sex marriage as a means of challenging its public benefit. The loss of charitable status could easily lead to such an organisation&#8217;s closure, which would have a hugely detrimental impact upon the vulnerable people who rely on the services that it provides.</p><p>Despite previous ministerial assurances regarding the future of the Catholic adoption agencies, OSCR has sought to remove charitable status from St Margaret&#8217;s Children and Family Care Society because St Margaret&#8217;s gives preference to married couples. I hope that all members have read the extremely thoughtful letter that was sent to us by the Rev Thomas White, the executive chair of St Margaret&#8217;s, which expands on the issue. The fact that OSCR&#8217;s decision has been overturned on appeal in the past few days is extremely good news, but it does not mask the fact that OSCR wished to remove St Margaret&#8217;s charitable status and that a lengthy period of uncertainty, disruption and distress has engulfed that small society. St Margaret&#8217;s had to use the law to protect itself, but a less well-resourced charity might feel that the costs would deter such action.</p><p>The appeal decision is welcome, but the entire sorry episode serves to underline why amendment 2 is so important. It would simply ensure that OSCR could not consider an organisation&#8217;s position on same-sex marriage when assessing its charitable status. I therefore urge the Government and all members to put the matter beyond doubt and to back amendment 2, which would send out a powerful message to the many voluntary bodies that are currently hard at work in our communities and which might be worried about the bill&#8217;s unforeseen impact.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879898", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As an adoptive parent myself, I appeal to the cabinet secretary and to every member in the chamber, whatever their view is of the bill, to understand why I feel that it is incumbent upon me to return with amendment 1 at stage 3.

However, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak at what is undoubtedly an historic moment for Scotland. It is historic because the institution of marriage, which has been at the core of our culture for centuries, is on the cusp of being changed forever. Many people welcome that. They say, &#8220;Why not have equal marriage? Why deny gay people the right to marry?&#8221; They argue that the status quo is discriminatory. I understand that line of argument, which has certainly been embraced by the vast majority of my fellow parliamentarians, but it is not one that I can agree with.</p><p>It is my conviction, and the conviction of many thousands of Christians, Muslims, people of other faiths and people of no faith, that marriage is unique&#8212;a unique relationship between a man and a woman. In recent months, polls have been cited to indicate that Scotland supports the bill, but I am not convinced that that is the case. Some 54,000 people signed Scotland for Marriage&#8217;s petition against the bill and, of the 62,000 people in Scotland who expressed a view during the Government&#8217;s main consultation on whether same-sex marriage should be introduced, 64 per cent&#8212;almost 40,000 people&#8212;said that it should not. Many of my fellow citizens have spoken clearly, but I am not convinced that we are listening.</p><p>Whether or not one accepts that the majority of Scots oppose the bill, the balance of views in the Parliament, where there is near-overwhelming enthusiasm for same-sex marriage, is hugely disproportionate to that in the country at large. That is why the various amendments that John Mason, Siobhan McMahon and I lodged, which were discussed earlier this afternoon, were significant and deserved the support of all MSPs, including those who favour same-sex marriage. Those amendments sought to ensure that the many thousands of Scots who disagree with the bill would have their views respected and protected once the law is changed.</p><p>In reply to Mr Harvie&#8217;s comments on amendment 1, I can say that I was branded homophobic in various emails.

Those include unscheduled emergency admissions to acute care, delayed discharges from acute care to community settings, delays in accessing required support, and lack of communication between services. There are too many occasions in which the hospital and the local social work department are not on the same page; when I was a councillor in North Lanarkshire I had to intervene on a number of occasions to resolve situations in which a patient was ready to come out of hospital but could not go home because support had not yet been supplied. On those occasions, I had to contact the social work department and the hospital in order to ensure that the patient&#8217;s needs were being met. If such problems could be solved, it would be good news for all patients, especially those who are in the last months of their lives, because delays in those patients&#8217; being discharged often results in their becoming too sick to move back to their homes and communities, where they would rather be.</p><p>Under the bill, health boards and local authorities will be required to create integrated plans for their areas. As has been said, two models will be available: the body corporate model, in which a health board and a local authority will delegate functions to a joint board that is headed by a chief officer; and the lead agency model, in which local authorities and health boards will delegate functions to each other under the oversight of a joint monitoring committee. Allowing each area to choose which of the two options best suits it will ensure that people in those areas&#8217; communities receive the best care, tailored to their needs. I suggest that all partners, plus GPs and local authorities, must work together to make local arrangements.</p><p>The point has been made that the Health and Sport Committee had representations from many organisations. However, as I have said, given the number of organisations, how many people will need to get round the table and will the table be big enough?</p><p>The bill will allow ministers to set out national health outcomes, and health boards and local authorities will be held accountable by the Scottish ministers and the public for delivering the targets.

Tomorrow, 22 November, is the 50th anniversary of his tragic assassination. I want to take this opportunity to reflect on the accomplishments of President Kennedy, who was one of the most noteworthy political leaders of the 20th century.</p><p>America&#8217;s youngest elected President, who had served just over 1,000 days in office, was shot dead on 22 November 1963 while being driven in his presidential limousine through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. It was a shock to all. Most people of my generation remember where they were on that fateful day.</p><p>Kennedy&#8217;s assassination has been the focus of conspiracy, mystery and intrigue for the past 50 years. In countless books, articles, films and research, people have analysed and debated the information, producing unsatisfactory explanations for why a man with such enormous promise met such an untimely death. Questions about the gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald&#8212;did he act alone? How many bullets were fired? Where were the shots fired from?&#8212;continue to plague people who are fascinated by President Kennedy and the almost Shakespearian drama that surrounds his life, family and legacy.</p><p>In a recent newspaper article, it was suggested that President Kennedy foreshadowed the exact means of his death in a conversation with his wife, Jackie, on the morning of the assassination. Over 50 years, official reports have concluded that there were three bullets and one man and that the President&#8217;s death was the result of a horrible, random act of violence. However, the public have been unable to accept that. People have constantly sought to give Kennedy&#8217;s life meaning and are unable to believe that such a historic figure could be brought down by one lowly man.</p><p>That is testament to the man that JFK was and to his political accomplishments. The theories around his death might be provoking, but ultimately they detract from his presidency and accomplishments. Prior to being sworn into office, Kennedy had received a purple heart for service in world war two and a Pulitzer prize for his non-fiction book, &#8220;Profiles in Courage&#8221;. He was a young, exuberant, handsome man with a glamorous wife, all of which, along with his wit, intellect and charisma, fitted the family for celebrity in a way that was perfect for the age of television. He easily defeated Nixon in the first televised presidential debates and he was the first President to use the television to address the American people. In that way, Kennedy was able to connect to the public and appeal to Americans on a personal and emotional level. He has been described as having had a unique ability to combine substance with style and wisdom, particularly on significant issues such as war, peace, space and civil rights.</p><p>As most presidencies do, Kennedy&#8217;s presidency faced turbulent times. It was the era of the Cuban missile crisis, the early years of the Vietnam war and the construction of the Berlin wall. However, despite political obstacles, he emerged to initiate the first Apollo mission to the moon, displaying his visionary spirit. In foreign policy, he was instrumental in negotiating a nuclear weapons test ban treaty with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, and he committed to a phased withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam. With a view to containing hostile relations, his presidency gave birth to the Peace Corps, and he was the first President to vocalise support for the civil rights movement. He drafted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which called for an end to voter discrimination, segregation of schools and other forms of discrimination.</p><p>Those were the achievements of a mere 22 months in office. What more might Kennedy have done had he lived? Some people suggest that his current popularity among politicians and the public is based more on the promise of what might have been than on the reality of his short term in office. Historian Dr James Boys has written:</p><p>&#8220;more than any other president, JFK is judged to a great extent on his promise, as opposed to his specific achievements in office.&#8221;</p><p>That might be true, but we must not overlook or underestimate the sense of joy that Kennedy brought to the presidency, which ultimately convinced the public of his greatness. He served at a time when cynicism towards the White House was at a minimum. Perhaps that helps to explain the longing for the days of Kennedy&#8217;s Camelot.</p><p>Kennedy was a man whom the public could stand behind and support. Through his handling of the Cuban missile crisis, he emerged as a heroic leader. Republicans and Democrats in America have sought to bask in Kennedy&#8217;s glory and often try to emulate his speeches and draw on him as a symbol. As we know, it is nothing less than extraordinary to find common ground between those two parties, so the fact that that happens speaks to the importance of Kennedy&#8217;s presidency. Unfortunately, many politicians today have failed to realise that Kennedy&#8217;s public image and persona were not just for appearance but had real substance as their basis.</p><p>Had Kennedy continued to live, he would surely have been elected for a second term. His presidency was on track to be the champion of the civil rights movement and to promote peaceful relations abroad, especially with the Soviet Union. Vietnam might have taken a far different course, as he was adamant about not committing more troops to the ground. However, we will never know about those possibilities. We will continue to wonder what could have been when we think of Kennedy and lament the loss.</p><p>Kennedy&#8217;s death has forever shaped how we remember him. Instead of remembering him for the myths of his death or his unrealised potential, we should remember him for being the man who inspired a nation, for the spirit that he brought to the presidency, for the accomplishments that he achieved in such a short time, for being a symbol for peaceful diplomacy, and for the duty that he gave to his country.</p><p>I will end with an excerpt written in the weeks that followed Kennedy&#8217;s death that aptly captures the essence of the late President. The excerpt was on display in the recent Andy Warhol display in the Parliament. It says:</p><p>&#8220;And so the 35th President of United States was laid to rest, the four days that shocked the world came to an end, and the great and near great from around the world turned back to their own worlds. And in all the speeches, in all the eulogies, in all the comforting messages, nowhere was the world&#8217;s sentiment more clearly expressed than in a brief inscription on the back of a picture of the late president which was handed out at St. Matthews cathedral: &#8216;Dear God, please take care of your servant, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Sadly, years later, on 19 May 1994, Kennedy&#8217;s wife, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died at 10.15 pm eastern standard time of cancer at her Fifth Avenue apartment in New York.

In order to have a truly patient-centred healthcare system, it must be built on solid principles. The first is respect: both patients and carers should have the fundamental right to healthcare that respects their unique needs, preferences and values as well as their independence.</p><p>The second is choice: all patients should have the right to participate in decision-making processes regarding their care, as long as they are comfortable in making those decisions. In order to achieve that, Scotland needs a responsive health service&#8212;as I believe it has&#8212;that provides suitable choices in treatment and management options that fit patients&#8217; needs.</p><p>Thirdly, patients should be involved. They deserve to share the responsibility for healthcare policy through meaningful engagement at all levels of the decision-making process. Such involvement should not be restricted to healthcare policy; it should extend to social policy that will have an impact on patients&#8217; lives.</p><p>Fourthly, all patients should have access to the healthcare services that their condition requires, including treatments, preventative care and health promotion activities. Provision must be made to ensure that all patients, regardless of their condition or location, have access to the necessary services. It is not enough just to treat the illness; a person-centred healthcare system must consider non-health factors such as education, employment and family issues that impact on a patient&#8217;s approach to healthcare choices and management.</p><p>Lastly, accurate, relevant and comprehensive information is essential in order to ensure that patients and carers make informed decisions about their healthcare treatment and living with their condition. The information that is provided to the patient must be presented in a format that takes into account their condition, language, age, understanding, abilities and culture.</p><p>We have one of the best health services in these islands. It already supplies excellent round-the-clock care, and patients throughout Scotland can access the service day or night. I had a good opportunity some years ago, before I came to this place, driving for the out-of-hours doctor&#8217;s service for two and a half years. I worked in Wishaw, Monklands, Hairmyres and Lanark, and the out-of-hours and A and E services in those hospitals were second to none.</p><p>The NHS is truly a seven-day service. Those working in all aspects of it, including pharmacists, physiotherapists and porters, must be on hand to help patients and to give them the support that they need to return home when it is best for them, any day of the week. To improve the service that patients receive within the NHS, I note that the Scottish Government is investing &#163;4 million across five major health boards to examine innovative approaches to healthcare and how to deliver them across the NHS.</p><p>I am pleased to note that the cabinet secretary, Alex Neil, has committed to implementing the recommendations of the Royal College of Physicians&#8217; recent report in order to achieve the needs of patients and involve them in the decision-making process on their care. Those recommendations include: extending the role of hospital physicians into the community; having a consultant presence on wards over seven days; ensuring that care for patients focuses on their recovery; enabling patients to leave hospital as soon as their clinical needs allow; and ensuring that patients can get appropriate care in the community if required.</p><p>The Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013 is designed to give those who require community care more choice and control over the social care that they receive, and it will integrate the language of self-directed support into legislation. The act also extends all four self-directed support options to children who receive care services, which will ensure that children who have disabilities have access to the same support as their non-disabled peers. In keeping with patient-centred healthcare, the act also places a duty on councils to provide advice and information to support people and to ensure that they can make informed decisions about the support that they want.</p><p>It is widely considered that patient-centred healthcare is the best way of providing care for patients by allowing them access to the decisions that are made on their behalf. The best way to continue with patient-centred healthcare is to have a Scottish NHS that remains publicly funded, publicly delivered, and that does not follow the disastrous Westminster privatisation agenda that the present Con-Lib Government is following in England. The Westminster Government has reneged on a pay rise for health workers in England while the SNP Government has said that it will pay the rise as promised for health workers in Scotland. I have total confidence in the work that the cabinet secretary and the minister are doing, and I hope that members will support them and their work on behalf of the people of Scotland.

It is our responsibility as policy makers to ensure that children have the opportunity to play and realise their full potential.</p><p>In my former role as a local government councillor for 36 years, I was astounded when I first joined the council at the cost of play equipment. However, I was committed to ensuring that play areas in my ward and throughout the authority were upgraded and that more money was allocated to play. I was also committed to reducing the number of &#8220;No ball games&#8221; signs.</p><p>During my term in office, I involved several schools in designing new play areas, which gave local children an input into what was being installed. Several small play areas were closed after consultation in order to erect a more central, safer and more innovative play area. Prior to leaving the council, I was able to access external funding from a housing association that wished to build in my ward. That funding ensured that a play area that a local group was requesting was built, and more than &#163;100,000 was obtained to promote play. Local groups, local councils and councillors must be innovative and explore all avenues in order to ensure that play is an essential part of council policy.</p><p>I will relate a story in the words that were used to me; I look forward to seeing this in the Official Report. While walking through the Jewel scheme&#8212;an area in my ward of Orbiston in Bellshill&#8212;I was stopped by a wee boy aged 10. He said, &#8220;Haw Dick, what you doing for us kids? You&#8217;re doing for all these old yins, but what you doing for us?&#8221; He was right. I went on to access funds and build a youth centre for kids in my ward; I received &#163;150,000 from the then Scottish Office urban aid fund. That is what can be done; as Mark McDonald and George Adam pointed out, local funding can be accessed.</p><p>One of the most resounding points in the strategy is that play and future wellbeing are closely linked. The strategy explains that play helps to promote brain function, which increases flexibility and improves potential for learning later in life. It also notes that play serves important social and emotional functions. Additionally, it has been shown that children who have the opportunity to play actively grow to be better problem solvers. Therefore, creating an environment that allows them such opportunities is highly beneficial not only for children but for society as a whole.</p><p>The play strategy for Scotland highlights that investing in children&#8217;s play is one of the most important actions that we can take to improve children&#8217;s health and wellbeing. As a member of the Health and Sport Committee, I find that especially important. We have devoted much attention to determining why and how inequalities in health arise. Evidence sessions have shown that inequalities in health are largely socially determined and that the communities where people live have a large role in health status.</p><p>It has been suggested that tackling those challenges requires an integrated approach of combined efforts with a focus on creating strong communities. Creating more connected, safer communities through the promotion of play can indirectly aid in reducing health disparities.</p><p>The assertion that play is a child&#8217;s right is enshrined in the play strategy for Scotland and supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. As members of the Scottish Parliament, it is our responsibility to ensure that that right is assured. We must ensure that, in a world in which parents are increasingly busy and incomes are often tight, all children&#8212;regardless of background&#8212;have access to play.</p><p>We must support free play initiatives and encourage a wide variety of play experiences. Playing in the home, outdoors and at school are critical in helping children practise and gain skills they will need in their adult lives. Unfortunately, many children now live in one-parent homes, hence they require greater support. It is our role to help support communities that provide assistance to families in need. Play is especially important for children in disadvantaged situations. It can also be used as a type of therapy to aid physical and mental wellbeing.</p><p>Scotland is already a great country to grow up in&#8212;I believe that&#8212;but supporting the play strategy for Scotland will help make it an even better environment for children in the future. The benefits of childhood play must not be overlooked or underestimated. Play directly affects how our children develop and what type of adults they become. We must do all that we can to create a positive environment for children so that they can flourish and express their creativity. By providing play opportunities and safe areas to play in, we can enhance communities and ensure that people are healthy. Enabling children to play can provide a better Scotland. I urge all members to consider this message mindfully and to support play action for Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I support the play strategy, as a father and grandfather.

It was initially intended that the fund would run until April 2014, but it has been extended to 2016.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, an extra &#163;20&#160;million each year will help to improve access to orphan drugs, for illnesses that affect fewer than one in 2,000 people, which have not been recommended for routine use by the Scottish Medicines Consortium. I am pleased that by 5 May, 71 patients in Scotland had benefited from the new funding, of whom 24 were between the ages of six and 16.</p><p>The SMC is an effective and comprehensive organisation, given its timeliness in providing advice to NHS boards in Scotland on the status of newly-licensed medicines. It is my hope that when the committee&#8217;s recommendations are implemented, the SMC will become more transparent and will increase access to medicines for end-of-life care and very rare conditions.</p><p>I am pleased that the health secretary has directed the SMC to apply a more flexible approach in the evaluation of medicines for end-of-life care, and to complete its review on the matter by the end of the year. I hope that the SMC will consider how it can implement a more flexible approach in the new year. The aim is to ensure that the process happens as quickly as possible, while maintaining attention to detail.</p><p>Quick implementation of the recommendations will help to make the medical approval process more transparent for patients, because the SMC will meet in public. Patients will be invited to attend peer-approval decision-making meetings, and a further &#163;1&#160;million will be invested to help to increase the transparency of the SMC&#8217;s work.</p><p>It is right that we continually examine all aspects of our health service; there is always room for improvement. However, the SMC should be commended. It is respected globally and has the fastest and most efficient medicines review process in the UK. During a meeting of the Health and Sport Committee in December, broad support was expressed for the SMC, which of course does very difficult work. Great support was expressed in relation to the SMC&#8217;s timescale for producing guidance on new drugs. On average, assessments are completed in 7.4 months, compared with an average of 21.4 months for NICE in England. SMC achieves that without sacrificing rigour in its methods.</p><p>Many members have mentioned cases in their areas, and I, too, have been asked to highlight a case. Earlier this week I was contacted by a constituent; I have her permission to name her. Ms Geraldine Ward needs the drug Fampyra, which helps MS sufferers to walk. The drug is not currently prescribed by Lanarkshire NHS Board. I hope that when the new arrangements come into effect, they will help Ms Ward to get the medicine that she requires to improve her quality of life. I intend to pursue that brave lady&#8217;s case to a resolution with NHS Lanarkshire. As Christine Grahame said, we must help our constituents where possible.</p><p>I commend the cabinet secretary, Alex Neil, for his commitment to the NHS in Scotland and for his quick action with regard to the committee&#8217;s inquiry.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to New Medicines"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Health and Sport Committee, I too am happy to take part in this debate, which is on a matter of great importance to the people of Scotland.

I also confess that I am not a great golf fan. However, I am a fan of what the Ryder cup can do for Scotland and, unlike Neil Findlay, I welcome the debate.</p><p>The Ryder cup is the most prestigious team golf tournament and it attracts vast commercial interest from a large selection of multinational brands. It will also bring thousands of spectators for every day of the tournament.</p><p>The Ryder cup is a biennial men&#8217;s golf competition between teams from Europe and the United States. The venue for the competition, which is jointly administrated by the PGA of America and the PGA European tours, alternates between courses in the USA and Europe.</p><p>The Ryder cup is named after the English businessman, Samuel Ryder, who donated the trophy. Originally contested between Great Britain and the United States, the first official Ryder cup took place in 1927 at Worcester Country Club in Massachusetts USA. The home team won the first five contests, but, with the competition&#8217;s resumption after the second world war, repeated American dominance led to a decision to extend the representation from Great Britain and Ireland to continental Europe from 1979. The inclusion of continental European golfers was partly prompted by the success of the new generation of Spanish golfers, led by Seve Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido.</p><p>In 1973 the official title of the British team was changed from Great Britain to Great Britain and Ireland but that was simply a change of name to reflect the fact that golfers from the Republic of Ireland had been playing on the Great Britain Ryder cup team since 1953, while Northern Irish players had competed since 1947. Since 1979 Europe has won nine times outright and retained the cup once in a tied match; there have been seven American wins over the period.</p><p>The European team has included players from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The Ryder cup, and its counterpart the presidents cup, remain exceptions in the world of professional sport because the players receive no prize money, despite being high profile events that bring in large amounts of money in television and sponsorship revenue.</p><p>It is clear from the tournament ambassadors who were present on Monday to mark one year to go to the start of the tournament, who included celebrities such as Alan Hansen, Marvin Humes and Jodie Kidd, that golf and the Ryder cup captivate members of the public from all walks of life and age groups.</p><p>I am pleased to say that the Scottish Government established clubgolf in 2003, investing &#163;500,000 in a project to introduce every nine-year old to golf, and that 260,000 children have participated in the sport through this scheme.</p><p>The Ryder cup is one of the premier sporting events in the world and will be broadcast in 183 countries and reach half a billion homes. Last year the Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport said that the Ryder cup would generate 45,000 visitors a day. I welcome her comments and hope that those figures can be reached and exceeded.</p><p>With Scotland&#8217;s increased visibility on the world stage it is estimated that the Scottish economy will benefit by over &#163;100 million during the week that the Ryder cup is played. Those financial benefits will mostly be felt in the tourism industry by accommodation providers, the hospitality sector, food and drink suppliers, and travel and transport providers.</p><p>I hope that, although the international visitors are here primarily for the fantastic golf on display in Gleneagles, they will find time during their trip to visit some of Scotland&#8217;s other excellent tourist attractions and thus extend the financial boost to other parts of Scotland.</p><p>The advantages to Gleneagles, the surrounding areas and Scotland as a whole from hosting the Ryder cup are not limited to the financial gains. There should be an increase in participation and in support for golf clubs as&#8212;to repeat what Mark McDonald said earlier&#8212;more youngsters are encouraged to take up golf. Local infrastructure, such as public transport and amenities, will provide a lasting legacy to be enjoyed by members of the public for years after the event has finished. In addition, the official charities that are selected for the event will benefit hugely from their association with the Ryder cup and, in turn, will be able to do more for their chosen areas of expertise.</p><p>Like many members, I do not play golf, but as a local authority councillor I had a golf club within my ward. Bellshill Golf Club is an excellent organisation, with greens and fairways that are maintained to a high standard. Located beside Strathclyde park&#8212;another excellent local facility in Central region&#8212;the club has allowed my constituents to play the game of golf for 108 years. I hope that, due to the intense interest generated, the Ryder cup will encourage people like me, who have not previously experienced the sport, to take it up in the years to come. I hope that that will help local courses and encourage community spirit, given that courses serve as an excellent local hub where people can get together and socialise. Golf clubs, like bowling clubs, are an excellent setting in which people can socialise&#8212;they do so after the 18th hole, so the clubhouse is often said to be the 19th hole.</p><p>With one year to go, I wish good luck to all those who are selected for both the American and European teams. I hope that the 2014 Ryder cup produces all the excitement and drama that golf clubs and golf fans have come to expect from this most famous of tournaments. The point of having the Ryder cup come to Scotland is that it is an excellent facility and will ensure that Scotland will be on the front of most sporting pages for the week that it takes place.

It encompasses everything from archaeological sites, buildings and architecture to gardens and marine sites. It covers the very well-known sites such as Edinburgh castle, which thousands of people visit every year, to the perhaps less well-known sites such as the covenanters site in Bothwell, which does not get nearly as many visitors or as much publicity as Edinburgh castle, but which is just as important to Scotland&#8217;s historic environment.</p><p>The historic environment is what makes Scotland distinctive, and it has value and benefits for local communities. It is part of our everyday lives and helps to give us a cultural identity both on a national scale and at local level. That cultural identity helps to promote a positive image of Scotland around the world, which in turn encourages visitors to our shores so that they can sample that culture for themselves. Scotland is rich in cultural history and that history should be preserved and celebrated whenever possible.</p><p>The historic environment is clearly high on many people&#8217;s priorities; across the country, groups of dedicated people give up their time in order to preserve historic sites in their areas. The covenanters site in Bothwell, in my region, is but one example.</p><p>The battle of Bothwell bridge&#8212;or Bothwell brig&#8212;took place on 22 June 1679. It was fought between Government troops and militant Presbyterian covenanters, and signalled the end of the covenanters&#8217; brief rebellion. The battle took place at the bridge over the River Clyde in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, near Bothwell in Lanarkshire, Scotland. The battlefield has been included in the &#8220;Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland&#8221; and is protected by Historic Scotland under the Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2011. South Lanarkshire Council planning department, please take note.</p><p>I spoke in David Torrance&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate in which we congratulated and celebrated the people in Fife who strive to keep the Wemyss caves accessible to the public. I am sure that there are many similar groups throughout the country that work tirelessly to protect and promote local history in their areas.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s extensive historic environment helps to provide vital jobs in uncertain economic times. Of the construction industry&#8217;s annual &#163;9.6&#160;billion turnover, 33 per cent is spent on repair and maintenance of existing buildings. Such investment helps to support employment throughout Scotland and helps to keep alive traditional skills, which are very relevant. Because much of the current building stock is pre-1919, those traditional skills are needed to repair and maintain the historic environment.</p><p>As we are all too aware, tourism is vital to Scotland&#8217;s economy, and the historic environment plays a large part in that. VisitScotland estimates that, in 2011, 16&#160;million tourists visited historic environment attractions. Latest research shows that 43 per cent of first-time visitors to Scotland, and 28 per cent of all visitors to Scotland, cite learning &#8220;more about the history/heritage&#8221; as a key motivator for their trip.</p><p>Historic Scotland reported recently that its sites welcomed more than 1.5&#160;million visitors between June and August, which is an increase of some 14.8 per cent from last year. During the past three months, Edinburgh castle&#8217;s visitor numbers rose by 26 per cent. In August alone, nearly 230,000 came through the castle&#8217;s doors&#8212;which is an increase of 35.8 per cent. It is not just the capital that has enjoyed an increase in visitor numbers. The numbers visiting the birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots at Linlithgow palace&#8212;which is in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s constituency&#8212;increased by 36 per cent, and the number of visitors to St Andrews castle went up by 9.8 per cent.</p><p>Due to the jobs and tourism that it generates, Scotland&#8217;s historic environment is estimated to contribute in excess of &#163;2.3&#160;billion to the Scottish economy. The historic environment also accounts for 2.5 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s total employment, which equates to more than 60,000 full-time jobs, as others have stated this afternoon.</p><p>However, despite the obvious benefits that it brings, our historic environment faces some challenges, perhaps the most obvious and pressing of which is the current financial outlook. I welcome the extra funding that the cabinet secretary has mentioned today, but I do not like the UK Government&#8217;s proposal in the 2014-15 spending review that Westminster will cut the Scottish Government budget by 12.3 per cent in real terms. The proposed cut from Westminster means that there could be some tough decisions ahead for the historic environment. However, with the introduction of the historic environment strategy for Scotland, I hope that the best decisions will be made in order to preserve our vital historic environment. I also believe that, by collaborative working, those decisions will produce the best outcomes so that local people and tourists alike can enjoy them for generations to come.</p><p>Let me end by saying what I believe should be a saying: Scotland&#8217;s history is in front of us.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695872", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scotland&#8217;s historic environment is, indeed, wide and varied, as we have heard.

REUTER. 10-27&#8221;.</p><p>Next year will mark 100 years since the beginning of that conflict&#8212;the day on which people&#8217;s lives, homes, attitudes and natures changed for ever. Until 1939, and the atrocities of Adolf Hitler, the first world war was known as the world war or the great war. Why? Because of the number of casualties, fatalities, nations and people involved. The United Kingdom, France, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Serbia, Italy, Belgium, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States and others were involved in the conflict. It truly was a world war.</p><p>Some 70 million military personnel, 60 million of whom were European, took part in the war. The war lasted four years, resulting in the loss of 16 million lives, with 20 million people being wounded. It is important to stress the number of people who died. Sixteen million people lost their lives in that war&#8212;that is more than three times the population of this country.</p><p>Of course, we in Scotland played our part in the conflict, with nearly 26 per cent of our population&#8212;some 557,000 personnel&#8212;dying or becoming casualties. Many of those people came from my region, Central Scotland. They were defending their country and protecting us all. In contrast, 11 per cent of the British Army were casualties. That shows the part that Scotland played in the war. We could quite often be at risk of forgetting such a fact, but the most important of memorial services and statues act as an everlasting reminder that we should never forget the sacrifices that many made during the great war.</p><p>The reason behind the bloodshed and loss of life was that, over the four terrible years of the war, the nations that were involved made significant technological advances and created tanks, heavier guns, machine guns, flame-throwers, poison gas and aeroplanes that could bomb and strafe trench areas and land behind the lines&#8212;air war was in its infancy, but it was terrible&#8212;as well as aircraft carriers, heavy battleships and submarines. Members who have listened to that list will note that some, if not all, of those weapons are still in use today by our modern armies.</p><p>I highlight the high level of loss of life in our naval forces during the war, particularly in the battle of Jutland.

I agree with the member&#8217;s comment.</p><p>I spoke of the effects that the great war had, and I intend to highlight what I mean by that. In his study of wars since the 1400s, Evan Luard stated that</p><p>&#8220;the First World War transformed traditional attitudes to war. For the first time there was ... an almost universal sense that the deliberate launching of a war could now no longer be justified.&#8221;</p><p>Commemoration is the honouring or preservation of a memory of an event or a person. Never has a word been more fitting than that: to honour and preserve. Never again should we stand back and allow ourselves to be involved in such a war or such bloodshed. The men and women of our armed forces who lost their lives in that war and others since deserve to be remembered next year and to have their memory preserved.</p><p>In the light of that, I have been approached by a constituent, Mr Ian Thomson, who is keen to erect a memorial in mainland France to recognise the sacrifice of all Scottish forces&#8212;both women and men&#8212;who fought for the liberation of Europe in the first world war. I am keen to generate support for that project, as it has been brought to my attention that no such monument exists in mainland France. There are memorials that commemorate individual Scottish regiments, and I pay tribute to them, but there is not one that takes in the whole of the work done by the Scottish armed forces. That oversight should be corrected.</p><p>Mr Thomson has recently visited and been in contact with officials&#8212;in particular, the mayor&#8212;in the French town of Arras, as we hope to position the memorial near the town, where most Scottish regiments were involved in the battle that took place around Arras. We intend to establish a group to take that forward and hope to enlist the help of the Scottish people and the Scottish Government.</p><p>Many battles&#8212;too numerous to mention&#8212;were fought all over France. They included battles at Arras, Ypres, the Somme and Passchendaele. We have also to remember battlefields in Italy, Russia and Africa. All the personnel who died during the conflict should have a place in our hearts. It is my sincere hope that, with the 100th anniversary of the great war approaching, the people of Scotland will take time to remember the sacrifice that their countrymen and countrywomen made to ensure that they could live in freedom. With no remaining combat veterans from the first world war, we must not become complacent and forget what those great men and women did for us.

Sport is something that we can all do, be it by taking a walk down the Royal Mile to Parliament in the morning, having a run around Strathclyde Park in Motherwell or making a visit to our local gym. The benefits of that type of sport and others are numerous, including improved physical and mental wellbeing, which has a number of positive knock-on effects. The benefits of sport and leisure cannot be ignored, and I am therefore delighted to note that the Scottish Government will publish a youth sport strategy later in the year. I hope that it will outline and enshrine the values and methods of sporting participation, which is of great importance to future generations. Actually, in the sunshine yesterday, my grandson was in a swimming pool&#8212;I say to Alison Johnstone that it is happening.</p><p>I want to highlight two examples of good practice and hard work in my region. The active schools network aims to improve motivation and attitudes among children and young people and, in doing so, to increase their achievements in school and their contribution to the community. It does so through sport and increased physical activity and has the added effect of increasing the number of young people who become youth leaders. The initiative is an example of good practice and helps to meet one of the targets for the Scottish Government and, more generally, this Parliament, in that it creates strong sporting foundations at pre-school level and creates physical education provision in primary and secondary schools.</p><p>My second example of good practice is the good work of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth games youth legacy ambassadors. I highlight in particular the work of Scott Lamond, April Crane, Craig Rutherford, Julie Dobbin, Stacey Smith and Jordan Linden&#8212;six North Lanarkshire ambassadors who are working hard to promote the legacy of the games and who are ensuring that the message about healthy living and participation in sport, as well as culture, is promoted in the run-up to the games and, indeed, after the games.</p><p>Scott Lamond and Jordan Linden opened the get active Lanarkshire event at Strathclyde Park last weekend. The event was aimed at promoting the get active message to young people and all of the people of Lanarkshire. The ambassadors&#8217; role is supported by the Scottish Government and Young Scot, highlighting a commitment to ensuring that the Commonwealth games are an outstanding success and that there is a lasting legacy from Glasgow 2014.</p><p>I welcome the creation of community sport hubs in local authorities throughout the country. Last week, I complimented the chief executive of sportscotland on his vision. I also complimented the minister on the work that is being carried out. I want more sports hubs. There is one located in Bellshill in my region but I would like more.</p><p>Nowadays, community sports facilities are often built in conjunction with a new high school or a new primary school. That is a good idea. It puts across a message to young people that from a grass-roots level, sport and education&#8212;two cornerstones of a healthy lifestyle&#8212;are interlinked.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s vision in the creation of at least 150 community sport hubs across all Scottish local authorities. That action, along with others, will help to deliver a sporting legacy fit for a generation.</p><p>Glasgow has placed a bid to host the youth Olympics in 2018 and has been shortlisted. Along with other members, I await with excitement the decision on the host city in 23 days&#8217; time. I am backing the bid and I look forward to hearing the decision&#8212;a decision that I hope will be in Glasgow&#8217;s favour and will continue Scotland&#8217;s success.</p><p>I compliment all volunteers who take part in sport on the unpaid time that they give to their sport. I also compliment a chap called Jim Hughes, who is a boxing coach in my region, particularly in the Bellshill area. Jim regularly trains more than 60 young people&#8212;girls and boys. He has given those young people self-esteem and has won various awards throughout the region.</p><p>My son never liked football and found his niche in volleyball.

As a member of the Rural Affairs, Environment and Climate Change Committee, I fully support the bill&#8212;and the Government&#8217;s swift action&#8212;because I believe that it is the right thing to do.</p><p>However, not everyone is of that belief. There are people outside Parliament who think that the bill has been hurried through. I ask them to think of the landlords, crofters and other people who are affected and who require that the change be made. Now is not the time for indecision; it is the time for effective, proper and right legislation that helps to fix the problem that those people face.</p><p>The bill should not be a party-political issue, and I sense that members across the chamber will agree to let the bill proceed at decision time. I am sure that we can all agree that the bill should be about the people who are affected by the issue that we are debating.</p><p>I want to return to what crofting is. To echo the point that Jayne Baxter made, when I was appointed to the committee, I did not know what crofting was either, but I am starting to learn what it means to so many people. Crofting is a system of landholding that makes a significant economic, social and environmental contribution to remote and rural areas, and it is part of our history. I am informed that there are 17,725 crofts in Scotland, mainly in the Highlands and Islands, and that about 33,000 people live in crofting households.</p><p>The bill is needed to address a problem that occurred with a provision in the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. I am sure that everyone has repeated this. The 2010 act introduced the term &#8220;owner-occupier crofter&#8221; into the 1993 act. I listened intently to the point that Dave Thompson made earlier about the various legislation on crofting that has come in over the years, and to the point that Angus MacDonald made with regard to what needs to be done, which was identified by the minister, the convener of the committee and other speakers. That provision in the 2010 act has had the unintended effect that owner-occupier crofters are not allowed to apply to the Crofting Commission to decroft land unless the land is vacant.</p><p>I note that there have been several criticisms that those who will be affected by the bill have not been consulted on its proposals. However, I re-emphasise my earlier point that those who are affected by the current situation desire that it be fixed, which will happen through the bill. Despite the tight parliamentary timetable, the Government attempted in the time that was available to seek views from the stakeholders on the proposals, as the minister ably reminded us. I make that point merely to highlight the fact that the Government has made every attempt to involve people in the decision-making process.</p><p>One prominent issue that is worth noting, and on which there is some strength of opinion among lawyers and crofters&#8212;as Graeme Dey said earlier, we got perhaps the only free legal advice that we will ever receive from lawyers&#8212;is that the current state of crofting law is poor. I think that everyone accepts that. If I, as a member for Central Scotland, recognise that, it must be poor. However, I am confident that the Scottish Government and the minister will look at that in detail.</p><p>The bill seeks to right a problem and to close a loophole. As other committee members do, I believe that despite the concerns that have been raised the bill will achieve its policy aim; it will do what it sets out to do and enable owner-occupier crofters to apply to the Crofting Commission for a decrofting direction.</p><p>As my final remarks in this stage 1 debate, I say that I hope that the bill will close the current loophole and bring much-needed assistance to the people who are affected by the problem. Once again, I congratulate the Scottish Government on introducing the bill and I welcome the swift action that it has taken. The Government&#8217;s action, along with the work that was done on the stage 1 report by the members of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8212;under the able stewardship, as I said yesterday, of our convener&#8212;are to be commended.

I highlight that point, as I recall that we recently debated a motion in the name of Christina McKelvie regarding the current attitude described in &#8220;Voices from the frontline ... Digital by default&#8221;, a report that ties in well with what we are discussing today. Furthermore, a case study by the Carnegie Trust showed broadband uptake to be as low as 90 per cent in some cases, further highlighting the need for a much valued local branch.</p><p>On a more general point, &#8220;A Strategy for the Financial Services Industry in Scotland&#8221; cited the following figures, stating that the financial services sector</p><p>&#8220;accounts for 9.3% of Scottish jobs, employing 108,000 directly and almost 90,000 more in a range of related industries. Including other effects, this amounts to more than 220,000 jobs in Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>The closure of local branches in areas such as Gourock and Shettleston cannot possibly be a good thing. We tell people these days to shop locally and buy locally. What about banking locally? Without local branches, people will not have the opportunity to go to a local bank and discuss their banking issues with a friendly face. I remember the RBS television advert a number a years ago, which promised no bank closures.</p><p>Bank closures result in further questions of exclusion: people will need to pay for transport to the nearest bank branch to discuss their banking issues; people who cannot afford broadband cannot bank online; and people who&#8212;like me until recently&#8212;have a dinosaur mobile phone cannot bank on the go. It is a question less of want than of necessity. Banking locally is key to every community. I therefore hope that the worrying trend that RBS has set halts and that there are no future closures anywhere in Scotland.</p><p>I end by thanking John Mason for bringing the important motion before us today.

Positive results can already be seen. From October to December 2012, there were 8,734 applications for homelessness assistance&#8212;12 per cent lower than in the same period in 2011. There were 7,526 assessments of people who were homeless or threatened with homelessness, which is 8 per cent lower than in the same period in 2011.</p><p>I am sure that the Scottish Government remains committed to implementing measures to protect the most vulnerable groups in society, particularly young people, in order to ensure that they have access to good-quality housing. While the Westminster Government implements destructive welfare reforms that will put thousands of Scottish tenants at risk, the Scottish Government has announced funding to help to minimise the devastating effects that the Westminster cuts will have.</p><p>In 2011, the Government announced the creation of a Scottish welfare fund, which will run for two years from April 2013. The fund has two main goals. The first is to</p><p>&#8220;provide a safety net ... when there is an immediate threat to health&#8221;,</p><p>and the second is to</p><p>&#8220;enable independent living or continued independent living, preventing the need for institutional care.&#8221;</p><p>I note that the Government has announced an additional &#163;9.2 million for the fund, which brings the total value of the fund in its first year to &#163;33 million.</p><p>The Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s inquiry last year into having and keeping a home highlighted the principal causes of homelessness in Scotland. One cause is family breakdown. The committee was presented with a bleak picture of the causes of family breakdown, which include addiction issues and mental health problems. Those are particularly problematic as young people do not have an effective means of communicating the problem, and so it is never resolved and gets worse until the young person is taken into the system. Some of those young people may be given their own tenancy, but they rarely know how to keep it. Linda Fabiani expressed well the problems that young people face.</p><p>Another principal cause of homelessness is the parents&#8217; or carers&#8217; attitude, which can put young people at risk. Unfortunately, some young people cannot stay in their family home because of abuse and have to leave for their safety. Overcrowding in the family home can be a factor. If too many people live in the home, there might be no place for the young person. Some parents and carers think that as soon as someone is 16, they are an adult and it is time for them to leave home and make their way in life. In many cases, those young people are left to fall into the system. Over the years, I dealt with many people in that situation.</p><p>A further cause of homelessness is the challenge of employability. Without a fixed address, young people find it hard enough to register with a doctor, never mind find meaningful employment. A stigma is attached to homelessness and employers seem reluctant to offer employment to someone whose address is a hostel or supported accommodation.</p><p>To tackle homelessness, the committee has identified ways in which to prevent its initial or main causes, on which I compliment it.</p><p>One way is mediation. The majority of young people who become homeless do so straight from the family home. Young people have said that mediation would have helped to relieve some of the pressures in the family home that led them to leave.</p><p>Another is respite. Young people themselves have voiced the opinion that if they could have had a short break, it would have helped to stop them and their parents becoming overwhelmed and would have enabled them to rectify the situation.</p><p>Another is education. The committee has pointed out very well that education must play an important role in raising awareness of the realities of homelessness for young people, and that young people must have someone to speak to if they are to avoid the risk of falling into homelessness.</p><p>As I have stated, I dealt with homelessness on a daily basis as a councillor. I remain committed to helping anyone who finds themselves homeless.</p><p>I was shocked by the speech that Alex Johnstone made. It was not to his usual standard and I think that it was prepared for him.</p><p>We all must work together on this issue. I compliment the convener of the committee, Mary Fee, and her committee on their excellent report.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Having and Keeping a Home"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not think that Alex Johnstone wrote his speech.

I have fond memories of using the ferry crossing between North and South Queensferry in the 1960s. I also remember walking across the newly constructed Forth road bridge and the excitement of seeing it when it opened back in September 1964&#8212;it was quite something. It is indeed something of an icon, and at that time it complemented the rail bridge. It is another of the many must-sees for visitors.</p><p>Who would have thought then that the bridge, which has now stood for 49 years, would have more than 25 million cars passing over it per annum, which equates to more than 68,000 per day? That level of intensity of use is one of the major contributors to the condition that the bridge is in, and it is why expert opinion has agreed that renewal of the bridge is in the best interests of Scotland&#8217;s people. It will also be of great benefit to the local communities in the immediate area.</p><p>The new bridge that the bill outlines is pioneering in the sense that, for the first time, it truly captures the imagination of the public&#8212;of people from all walks of life. The inclusion of Scotland&#8217;s people means that they are included in a decision-making process about a key piece of long-lasting infrastructure. I believe that that also encourages people to participate in politics in their day-to-day lives. I look forward to the results of the public vote on the name of the bridge. I have to confess that I have not voted yet. The options are Caledonia bridge, Firth of Forth crossing, Queensferry crossing, Saltire crossing and St Margaret&#8217;s crossing. I compliment the minister on the way in which he has conducted that public participation exercise. I was pleased to see that even the Canadians want to get involved in what is happening.</p><p>My hope for the new bridge is that it will remain toll free&#8212;I know that, under an SNP Government, that will happen&#8212;just as the existing bridge is toll free, as a result of the abolition of tolls under the SNP Government. Alex Johnstone touched on that. I thought that he would go the whole hog and compliment the SNP Government, but he did not.</p><p>Looking specifically at the bill and the intentions behind it, it is clear to me that the Scottish Government has looked deeply into a number of options for the management of the bridge. I support the intentions to let a new single contract for the management and maintenance of the new bridge and to safeguard the staff. When reading into the bill further, I thought it best to look at the financial implications of our passing it. I note that the financial memorandum highlights that it is likely to cost about &#163;1.2 million per annum less to let a contract for the management and maintenance of both the Forth road bridge and the Forth replacement crossing, compared with having the two bridges managed by separate organisations.</p><p>More generally, with replacement comes a whole host of economic and usage benefits for those who use the bridge. The replacement crossing will be of benefit to its users as it will reduce travel times and travel distances, as has already been stated. The new crossing will also bring with it significant economic impacts for the communities of Lothian and Fife and&#8212;by extension&#8212;for Scotland as a whole.</p><p>As no amendments to the bill have been lodged, it is clear that the whole chamber supports the proposal. I am delighted to have had my chance to take part in the debate and to make my contribution to a hugely significant piece of infrastructure here in Scotland that will be fit for generations to come.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am happy to take part in the debate.

Scotland&#8217;s people are best placed to make decisions on welfare, defence and other reserved matters. Scotland has been successful with devolved powers: with independence, there will be nothing that we cannot do.</p><p>It is also right that the bill will set in stone the ability of our young people to have a say in the referendum next year. Absolutely no one has a bigger say in the future of Scotland than its young people because, by their very nature, young people do not stay young for long. At 16, young people can marry, have children and pay taxes: they should be given the right to vote on the future of the country in which they live because, before we know it, our young people will be leading the country. They will be the new politicians devising policy and enshrining the values that we, in Scotland, hold most dear.</p><p>The argument for votes at 16 and 17 has been going on for a long time. Organisations that play significant roles in representation of young people, such as NUS Scotland and the Scottish Youth Parliament, have fought for many years for the right to vote at 16 and 17. I am proud that the Scottish Government has made that resounding commitment and fulfilled the long-term SNP policy of extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds for the most important decision that this country will make. We are not Brigadoon, we are Scotland. I am confident that, when Scotland is an independent country, an SNP Government&#8212;or whatever Government governs this country with the powers of independence&#8212;will extend the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in every election and referendum.</p><p>With the right to vote also comes a responsibility on our Government to protect the young people who vote.

I do not care whether it is a Labour Party governing it, a Tory party governing it or a Liberal party governing it, but I want an SNP Government governing it because I want an independent country&#8212;[Interruption.] I want a country that will look after its people, and which will not go backwards, as we are doing with the UK. We must have a greater emphasis on young people, particularly because for many young people the referendum will be their first chance to exercise their democratic right to vote. It is a decision for a generation.</p><p>The question in everyone&#8217;s mind right now will be, &#8220;What benefit will independence bring to me and my life?&#8221; That is a fair and balanced question. The answer is that, with independence, we can shape a nation that lives up to our ambitions of fairness and prosperity. What does that mean in reality? Among other Scottish priorities, I am sure that it means scrapping the bedroom tax. An SNP Government in an independent Scotland would scrap that unfair and unjust tax on the least well-off people in society&#8212;a commitment that our Deputy First Minister has made on several occasions.</p><p>In closing, I note that convicted prisoners who are detained in penal institutions will not be eligible to vote in the referendum, although prisoners who are on remand and have not been convicted will be able to vote.

Digital by default&#8221; by Citizens Advice Scotland, I share the views that are expressed and the concerns that have been raised by Inclusion Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland that those people who are already facing barriers will find it even more difficult to get online.</p><p>Looking deeper into the issue, I examined research from the Carnegie UK Trust, which had a fantastic case study on digital exclusion in Glasgow and why Glasgow has such a low broadband uptake. The figure from that particular case study that struck me was that more than 90 per cent of people in some specific groups are offline. Groups including older people, social housing tenants and people who are unemployed are the least likely to be online.</p><p>That finding, coupled with the fact that those groups also include people who are already facing difficulties in day-to-day life through disability, proves how out of touch the Westminster Government truly is, not only with the people of Scotland but with people throughout the rest of the UK.</p><p>The extent to which the Westminster Government is out of touch is highlighted by its action over the bedroom tax. It wants 90,000 people to move house in a year, but in my 36 years of service as a local authority councillor in North Lanarkshire Council l managed to help only 5,000 people to move. How can the Westminster Government suggest that 90,000 people can move in a year?</p><p>The facts are more damning. Studies have shown that disabled people are significantly less likely to live in households with access to the internet than non-disabled people. In 2010, 58 per cent of disabled people in the UK lived in households with internet access compared with 84 per cent of non-disabled people. That is according to the 2010 British social attitudes survey and runs in line with the review by the Scottish Government entitled &#8220;Digital Participation in Scotland: A Review of the Evidence&#8221;.</p><p>The reasons that were outlined in the review for the low internet access figures for those with a disability are twofold: first, because of impairment as a result of the disability; and secondly, because of a lower income. An example of such impairment is of people with visual impairments who face practical difficulties in using the internet. They have particular problems in reading what is displayed and in finding their way around many websites as a result of the websites not being fully accessible, to name but two of the issues.</p><p>There is a natural correlation that those who have a higher income are more likely to have internet access at home. Currently, only 52 per cent of people in the 15 per cent most deprived communities have internet access in their homes, with disabled people being one of the groups most likely to be living on a lower income. In turn, therefore, disabled people are most likely to be living on a low income and thus have a need to claim benefits, but they are least likely to have internet access. That is why the Westminster Government plans for digital by default are poorly thought out and show a lack of concern for the most vulnerable in our society.</p><p>I urge the Westminster Government to look again at its policy on the bedroom tax. It is causing significant worry and despair and, as Christina McKelvie has already said, it has caused a regrettable suicide of a young woman. It is a policy that is even worse than the poll tax, and the only conclusion that I can draw is that we as a country here in Scotland can rid ourselves of such unfair and undemocratic policies only through the powers of an independent Scotland.

As a member of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, I am greatly interested in the situation that faces the freshwater pearl mussel, so I want to thank Dr Peter Cosgrove and his team for providing me with information at today&#8217;s drop-in session, and Buglife for the information that it provided.</p><p>Capable of living up to 130 years, the freshwater pearl mussel begins its life as a minute larva that is, along with 1&#160;million to 4&#160;million other larvae, ejected into the water from an adult mussel. That remarkable event takes place between July and September. In order to live the larva must snap shut on a suitable host fish&#8212;often young fish from the salmon family, which includes Atlantic salmon and sea trout. As the chances of a larva encountering a suitable fish are very low, nearly all of them are swept away and die; only a few are inhaled by an Atlantic salmon or sea trout , and when that happens they snap shut on to the fish&#8217;s gills for nine or so months. Finally, they land on sand and begin to grow on their own. I highlight that process to show not only the complexity but the natural beauty of those events.</p><p>The issue that has been raised by Mary Scanlon is important; because freshwater pearl mussels are more sensitive to pollution than any other river creature, they are a crucial indicator of river-water quality. They are critically endangered and remain at risk from a range of factors, including water pollution, the ruining of their habitats, climate change, illegal pearl fishing and overexploitation. As with most things, some factors arise because of human error. We continue to pollute our water with septic tanks while engineering works also compromise the mussels&#8217; habitats. As we know too well, climate change is also having a negative impact.</p><p>Scotland is abundant in biodiversity, by which I mean the variety of life. Biodiversity is essential in sustaining the ecosystems and life systems that provide us with the food we need, the fuel we use to get around, the health we enjoy, the wealth we have and other vital services.</p><p>We are all part of that biodiversity, and we have the power to protect or destroy it. That power is a privilege and a responsibility. The actions that we take have a direct impact on life around us. Mary Scanlon has highlighted well the point that we must do something now in order to protect, in the future, freshwater pearl mussels as well as other creatures. RSPB Scotland has stated:</p><p>&#8220;Urgent action is needed to protect remaining pearl mussel populations.&#8221;</p><p>I am sure that members across the chamber agree with that sentiment, as I do.</p><p>There is never a quick fix for such problems, but we can take actions to alleviate the problem and to prevent it from getting any worse. Adult mussels can be transferred to areas in which they are extinct, young mussels can be cultivated, and juvenile trout that have been infected with the larvae can be released into small rivers, but the main successes lie in habitat restoration projects. There is also the essential role that salmon play in the life of the freshwater pearl mussel. The conservation of salmon and trout is central to the survival of that endangered species. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has begun to work to address those issues.</p><p>I thank Mary Scanlon again for bringing the issue to the chamber. As a grandfather, I feel that it is important and right that the Parliament and the Government take stock of the issue and continue to address the problems that have been outlined.</p><p>On the Roman link, I am sure that Julius Caesar invaded Britain to control the pearl trade.

I welcome the debate about that important issue that the committee is holding.</p><p>As members will remember, in 2008 the Scottish Government and the Association of British Insurers signed an agreement called the statement of principles on the provision of flood insurance. It outlined that the ABI and the Scottish Government would work together to increase the understanding and awareness of flood risk, develop a strategy to reduce the risk of flooding throughout Scotland, encourage action to minimise the risks and costs of flooding to the Scottish people and provide essential information on how to obtain flood insurance and on access to insurance for low-income households.</p><p>Since then, I note that the Government has been engaged in discussions with DEFRA, devolved Administrations and the ABI on how to safeguard the widespread uptake of affordable insurance for all. That action highlights the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to ensuring access to flood insurance for all in our society who may have experienced the horrendous effects of flooding or are at risk of doing so.</p><p>I recall the Scottish Government&#8217;s quick action in 2012 alongside key partner agencies and emergency services&#8212;as mentioned by the minister, Paul Wheelhouse&#8212;to ensure a co-ordinated response to the problems faced by the whole country. I remember the TV coverage of what happened to parts of Stonehaven during the flooding&#8212;there were scenes of devastation and loss of possessions such as furniture and cars. For some, the floods took away memories and cherished belongings. I certainly feel for the residents there.</p><p>Having stayed for weekends in Stonehaven for several years, I know the area well. The devastation there surely leads to worry, as many families find themselves needing to sort out their water-damaged homes and possessions. It is particularly difficult for people to do that when they are facing the economic downturn and are feeling the squeeze even harder than before.</p><p>It is clear that reducing the risk of flooding is a key priority for the Scottish Government. The national flood risk assessment, which was published in December 2011, provided for the first time a national view of flood risk across Scotland. It was a major milestone towards Scotland being able to target efforts to plan and invest in reducing the impact of flooding on the most vulnerable areas. That action and others further highlight the Government&#8217;s commitment to protecting and safeguarding the Scottish people.</p><p>I am confident that the Scottish Government will continue to deliver on its commitment to the Scottish people to end the examples of disaster that we have witnessed in Stonehaven and throughout the country when floods hit. Members have commented on negative insurance, and we have to help people to insure at a reasonable price.</p><p>The floods and their effects show an even greater truth, which is that climate change is a reality. Scotland is leading the way in renewable energy and cutting its carbon emissions, and the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to additional climate change action further highlights its commitment to ensuring that we can cope with the effects of climate change and create a more environmentally friendly and sustainable Scotland for all.</p><p>I note that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is working hard to ensure that the insurance industry takes flood risk management work into account. The ABI acknowledges that flood risk is higher in England and Wales than in Scotland. When I look at some of the areas that are being built on in England, I wonder why that is being done.</p><p>There is cross-subsidy from high-risk to low-risk areas, which means that those in low-risk areas such as Scotland pay higher premiums to subsidise insurance in higher-risk areas such as England and Wales. As has been mentioned, DEFRA estimates that the total cross-subsidy is &#163;150 million across the UK, while Professor Crichton estimates the subsidy at more than &#163;200 million.</p><p>Members will note that, although flood management is a devolved responsibility, financial services are not. With the powers of independence, the Scottish Government&#8212;and ultimately the people of Scotland&#8212;will be better placed to make decisions on flood insurance and many other areas.</p><p>I am one of the lucky ones, as I live in an area that is not subject to flooding, but people in other areas of my region are not as lucky. We must help constituents who face problems with possible flooding in whatever way we can. Insurance must be available to everyone who wants it, at a cost that suits people&#8217;s needs. Insurance excess payments must be affordable and not excessive, as members have mentioned today.</p><p>I welcome this debate on a subject that is important to all. We have to learn how to cope best with insurance, flooding and the situation that faces many of our constituents. We must draw on examples. My mother-in-law was born in Holland, where every area pays a windmill tax so that the water is kept off the land. Holland is a prime example of a country that copes with flooding. I am not saying that it has the answer for everything, but we have to look at other countries in order to see how we can cope.</p><p>I welcome today&#8217;s debate and I welcome the points that Chic Brodie and other members have made.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the petitioner, Professor David Crichton, for highlighting to the Public Petitions Committee and the Parliament the issue of flood insurance.

However, for some, even the simplest of day trips is beyond reach. According to the Family Holiday Association, an estimated 2.5 million families cannot even afford a day trip, as John Mason has already said. Financial difficulties in tough economic times coupled with family breakdown and work pressures sometimes prevent families across the country from accessing holidays and leisure activities. In turn, that prevents them from reaping the benefits of a holiday.</p><p>A number of welfare benefits can be reaped, such as better mental, physical and emotional wellbeing, giving families the chance to feel rejuvenated through having a break that is free from stress or worry. There is also a lot to be said for the wider educational and cultural benefits to those who take a break or a holiday through learning about the culture and traditions of other nations, which is an enriching experience for all.</p><p>I recall a scheme that was run by what was then Strathclyde Regional Council, which referred people through the social work department to experience a family caravanning holiday in various locations across the country. Such examples have helped to ensure that many people who are on a low income get the chance to have a family holiday. It is a very important opportunity and a scheme that I would like to see more local authorities and organisations roll out.</p><p>Social tourism also carries with it significant economic benefits to tourism and associated industries by making use of facilities that would not otherwise be used during the off-peak season. Many examples that provide evidence of the success that social tourism can bring can be found throughout Europe. The IMSERSO scheme has helped to employ thousands of people while bringing in billions of euros.</p><p>There are a number of good examples of work that is being done to promote social tourism in Scotland, for example by the Family Holiday Association, an organisation that I had the pleasure of meeting earlier, which is working in partnership with companies such as Thomson and Canvas Holidays as well as with charities such as the Family Fund.</p><p>Those organisations are working to champion social tourism and to increase opportunities for those from low-income families who face a number of barriers. In particular, I welcome the work done by Thomson and First Choice in collecting an average of &#163;2 million per annum from donations on board flights as well as staff fundraisers, and I thank the people involved for their hard work and generosity. I encourage other travel firms and airlines to get involved because Thomson and First Choice have shown what can be done when such companies set their minds to it.</p><p>Over a number of years, several companies have run low-cost holiday breaks for families&#8212;I support that and ask others to take up that worthy cause. Through newspapers, people can obtain a voucher for a holiday at a cost of sometimes perhaps only &#163;9 or &#163;10. Many parents and their children deserve a break.

The act means that, from April 2015, the Scottish Parliament will be empowered to introduce and manage taxes on the purchase or leasing of land or buildings and on the disposal of waste to landfill.</p><p>Even after those measures are in place, 85 per cent of taxes paid in Scotland will be managed by Westminster, and the Scottish Parliament will manage only 15 per cent of our taxes. We should have responsibility for all taxes that are paid in Scotland. I believe that the Scottish Government has demonstrated an approach to taxation that is equitable and fair, especially when we remember the action that it has taken over the council tax.</p><p>LBTT will cover a range of property transactions. I believe that LBTT will not be disruptive to activity in the housing market. Indeed, there are features within LBTT that will smooth some undue distortions. With LBTT&#8217;s progressive system of taxation, the value of the tax applied will be more reflective of the total value of the property being sold. That may see an end to the inefficiencies in the market that arise from stamp duty.</p><p>LBTT may also provide an opportunity to incentivise first-time buyers to enter the market. Evidence suggests that the most recent stamp duty holiday did not greatly assist first-time buyers on to the housing ladder, as high deposit requirements usually remained the single biggest obstacles. I remember how much of a deposit my son had to put down when he bought his first house&#8212;it was quite horrendous. Any assistance in the form of discounts or exemptions should be welcomed, as every first-time buyer who gains a foothold on the housing ladder creates a knock-on effect higher up.</p><p>I note that the Scottish Government will need to consider carefully the proper levels at which to introduce the rates of tax so as to avoid unnecessary market distortions. Any disparity could introduce inequalities into the market and make it more difficult for households to move up the ladder. While I acknowledge that an aim of the more progressive system of taxation is to place a greater burden on those who have the broadest shoulders, it is worth pointing out that high house prices are not always matched by cash-rich or high-income households. Various sources suggest that the current system results in people paying too much tax at certain points, which distorts the housing market.</p><p>In its stage 1 report on the bill, the Finance Committee notes the need to consider the timing of the announcement of the rates and bands. The timing of that announcement is also extremely important to the residential housing market. We must ensure that the legislation is implemented in a fair and equitable fashion to avoid introducing unnecessary blockages in the market, which would affect the affordability of properties up and down the housing ladder. The announcement should occur as close to the implementation date of the LBTT as is practicable to avoid creating undue distortions. I note the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments on that today.</p><p>We have been advised that the tax will be cash neutral, but some of the briefings that we have received present various scenarios, including one that gives winners and losers. Under one of those scenarios, 50.7 per cent would pay less, 38.9 per cent would pay the same amount and more than 10 per cent would pay more than they do under SDLT.

The caves appear to have been created by sea action thousands of years ago, and they house a large collection of carvings on their walls. It has been said that there are more carvings on the walls of those caves than in all the other caves in Britain put together. The caves at Wemyss have been used by various groups including prehistoric cave dwellers, Picts, Norsemen, early Christians, Jacobites and smugglers throughout history&#8212;a fact which perhaps explains the large number of carvings.</p><p>Despite the obvious historical relevance of the caves and the fact that they are a registered scheduled monument, they are now under threat. I note that steps are being taken to prevent further damage from coastal erosion, landslips and human interference. Some caves have already been lost, along with all the historically important carvings that they contained.</p><p>The Save Wemyss Ancient Caves Society must be commended for its work to date in preserving the caves. Since the society was formed in October 1986 following wilful damage to the caves by vandals, its members have sacrificed a great deal of time and expense to promote and preserve the caves. The volunteers&#8217; work is varied and creative, and it covers everything from book publications to hosting annual historical lectures. In particular, the society holds a series of open Sundays, when visitors are given the chance to explore the caves and the museum dedicated to them.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s history has proved to be vitally important to the economy on both a national and a local level, and the Wemyss caves could provide a vital tourist attraction to Fife if they are preserved properly. They also provide excellent educational opportunities to the local schools&#8212;they represent an active learning opportunity.</p><p>It is important that all possible avenues are explored to preserve and protect these historically significant caves and the carvings that are contained within them. That includes the project that is being run by the Scottish Coastal Archaeology and the Problem of Erosion Trust, which plans to use digital technology on the caves. The project is welcome, as it has the capacity to make the cave carvings accessible to a wider audience, which it is hoped will in turn increase the level of interest in the caves.</p><p>Digitally reproduced images are no substitute for actually visiting the caves and seeing them at first hand, and I encourage as many people as possible to do so.

In those days, no one gave climate change any serious thought. How things have changed. In the 21st century, we must act on what is one of the main issues in the world today. What we dare to do today will affect the generations that will follow us in this world of ours. What we do today will help to ensure the survival of all mankind tomorrow.</p><p>I believe that Scotland has the most ambitious climate change legislation in the world. Scotland&#8217;s emissions are reducing; Scotland has had the biggest fall in emissions of the EU 15 since 1990. The challenge is increasing, but we are over halfway to achieving our target of 42 per cent emissions reductions by 2020.</p><p>Missing the 2010 annual target was disappointing, but annual fluctuations are to be expected. 2010 saw the first year-on-year increase since 2006, which was the result of very cold weather at the beginning and end of the year&#8212;the coldest six months since 1919. Scotland was not alone in experiencing the impact of that cold weather; the Welsh Assembly Government noted that increased demand for energy during the winter months was a major contributory factor to Welsh emissions increasing by six per cent between 2009 and 2010. The measures that are set out in RPP2 show that it is possible to compensate for having missed the 2010 target by beating targets in future years, thereby meeting our obligations on cumulative emissions, as well.</p><p>The Scottish Government has committed &#163;1.14&#160;billion over the current spending review period to support additional climate change action. That is on top of its traditional investment in areas such as public transport. The investment will support a range of climate change measures, including investment in driving the growth of low-carbon energy over the next three years in renewables and grid enhancement; investment in homes and communities, including support for fuel poverty reduction, energy efficiency and the climate challenge fund; investment in active travel, low-carbon vehicles and congestion reduction to reduce the impact of transport; and investment over three years to tackle emissions from rural land. The overall estimated annual costs that are set out in the draft RPP2 present overall financial costs to society as a whole, not just to the Government.</p><p>It is not just about Government money; investment decisions that are taken by local government, the wider public sector and the private sector will all contribute. Everyone in Scotland has their part to play in the climate change agenda and everyone needs to plan. If we all buy in and take part, we can help to meet our emissions target. Simple things such as saving energy in our daily lives will help. Remember the switch off campaign some years ago? Occasionally, I go around my house and switch off lights when my wife has left a room, which really annoys her. I used to say that my daughter lit up my life, but that was because she left all the lights on in the house. Basically, if we take part and switch off, we can save a lot of energy and help to move towards our targets.</p><p>It has been suggested that the Scottish Government needs to turn proposals into policies, and I am sure that the Government will do so where that is practicable. The money that the Government has invested over three years demonstrates its commitment. For example, the national retrofit programme will refurbish or refit Scotland&#8217;s older houses to make them more energy efficient. Other proposals are already contributing at a lower level, including support for cycling and for a modal shift to bus or rail and away from private car use.</p><p>I suggest that the Scottish Government is delivering on climate change. We are ahead of our schedule on renewables targets. By 2011, 65 per cent of Scottish homes had achieved a good energy efficiency rating&#8212;up from 50 per cent in 2007 and from 31 per cent in 2002. Tackling fuel poverty and cutting emissions from homes should be a priority of the Government, and I am sure that the Government is doing that.</p><p>The Government is reversing the decline in the woodland planting rate. It is phasing out, by 2020, the sending of biodegradable waste to landfill&#8212;the first ban anywhere in the UK&#8212;and it is giving more resources to Scottish communities to support low-carbon action at local level.</p><p>I believe that RPP2 takes the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment further in building on the strong package of proposals and policies that were in RPP1. The new vision for decarbonising heat means that Scotland will have a largely decarbonised heat sector by 2050, with significant progress being made by 2030.</p><p>I compliment the staff, the convener and the other members of the RACCE committee on the work that they did on an excellent committee report.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is now a number of years since the subject of climate change was first highlighted.

Supermarkets should also pay farmers a fair price for their produce, to ensure that farmers are encouraged to stay on the land and produce the amounts of food that will be required in the coming decades. Fair pricing is also crucial in the food industry.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s red meat and fisheries sector continues to grow and grow. In 2011, turnover in Scotland&#8217;s food and drink industry grew by 6 per cent. Gross value was up by 9 per cent and exports hit an all-time high of &#163;5.4 billion&#8212;a 10 per cent increase compared to the previous year.</p><p>I compliment the food industry in Scotland and I compliment the cabinet secretary who, to my mind, has been a major supporter of the Scottish food and drink industry. Richard Lochhead believes in the food and drink industry and it certainly shows at any function that he and I have had the opportunity to attend.</p><p>The Scottish food industry has an annual turnover of almost &#163;12 billion and supports almost 114,000 jobs in Scotland. The output from the beef, sheep and pig sectors has grown for the fourth year in a row. In 2011, beef production was the largest sector of Scottish farming, the sheep sector grew by 7 per cent and the pig sector grew by 15 per cent. Nearly &#163;250 million-worth of Scotch beef was sold last year. Scotch beef and lamb and specially selected pork brands are currently underpinned by six quality assurance schemes, which cover areas including farm feed, haulage, auction markets and primary processors.</p><p>The success of the Scottish fisheries sector over the past few years is also impressive and we should also support that industry. Aquaculture production and salmon and freshwater fisheries are estimated to be worth &#163;650 million. Scottish fisheries employ more than 2,000 people and support around 4,000 upstream and downstream jobs. Scotland is the largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon in the EU and it produces more than half of the UK&#8217;s farmed trout.</p><p>Scotland is, I suggest, an excellent producer of quality food, both farm and sea.

Given that their economic, environmental and social contributions and impacts are of considerable importance to Scotland, legislation is needed to enable them to develop sustainably and to co-exist as harmoniously as possible. Salmon farming and wild fisheries are vital industries for the coastal and inland parts of Scotland.</p><p>Climate change might have many implications for aquaculture and fisheries in Scotland. For example, in the case of salmon fisheries, any increase in river temperatures might reduce salmon reproduction. Reductions in summer rainfall will reduce summer flows, which will also increase water temperatures and make it more difficult for salmon to migrate upstream, and increased winter flows might scour the gravels and salmon spawning beds, resulting in the loss of or damage to eggs.</p><p>The bill places requirements for farm management agreements and farm management statements on a statutory footing, but I note that a significant majority of Scotland&#8217;s fish farms are already operating voluntarily within such a system.</p><p>Committee members have heard a range of opinions on the number, causes and effects on the wider environment of escapes from fish farms. Given that such escapes are obviously undesirable for the aquaculture and wild fisheries sectors, it is important for the sectors to work together to limit the number of escapes and their effects.</p><p>I note that some fish farms are putting in better nets with finer mesh to make it hard for seals to access them. Many fish farms are deploying acoustic deterrents in a bid to keep seals away from the farms. The culling of seals is not supported by the general public&#8212;or by me. Non-lethal alternatives need to be explored to allow seals to co-exist with the aquaculture industry. I welcome the efforts of some parts of the aquaculture industry to pursue alternative measures&#8212;in terms of netting and other equipment&#8212;that would prevent seals from being able to break through into farm cages. I also welcome the work that is being done at the University of St Andrews to develop an audio device that is as humane as possible for seals and which does not harm other species. I am encouraged that that device has secured investment.</p><p>As part of its evidence gathering, the committee learned that few, if any, wellboats are built in Scotland&#8212;they are mostly built in Norway.

After I left school, my first job was in retail grocery. I was fortunate to be employed as an assistant grocery manager for the Bellshill and Mossend Co-operative Society, where I stayed for three years. After that, I moved on to the Dalziel Co-operative Society, in Motherwell, first as an assistant manager and then, after a few years, as the co-operative&#8217;s youngest manager, in the Brandon Street branch.</p><p>Retail grocery was a job that I really enjoyed. Over the years, I was put in charge of bigger and better shops in Dalziel Co-operative, and eventually I was promoted to assistant grocery departmental manager. That co-operative is now Scotmid. I was in retail grocery until I was 28, when I moved on to another side of retail and credit selling. Working in a shop is certainly an experience.</p><p>Retail is the UK&#8217;s largest private sector employer, employing 3 million people. In Scotland alone, the sector employs around 239,000 people, or 9 per cent of the workforce&#8212;more people work in retail than work in tourism.</p><p>The retail workforce is one of the UK&#8217;s most diverse. Some 62 per cent of the workforce are women, 13 per cent are disabled and 12 per cent are ethnic minority workers, in proportions that reflect local populations. Just under a third of people in the retail workforce are between 16 and 24 years old. One in eight households has someone who works in retail.</p><p>Scottish retail is extremely important to the economy, as Margaret McCulloch said. There were sales of &#163;28 billion in 2011, and more than a third of consumer spending took place in shops. Five per cent of the UK&#8217;s gross domestic product is generated by the retail sector. Retail accounts for 20 per cent of turnover and 15 per cent of gross value added in the whole Scottish services sector&#8212;higher proportions than in the UK, for which the comparable figures are, respectively, 15 per cent and 11 per cent. Retailers account for 9.7 per cent of enterprises in Scotland. Again, the proportion is higher than in the UK, where the proportion is 9 per cent.</p><p>Shopping is something that we all do, whether it is for essential items such as food and clothing, or for leisure goods such as CDs, DVDs and books. Through our experiences in the local convenience store, the nearby supermarket, the high street or online stores, we all have a view on what retail has to offer.</p><p>From customer services assistant to fashion buyer, from butcher to store manager, and from fleet manager to food technologist, the sector offers a wide variety of roles, with opportunities to learn. People can learn skills, and can progress within the sector. They really can start on the shop floor and work their way to the top. Many well-known retail chief executives have done just that.</p><p>The growth in private sector jobs is critically important to the health of our economy, which is why now is the time to champion the retail sector and what it has to offer. With the support of the Government, retail can grow vital jobs and provide essential services to our communities.</p><p>I thank all who have supplied briefings on this subject. Margaret McCulloch mentioned the excellent Asda briefing. The writing is a bit small, so I had better put my other glasses on. Asda is investing in communities and supporting the young and long-term unemployed. It is</p><p>&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s retailer of choice for a vocational career&#8221;.</p><p>I am an Asda shopper, but I also go into Sainsbury&#8217;s and other shops.

For those who do not know about Eddie Calvert, I should say that he was a famous English trumpet player, who enjoyed his greatest successes in the 1950s. Calvert had his first UK number one in 1954 with &#8220;Oh Mein Papa&#8221;. My father&#8212;also called Richard Lyle&#8212;was a fervent Musicians Union member, and I well remember him taking part in other union activities in the 1960s and 1970s. He played in a dance band. In those days, he earned &#163;15 a week in his day job, but he could supplement the family income by playing at least two nights a week in Lanarkshire.</p><p>The debate centres on the actions of current hall and club owners who want musicians to play for nothing in their hall or club. When I first heard of that, I was appalled. A campaigner informed me that owners of halls or clubs force musicians to sell tickets for their gigs, and they must have a certain number of tickets sold prior to the performance to perform. Hall and club owners now have their cake and eat it by not paying the musician and getting an income from ticket and food and drink sales. That cannot be right.</p><p>The London Olympics brought that escalating problem to the attention of many. I can see the benefits that the London games brought to many, but it is unfair to ask for such an important part of the games and the supporting activities to be done for free.</p><p>We must all remember that musicians train and develop their skills as a career choice, not as a hobby, and they must be compensated for the work that they undertake. Research has shown that more than half of professional musicians earn less than &#163;20,000 a year and that 60 per cent have worked for free in the past year. Those figures are particularly stark when we consider that the United Kingdom Government failed to include music in its &#163;6&#160;million boost to the creative industries.</p><p>Because of those low incomes, only 35 per cent of musicians pay into a pension scheme, which is a worrying trend given today&#8217;s economic uncertainty. Compounding the problem is the fact that a large number of people in today&#8217;s society think it acceptable to download music for free&#8212;or, if they pay for it, it is often extremely cheap. That has led to many professional musicians relying on live performances to make up for the loss of earnings. If that income, too, is threatened, many musicians will no longer be able to continue in their chosen profession.</p><p>Scotland is known for its world-class musicians. However, if the problem is not resolved, we will no longer be able to make that claim, as many musicians will have to face the stark reality that a career as a professional musician is not a viable option.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683226", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Musicians Union Work not Play Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am pleased to be taking part in this debate, and I thank Drew Smith for bringing it to the chamber.

Young people who are just leaving education are extremely important to the Scottish economy. Business needs young, educated people&#8212;whether they are coming straight from school or from further or higher education&#8212;in order to help businesses grow. That in turn will help those businesses stave off the effects of the current slow economy. Recruiting straight from education is an efficient way of building an effective and productive workforce.</p><p>Despite the fact that the majority of businesses that recruit staff straight from education find young people well prepared for the workplace, only 25 per cent of businesses in Scotland have recruited straight from an education environment in the past two to three years.</p><p>There seems to be an inherent problem for young people looking for work. Companies want young people with experience, but those young people cannot get that experience without gaining employment in the first place. That is where the make young people your business campaign has the most to offer. By highlighting that problem, we can move on to helping young people gain employment by increasing their employability skills.</p><p>There are many advantages to recruiting young, educated people. In today&#8217;s workplace, with the advancement of technology, many markets are changing rapidly and rely on a youthful customer base. By employing young people, our companies will be able to utilise their fresh ideas and approaches, which in turn will help to open up new and emerging markets.</p><p>The make young people your business campaign is keen to point out that schemes such as modern apprenticeships often pay for themselves very quickly. Also, offering young people work placements helps to take the risk out of recruitment, as the placement acts as a trial period for both parties before any formal commitment is made by offering a job. At the end of the placement, if the company feels that it cannot offer a job to the person, that placement will still have given them invaluable experience that they will be able to put to use in other jobs that they go on to apply for.</p><p>As I said, most businesses find that people who have just left education are prepared for work: 86 per cent of businesses believe that university leavers are prepared for work; and 60 per cent believe that school leavers are prepared for the working environment. If that is the case, why are businesses so reluctant to use that valuable resource?</p><p>We must make Scottish business aware of the many benefits in recruiting young educated people and help them to recruit those young people. Steps are already being taken to do that. Skills Development Scotland is seeking the support of employers that would consider offering disadvantaged young people opportunities for sustainable employment in their business, and payments of &#163;1,500 are available through the employer recruitment incentive. In addition, talent Scotland offers a free service for employers that includes job advertising, company promotion and access to graduates.</p><p>Those are just some of the many schemes available to employers to encourage them to employ young people straight from education. For years, we have been telling young people to get a good education so that they can get a good job.

As always, our goals are ambitious and will not be easy to achieve but, with Government departments and public bodies working together with renewed vigour, the targets should be met, and Scotland will be a world leader in biodiversity.</p><p>Biodiversity is particularly important to Scotland. As has been said, about 90,000 species live within our borders. Just as important as the sheer number of species are the habitats and scenery that help to make up our world-renowned landscape. Let us be clear that our unique landscape is an asset that we must maintain. The European habitats directive lists 160 conservation priority habitats, of which Scotland is home to 65. Because of Scotland&#8217;s climate and landform, many species are at the extreme of their range or are living in atypical habitats, which in turn has led to many of them adapting and becoming local varieties.</p><p>As a member of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, I welcome the debate. I have seen for myself the wide range of environments that Scotland offers, ranging from its heather moorland, upland blanket bog and lowland raised bog to its freshwater and seawater lochs. All those must be protected, as I am led to believe that the natural environment is worth &#163;21 billion to &#163;23 billion per year to the Scottish economy. That figure might seem high to some people, but the loss of any significant part of our biodiversity is incalculable and would have a devastating knock-on effect on a number of industries that rely on our biodiversity to survive, such as our booming tourist industry, which employs more than 9 per cent of the workforce in Scotland. Further, the figure does not take into account the advantages that contact with outdoor places has for our physical and mental wellbeing.</p><p>Because of past failings, some of our biodiversity has been lost; unfortunately, biodiversity continues to be lost, although thankfully at a slower rate because of better management of the various threats. It is important that we find a balance between our social, economic and environmental needs to protect Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity. It is important that we conserve what we have and do what we can to stop the continual erosion of our biodiversity, because it is far cheaper to maintain nature&#8217;s capacity to provide vital services that contribute to our economy than it would be to have to replace that at some point in future.</p><p>To improve on our current biodiversity, we cannot focus only on one aspect of our diverse wildlife or an individual habitat, as most wildlife depends on a complex environment. Therefore, we need to look at the bigger picture and to enhance our entire biodiversity, which in turn will enhance our economic and social wellbeing. As has been said, that will require Government departments to work closely with outside organisations such as the RSPB, Plantlife and Scottish Land &amp; Estates.</p><p>To reach our targets for 2020, we will need to engage more people with biodiversity, so that they can enjoy&#8212;and encourage others to enjoy&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s unique environment and reap the economic benefits that it provides, and so that that can continue for generations to come.</p><p>Biodiversity must be brought into the mainstream of public interest; it must no longer be regarded as a specialist issue that the majority of people cannot enjoy or influence. It is important that we do everything possible to maintain and enhance Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity, so that we can not only meet the targets for 2020 but ensure that one of Scotland&#8217;s most important resources is not wasted, depriving Scotland&#8217;s future generations of the economic and health advantages of our rich biodiversity.</p><p>In the early 1970s I saw a film that brought home to me what could happen in the next 100 years. I recommend that members purchase the film&#8212;I do not know whether Blockbuster will sell it before it closes. The futuristic film, &#8220;Soylent Green&#8221;, shows what will happen to the world if we do not preserve our environment.

It is often the case that a merger or acquisition is positive for the companies involved and the national interest, encourages growth in the economy and provides stability for the companies concerned.</p><p>That said, there have been some recent high-profile cases that have brought to light aspects of merger and acquisition policies that it might be in the public interest to look at. The case of RBS has been mentioned, but I want to talk about the merger between Lloyds TSB and the Bank of Scotland in 2008, which is particularly interesting. Although the merger took place in exceptional circumstances at the height of the economic crisis, it was allowed to go ahead. Questions were raised about the legality of the merger, which in normal circumstances would most likely have been blocked by a competition watchdog, as it created a huge firm with 22 million customers. The deal was pushed through only by the use of a national interest provision in competition law, which allowed the UK Government to override any objections that watchdogs raised.</p><p>The deal was completed and allowed the newly merged companies to survive the worst of the economic downturn. However, serious concern was expressed about whether the deal delivered the best for the customer, because it caused a lack of competition. John Mason mentioned the fact that banks have got bigger.</p><p>More recently, the high-profile proposed merger of BAE Systems and EADS highlighted the possible need to re-examine merger and acquisition policies. David Cameron was put under pressure by a number of his back benchers, who were concerned that that merger was not in the UK&#8217;s national or manufacturing interests. I am sure that members are aware that, as has been said, that deal fell through because the UK, French and German Governments could not reach a compromise to suit all three nations.</p><p>As I said, not all mergers and acquisitions are detrimental, despite the uncertainty that they bring to the workforce of the companies involved. The merger between Scottish Power and Spain&#8217;s second-largest electricity company, Iberdrola, has brought benefits to both companies and to the public whom they serve. That merger created the world&#8217;s largest wind power developer, which invests 25 per cent of its business in renewables. In turn, that has helped Scotland in its desire to lead the world on renewable energy. Scotland is also first in line for investment from the newly merged company, as it has 24 per cent of total investment. The company will invest nearly &#163;4 billion in the next three years.</p><p>Despite that, it is important to review mergers and acquisitions policy, to ensure that the best outcomes are achieved for the national and public interests.

Its bad debt problem has been attributed to falling commercial property values. The bank made an underlying profit when bad debts were excluded, but it reported that the profit was down 16 per cent to &#163;448&#160;million&#8212;as reported by BBC news Scotland business.</p><p>Along with the Yorkshire Bank, the Clydesdale Bank has cut costs, with 468 jobs shed during the year to September. The chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank has said that the UK Government&#8217;s austerity programme has contributed to the harsh business environment and its decision to carry out the review.</p><p>The two bank brands run out of Glasgow have been the subject of long-running speculation, as the National Bank of Australia, the parent company, has sent out conflicting signals on what it wants to do with its only European operation. The Australian economy is doing relatively well and, with opportunities to expand in Asia, the Clydesdale Bank has increasingly been seen as a problem for its owner. The group chief executive has stated that UK gross domestic product has declined by 0.2 per cent in the quarter to December and that those difficult conditions have adversely affected the performance of UK banking.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have heard and read about the banking crisis. Household name banks have been partly taken over by the UK Government through the buying of shares. For 10 years, I worked for one of those household names&#8212;the Royal Bank of Scotland. Our division was made redundant, so I know what redundancy feels like.</p><p>In the 10 years prior to the millennium, everything was rosy, particularly for the Royal Bank of Scotland. Management wanted to mark the millennium, which it did by making a &#163;2&#160;billion profit in the year 2000. Banks could do no wrong, the money poured in and out, profits grew and the share prices rose. They thought that it could never end, but we had forgotten about black Monday and black Wednesday in the prior decades.</p><p>With the on-going financial crisis, over the past number of years household banks have paid the price. I would suggest that too many jobs have been lost in the branches and centres in the banking sector, and I will speak about those.</p><p>The Clydesdale Bank has not been swept up in the storm that has erupted. The bank has not had the same daily publicity as other national banks have had. The management of the bank needs to look at its future decisions. As I have said, I am a customer of the Clydesdale Bank. I believe in that bank&#8212;I still believe in the Royal Bank of Scotland&#8212;but I get annoyed when I have to wait in a queue, when there are not enough tellers on the desks, when I have to wait for phones to be answered or when I receive an automated answer when I phone a call centre. I get annoyed when the Clydesdale bank in my local town is not open on a Saturday when the Royal Bank of Scotland across the road is.</p><p>Not everyone has a computer; not everyone wants to do money transfers over the internet. Some customers believe in counter transactions and want to have a face-to-face conversation in their local bank. They also want call centres and financial solutions centres, which are required for customers who do internet banking.</p><p>I know that some banks close early because they say that customers are not coming into the branch. They do not come in because they are working. I strongly suggest that banks should stay open late for their customers. They do not cater for customers through their call centres and they do not cater for customers now as they did in the past. They must cater for all customers who use branches and call centres.</p><p>I get annoyed when people who have worked for a firm for many years, have given good service and commitment and have made profits for the firm, and who have rent or mortgages to pay, car payments to make and families to look after, are cast on to the scrap heap because a firm wants to restructure.</p><p>The Clydesdale Bank is a good bank and I hope that it will still accept my business, even after this speech today, but I ask the Clydesdale Bank to reconsider its proposals for further redundancies in its centres. I also ask all banks to provide a better service. I am sure that the Clydesdale Bank could show the way to other banks by providing confidence in the way that it carries out its business. The Clydesdale Bank is an asset to Scotland and its staff deserve better. I ask its owners to reconsider their plans and to give their call centre staff the Christmas that they deserve.

Like Jim Hume, I welcome the timing of this debate. Only yesterday, I drove to the Parliament, and as anyone who travels on the M8 knows, the fog always lies at Harthill. I am always amazed by the number of people who do not drive to the road conditions. People were doing 80 or 90mph and jumping in and out of their lane. I hope that as part of the campaign people will be urged to drive responsibly. I love people who tailgate me. I often think that I will ask them to come into my car and sit beside me, because they are right up at the back of the car. What will happen if they try to brake in severe weather? They will just bash into the car in front. I hope that what the minister said will come true.</p><p>The vast majority of car owners think that they have done enough to prepare for poor driving conditions when they have an ice scraper and some de-icer. I love it when I go into Asda and see people buying their de-icers and scrapers. They should prepare by ensuring that their car is fit and their tyres are inflated and road worthy and have tread. They should ensure that they drive to the conditions.</p><p>I welcome the investment in technology to ensure adequate planning and preparedness. I welcome the trialling of closed-circuit television cameras in gritter vehicles, to help to inform decision makers about real-time conditions. After being stuck on the brae in Motherwell a couple of years ago I made the point to the minister that councils should have grit bins on hills, because gritters cannot get by all the traffic that is stuck on the road. Some people nowadays have wonderful new cars that just cannot get up small hills&#8212;I just love it to bits when I see that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I agree with James Dornan: I, too, do not agree with what the Labour Party amendment says.

A household is in fuel poverty if it spends 10 per cent or more of its post-tax income on gas and electricity. For every 5 per cent increase in energy prices, 46,000 households are pushed into fuel poverty. Fuel poverty has risen steadily since 2002 and reached a peak of 33 per cent in 2009. Fuel costs have risen six times faster than household income since 2004. I am sure that Anne McTaggart agrees that the &#163;65&#160;million budget that the Scottish Government has allocated to tackling fuel poverty is welcome.

I endorse the motion that is before us and pay tribute to the members of the 5th Fife scout group who are mentioned in it.</p><p>I also thank David Torrance MSP for bringing the debate to the chamber. I understand that he entered the scouts in 1969 at the age of eight and became a scout leader when he was 18. He has held most positions in his scout group over the past 33 years&#8212;he looks too young for that. For the past 12 years, he has been the group&#8217;s scout leader. Because of his hard work and dedication, David Torrance has been awarded the highest achievement in venture scouts&#8212;now explorer scouts: the Queen&#8217;s scout award. Throughout all his hard work he has been in the same scout group for 43 years. I am sure that his leadership is an example to all.</p><p>People may ask, &#8220;What is scouting?&#8221; Scouting is a worldwide youth development movement that is active in 216 countries and territories and has a global membership of more than 28 million. As has already been said, it was started in 1907 by Robert Baden-Powell to give boys the opportunity to try activities that they would not otherwise have the chance to do, with the aim of helping them expand their horizons. In 1976, the movement started to accept girls as well. Today scouting has evolved; it has changed considerably to meet changes in society and the world in general.</p><p>I was never a scout but I understand that scouting provides challenges and adventures for young people of both genders aged between six and 25. It is a relevant and modern pursuit for those who enjoy adventure and want to meet new friends while developing new skills. Scouting is all about fun, as David Torrance and Dennis Robertson have told us. I have never boiled egg on a stone and I look forward to Dennis showing me how to do that. Scouting is also about helping members to fulfil their potential as individuals and as active members of society.</p><p>What do scouts do? The point has been well made that they work well for their community and they involve the community in their work. Scouts learn by doing, thinking for themselves, working in teams and taking responsibility. That includes everyday adventure at weekly or less regular meetings, as well as exciting outdoor activities or trips away. Scouting offers a huge range of activities and experiences to suit all ages, abilities and interests. Basically, it is a balanced programme.</p><p>Scouting includes activities such as badge work, awards and challenges. Scouts award badges to recognise personal achievements and progression. Young people can work towards a range of awards and challenges that reward participation, commitment and achievement.</p><p>Scouting also involves camping and outdoor activities. Over the past few months, David Torrance has told me about the work that he has done on outdoor activities in the Borders. Those activities are a very important part of scouting and, I suggest, are an excellent way to develop what scouts are doing.</p><p>Scouts also have international experiences. Lots of young people will have their first taste of foreign travel and meet people from other countries with the scouts, and there are opportunities to travel abroad to international camps. Service to the community has also been mentioned.</p><p>I pay tribute to all scouts. I agree with Liz Smith&#8217;s comments and think that 95 per cent of kids are really excellent. The work that the scouts do is excellent and I support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674665", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: 5th Fife Scout Group (Scottish Championship Award)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join my fellow MSPs in welcoming our scout visitors to their Parliament.

I am sure that members will welcome the millions of pounds that have been spent on the Glasgow area, and I am sure that the facilities and houses that have been built will enhance the life of people in Glasgow as a whole.</p><p>The Government has also provided significant money for the establishment of sports hubs, with nearly 141 to be opened.

That affirmative attitude has set the foundation for equal opportunities in all sectors and underpinned the importance of the work of women.</p><p>We now need to reassert our determination towards achieving equal opportunities in the labour market. Across all levels, we need to close the segregation gap by providing more flexible work opportunities. Although women comprise 48 per cent of the Scottish labour force, those workers still have primary responsibility for childcare. A disproportionate number of carers are women, and provisions need to be put in place to allow women to balance work life and home life. Many women seek employment that offers some flexibility, whether through flexible arrangements, shift working or part-time hours. The Official Report of the Equal Opportunities Committee meeting details many situations that are faced by women, whether they are single, single parents or married. I would love to go into that further, but unfortunately I do not have the time.</p><p>We must tackle discrimination and the stereotyping of female jobs. Some 64 per cent of the lowest-paid workers are women. Female workers are more commonly found in low-paid jobs such as cleaning, catering, clerical, cashiering and caring jobs, and less than a third of top-level jobs are held by women. Conversely, their male counterparts can enjoy higher-paid jobs in various fields.</p><p>The Parliament should be committed to making transformational changes to childcare.

Almost two thirds of the beneficiaries of that will be women.

Alcohol minimum pricing is the latest step to change the drinking culture in Scotland. It is crucial that minimum pricing be implemented because, without it, our previous steps will prove to be less effective, because alcohol can be sold at rock-bottom prices.</p><p>As I have said previously in the chamber, before I was elected to the Parliament, I was not convinced that minimum pricing was the right way to change our drinking culture; I did not agree with the policy. However, after hearing the evidence that the Health and Sport Committee collected, I have changed my view. It is encouraging that all the major parties, apart from Scottish Labour, recognise the need for minimum pricing and are prepared to support the bill at stage 3. That type of cross-party approach will help to eradicate Scotland&#8217;s drinking culture. I implore the Labour Party to change its position on the bill and to vote for it at decision time.</p><p>The culture needs to be changed. Let us not lose track of why it is important that we pass the bill. Alcohol is connected with more than 60 types of disease as well as to disability and injury, and people in Scotland are drinking hazardously or harmfully. Scotland has one of the highest cirrhosis mortality rates in western Europe and is currently ranked eighth in the world for alcohol consumption per head of population. Alcohol is a contributory factor in a wide range of health and social problems, including accidental injury, violence and mental ill-health. Scotland has one of the highest rates of liver disease in the world and the figure continues to rise at an alarming rate.</p><p>Alcohol misuse affects not only the individual drinker, but has far-reaching consequences for friends and family, wider communities and society at large. Misuse of alcohol in Scotland costs &#163;3.5&#160;billion every year in direct and indirect costs. There is a growing consensus among professional bodies including the World Health Organization and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence that minimum pricing could be the most effective means to reduce alcohol consumption.</p><p>The University of Sheffield has carried out various studies and has done modelling on minimum unit pricing, and Professor Tim Stockwell from the University of Victoria in Canada has said that introducing a minimum price for alcohol can bring significant health and social benefits that can lead to significant savings in the health service. Research has also indicated that minimum pricing will target high-alcohol products that are sold cheaply. Such products are often consumed by harmful drinkers and are very popular with young drinkers.</p><p>It is clear that alcohol consumption is a problem in this country and that something needed to be done to ease the social and economic problems that are caused by it. Studies have shown that the best way of tackling the problem is by introducing a minimum price for alcohol. Alcohol is a serious national health problem that must be tackled because it has a significant impact on the health of our nation.</p><p>I say to Scottish Labour that if I can change my mind over this issue, I am sure that others&#8212;in particular Labour members&#8212;can change their minds, too. Scottish Labour must show leadership. Its do-nothing attitude has isolated the party in the Parliament. Labour members can bluster all they want, but they have got it wrong and they must now see that.

I record my appreciation for the two best housing ministers: the cabinet secretary, Alex Neil, and his friend and sidekick, Keith Brown, who are the Batman and Robin of housing.</p><p>Working with COSLA, we have already filled the gap that the Tory-Lib Dem cuts to council tax benefit gave rise to, which could have badly affected the 558,000 people in Scotland on low incomes who receive the benefit. If members want to know about homelessness, I invite them to cast their minds back to &#8220;Cathy Come Home&#8221;, which was shown on television back in the 70s&#8212;perhaps they can pick it up somewhere&#8212;because it showed what homelessness is like.</p><p>The Welfare Reform Act 2012 will reduce housing benefit for those who live in social rented housing that is larger than they require. The Scottish Council for Single Homeless reported to the committee that at least 75 per cent of social housing in Scotland comprises two to three-bedroomed accommodation, with the majority of housing for homeless people in Scotland having a single bedroom. The change will make the 2012 commitment more difficult to meet.</p><p>I note that the Scottish Government is working with COSLA, local authorities, the SCSH, Shelter and the Housing Regulator to develop a measurement tool for homelessness.</p><p>The Tory-Liberal Democrat Government plans to reduce housing benefit for those living in homes that are bigger than they require, as I said. The Scottish Government has undertaken an impact analysis of the measure and has identified more than 95,000 social tenants who will lose between &#163;27 and &#163;65 a month. That will remove &#163;50 million a year from the Scottish economy.</p><p>Last night on television, we saw what is facing people in Newham, but that is for another day&#8212;I have run out of time.</p><p>I support the motion, and thank the two gentlemen on the front bench, who are doing such a good job.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665539", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for reminding me that, in eight days&#8217; time, I will demit office as a councillor.

In a spirit of honesty, I, too, have a confession to make. In my maiden speech last year, I welcomed the reintroduction of the bill but, to be honest, I did not support minimum unit pricing prior to coming to Parliament. However, after nearly a year as a member of the Health and Sport Committee, I have been convinced by the evidence of the benefits of the proposal, and I pledge my full support to the committee&#8217;s report on the bill.</p><p>It is the overall health and wellbeing of the people of Scotland that the bill addresses. Scotland faces many health problems, such as obesity, and we do not want alcohol abuse to add to them and continue to worsen the country&#8217;s health. Liver disease is already the second most common cause of death in the under-65s. Scotland has a noticeable problem with alcohol misuse compared with the rest of the UK, and we must acknowledge it as a concrete issue.</p><p>Off-licence sales of pure alcohol in Scotland increased by 52 per cent between 1994 and 2010, and off-licence sales of vodka in Scotland are almost 2.5 times higher than in England and Wales. If we consider that the Scottish population is minute in comparison with our English neighbours, those statistics are worrying enough to warrant the introduction of minimum unit pricing of alcohol as a disincentive for binge drinking and alcoholism.</p><p>The measure will benefit not only the younger generation, for whom binge drinking has become a culture, but those young people who have to deal with alcoholism in their families. It is estimated that 65,000 children live with a parent with an alcohol problem, and excessive drinking by a partner is cited as a contributory cause in one divorce case in three. We must consider not only the immediate health effects but the detrimental collateral damage that is caused by alcohol misuse.</p><p>Scotland has previously toyed with the idea of introducing a minimum price at less than which a unit of alcohol must not be sold, but the proposals have always been removed at the later stages of the consideration of legislation. That happened back in 2009. I believe that a significant proportion of the cases that are reflected in the statistics could have been avoided if the Government had been able to follow through with its plans at that time.</p><p>Feedback has been received from the variety of sectors that are involved. The committee issued its call for written evidence on 1 November 2011, and 95 submissions were received. Some 85 per cent were in favour, and 15 per cent against. Those who were in favour of the proposal were from the health, licensing and on-trade sectors, and those who opposed it tended to be from the alcohol manufacture and off-trade sectors. Although the committee recognises the manufacturers&#8217; concerns, it is our job to see beyond that and listen to the statistics, which resonate loudly. They show us that Scotland has an alcohol misuse problem that is detrimentally affecting our health and our society, and minimum unit pricing might help us to tackle that.</p><p>Minimum unit pricing will be the most effective and efficient way in which to reduce alcohol consumption. That is why we propose&#8212;and I accept&#8212;that method over banning the sale of low-cost alcohol or increasing duty on alcoholic drinks.</p><p>As has been confirmed today, the bill already has the support of the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. The Labour Party still opposes the bill and, although it has made an effort to present an alternative set of regulations, they would not combat the Scottish relationship with alcohol as effectively as the setting of a minimum unit price. It is the correlation between low prices and high-strength alcohol that has to be changed.</p><p>The relationship between minimum unit pricing and health benefits is supported widely in the academic world as well as the political world. Tim Stockwell, a professor at the centre for addictions research of British Columbia, when talking about a report on whether minimum pricing reduces consumption, concluded:</p><p>&#8220;This is significant information for policies to prevent the substantial toll of death, injury and illness associated with hazardous alcohol use&#8221;.</p><p>Some manufacturers are adamant that there is no correlation. However, empirical evidence&#8212;I like those words&#8212;has shown that minimum unit pricing has been beneficial. The Health and Sport Committee held a videoconference with Professor Stockwell and, although we agreed that each society reacts differently to policies so they cannot be directly compared, the evidence thus far shows that minimum unit pricing has led to positive outcomes both for health and in other areas that are connected with alcohol abuse, such as crime. Professor Stockwell assured the committee:</p><p>&#8220;Theoretically, from a purely public health perspective, the idea of pricing ethanol in such a way that the more ethanol someone purchases for their consumption, the more expensive it will be, what is proposed in Scotland is perfect.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 10 January 2012; c 798.]</p><p>Therefore, as a back-bench MSP, I urge every party and every member to support this proposal to tackle alcohol misuse in Scotland.</p><p>I am a smoker. I did not support the smoking ban, and I was wrong. I did not support minimum unit pricing at first, and again I was wrong, but I now support the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have been called many things in my life, but I have never been called a tartan Tory.

I am especially grateful for the excellent contributions to the report by my good friends Mary Scanlon and Mary Fee, both of whom are, sadly, no longer on the committee.</p><p>With an ageing population, it is increasingly salient that we ensure that older people are provided with the correct care. It is important not only that the correct care is provided but that we can deal with the increased demand for care as a result of demographic change. Sadly, as the report makes clear, healthy life expectancy has not increased at the same rate as life expectancy, and men and women can expect to spend about seven and nine years respectively in poor health. That suggests not only that the demography and demands are changing but that those changes will have a detrimental effect on the health of all Scottish citizens.</p><p>The type of care that is required is changing and must adapt to accommodate the move towards provisions for care in a person&#8217;s home as well as for care in a care home. The motivation to produce the report stemmed from the increasingly high-profile cases of the past year, including the announcement in July 2011 that the Southern Cross Healthcare Group would cease to be a care home operator, a decision affecting more than 90 care homes in Scotland. Our aim was to scrutinise and investigate the relevant legislation in order to reveal any weak areas in the regulatory regime and to examine whether the safeguards were robust enough to protect the elderly.</p><p>Although the report shows that the current regulatory system is sufficiently rigorous to identify those care services for older people that are failing to deliver high-quality care, that does not mean that there are no weaknesses. I will highlight a few. There must be improved accessibility to and better dissemination of inspection reports, as well as enhanced engagement of healthcare professionals in the inspection process. There must also be research into the appropriate staffing mix for care homes and other services for older people, and all staff should be paid the living wage and trained to the highest standards.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s inquiry has received widespread support, including from the Scottish Human Rights Commission, which has welcomed this debate, because it has a number of recommendations for areas of improvement. The responses that the report has induced from bodies such as the commission on how we might further regulate our system are extremely valuable for the growth of better regulation for the care of older people.</p><p>In addition to that outside support, I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s previous announcement that care homes for older people would receive at least one unannounced inspection each year, and that it was hoped that that provision would be implemented before the expected statutory commencement date of April 2012. In fact, that provision came into effect on 8 February, which is great news.</p><p>Feedback from inspections and from relatives and friends of care home residents should not be deemed as negative. We would like to encourage the process of regulation from within the care homes themselves. The report has already highlighted important areas that lacked integrity previously. It also works as a tool for knowledge for those who are unaware of the changing demographic situation, which must be addressed right away.</p><p>Quality of care for the elderly is a key priority for the SNP Government. The SNP is bringing forward inspired plans on the integration of health and social care through the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill. We aim to make the transition as quickly as possible so that we avoid any more tragic incidents. The Government has taken on board the committee&#8217;s recommendations.

Scotland presents itself to the world as a forerunner in the fight for climate justice by acting as a model for best practice on climate change and by promoting moral, environmental and economic reasons for action by other countries. I compliment the minister on his announcement on the climate justice fund.</p><p>The impacts of climate change already affect people in the global south through droughts, flooding and many more events that cause devastation to communities and to countries&#8217; growth. The developed world should do its best to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but it is now widely accepted that the developed world&#8217;s attempts to battle climate change and climate injustice are just not good enough, which puts the third-world countries at a further disadvantage in their ability to develop while combating the effects of climate change. Scotland must pave the way for the global north and set an example to the rest of the developed world. We need to continue to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but we must also seek to correct that gross injustice by allowing the third world to develop in the way that the global north did while, where possible, aiding those countries&#8212;which cannot afford the luxury of green technology&#8212;to do that sustainably.</p><p>A 2005 Friends of the Earth report revealed that people who live in deprived areas in Scotland suffer disproportionately from industrial pollution and poor water and air quality. Further, more than a third of households now suffer from fuel poverty, and the poorest households&#8212;which include households that are unlikely to own a car&#8212;are actually most likely to suffer from poor air quality as a result of congestion. We must take action to tackle that, whether through insulating homes, reducing traffic or producing reduction action plans for communities. Because 25 per cent of emissions come from the home and everyday life, we must do all that we can to encourage a holistic approach domestically, as well as championing the issues internationally.</p><p>We need to develop a fairer community at home and abroad, because our domestic activity will help to shape our identity as a country in the fight for climate justice. We can do that by continuing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions while doing what we can to provide support for those who are most at risk in developing countries, so that the world continues to grow, but in a sustainable and equal manner. Scotland reaps revenue from its beautiful surroundings, which are tourist attractions; its fisheries, which are already depleted; and its forestry and agriculture.</p><p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, coupled with Scotland&#8217;s ambitious renewable targets set the standard for Scotland. Friends of the Earth has used the Scottish approach as an example for other nations to follow. We want to continue to have influence in that way with regard to climate justice. The entire Parliament must feel an obligation to tackle the issue and to listen to our citizens, who are calling for change. Non-governmental organisations such as the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, Friends of the Earth, Stop Climate Chaos Scotland and Amnesty International are prominent in showing their support for Scotland becoming a front runner in the process. It is important that we keep our links with international groups, which we can help to spread the message of Scottish support, and that we work together with them in the fight.</p><p>There should be a strong consensus throughout Scotland. We can push for support abroad, but we also want to implement the ideology domestically. As a leading nation in the industrial revolution, which has played a part in climate change, Scotland must now become a leading nation in a new revolution for climate justice. Climate change is fast becoming a humanitarian crisis. We have seen an increased in natural disasters such as floods and droughts, food and water scarcity, and disease, and there has been increased conflict over resources, and many other issues. Many countries in the global north throw themselves at the chance to help in the aftermath of a large-scale crisis such as a natural disaster. Rather than sending aid to clear up the mess, we should be helping to prevent it from ever happening in the first place, and helping those who have already been affected to adapt to their new surroundings.</p><p>The world is continually warming because of the greenhouses gases that remain in the atmosphere for long periods, so we must act now, not later. We must treat climate justice as we would any other human rights issue so that, as an international topic, it can be treated in a way that allows for discussion and harmony between national and international efforts to address the global challenge in a co-ordinated and human-centred way.</p><p>It is our obligation to ensure that the principles of climate justice are implemented throughout all policy areas internationally and nationally, as well as to encourage a human rights approach to climate justice. Not only should Scotland continue to create innovative and effective policy domestically, it must put the same effort into multinational agreements to fight for climate justice.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Parliament understands that poor and vulnerable people in developing countries are most affected by climate change, but are least equipped to respond to it.

That is &#163;1.12 below the given living wage. For those aged 18 to 20, the national minimum wage stands at &#163;4.98 an hour. Competition to get into universities has increased and many people who can go into work after leaving school want to become independent from their parents, but they are not able to do so. Moreover, &#163;6.08 an hour for a person over the age of 21 is not sufficient for those who want to start a life with a family.</p><p>The majority of councils are now paying their staff the living wage. Six further councils have confirmed that they will pay it from April, and another two have said that they intend to introduce it.</p><p>The Government supports the principle of the living wage and the public sector pay policy for staff for 2012-13 requires employers covered by it to pay their employees a Scottish living wage of &#163;7.20 an hour. The public sector pay policy covers employees from central Government, Government agencies and the national health service, but not the wider public sector. Although many local authorities are implementing the living wage, others are not, which means that local authority workers are not safeguarded by that incentive. I believe that they should be.</p><p>The SNP is dedicated to the welfare and wellbeing of its citizens and is working with the European Commission on the issue, because it is estimated that about 550,000 employees on adult rates in Scotland are paid below the living wage.</p><p>In the private sector, pay is a matter for individual companies, and including conditions for procurement processes could amount to a restriction of the freedom to provide services that is guaranteed by article 56 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. The Commission is currently reviewing the issue so that it can examine procurement rules.</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises that local authorities are not safeguarded by a living wage and the public sector pay policy, but it encourages all employers to implement it so that we can help to ensure that everyone can afford to meet their basic needs. We should recognise the need to safeguard those who are employed by contractors and those who are not directly employed, so that they too can receive a living wage. We are striving to resolve a large poverty gap, so the living wage should be implemented where possible to secure good living standards for the Scottish population.</p><p>UK regulations on minimum wages leave people with not enough money to support a family. That is closely related to poverty, which in turn is a social problem, disadvantaging those who cannot afford to improve their circumstances. That still occurs, even though the Scottish Government has produced data that allow us to see that the minimum wage, as it stands, simply does not provide a basic living for a worker and their family.</p><p>Over the years, Mr Pentland and I have continually battled over budgets in North Lanarkshire Council.

I do not support a system that undermines the principle of taking care of people by using modernisation of the welfare system to cut their benefits in order to save money and&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;to reduce the massive deficit that was caused by successive London Governments. Those damaging cuts to benefits and services will impact on some of the most vulnerable people in Scotland. The changes will take money from the poorest individuals and families, including lone parents, kinship carers, and young people who have left the care system.</p><p>Lone parents will be required to enter the workforce when their youngest child starts school. It will be interesting to see where they will find jobs. They will face having their benefits withdrawn if they refuse the childcare arrangements that are offered, even if they are unsatisfactory, inconvenient or costly.</p><p>In Scotland, &#163;2.5&#160;billion will be cut from the benefits system: the money will be taken out of the pockets of benefits claimants in Scotland. That figure has been confirmed by the DWP. Apart from the effect that they will have on claimants, the cuts will have a drastic effect on Scottish business. The introduction of the proposed legislation could reduce the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s ability to deliver key policies such as the early years framework and the child poverty strategy.</p><p>Since the days of Mrs Thatcher, each Tory Government&#8212;now aided by their Liberal partners&#8212;has attacked people who live on benefits. Do they class them all as scroungers? They are not scroungers. Remember what Norman Tebbit, Tory minister in the 1980s, said about getting on your bike and looking for work? Many people on benefits are looking for work by sending endless CVs to employers who do not respond, or by going along to jobcentres that do not have many jobs on offer. I know of one person who has sent out more than 400 job applications and has received very few replies.</p><p>Do people who live on benefits get a fortune? No, they do not. Jobseekers allowance is &#163;53.45 and the single person&#8217;s allowance is &#163;67.50 per week. Married couples get &#163;105.95 per week, and a lone parent gets between &#163;53.45 and &#163;67.50 per week. Many of my constituents just survive from one giro to the next and how they do it is beyond me. Any reduction in their income will press them further into poverty. We should be helping people and not oppressing them.</p><p>Could Mr Cameron or any of his ministers live on those payments? I do not think so. I remember watching some years ago a television programme that asked members of Parliament to live on benefits for a week. My goodness, but they were very glad to return to their lifestyles at the end of that week. They could not survive on the money that they were getting.</p><p>Another reduction that the UK Government is considering is a reduction in housing benefit for people who live in houses that have more bedrooms than they need. The UK Government suggests that people should move to smaller houses. Several agencies have pointed out that that could be practically impossible. Citizens Advice Scotland said</p><p>&#8220;we are concerned about under-occupation proposals due to its impact on people and services and a lack of suitable one-bedroom properties&#8221;.</p><p>Most people have brought up their families in bigger houses. Like many other members, I have elderly and disabled constituents who live in three, four or five-apartment houses on their own. Will they now be forced out or penalised because they want to live their lives in their favourite surroundings? Many elderly people have had disability adaptations made to their houses to meet their needs, and many councils have spent millions of pounds on implementing care in the community. Will we now be asking people to move? How crazy is that?</p><p>I want a fair society. I want to aid people who are less fortunate than I am. The UK Government says that it needs to improve the benefits system, but it should not reduce the benefits on which people just survive.</p><p>I am sure that my Labour colleagues will just bring up the usual ways of deficit reduction, and I will then suggest other ways to reduce the deficit that they caused, but that is for another debate.</p><p>I will support the SNP Government&#8217;s motion, which seeks to defend the rights of the people of Scotland, and I will support the suggestion to set up an ad hoc welfare committee that should meet for the duration of the current parliamentary session to continue to examine this terrible bill.

[Interruption.] Anything George Adam can do, I can do better.</p><p>I welcome this debate on the integration of health and social care. Social care is pivotal to the care of all who require the service. A social work department in any council deals with the range of needs across a wide remit and must react to meet those needs. Many improvements have been achieved in adult health and social care services, but I agree that the integration of services to Scotland&#8217;s older people needs to be improved to deliver better health and social care services. We need to continue to reduce the number of delayed discharges because that impacts directly on the health and care experience of older citizens.</p><p>For too long, there has been a silo mentality in social work and the health service. Each blames the other for the delays that they both cause, and each watches its own budget too closely. They now have to learn to work together to release the potential that has always been there to improve the quality of care for our elderly citizens. I read with interest the parliamentary briefing on social care and health integration from the Association of Directors of Social Work. It says:</p><p>&#8220;We acknowledge that there are things we could do better and there are issues that politicians are concerned about and we are keen to assist Government in addressing this.&#8221;</p><p>It then goes on to say why social work should stay in its silo. Frankly, like Nanette Milne, I was not impressed by the submission, which continually states &#8220;We must keep&#8221;. Yes, social work can keep, but it must also work with other agencies to improve the quality of care in our society. We must put an end to cost shunting between the NHS and local authorities. Too often, that ends up with older people being delayed in hospital longer than they should be and not getting the standards of care that they deserve.</p><p>Like many others, I have personal experience of the delay that can arise when a family member is unable to go home because they have to wait for the hospital and local social work to agree on the best action. I will not go into that case because it is personal. However, I will talk about the case of one of my constituents, who was stuck in hospital in my region. We all have such cases and Jackie Baillie mentioned one. My constituent&#8217;s relation, Mr John Love, who stays in Motherwell, contacted me to gain my support. Mr Love had tried without success to resolve his relation&#8217;s problem. Mr Love was going between the hospital and social work and getting nowhere. I was lucky enough to know who to phone in the social work department and, within a few hours, Mr Love was able to talk to the people who could really help him. I was happy with the outcome.</p><p>If we can use common sense and working together to solve one constituent&#8217;s problem, we can solve most of the problems that face social work in local hospitals. We cannot go on any longer suggesting that the problem cannot be solved. We cannot hide in our local silos and suggest that another department should bear the costs. I therefore welcome the health and social care partnerships that will replace the community health partnerships. The new partnerships should be accountable to ministers, leaders of local authorities, MSPs, councillors and the public for delivering new nationally agreed outcomes. Reform is vital to ensure the long-term sustainability of adult care in Scotland. We need closer working.</p><p>I welcome the comments of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers about the proposal. I agree with it that</p><p>&#8220;Carers play a crucial role in the delivery of health and social care in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>I note that the Princess Royal Trust for Carers has tabled a number of questions in its submission.

I always laugh at soaps or films that show couples adopting a child in a few weeks, as that is simply not true. After an application and seven years of waiting, my wife and I finally had a baby girl in 1982. I remember the number of visits that social workers made to our home and what we had to go through, and the time that was spent discussing with our social worker our intention to adopt a baby.</p><p>After 30 years, it has not got any better, especially as we know that more than 15,892 children are now looked after by local authorities. The number of looked-after children has increased every year and is now at its highest since 1982, which was the year we adopted our daughter.</p><p>More than 9,000 children are cared for away from their home. More than half of those children have experienced two or more placements; 30 per cent have experienced three or more placements; and 6 per cent have had six placements. There were just 466 adoptions in 2007, and 218 children who were ceasing to be looked after were adopted. Nearly 70 per cent of those were no-relation adoptions.</p><p>Statistics show that children are becoming looked after for longer periods, which is totally unacceptable, as it creates uncertainty and potential long-term social and emotional problems. We must do better, but we cannot&#8212;as some people try to do&#8212;start the blame game. Social workers are complimented when they get it right and slated when they get it wrong. I know that they have a hard job, but there are so many children in care that we must examine the reasons why they are there. Can we do better for them?</p><p>I will make an observation from several cases that I have personally dealt with over the years. In one case, I backed a couple to the hilt. Officials said that they had masses of evidence, but I told them that I did not believe what they were saying, as there was other evidence to support the family. In the end, I and many of the friends who stuck with the couple were proved right one year later. Social work got it wrong on that occasion, and the children in question are now back with their parents, where they should have been all the time.</p><p>Another case that I am dealing with involves a father who wants to provide a decent home for his child but who, due to circumstances that I will not go into, will not be allowed to do so. His daughter will go into the system and become a statistic like all the others. His young child is in care, and the visits when he gets to see her are irregular because social work cannot agree to his request for more regular visits. He is constantly on the phone to the social work department, and its time is used up in answering his phone calls and e-mails. I share his frustration, as any agreement that we try to make is a problem for the department due to legal requirements.</p><p>When children are taken into care, there should be a clear intention to return them to their family or to any family member as soon as possible, depending on the circumstances. Children should be cared for, not put into care. They should be adopted as soon as possible, depending on individual circumstances and legal requirements, and the agreement of the birth parents. In response to Gil Paterson&#8217;s point, I have been there, done that and got the T-shirt. Putting kids into care should be a last resort. Our children deserve better, and we cannot let them down.</p><p>I support the Government&#8217;s intention to reduce the time that is needed to find a permanent home for looked-after children. I would encourage the many hundreds of couples out there who I know want to give a child a good home to apply to adopt or foster a child. It changed my life and my wife&#8217;s life. We applied, and we were very happy to get our daughter. We applied to adopt another child but, like many other couples in similar circumstances, we were blessed after three years with the birth of our son. We were lucky, but many people have not been lucky. We now have a lovely daughter and son, who are both a credit to my wife and me.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I could talk about this subject for hours but, in case the Presiding Officer is concerned, I assure her that I will stick to my six minutes.

It is right that we debate winter resilience before the onslaught of this year&#8217;s weather. I hope that the weather will not be as bad as it was in the previous two years, but who knows what type of weather we will face over the next few months?</p><p>I well remember last year&#8217;s bad weather. It was 10.30 on a Monday morning, and I was on my way to Motherwell. Like many that morning, I got caught in a traffic jam. Most of the vehicles that were in front of me could not get up the hill; we were in a dip. In Motherwell, people go down a hill and go up a hill. Nowadays, most cars cannot cope with the snow. It always surprises me that some of the most expensive cars&#8212;like the one that Jason Carlaw has, I am sure&#8212;do not have front-wheel drive and are not four-by-four. Car manufacturers could consider that as we face worse weather conditions in some years. I was lucky. My car had a front-wheel drive. I was in a used, cheap man&#8217;s Merc&#8212;an A150. I have changed that car since then, and I hope that my new car does the same as my old one did, and will take me out of any adversity. Most of the cars eventually got up the various hills in the Motherwell area only because many drivers helped one another. That is a tribute to everybody helping one another on that day.</p><p>The snow fell for several hours in the area. The area had been gritted, but the gritting was overcome by the amount of snow that fell that morning. Thankfully, I was able to get home after two hours. I was one of the lucky ones that day. I was faced with a mountain of snow when I returned to my street. I was unable to get into the street&#8212;I am sure that most of us were in the same position&#8212;so I parked at the end of it and proceeded to dig along the road to gain access to my home. The point of my story is that that prompted several of my neighbours to come out to help me. In turn, we helped other neighbours to get into their homes. The Scottish people have great comradeship in adversity. Most members have said that last year brought out the best in people. I am sure that we will face any impacts that the weather brings.</p><p>We have to be prepared. I welcome the Minister for Housing and Transport&#8217;s statement. The cold weather affects not only the roads; it affects families and groups throughout the country. I also welcome the various programmes that the Government has announced for insulating homes and tackling fuel poverty. All residents should be encouraged to prepare, plan, improve their energy efficiency, protect their pipes, and do what they can in their own homes. I compliment all local council staff who have played their part in working to repair affected homes over the years, especially last year.</p><p>Last winter was the worst that Scotland has seen since 1962-63&#8212;I am old enough to remember 1962 and 1963&#8212;and the second coldest since records began in 1914. I was not around then; I may look that way, but I was not. There are more gritters, but we must remember that gritters sometimes cannot get to areas because they, too, get stuck in traffic jams. Councils need to place gritting bins in appropriate places. If there were gritting bins in the dip I was in in Motherwell, we could have got up the hill much better. Members may want to consider the issue of strategically placed gritting bins on roads or hills that cars may not be able to get up.</p><p>Most councils have in place a programme for the main roads that they will salt. That point was made earlier. Many roads in council and private areas are not salted now. Strategic areas, main roads, motorways and roads near schools are salted, but many roads are left out. Once main roads and motorways are cleared, there is a case for councils at least to plough local roads that require it. I do not even want them to salt those roads; all that I want them to do is plough them. Dennis Robertson was lucky that a plough came along his road. I stay beside a sheltered housing complex, and we had to dig snow out ourselves. I hope that the minister will speak to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and local councils about that matter.</p><p>I condemn anyone who attacks council road workmen who are trying to help their fellow Scots&#8212;Jason Carlaw spoke about that earlier&#8212;and I condemn the persons who attacked North Lanarkshire Council personnel last year.</p><p>We must build on the lessons that were learned last year.

NHS Lanarkshire moved for closure, totally dismissing all public objections. The local Labour Party came out against the closure, but the Labour Party in this Parliament agreed with the proposal to close it. It took the Scottish National Party and the now Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy to reverse the proposed closure soon after taking power in 2007. Now, when it comes to Lightburn, history repeats itself. The proposed closure of Lightburn hospital is yet another example of one section of Labour voting for the closure of a hospital or service and another section of Labour mounting a campaign against any closure. It is commonly called having your cake and eating it.</p><p>On a Scottish Labour Party website, Paul Martin MSP calls for a debate on the proposed closure of Lightburn and suggests that it is time for the SNP Government to live up to its promise on ensuring that there is a presumption against centralisation. Paul Martin states on that website:</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a ... strong feeling of support in the East End of Glasgow for ensuring Lightburn Hospital has a future. I hope Nicola Sturgeon joins the community campaign to ensure the future of a hospital that has been an integral part of the community for decades.&#8221;</p><p>Nowhere on the website does the member suggest that the Labour-controlled Glasgow City Council should rescind its decision to support the closure of Lightburn. Nowhere does the member condemn the council&#8217;s involvement in the closure proposals.</p><p>On 25 November 2010, Glasgow City Council executive committee discussed the closure; it was item 7 on the agenda. The committee&#8217;s recommendations were as follows:</p><p>&#8220;the Council acknowledges the financial and clinical advantages to the Health Board of option 2, but makes this support conditional on appropriate transport links being established to allow satisfactory visitor access from the East of the city to Stobhill Hospital; and ... the Council&#8217;s support for option 2 was further conditional on transparent negotiations taking place as a matter of urgency between the Health Board and the Council on the potential impact of these proposals on demand for community-based Social Work Services.&#8221;</p><p>The report went on to list a number of significant issues: it would leave the east end of the city without any acute beds for older people, there were concerns regarding visitor access given the absence of adequate public transport, and there were concerns regarding the rebalancing of beds from rehabilitation to assessment. Even with all those concerns, which should have made the case for retention, Councillor Matheson, the leader of the council, seconded by Councillor Graham&#8212;both Scottish Labour councillors&#8212;moved that the committee agree with the recommendation.</p><p>I further note from the minutes that</p><p>&#8220;Councillor James Dornan,&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>now an MSP&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;seconded by Councillor Hendry,&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>both SNP councillors&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;moved ... an amendment ... to extend the consultation period.&#8221;</p><p>Only three members voted for the amendment, while 13 voted for the motion. We now hear that they have changed their minds. It is not hard to guess which party most of the 13 were from.</p><p>I agreed with James Dornan when he stated that Labour has an</p><p>&#8220;appalling track record over hospital closures&#8221;</p><p>and that Labour has tried to deceive the people of the east end on the issue.</p><p>I know Lightburn hospital&#8212;my daughter started her nursing career there a number of years ago. I will refer to a recent e-mail from a constituent regarding hospital bed availability in Glasgow&#8212;this is where my comments may differ from others. His mother-in-law, Mrs Martha Harris, fell at her front door and was transported to the Western infirmary after being treated at A and E. There was no room at the inn but, thankfully, later that morning a bed was found for the Rev C B Ross&#8217;s mother-in-law. His formal complaint is about the number of hospital beds that are available in a major city.

That must change.</p><p>We now have a policy of zero waste, and we have made tremendous progress on waste management. In 10 years, we have reduced the amount of waste that we send to landfill by more than a third. Waste is a resource that can be used as a catalyst to create products and to generate renewable energy, heat and fertiliser. It has also been suggested that Scotland&#8217;s waste policy could create more than 2,000 jobs.</p><p>We need a broad policy to tackle waste. We need companies to reduce their packaging. How much waste is produced because companies use too much packaging? We also need councils to increase their recycling rates and to have a common policy on recycling. Too many councils still have different collection policies: some collect glass and some do not; some collect cardboard and some do not. If somebody moves from one council area to another, they find that the councils tackle waste differently.</p><p>Energy from waste has a part to play, but it should be used only for material that cannot be recycled. In 2009, only 2.7 per cent of our waste was incinerated, and 4.7 million tonnes was landfilled. Local councils have a responsibility to listen to and react to their voters&#8217; needs, especially when it comes to incineration projects. Incineration should be the last resort in tackling waste.</p><p>The Labour Party has made great play of how it has opposed incinerators. In North Lanarkshire, the Labour Party supported the Greengairs incinerator&#8212;I was there and I know that Labour pushed it.

I wish you well in your new job.</p><p>I rise to make my maiden speech in the Parliament. First, I record an interest: I used to work part-time for NHS Lanarkshire.</p><p>I thank the many SNP members throughout the country who worked hard to get a majority SNP Government elected. Although they are too numerous to mention, I will remember here former members from my area, no longer with us, who worked throughout the years not knowing that we would eventually see an SNP majority Government: Gordon Appleyard, Flora Rice, Jim Scott, Billy Hooper, David Woods and Margaret Pirie Murray.</p><p>I joined the SNP in 1966 to gain independence for Scotland. When people talk about independence lite, it reminds me of products such as Ryvita, Tab or even Lurpak. I assure members that the only light that we will switch on over the next few years is the light on the road to independence for Scotland.</p><p>There have been three important political dates in my life. The first was 1976 when I won the Orbiston by-election in Motherwell District Council in Lanarkshire. I told my wife then that I would be in the council for six months. That was 36 years ago. Orbiston was then an area of deprivation, but that has changed over the years because of hard work. I thank the people of Orbiston and Bellshill for their trust in allowing me to be their councillor for the past 36 years. It has been an honour to serve them.</p><p>The second most important political date for me was 2007, when the SNP Government was elected. During the first two years of the SNP minority Government, I held the position of SNP group leader in the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. During that period, I was able to secure several important votes for the new SNP Government. When I was first elected to COSLA over 20 years ago, we could have held our group meeting in a phone box. I know how the Liberals in the Parliament must feel. I can recommend a few telephone boxes to them.</p><p>Today we debate health, wellbeing and cities strategy. In the past two years, I have seen the way in which this Government has helped the people of Scotland through health provision. Before the end of last month, I was a driver for the NHS Lanarkshire out-of-hours service. I worked five shifts a month driving one of five cars to ferry doctors to house calls all over Lanarkshire&#8212;6 pm to midnight, Saturdays 8 until 4, 4 pm to midnight and, sometimes, the overnight shift. I was also one of the drivers who worked in what we called the swine flu car during the swine flu outbreak. In the initial outbreak, we were dispatched to homes of suspected swine flu carriers to swab and quarantine if necessary, and dispense Tamiflu tablets.</p><p>I have been in Monklands, Wishaw and Hairmyres accident and emergency departments when they have been overflowing on Saturday nights and week nights. I have seen for myself the excellent work done by our health service staff. I pay tribute to our health workers and all the out-of-hours services in Scotland. I have worked in Monklands accident and emergency department, which the SNP kept open four years ago, thanks to the cabinet secretary. She also saved Ayrshire A and E. Over 200,000 patients have been treated in Monklands A and E in the past four years. How Labour thought that it could close it and send patients to Wishaw A and E is well beyond me.</p><p>I note the key SNP achievements since 2007: hospital waiting times at a record low, 70 per cent reduction in hospital infections, more than 1 million more Scots registered with dentists and&#8212;one of the best&#8212;the abolition of prescription charges in Scotland. There has also been action on smoking and investment in tackling alcohol abuse.</p><p>In the last regard, I welcome the reintroduction of the proposal on minimum pricing for alcohol. All the doctors I worked with support the proposal. I ask the cabinet secretary to look at how money raised through minimum pricing can be secured in order to fund treatment centres, which could be located throughout the country.</p><p>During the past four years, I have also been the UK chair on social care for the local government organisation APSE&#8212;the Association for Public Service Excellence. I have also been chair on sport in Scotland for APSE. My committees have looked into all aspects of social care and sport, and I look forward to being a member of the Health and Sport Committee and bringing my knowledge to it. APSE represents all councils in Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales.</p><p>To finish, I will mention my third political date. After 36 years in opposition, I now sit on the Government benches&#8212;it is a fabulous feeling. I look forward to the challenge of working hard for the people of the Central Scotland region, who have placed their trust in me as their MSP. I look forward to the day that Scotland becomes independent, and I intend to work to make that dream a reality.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.
