It is an absolute scandal that, 30 years on, we see evidence of food banks all over Scotland. As the Trussell Trust&#8217;s submission says, 23,000 food parcels were issued between April and September last year. That is shameful in a modern society.</p><p>In assessing the reasons for the growth in food banks, it is clear that there is a cost-of-living crisis. We are seeing food prices increasing, incomes decreasing&#8212;as people&#8217;s incomes do not match the increases in food prices&#8212;and fuel prices rocketing. With each 5 per cent increase in fuel prices, 46,000 people are added to the fuel poverty roll. One of the primary reasons for that is the policies that are being pursued by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition at Westminster. I regret the tone of Stuart McMillan&#8217;s comments, in which he tried to lump the Labour party in with those in the coalition who are pursuing these policies.</p><p>Like others, I pay tribute to those who operate the food bank in my area, in Rutherglen and Cambuslang. In particular, I thank Brendan Rooney and Th&#233;r&#232;se Reid. I attended a church service in Rutherglen last night to highlight the work that is carried out by the 60 volunteers. One young man who recently presented himself at the food bank did not even have a plate or a cup, never mind a microwave or a cooker to cook the food. That shows the difficulty of the cases that food banks have to deal with, and there is a lot of excellent work being done by those in Rutherglen and Cambuslang to service that food bank.</p><p>I regret the existence of food banks throughout Scotland. We must look at what can be done to move the situation forward. It is absolutely clear that alternative policies that put people and communities first need to be pursued at the Westminster level.</p><p>The administration of the Scottish welfare fund must also be looked at. The fund is absolutely welcome, of course, but I think that every member in the chamber would agree that, where we have such funds in place, we must ensure that they get down to those who need them. I would be interested in hearing the minister explain what more the Government can do to ensure that the funds get down to needy communities and individuals.</p><p>To sum up, it is regrettable that there are so many food banks in the country. We all need to speak out loudly and clearly for an alternative approach that moves us away from their existence.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22883964", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Banks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Patricia Ferguson, I recall the miners&#8217; strike of 30 years ago and my experience of working with other colleagues in Cambuslang to organise food collections during the strike.

I welcome the fact that the Government has engaged positively on the issue. We have moved significantly since the draft budget was published in September, when there was no money to mitigate the effects of the bedroom tax. The Government has listened to the strong voices of not only Iain Gray and Jackie Baillie but organisations such as Shelter Scotland. That is important, because such organisations speak from the ground and from communities. It is important that the Parliament takes such views on board.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that, despite the agreement on the bedroom tax, the passing of the budget will not wipe out some of the issues in our constituencies. There are schools in my constituency that cannot afford to print out the homework for the pupils. I recently visited a sheltered housing complex that was no longer able to continue with its overnight sleeper, which caused a lot of anxiety to pensioners in the complex. I am frequently visited by constituents who stay in overcrowded accommodation and struggle to get alternative housing because of the growing waiting lists. It is important not to lose track of the issues on the ground.</p><p>There is no doubt that, with the &#163;30 billion that it has at its disposal in the Scottish budget, the Government can make an impact on the economy. One way in which it can do that is to invest in capital projects. However, it is important that those projects are properly managed and that the investment makes a difference in the economy.</p><p>Recently, an announcement was made on the M8-M73-M74 interchange project. Although it is welcome that some progress is being made in that project, the progress on improving transport in that area and making a contribution to the economy in the west of Scotland has been far too slow.</p><p>Another example is the Edinburgh to Glasgow improvement programme&#8212;EGIP&#8212;on which the Minister for Transport and Veterans made an announcement only this week.

Before I came to the chamber to give this speech, one young pupil asked me, &#8220;What was it that made John F Kennedy famous?&#8221; There are two aspects to the answer. The first is the assassination itself. We will see more of the photographs and images tomorrow, but there is no doubt that the image of an American President driving down a street and being assassinated in front of thousands is one that shocked people at the beginning of the television age, as members such as Christine Grahame have said. People were also shocked that the life of the President, pictured in an iconic image with his wife and young family, had been denied. Such images add to the fascination of the conspiracy theories.</p><p>From a political point of view, Jackson Carlaw did the debate a service by bringing an alternative critique to the table. Although I did not agree with much of it, he was right to point out that perhaps all that glitters is not gold.</p><p>I would say two things about Kennedy. In yesterday&#8217;s debate on same-sex marriage, a lot of people spoke about how the world has moved on. I was talking to my 13-year-old daughter Erin recently about a project that she was doing on America. We talked about the challenges that black and Negro people faced in America: they were not allowed to ride on certain buses; there was segregation; and people were murdered and beaten up. Kennedy took a stand against all that and moved things on. Perhaps if he had not done that, and if Lyndon Johnson had not carried that work on, we would not have got Barack Obama as President in 2008. Kennedy did the world a real service.</p><p>Kennedy also showed real leadership during the Cuban missile crisis. If people read up on what happened at that time, they will see that there is no doubt that we were on the verge of world war three. He was right to stand firm and provide leadership at that time.</p><p>The real lesson for me is that politics matters. I return again to yesterday&#8217;s meeting of the Parliament, when we had tributes to Helen Eadie. Sadly, that was the third occasion in recent months when we have had to pay such tributes; Brian Adam and David McLetchie also died recently. Although we have different views and visions, the thing that brings everyone in this chamber together is that we are in this because politics matters.</p><p>What John F Kennedy achieved in his life and political career shows that we can make a difference in politics.

This is an important debate, because it deals with real issues.</p><p>We must look at the benefits to Scotland&#8217;s shipbuilding industry of operating in the UK market. After all, a third of the UK&#8217;s shipbuilding jobs, including 3,000 on the Clyde and 2,000 at Rosyth, have been allocated to Scotland, and Scotland benefits from having 50,000 jobs in the defence industry.

Was it sheer incompetence on the part of the Government and Transport Scotland, or was it a show of political spite in killing off the GARL project?

If the assets are not replaced timeously, maintenance costs begin to run up. Some members, including Joan McAlpine, highlighted situations in which many buses have broken down during a journey.

More could be done to co-ordinate and join up the training of those minibus drivers who are on these licences so that the voluntary organisations&#8217; costs could be cut.</p><p>Any discussion about community transport cannot take place in isolation. We need to look at what is happening with buses generally. The reality is that the Government&#8217;s cuts to the bus service operators grant and the changes to reimbursement for the concessionary travel scheme, which will be reduced to 58 per cent next year, mean fewer bus routes and buses throughout Scotland. There has been a 12.5 per cent reduction in annual bus mileage since 2008, which means that fewer buses are operating in our communities. That puts more pressure on community transport organisations. The Government cannot look at community transport in isolation. It needs to look at its record on buses generally. Buses are being underfunded and passengers are being left at bus stops without buses to service the routes.</p><p>The committee has made a number of practical suggestions and informed us all about the debate.

The bill is part of the process as we move towards the referendum in September 2014. It will extend the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds, which I know will excite many young people throughout Scotland; it will undoubtedly encourage them to participate in the referendum. I am sure that people on both sides of the debate agree that we hope that, post the referendum&#8212;whatever the result&#8212;the young people who participated in it will be more motivated to take part in the political process in the future. The quality of the young people who gave evidence to the committee reinforces the view of the many who support the extension of the franchise.</p><p>Annabel Goldie raised important points about awareness raising and the role of schools. When I talk to young people who are coming up to the age of 16 and who will vote in the referendum, I find that they are very excited about the prospect. To an extent, they also find it quite daunting, in that they have a big decision to make. There is a quest for more information, not just about the process but about the politics on the two sides of the argument. It is important that we raise awareness and that provision is made for information to be supplied in schools. That process should be properly controlled and the information should be appropriately balanced.</p><p>As others have said, the legislative process has been accelerated. I am not often a great fan of that, but I acknowledge that it was necessary in this case. As the Deputy First Minister pointed out, the annual canvass will start in the autumn. Never has a canvass been so important; we must ensure that not just 16 and 17-year-olds but as many people as possible are registered to take part in this important vote on the future of Scotland. It is important that the correct processes are put in place. Electoral registration officers have an extremely important role to play in making available the right forms and information.</p><p>It was interesting that Annabel Goldie mentioned the NUS briefing. Students will present a big issue, because many will leave home for the first time in around September 2014 and might do so without registering for postal votes. Therefore, the process of proxy vote registration and rolling registration is important. We must ensure that those young people are aware of the options that are available to them if they move to a college or university that is some distance away from where they currently live, because we want as many people as possible to be registered to vote.</p><p>A concern that many people had about the bill related to data protection issues and the potential for data to be published on young people who have not reached the age of 16. However, the committee has done a robust job of checking the processes. People can be reassured by the final product that the Government has produced and the feed-in that the committee has had, which will ensure that young people are properly looked after as far as data protection is concerned.</p><p>I do not want to rerun the debate on prisoners voting, although I say to Alison McInnes that it was an important debate to have.

I also welcome the many campaigners from Parkinson&#8217;s groups across the country who have made it to Parliament to lobby members and watch the debate. As the political parties gear up for the Aberdeen Donside by-election in two days, they might learn a trick or two from the Parkinson&#8217;s campaigners, who have been very effective in making known their views and lobbying many MSPs face to face this afternoon.</p><p>Given the significant impact that, as I am sure MSPs know from speaking to the campaigners, Parkinson&#8217;s disease has on the lives of constituents and their families, it is important that we as parliamentarians take the issue very seriously. More than 10,000 people in Scotland suffer from Parkinson&#8217;s&#8212;it affects one in 500 people&#8212;but I am well aware that in Rutherglen, Cambuslang and Blantyre in my constituency the number of sufferers is the best part of 200, which is higher than the average for the country. The issue was first brought to my attention by my constituent, Harry Hay, who is in the gallery this evening. Mr Hay pressed his case in a very articulate and strong way, and since then I have been very vocal for increased resources in my area to support people who have Parkinson&#8217;s.</p><p>Many of the issues are highlighted in Parkinson&#8217;s UK&#8217;s recent report, which comes on the back of the NHS Scotland report on neurological issues. Of the two key indicators in the NHS Scotland report that relate to Parkinson&#8217;s, the criteria for access to specialist Parkinson&#8217;s disease services are not met by five health boards and the criteria for on-going management of Parkinson&#8217;s disease services are not met by 10 health boards. Clearly, therefore, there is a big job to be done in health boards across Scotland. In my previous members&#8217; business debate in 2008, I spoke about the importance of people with Parkinson&#8217;s receiving their medication on time, but it is obvious from speaking to people who are involved that that issue still needs to be addressed by the NHS.</p><p>For the people in the gallery tonight, the central issue is the importance of Parkinson&#8217;s nurse specialists. Figures that have been provided by the Scottish Parliament information centre show that Scotland has only 20 such nurse specialists to cover 10,000 people, so that resource is not adequate. A recent Parkinson&#8217;s UK report draws attention to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendation that Parkinson&#8217;s nurse specialists should have a maximum caseload of 300 patients, whereas the statistics show that each nurse is covering at least 500 people. That is certainly the case in NHS Lanarkshire, which not only fails to meet the NHS Scotland report criteria on Parkinson&#8217;s but, unfortunately, has only two specialist nurses who have a caseload of 1,000 patients. Clearly, more priority needs to be given to the issue not just in NHS Lanarkshire but throughout the country.</p><p>Among other issues that the Parkinson&#8217;s UK report highlights as needing to be addressed by health boards is the importance of telemedicine and of virtual teams. Especially in rural areas, such teams can do a lot to support people who have Parkinson&#8217;s. A crucial issue is the link between general practitioners and the specialist nurses, which really must be reinforced. If GPs have proper awareness of the issue, they can detect the condition early and flag up appropriate treatment, which can help in management of the condition.</p><p>Another area that needs to be examined&#8212;but which is often overlooked&#8212;is data collection. It is important that we collect appropriate data on the condition because it can help us to identify best practice in management of it.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that, properly managed, all those things together would save the NHS money. If we can treat people who have Parkinson&#8217;s better and keep them in their homes rather than in NHS hospitals, that will not only save health boards money but will take some of the stress away from families.</p><p>Clearly, the priority must lie with the NHS, but the Government also has an important role in leadership and co-ordination. The Scottish Government recently allocated &#163;4&#160;million for treatment of people who have long-term conditions. Part of that is for policy development, which is welcome because it is important; clearly, some of the issues that are outlined in the Parkinson&#8217;s UK report show the need for more policy development. NHS boards need to be more aware of the issues and to give them greater priority. In the context of last week&#8217;s coverage of NHS continuing care and mistreatment, in some cases, it is also worth mentioning that some of those may involve people who have Parkinson&#8217;s. It is important that we have a proper process to examine when people have been mistreated and are due reimbursement.</p><p>Those are big issues that affect many people in constituencies and regions across the country, so it is important that we speak up and speak out. There is an absolutely key role for NHS boards. It is important that we use this evening&#8217;s debate to get across the campaigners&#8217; message that health boards must take the issue more seriously. We want urgent and practical action.</p><p>I thank members for their support.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694006", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parkinson&#8217;s Nurses"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to open this evening&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate and thank members from across Parliament for signing the motion, thereby enabling me to bring it to the chamber.

In particular, I thank Jim Hume, who was a core supporter of the motion and is a descendant of David Livingstone. I am sure that he will give us some unique reflections on the Livingstone family.</p><p>I welcome members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and&#8212;to reiterate the Deputy Presiding Officer&#8217;s welcome&#8212;special envoy Annie Lennox, who has been a terrific ambassador for the CPA on issues relating to Africa. I also welcome to the gallery representatives from Blantyre, particularly the young children from St Blane&#8217;s primary school in Blantyre, which has a special place in the Livingstone story.</p><p>The debate is the culmination of a number of successful events over the past fortnight, including the special service at Blantyre Livingstone memorial church last Sunday, which was attended by President Joyce Banda and the First Minister.</p><p>It is poignant that President Banda returned to Blantyre and the location of the Blantyre mill where David Livingstone grew up, because that is where the Livingstone story began&#8212;and what a story it is. Although he worked 14 hours a day in the mill and walked many miles during the course of the day, such were his family&#8217;s dedication to giving him a good education and his own perseverance that he would return home at night and, in poorly lit conditions, read until midnight. That gave him the platform to go to the University of Glasgow. Every Monday, he used to walk the 8 miles from Blantyre to the university, from where he qualified as a doctor with the skills that were relevant to the time that he spent in Africa.</p><p>There are three main factors in David Livingstone&#8217;s life that stick out for me. First and foremost, he was an explorer who undertook three trips through Africa over a 30-year period; he was a powerful missionary for the Christian faith in Africa; and he was a very strong anti-slavery campaigner. The point to bear in mind about those three aspects is that they were difficult activities to undertake 200 years ago. The infrastructure and travelling conditions in Africa at that time were very different from those in Africa today. Travellers were very exposed to disease. The Christian faith was not as widespread as it is today and the culture was not conducive to an anti-slavery campaigner such as David Livingstone getting their message across. The perseverance, grit and determination of the man is shown by what he did, and the hard-working ethics that he learned in the mills of Blantyre served him well throughout his life and his travels in Africa.</p><p>It is worth paying tribute to Mary Moffat, David Livingstone&#8217;s wife, and recognising the important role that she played in supporting her husband in his work in Africa. Much of the Mary Moffat story has been untold for many years, but some of it has been uncovered by Julie Davidson in a very interesting book that recently came out. If we consider the loyalty of Mary Moffat and what she gave up to follow and support her husband&#8212;her personal sacrifice in losing a young child and eventually dying before David Livingstone through acute malaria&#8212;we can see the sort of person that she was.</p><p>The question that we need to ask today is what David Livingstone&#8217;s legacy is in 2013. Four aspects come to mind, one of which is the fair-trade mission, which is so relevant for us because of the recent launch of Scotland as a Fairtrade nation. I see David Livingstone very much as Scotland&#8217;s first fair-trade campaigner, because he took that message to Africa. He really wanted to bring those communities forward, not only to give them something to live for but to give them something sustainable that could take their lives forward and improve their quality of life.</p><p>Secondly, we can see the strong links between Scotland and Malawi, which were established by the previous Scottish Executive and have been carried forward by the current Scottish Government in the Scottish Malawi Foundation. The work on that and the co-operation between the two countries benefit both greatly.</p><p>Thirdly, in Blantyre, David Livingstone&#8217;s birthplace, the Livingstone memory and legacy are still very much alive, particularly at the David Livingstone centre, which is located where he worked in a mill all those years ago. I know that the Blantyre community is a strong, loyal and very cohesive one in which people pull together strongly, not just in support of Livingstone&#8217;s memory and legacy but in support of all the individuals and groups there.</p><p>The fourth aspect is the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Sarah Boyack and Alex Fergusson recently undertook a visit to Malawi, and there was a reciprocal visit here by MPs from Malawi. It was great to welcome them to Blantyre last Sunday and to talk about common parliamentary traditions. I think that each Parliament can learn a lot from the other. There are a lot of good lessons and good practice that can help the Parliaments and the communities in our two countries on issues such as poverty, human rights and AIDS awareness, which the CPA and its envoys are very effective in championing.</p><p>This bicentenary has given us a great opportunity to reflect on and celebrate David Livingstone&#8217;s rich life. However, it also gives us an even greater opportunity to look to the future and build links between Scotland and Malawi, and to celebrate Livingstone&#8217;s legacy and make it relevant in today&#8217;s Scotland so that it can continue to serve us well both here in Scotland and abroad in Malawi.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure, as the MSP for the Blantyre area&#8212;the birthplace of David Livingstone&#8212;to open this evening&#8217;s debate.

I am pleased to see Jim Hume in the chamber, as he is a direct descendant of David Livingstone. He looks as if he is set to contribute to the debate. I have no doubt that his contribution will give a particular insight and enrich the debate.</p><p>I want to concentrate on David Livingstone&#8217;s links with Blantyre, his legacy, and the relevance of his story to Blantyre now. If we look at Blantyre today and the school names there, we see that his memory is alive and well in that community. There is the David Livingstone Memorial primary school and the David Livingstone centre, which Bob Doris mentioned. There is no doubt that his memory is alive and well in Blantyre because of the remarkable story of his upbringing there, which is an inspiration. He worked in a mill from the age of 10. He started at 6 o&#8217;clock in the morning and worked until 8 at night&#8212;that is a 14-hour day. Such was his and his family&#8217;s drive that he would then spend two hours reading in very poorly lit accommodation to educate himself.</p><p>When David Livingstone secured a place at the University of Glasgow, he used to leave every Monday to go to it, walking the 8 miles from Blantyre. That shows the man&#8217;s drive and inspiration. His education at the University of Glasgow built the platform for the life that he was to go on to lead.</p><p>There were a number of important strands to Livingstone&#8217;s life. Obviously, he was an experienced explorer from three trips over a 30-year period, and he had a really strong Christian faith, which he looked to take to Africa. That faith is alive and well today in the Blantyre Livingstone Memorial parish church, which holds a memorial service every year, not just in this bicentenary year. Livingstone was also a strong anti-slavery campaigner. In his famous University of Glasgow address in 1858, he hit out at</p><p>&#8220;the horrid system of slavery&#8221;.</p><p>There are important lessons that Blantyre is taking forward now. There is a strong community in the area, which goes back to the time of the mills, where Livingstone&#8217;s family worked, and the mines. We should not forget that, around the time of Livingstone&#8217;s death, 207 people lost their lives in the Dixon&#8217;s pit mining disaster in Blantyre. That history still very much lives with people today.</p><p>Like other areas, Blantyre has faced difficult times in recent years, but there is a strong community there, and some of the principles that David Livingstone followed have been followed by people in the community. There is perseverance and respect for different parts of the community, and that is taken forward locally by St Blane&#8217;s primary school. It works with Nil by Mouth and has an important anti-sectarianism project, which it uses to reach out to all parts of the community. In all the community groups in Blantyre, there is a sense of improvement, which I think Livingstone would have approved of. He was all for people doing better and improving the quality of their lives.</p><p>Livingstone&#8217;s life is an inspiration, and we are proud to have the opportunity to look at that past. His legacy lives on, and the flame of his ideals burns brightly.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686494", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate, in which we are celebrating the life of David Livingstone, and congratulate Bob Doris on securing it.

It is an important contribution to the debates that we are having in the Parliament on the priorities in our budget and the challenges that the changing demographic in Scotland present.</p><p>Like others, I welcome the fact that we have a growing elderly population. There are many benefits from that. Most of all, we have our friends and families around us for much longer than our predecessors perhaps did. That can only enhance the quality of our lives. As others have pointed out, many pensioners also make a great contribution to the working economy and to the vibrancy of our local communities.</p><p>As the report highlights, there are real challenges around our ageing population. We now have 5.3 million people, and there are more people over the age of 65 than there are under the age of 15. As Anne McTaggart pointed out, the number of people over 75 is projected to increase by 82 per cent by 2035&#8212;although that contrasts with the continuing issues around life expectancy. Ken Macintosh quoted the famous train journey from Bridgeton to Jordanhill&#8212;for each stop, life expectancy increases by two years. I was taken with the figures that Annabel Goldie quoted from page 8 of the report, not just on life expectancy but on the non-healthy component. In one part of Scotland, 11.2 years of a 67.2-year life is unhealthy. That means that a person is unhealthy for more than 15 per cent of their life, which is a real strain on them and on the NHS budget.</p><p>As COSLA pointed out, all those challenges are set against the background of a &#163;3&#160;billion funding shortfall up to 2016-17. Furthermore, because there is a deficit to pay off, there will be real-terms cuts in the budgets until around 2026. That produces real pressures.</p><p>There are continuing rises in emergency admissions for the NHS budget to cope with. As is noted in the report, budgetary provision for social care is not rising to take account of the growing elderly population. On housing, there are real strains around adaptations: because of the increasing number of pensioners, more houses will need adaptations. All those things make up a background of real financial pressure.</p><p>Against that background, we have the admirable policies that members have mentioned, such as free personal care for the elderly, free prescriptions and concessionary travel. However, the cost of those policies amounts to &#163;870&#160;million, and an aspect is that we are providing some services for free to those who could afford to pay for them.</p><p>I will go off topic slightly. A recent report highlighted that there are 194,000 young children living in poverty in Scotland, 3,387 of whom are in my constituency. There is a real challenge there.

However, the issue is not just that statistic, but the impact that the losses have on individuals&#8217; lives.</p><p>Particularly in the run-up to Christmas, the prospect of losing a job is deeply unsettling for families, and that feeds into local communities. The proposal to close four solutions centres in different communities in Scotland means that jobs will be lost in each of those areas. That has a knock-on effect not only on families but on local businesses and local economies. We should reflect on that.</p><p>Like Drew Smith, I pay tribute to the campaign that the Unite trade union has led, opposing the job losses and speaking up in support of its members. It shows the importance of trade unions in the workplace, representing people and giving voice to their concerns and anxieties.</p><p>Another deeply regrettable aspect of the job losses is that the jobs that are going are skilled jobs. We hear a lot of talk about the importance of growing the economy, and we will no doubt hear it again this afternoon in the Finance Committee debate on the draft budget. One aspect of that is the need for skilled jobs and skilled workers. It is to be regretted that the Clydesdale Bank&#8217;s downsizing is taking skilled jobs out of the economy. That has an impact not only on people&#8217;s lives but on economic growth.</p><p>Richard Lyle poses an interesting question. The Clydesdale Bank has advanced a model to try to make its business more successful but, as he pointed out, some of the measures that it has introduced result in longer queues and people being stuck on the telephone for longer than they would wish. That has an impact on the bank&#8217;s customer base. People, understandably, do not like such treatment and will go to other banks. The bank must reflect on the proposals that it is making and whether they will lead to good business.</p><p>The Clydesdale Bank has a good record of supporting community events but if a business is going to talk that up, it needs to be prepared to give something back to the community. That is not what it is doing by closing down the four solutions centres in different parts of Scotland.</p><p>It is important that the bank reflects on the business model that it is advancing and the impact that it will have on people and communities.

There is also no impact assessment of how resource-to-capital switches will contribute to sustainable economic growth.</p><p>The Local Government and Regeneration Committee highlighted an absence of clearly identifiable, meaningful and measurable outcomes to assess the effect of regeneration on sustainable economic growth.</p><p>There is also a lack of detail. The Finance Committee asked why the revised estimate on NPD was not provided in the draft budget. We have had some debate on that this afternoon.</p><p>Members have spoken about the change funds. Little detailed assessment has been made of their implementation and it is unclear how the &#163;500&#160;million figure for those funds has been arrived at.</p><p>Furthermore, a lack of transparency has been brought out. The Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee has said that it is difficult to assess how to allocate money for active travel because of the lack of transparency in the budget.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee said that little progress has been made in developing methodologies that would allow the Scottish Government to understand individual policies&#8217; full downstream impact on climate change targets.</p><p>Finally, the Education and Culture Committee said that a feature of this year&#8217;s budget is that several witnesses were unable to identify movements and changes from previous years.

Before I go on to the issues that I had planned to cover, I have a couple of comments on the minister&#8217;s announcement about security. I accept that it is correct to learn the lessons from the Olympic games in London, and the minister is correct to take on board advice from experts to update the budget and the security plans.</p><p>However, I think that members will want to study the plans that have been placed in SPICe in detail, because the minister&#8217;s announcement is substantial, and a large sum of money&#8212;&#163;90 million&#8212;is potentially being committed. I would be interested to hear from the minister when he sums up from which areas of the budget that extra &#163;37 million has had to be taken in order to make up the security budget.</p><p>The Commonwealth games is&#8212;as other members have said&#8212;a fantastic opportunity for Glasgow and for all the other communities and areas in Scotland. We need only look back at the success of the Olympic games, on which the recent sporting reviews allowed us to reflect. We can also reflect on the Ryder Cup and how much excitement it generated for us as spectators and for the participants.</p><p>The real test of the games will be whether we make the most of the opportunity not just to create a sporting spectacle in Glasgow, but to gain lasting benefits for communities in Glasgow and throughout Scotland. We will look for a knock-on effect in increased participation in sport throughout the country.</p><p>We have recently had reports about the alarming levels of obesity in Scotland; that could be overcome by people participating in sport and fitness activities. Alison Johnstone is correct to point out that, to get that right, we have to start in school with physical education and quality guidance from PE professionals. We also need to make the most of the school estate and open up the public facilities that are available to encourage greater participation.</p><p>The games will give communities a real opportunity to celebrate their happening and to get involved. In Rutherglen, Cambuslang and Blantyre in my area, there will be much excitement. Those areas are outwith Glasgow, but they are right on the doorstep of many of the games venues, being especially near to the outdoor cycling course at Cathkin Braes. The games give the community in my constituency a great opportunity to see the events and to participate by welcoming visitors from overseas. I am issuing a clarion call to those communities.</p><p>From speaking to a number of groups and individuals in my constituency, I know that people are very enthusiastic about the games and I look forward to working with local groups as their MSP during the coming months so that they can be involved and make the most of the games.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this afternoon&#8217;s debate.

It is quite timely, but it might have been overtaken by events to an extent. If we listen closely to the First Minister&#8217;s statements, we can tell that he clearly has a proposal for a way forward that might not involve a Scottish medial panel, although I think that the idea is certainly a worthwhile contribution to the debate.</p><p>In considering whether we should have a Scottish media panel, the First Minister&#8217;s alternative or another way forward, it is important to take proper cognisance of the adverse effect that some media coverage has had on ordinary people. One of the most powerful advocates at the Leveson inquiry was Margaret Watson from Glasgow, who sadly lost her daughter when she was murdered more than 20 years ago. There was coverage in the newspapers, and some disparaging remarks in newspaper columns resulted in Mrs Watson&#8217;s only remaining child&#8212;her son&#8212;taking his own life. Newspaper cuttings were found around him when, sadly, he was found dead. Listening to Mrs Watson, I could tell that that clearly had a devastating impact on her family. We saw a line-up of celebrities and VIPs at the Leveson inquiry, and I do not want to downplay the adverse effect that media coverage has had on some of their lives. However, we all represent constituents throughout Scotland and we must ensure that there is a fair and transparent media that properly sticks up for people.</p><p>Christine Grahame made some very relevant points about how the media has changed. She quoted figures about some of the Sunday papers&#8212;I think she said that Scotland on Sunday&#8217;s sales are down to 32,000, and I believe that The Sunday Herald&#8217;s are even lower than that, at 28,000.

There is no doubt that there has been criticism recently of how some committees have gone about their work, but none of that criticism could be levelled at the Finance Committee for its work on the bill. It is clear not only from the report but from the thoughtful speeches that many committee members have made that they took their job seriously and interrogated the bill robustly.</p><p>As Michael McMahon said, there is no doubt that the bill makes some pretty minor technical changes. With the exception of the royal exemption, the basic points of the bill are the subject of broad agreement. Nobody will disagree with proposals to tidy provisions on historical records and the lifespan of exemptions. As Jamie Hepburn pointed out, it is logical for the six-month period in relation to offences to start when evidence is amassed rather than when an offence was committed. Such changes are logical and I do not think that people will disagree with them.</p><p>Willie Rennie and Iain Gray pointed out an issue with the current legislation. There is no doubt that some organisations and public bodies are getting expert at dealing with FOI requests and can release the minimum amount into the public domain. A great concern is the example that Iain Gray gave of a contract document in which the financial information was redacted. That does not represent the intention of the original legislation.</p><p>A number of members, including Paul Martin, have argued that the bill is at this stage a missed opportunity. We should look at extending the legislation to other organisations and to ALEOs. As Jean Urquhart said, there are now 130 ALEOs. As John Mason demonstrated, the nature of the public sector has changed quite a bit in recent years, and the FOI legislation must change to keep up with that.</p><p>Such points are important, and I note that the Deputy First Minister gave a commitment to look at them at stage 2 and said that she would want to see whether amendments would make the bill more fit for purpose.</p><p>The issue that has caused most discussion in the debate has been the royal exemption. I suppose that we must wonder why the Government adopted a royal exemption at stage 1. I think that it has viewed the matter through the prism of the independence referendum. From what the SNP has done over the past year, it is quite clear that it has tried to adopt a more cautious approach in order not to scare the voters. It has told them that Scotland would keep the pound and would still be wedded to the Bank of England. Alex Neil even said that we would still be British even if we voted to be independent.</p><p>The SNP has adopted this proposal. Who would ever have thought it? The Deputy First Minister is cuddling up to the British establishment. The SNP thought that adopting a more cautious approach might appeal more to the voters, but it is clear from the speeches by some of its back benchers that that is not a uniform view in the SNP. As Jean Urquhart pointed out, the public interest test will remain in the legislation, and I think that that will give adequate protection to the royal family.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677175", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freedom of Information (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to close the debate on behalf of the Scottish Labour Party, which will at 5 o&#8217;clock support the bill&#8217;s general principles at stage 1.

Like other members, I welcome the new minister, Humza Yousaf, to his post, and I compliment him on his speech, which I am sure will be the first of many on the Government&#8217;s front bench.</p><p>It is important that the Parliament comes together on Malawi. It is clear from the speeches across the chamber that members feel strongly about Malawi and that they want to celebrate the contribution that the current and previous Governments have made to improve the quality of life in Malawi.</p><p>The debate particularly resonates with me as the constituency MSP for Blantyre. From that point of view, I look forward to next year&#8217;s bicentenary celebration of David Livingstone&#8217;s birth.</p><p>Many members concentrated on the story of David Livingstone and his contribution. However, it is worth reflecting a bit more on his early life in Blantyre in order to look at the inspiration that that life gives not only to those trailblazers in Malawi, but to young people throughout Scotland and in Blantyre and Lanarkshire in particular.</p><p>As Siobhan McMahon noted, David Livingstone grew up with his family in a one-bedroom house next to the Blantyre mill where he and his family worked. He went to work at that mill from the age of 10, where he worked 14 hours a day. It says a lot for the commitment of his family, and particularly of his father that, when he came from work, he taught his son how to read and write. At quite a young age, David Livingstone taught himself Latin, which shows the quality of that young man.</p><p>When David Livingstone was 19, his family had saved enough to enrol him at Anderson&#8217;s University in Glasgow to study medicine. One story about him that has always interested me is that every Monday morning he walked 8 miles from Blantyre to the university, where he stayed in digs for the week. That shows how determined he was to learn and better himself. After gaining his medical qualification, he went on&#8212;as other members have pointed out&#8212;to make a major contribution as a missionary, a campaigner against slavery and a philanthropist.</p><p>I think that that story can act as an inspiration to schoolchildren throughout Scotland. In Blantyre, there is a primary school that is named after David Livingstone. As Clare Adamson and Christina McKelvie said, pupils from many of the schools in Lanarkshire visit the David Livingstone centre. Next year&#8217;s bicentenary will provide a great opportunity for focus on the centre and on the story of David Livingstone. Many schoolchildren do not know a lot about that story when they go there, but it is an excellent centre that has a great story to tell.</p><p>The issue now is how we can use that legacy to tackle the problems that Malawi has faced and to make it a better country. Poverty remains a major issue. Claudia Beamish highlighted the Co-operative College&#8217;s initiative, which 10,000 people will have the opportunity to come into contact with, 2,700 of whom will receive training in modern farming techniques and how to run a farming co-operative. That will help to lift many people out of poverty. The same can be said of the NIDOS project that Clare Adamson and Christina McKelvie mentioned, which came to Rutherglen. I was extremely interested in the fact that the water purification system&#8212;which was developed in Glasgow&#8212;had saved around 800 lives.</p><p>Those are schemes that tackle poverty and improve the health and wellbeing of the people of Malawi. When such improvements are made in a country, they are followed by improvements in its political infrastructure. That is highlighted in the Labour amendment, which mentions some of the initiatives that have been progressed in recent years, particularly in relation to women.</p><p>It has been an excellent debate. I welcome the opportunity to recognise the work that has been done in Malawi, and I look forward to the celebration of the David Livingstone bicentenary. I believe that that work can play a trailblazing role in tackling ill health and poverty in Malawi and in improving the wellbeing of the country&#8217;s people, so that they can make a contribution on the international stage in the way that David Livingstone did.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Relationship with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to take part in a debate that celebrates Scotland&#8217;s relationship with Malawi.

As Christina McKelvie said, that has been demonstrated in my local area by South Lanarkshire Council, which has delivered a living wage that benefits nearly half of its 16,000 employees. As Mary Fee and Christina McKelvie said, the beneficiaries of the policy are often women. That increases the focus and the impetus to make progress on the issue.</p><p>A living wage has three direct benefits. First and foremost, it puts more money into people&#8217;s pockets. Increasingly, families are struggling&#8212;on average, families have become &#163;1,200 less well off in the past year. There are rising fuel bills and other challenges for families. At lunch time, I was talking to people from the co-operative retail sector, who said that, from the footfall in their shops, they can see that people are struggling to make ends meet and even to make basic food purchases. Although the living wage does not address all those issues, at least it makes a contribution.</p><p>Allied to that, there is an economic benefit. If we put money into people&#8217;s pockets and they spend it in local shops and businesses, that will boost the economy. That is particularly true when the money goes to those who are lower paid and who need to spend it. To be mildly controversial for a minute, if for example we pass the benefits of free prescription charges to those on six-figure salaries, the cash benefit to them is more likely to lie sleeping in bank accounts than to make its way into the local economy.</p><p>The final benefit is to business itself. Patrick Harvie is right that there are still those who say that the living wage is not a good idea because it raises business costs, affects the bottom line and undermines value to the shareholder. However, the statistics that John Park and Malcolm Chisholm gave from two studies in London show that, if a business recognises the worth of an employee by paying them more, they are more likely to be motivated to stay with the company and less likely to be off sick, and the business will operate more efficiently and effectively as a result. There are therefore benefits to businesses from the living wage.</p><p>I again congratulate Kezia Dugdale. I look forward to working with John Park on his proposed bill on the issue. The campaign has grown, but the fight must continue so that we can provide a real benefit and make a real difference to families and individuals throughout the country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676142", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Kezia Dugdale on securing the debate.

Before today&#8217;s debate, I considered the issues and&#8212;much as Chic Brodie did&#8212;the implications for the economy. I am very much aware that I have a VION food processing plant in my constituency that employs nearly 400 workers. It makes a vital contribution not only in my constituency but throughout the Scottish economy. There is an impact in the areas that the food for that plant comes from, and there are direct benefits to the economy far from the plant&#8217;s Cambuslang base.</p><p>A recent example of that point is the potential closure of the Hall&#8217;s plant. Everybody in the chamber is aware of the impact that that has not only in the local area but throughout Scotland. That demonstrates the importance of the rural economy and why it is so important that we get a proper and efficient CAP.</p><p>People might characterise MSPs such as myself who represent urban areas as thinking of rural areas as areas that simply have farms full of cows and sheep. However, it is clear from speaking to members, listening to their speeches and reading the briefings that, during an economic downturn, rural areas sometimes have the same problems that we experience in other areas but that they are magnified. Those areas have unemployment, poverty and vulnerable areas. It is important to bring that to the fore in this debate.</p><p>Against that backdrop, it is important that this Parliament and other Parliaments look at CAP reform and that we produce a system that is robust, fair and benefits the public in addition to supporting the economy.</p><p>Some members have concentrated on how the payments system would operate. I think that the Lib Dem amendment makes a valid point about financial modelling. If there is proper financial modelling of the impact of any payments system, we can work out how the payments have been distributed and whether the distribution is fair, and we can assess the economic impact of the system.</p><p>I am in tune with members who have spoken about the importance of ensuring that the payments are tied more closely to farms on which active farming is taking place.

The benefit of giving the Scottish Parliament greater opportunity to borrow and therefore to invest in capital infrastructure is that we will be able to create more jobs at a time of economic downturn.</p><p>As Mr Crawford said, the bill deals with other issues such as the provision of additional powers on landfill tax and stamp duty.

There are cross-party concerns about drink driving and the number of accidents on our roads in Scotland. The additional powers will help to tackle those issues.</p><p>I welcome, too, the substantial discussions that have taken place on the issue of the UK Supreme Court. The finished product in that regard makes the process more efficient in terms of appeals and it tidies up the Scotland Act 1998 in relation to acts of the Lord Advocate.</p><p>Fundamental to the transition to the new tax system is the no-detriment principle. I welcome the fact that discussions have taken place and that a constructive agreement has been reached, so that both Governments can be satisfied that, as we move through the transition period, Scotland&#8217;s financial position will not be disadvantaged.</p><p>Labour believes that the bill should have gone further on a number of matters. We would have liked the borrowing ability to be extended by a greater amount. We have consistently argued that air passenger duty should be devolved. The business community has promoted that, and being able to decide that duty here would be a greater economic tool in Scotland&#8217;s toolbox. There was cross-party agreement on the Scotland Bill Committee on greater devolution of the Crown estate. My colleague David Stewart will hold a members&#8217; business debate on that tonight, which I have no doubt will give us an opportunity to explore some of the issues in more detail.</p><p>Supporting the LCM does not mean that we should not allow ourselves to examine the SNP&#8217;s record. We should not forget that John Swinney decried the initial proposals as a poison pill. In the aftermath of the 2011 election, the First Minister made&#8212;from the seat that Bruce Crawford is in now&#8212;his clarion call for the six demands. Those demands have melted away to a damp squib. Part of the reason for that is that the case that was presented by the Scottish Government lacked detail&#8212;indeed, it had all the detail of a poorly prepared student essay. That is why the proposals melted away.</p><p>I will look at some of the proposals in a bit more detail. The Scottish Government said clearly that it would use corporation tax powers to lower that tax, but it must say how it would prevent corporations such as Amazon from avoiding paying corporation tax and how it would avoid a race to the bottom.</p><p>There are fundamental issues for the SNP as a party. It tries to put itself forward as a low-tax party, but the other side of low taxes is public spending cuts. Perhaps we should not be surprised about that, because the SNP Government goes into the council elections while passing on 89 per cent of all the cuts from the UK Government.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What struck me from our discussions in the Scotland Bill Committee on having more powers over income tax and how that would operate is that, as the SNP gets the opportunity to be handed more powers, it always seems to find an opportunity to complain about the process, rather than grasping the nettle and taking the powers forward.

It is silent on some areas, for example, which I know has meant major challenges for those who work in Registers of Scotland. As many people have pointed out, it is quite clear that there has been a lack of registration since 1979, so the issue needs to be taken more seriously. In addition, there are genuine challenges around mapping and how that is dealt with in terms of modern land registration law.</p><p>One of the central issues that members have touched on is the completion of the register. As many have said, only 21 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s landmass is registered in the system, which means that nearly 80 per cent is not registered. The register is therefore far from complete and we need to look at methods of encouraging more registration.</p><p>There has been some discussion of fees. As the committee has said, we should consider reducing some fees, particularly for voluntary registration. Looking forward, the Government has to be serious about the fees that it sets if it wants to encourage more registrations.</p><p>Registers of Scotland&#8217;s reserves of &#163;75 million underpin all of that, and any future fee-setting regime must be set against those reserves. Surely we can come up with more realistic fees that can encourage people to register. The situation must be monitored, with transition and timescale targets set to ensure that there is a greater uptake of registration. Closer monitoring will ensure that the matter is taken seriously.</p><p>Many members have raised the issue of electronic conveyancing and access to the land registration system. It is vital that that access is taken beyond those who are involved in conveyancing. Members of the general public are interested in land issues. People occasionally come to me, as a constituency MSP, with land disputes, but it is hard to get information. It would help greatly if more information were available through IT. IT can be of great benefit&#8212;Stuart McMillan made a number of relevant points about that&#8212;and we need an IT system that is fit for purpose. If the current ARTL system does not do the job, we should look at creating a new system, although that would need to be planned properly. We need to listen to those who want to use the system and implement a new one that can be used in future to service not only conveyancers, but the general public.</p><p>There are serious issues that need to be addressed in the bill, such as beneficial ownership, which Rhoda Grant made relevant points about.

It lifts them out of poverty and gives them hope and a chance to move forward in life.</p><p>It ill befits a Conservative representative to argue against something that benefits families. Margaret Mitchell is at odds with her South Lanarkshire Council colleagues, who voted for the living wage measure in the council&#8217;s budget.</p><p>I congratulate John Park on raising the issue. It is vital to build on the debates tonight and last week, to continue to support the campaign and to speak up for the living wage to be rolled out in more councils throughout Scotland and taken into the private sector. That will fight inequality and boost economic activity.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662943", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The money that has been invested by South Lanarkshire Council is not only helping many families in Cambuslang, Rutherglen and Blantyre, where there are areas of real deprivation and poverty; it is also benefiting the economy, as people will now be paying more taxes and national insurance.

I congratulate George Adam, my fellow co-convener of the cross-party group on fair trade, on securing the debate.</p><p>This is an excellent way to start the Fairtrade fortnight and to launch the debate in the Parliament. It is a tremendous platform for the many events that will take place in communities throughout Scotland and that signify the growth in fair trade that other members have spoken about.</p><p>As George Adam said, a few years back we struggled to find shops that would sell fair trade products, never mind fair trade products themselves. That has changed, as we can purchase fair trade products in a number of shops in our main streets and our towns. That shows the success of the fair trade movement.</p><p>Whether someone is involved in politics, in a community group or in fair trade, the test is whether what they are involved in makes a difference. Fair trade is an excellent example of such work making a difference. It helps 7.5 million people throughout the world, many of whom come from vulnerable and poor communities. Fair trade helps give those people at least a contribution towards a decent living. I take John Mason&#8217;s point about whether it is sizeable enough, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. Fair trade also lays the basis for some proper education. It allows people to operate in structures, which means that they can produce their goods to sell on and it gives them a sustainable solution for the future.</p><p>I am lucky in my constituency in that there have been active fair trade groups in Rutherglen and Cambuslang for a number of years, and they have achieved Fairtrade status. That has been down to the active chairmanship of Kieran Dinwoodie followed by John Sanderson.</p><p>George Adam said that it is important to have politicians in the group. There is certainly an appropriate place for them, but the test of a successful fair trade group is its breadth of community involvement. We certainly have that in Rutherglen and Cambuslang, as schools such as Trinity high school and Cathkin high school, St Bride&#8217;s church and Stonelaw church, and a breadth of younger and older people are involved. The zest of younger people and the experience of the older heads in the group have really driven things forward, and they have not stopped at Fairtrade status for Rutherglen and Cambuslang. I am glad that they have joined other communities throughout South Lanarkshire to try to secure Fairtrade zone status.</p><p>It also strikes me that there is an education aspect, particularly for the younger people who are involved in fair trade groups. They become aware of good practices as citizens and learn a lot about what it means to make a difference in a fair trade group. They take forward what they have learned to college, university or employment. We look for young people to make positive contributions in 21st century Scotland, and what young people learn in fair trade groups gives them a positive leaning towards making such contributions.</p><p>To sum up, the debate is an excellent opportunity to support Fairtrade fortnight. I am sure that we will see tremendous events throughout Scotland over that period.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate to celebrate the launch of Fairtrade fortnight.

We should also look at some of the international examples, and consider how we can implement that good practice in Scotland.</p><p>As Chic Brodie mentioned, there is a rich vein of history with regard to co-operatives in Scotland. We have held a debate before in celebration of the work of the Fenwick Weavers Society. As Helen Eadie pointed out, and as the motion mentions, the co-operative movement has developed extensively in the retail and energy sectors, in credit unions, and in football and other areas.</p><p>In my constituency, I do not have to look very far from my home in Cambuslang to see a shining example of a successful co-op. The West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative Ltd became a co-operative in the 1980s, and the turnaround has been remarkable, not only in the quality of the housing but in the way the community has come together to combat crime and antisocial behaviour. People have much more pride in the area as citizens, and it is a great example of the real benefits that co-operatives can bring to an area.</p><p>It is important that we look at international examples to see how we can learn from them. One area in which we can see such examples is football, which people in Scotland obviously feel very strongly about. It is interesting to look at the German example. The rules in Germany are such that they offer a greater opportunity for community involvement and influence, which can be seen in the fan-friendly policies that are implemented there. I do not need to point out that Germany has a much greater success rate in club and international football than not only Scotland but England, and we can learn something from that.</p><p>In taking forward such ideas from Germany, we should look at the work of Supporters Direct in Scotland, which is an excellent organisation that has been at the forefront of developing 34 trusts and seven community-owned clubs.

That presents greater challenges not only in getting more people to the polls but in ensuring that people interact with the system and understand the different electoral systems by which we choose our representatives. Those are major challenges.</p><p>It is clear, as Margaret Mitchell and Anne McTaggart said, that it was correct to review the arrangements in the aftermath of the 2007 elections because of the chaos that ensued and that we must put in place arrangements in which the electorate can have more confidence. From that point of view, I recognise the work that Ron Gould did and congratulate him on the many recommended arrangements that have been taken forward. Central to those arrangements is the design of the ballot paper, and I acknowledge that testing has been done on it.</p><p>One issue that nobody has mentioned is the positioning of candidates on the ballot paper, which I suspect affects Labour and the SNP in particular. When a party runs more than one candidate, it is to an individual candidate&#8217;s advantage to have a surname such as Adam and to be placed higher on the ballot paper. In fact, Kenny Gibson produced some really interesting research in the aftermath of the 2007 elections to show that, when parties ran more than one candidate, people who were placed higher on the ballot paper were more likely to be successful. I can also say anecdotally, from my experience in Labour, that in 2007 some experienced councillors lost out to new candidates. We need to consider the issue in the context of the 2012 elections.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658938", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections 2012"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to close this morning&#8217;s debate on behalf of the Labour Party.

We all agree that we want to eradicate the evil of sectarianism&#8212;a blight on Scottish society&#8212;and we should not divide on such an issue. The reason why we are is not only that the Government has not made the case, but that the legislation is flawed, and the Government has not been able to build a consensus on it in Parliament or outside.</p><p>The minister tells us that she thanks members for lodging amendments; however, only at the very last minute did we actually see an amendment accepted&#8212;one, from Patrick Harvie. It was like throwing a crumb to the Opposition benches.</p><p>The decision not to agree to the bill at this stage is both a principled and an evidence-based one. It has been useful to have more evidence since our last debate in the Parliament. Statistics on prosecutions for religious aggravation have been published, showing 693 prosecutions in 2010-11. Do not forget that the vast bulk of those will have come before 3 March and the old firm game at which all the controversy started. That shows that legislation is effective and was being used. In addition, 99 of those prosecutions related to section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, which was only enacted in October last year. Surely it would have made more sense to let another part of the legislative toolbox settle in and to take more time.

The Government&#8217;s process has been flawed.</p><p>We welcomed the decision by the First Minister back in June to pause, reflect and extend the timetable but, in reality, the Government paused but did not do anything more. Where was the consultation over the summer? Where were the discussions with community groups and the education sector? They did not take place. Instead, the Government was closeted in St Andrew&#8217;s House with civil servants and became too focused on football. We still do not have a clear strategy for tackling sectarianism. As a result, the Government has not been able to build a proper consensus. The issues that were raised at stage 1 remain. We need only look at the submission from the Law Society of Scotland, which says that the existing legislation is adequate and asks about section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing Act 2010. Many such issues, which it raised at stage 1, have still not been answered at stage 3.</p><p>No wonder the Government has failed to build support for the bill.

The legislation was broadly supported by the main political parties that October afternoon, although the debate was&#8212;this is not a criticism of the Government&#8212;somewhat chaotic at times.</p><p>It was correct to set up a review group to reflect on the implications of not only the Cadder judgment but the legislation that was passed in its aftermath. Lord Carloway&#8217;s report is an extensive piece of work that is heavily evidenced and researched. The report&#8212;in particular, the conclusions&#8212;is written very clearly. In it, he sets out his views clearly and, helpfully for the Government, he identifies areas where he feels that legislation may be required, and areas where it may not be required, to implement his recommendations. We should thank him for a substantial piece of work.</p><p>Much of the discussion in the media and the legal profession has focused on corroboration. Lord Carloway&#8217;s report sets out the history of why corroboration was incorporated into Scots law. It is important to remember that it was incorporated at a time when the legal system and the country were very different. There were geographical and other divides in Scotland, and it was essential to ensure that anyone who was being prosecuted was properly protected and got the fair trial to which they were entitled. It was on that basis that corroboration was incorporated into Scots law. There have been many advances since that time, not only in technology but in the skill and expertise of prosecutors and defence agents. Times have moved on.</p><p>Lord Carloway makes a powerful case for the abolition of corroboration. The cabinet secretary cited the research, which covers some of the more serious cases. Of the 458 cases that were not taken forward, 374, or more than 80 per cent, would have been likely to go to trial if there had not been a requirement for corroboration, with almost 60 per cent of those cases having a good chance of success.</p><p>Labour has previously made its position clear on rape cases, in relation to which we feel that corroboration should be abolished. The most recent statistics on rape cases show that of 884 cases reported to the police, only 41, or less than 5 per cent, secured a conviction. I am sure that there is agreement across the chamber that that level of success in securing convictions is unacceptable, particularly for the victims of rape.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656451", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Law and Practice (Carloway Review)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate and to support the Government&#8217;s motion.

That is clear not just from the analysis that he sets out but from the international examples that the cabinet secretary quoted, which mean that we in Scotland stand alone in pursuing corroboration. As well as for the reasons that I have already outlined, corroboration was set up to ensure that there were no miscarriages of justice. As Christine Grahame pointed out, we do not want those to happen further down the line.</p><p>The case for abolishing corroboration must be weighed against the fact that it is a central tenet of the Scottish justice system. Some have argued against its abolition on the grounds that doing so would threaten the fairness of trials and might result in people being unfairly convicted. Such concerns must be weighed in the balance as we consider whether we should abolish corroboration for all criminal trials.</p><p>For me, the test is the one that Lord Carloway presents in his review, and it involves looking at the quality of evidence. There is a danger that in sticking with the corroboration principle we concentrate on quantity in getting two different sources of evidence. However, we must look at the quality of that evidence. We must ensure that if corroboration is not in place, those who are prosecuted get the fair trial to which they are entitled and that any conviction must be because their guilt is beyond reasonable doubt. Proper safeguards must be put in place if the corroboration principle is abolished. Part of that will be about looking at the process, including the jury system and the principle of majority verdicts, to see whether we need to build in further safeguards.</p><p>There are major issues to consider. To answer the members who intervened, successful prosecutions in rape cases is a matter of major concern, and I am convinced about abolishing corroboration in that area. I am sympathetic to the case that Lord Carloway makes, but I am still not totally convinced.

They might even have personal experience of a salesman appearing on their doorstep with a reasonable proposition to tidy up part of their roof or whatever and carrying out the work, trying to extend the work and maybe leaving part of the work undone. Often, their shoddy workmanship results in the condition of the building being worse than it was before they started. There are significant concerns about the problem, and Consumer Focus Scotland reports that more than 13,000 complaints have been raised about inappropriate activity and salesmanship by rogue traders.</p><p>In my constituency, unfortunately, many of the victims are pensioners.

If somebody comes round and suggests that a particular area needs work, they are more inclined to accept what that person says. It is not only stressful when it does not work out for the person once they have handed over the money; older people, understandably, are more subject to stress and take longer to get over such incidents. The issue is, therefore, a matter of great concern. It is also unacceptable and we should condemn it.</p><p>I heard of a practical example yesterday, when I attended an event that was sponsored by Kezia Dugdale on installing carbon monoxide monitors in homes throughout Scotland. One of the people at that event told me that they had had some work done in their loft, from which there were carbon monoxide emissions. Fortunately, they had a monitor installed, which alerted them to the problem, but lives could have been at risk because of that shoddy workmanship and the results of a rogue trader.</p><p>The problem has an impact on the economy. Much of the work relates to housing repairs and takes a big amount out of the economy. Housing repairs account for &#163;22 billion in the economy, and work that is done by rogue traders as opposed to properly recognised traders amounts to some &#163;170 million of work that is not carried out appropriately. It is work that is stolen from the economy, as it has to be redone. Rogue traders do not pay VAT, and in these hard-pressed economic times, VAT receipts are important to the public purse if we are to maximise the amount of money that we have for public spending.</p><p>There is an impact on the economy and a real human impact. To move the issue forward, it is important to raise awareness of the problems. I pay tribute to the Federation of Master Builders, with which I worked closely on the motion and the campaign to raise awareness of the issues in communities throughout Scotland.</p><p>Consumers can take some practical steps to expose the activities of rogue traders. First and foremost, if anyone has been a victim of such activity, they should report it to the police if it is inappropriate and illegal. To stop rogue traders in their tracks, people could take references rather than go ahead with work that is to be carried out on their house. It is advisable for people to get three quotes so that they not only get the best value for money but can make a judgment about those who recommend that work be carried out.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654189", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rogue Traders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the campaign to nail the rogues.

I thank Lord McCluskey and his colleagues for the work that they have done in producing not only the final report but the interim report that we debated in June.</p><p>Mr MacAskill started with a history lesson. I will start with a more recent history lesson to put the debate in context. It is important to reflect on the intemperate contributions that the First Minister and the cabinet secretary made to the debate back in May. Following the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment in the Fraser case, Mr Salmond attacked the England-based judges for the decision. Mr MacAskill told us that such judgments implied that the judges acquired their knowledge of Scots law on a visit to the Edinburgh festival. He also, shockingly, threatened to withdraw funding from the Supreme Court. The Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates united to condemn that move. Those comments were unacceptable at the time and did nothing to set the tone that Mr MacAskill has strenuously encouraged Parliament to adopt this afternoon. It seemed to me almost as if Mr MacAskill and the First Minister were telling us that all we needed to get the correct decisions were some Scottish judges in tartan scarves as opposed to English judges wrapped in the St George&#8217;s cross. Some members are shaking their heads, but that was the tone of the debate.</p><p>I note the report and will move on to discuss the issues in more measured terms. I welcome the fact that the report reinforces the UK Supreme Court&#8217;s role. I point out that that is at odds with the view that the Scottish National Party Government expressed back in May, but it is the correct view to take and is entirely logical given the situation that we are in.</p><p>Mr MacAskill stressed that we have an independent legal system. However, we are not an independent country. We reside within the UK, and the UK is the signatory to the European convention on human rights. Therefore, it is important that we have consistency throughout the UK and the Supreme Court should be the court of appeal in human rights cases. That recommendation in the report is to be welcomed, particularly when we contrast it with some of the suggestions in the debate back in May, such as having a Scottish supreme court or referring decisions to Strasbourg.</p><p>In its submission to the Scotland Bill Committee, the Faculty of Advocates pointed out that the Supreme Court has been used on only very few occasions. Between October 2009 and March 2011, there were 18 requests for the Supreme Court to consider cases and only two of them were taken up. Members should contrast that with Strasbourg, where 150,000 cases are taking up to three and a half years to be heard. We should think of the cost and uncertainty that would arise if we went down that route, as some members suggested earlier in the year.</p><p>Three areas in the report require concentration and further consideration. The proposal in the Scotland Bill on acts of the Lord Advocate, which has been discussed in the expert group convened by Lord Wallace and in Lord McCluskey&#8217;s group, is a substantive legislative proposal that requires consideration. The expert group, supported by Lord McCluskey&#8217;s group, criticised the original constitutional arrangements in relation to the Lord Advocate&#8217;s retained functions. It pointed out that that has resulted in practical problems and delays. The proposal has been made to take out the Lord Advocate&#8217;s retained functions.</p><p>It should be noted that the Law Society has opposed that. It has some concerns on the issue, particularly on how convictions would be treated if convention rights had been breached. However, I note that, in its evidence to the Scotland Bill Committee, the Faculty of Advocates&#8212;which was originally opposed to taking the acts of the Lord Advocate out of the arrangements&#8212;says that it is hopeful that a solution can be found. It is important that the relevant parties discuss the issues to try to find a solution that is agreeable to all.</p><p>Mr MacAskill focused on the proposal that the High Court should have to grant a certificate of public interest in a case before the Supreme Court could hear it. He argued that that would bring Scotland into line with other parts of the UK. That is one side of the argument, but other issues must be considered. If that approach was to be consistent with that in other parts of the UK, it could open up the ability for people to argue&#8212;as with criminal cases in England&#8212;that an application should be implemented in Scotland, which would provide a route for criminal cases to go to the Supreme Court.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Criminal Law (Integrity)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this afternoon&#8217;s debate.

What keeps patients, particularly elderly patients, going in hospital is the thought of a relative or a friend coming to visit them.

The SNP&#8217;s approach is to demand and to assert, and when people do not agree with it, it portrays them as being against the consensus and anti-Scottish. Gavin Brown is correct to point to the lack of detail regarding the Scottish Government&#8217;s modelling, although the published paper gives the outputs from the model. The clue is in the fact that it is referred to as &#8220;initial modelling&#8221;. This is a serious debate about a proposal for a major change in taxation policy in Scotland, yet what we have is &#8220;initial modelling&#8221;. Financial and economic models are complicated. There are a great number of variables in them, and major assumptions underpin them. We are told that the modelling, in this case, was over 20 years; therefore, we might expect some of the variables and assumptions to change over that time. We do not have any of that information, and it is difficult to reach a practical conclusion on the basis of the information that has been published.</p><p>The Scotland Bill Committee has heard that the complexities of moving to two rates of tax&#8212;one in Scotland and one in the rest of the UK&#8212;would make things difficult for businesses. Businesses are constantly telling me that they want reduced bureaucracy and systems to be simplified. However, we are potentially introducing an additional tax system that not only will add costs to businesses, but will have significant set-up costs. That needs to be taken into account.

No SNP member has been able to tell us the extent of the black hole that would exist in the budget. Neil Bibby was right to point out the policy implications of that. In effect, that would be shifting resources from the public sector to the private sector. We heard yesterday that nearly 600,000 people in Scotland are employed in the public sector.</p><p>The SNP is always telling us how we face a difficult budgetary situation that will make it tremendously difficult to tackle issues such as the living wage, finding jobs for unemployed teachers and tackling the scourge of youth unemployment. We must also question who would benefit from the policy. What are the main businesses in Scotland that pay corporation tax? They are the banks&#8212;HBOS and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The public would question a policy of passing on benefits to such banks and potentially asking public sector workers to pay for it.</p><p>The third part of the debate is the impact on economic growth.

If we move to a new rate of corporation tax, there will be uncertainty over future revenue.</p><p>The Scottish Government should be looking at what it can do, as Margaret McCulloch pointed out, to promote broadband.

Even now, looking back at pictures and films of it, we are struck by the iconic images of the workers as they return to the yard and of the demonstration down Union Street. The strength, dignity, resolve and determination of those workers, who wanted to protect their right to work, come across powerfully when we look back on it.</p><p>I will also talk about the impact that those events had on wider Scotland. I was only eight years old at the time and I do not remember the work-in, but I remember that my parents used to talk about it when I was growing up in the 1970s. My parents did not come from Clydebank and were not associated with the shipyards, but that shows the impact that it had throughout the west of Scotland and Scottish communities in general.</p><p>I pay tribute to Sammy Gilmore, one of my constituents, who played a central role as a shop steward. He is not able to be here because of ill health, but I know how proud he is of the work that he did on the UCS work-in and of his work as a shop steward. From speaking to his wife, Margaret, I know how proud the wider family is of Sammy and how pleased they are that the Parliament is recognising this event. Sammy is a character and he calls a spade a spade. Whether disagreeing with a fellow worker or speaking to a Government minister or even a Prime Minister, Sammy puts people in their place. That was an asset to the shop stewards committee during the work-in and the negotiations with the Government.</p><p>It is also important to reflect on the legacy that Sammy Gilmore, Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie and others have left for the trade union movement. Two years ago, the Vion factory in Cambuslang suffered job losses. The shop stewards from the committee, who I brought to the Parliament, carried on the legacy of the work-in. They resisted the job losses and the potential closure, turned the situation round and attracted new investment to Cambuslang. I congratulate Hugh Henry and I congratulate the shop stewards who were involved in 1971 and those who are here tonight.

We have set up the Scotland Bill Committee&#8212;it was the wish of the SNP to set up such a committee to consider the six items that Alex Salmond, as First Minister, put forward in his acceptance speech when he was elected as First Minister. If we establish a committee and dedicate parliamentary resources and the time of parliamentarians, we want the committee to consider the issues, hear and test the arguments, and take appropriate evidence.

It must also be competent. Some of the rules on representation are decided by the EU.

I suppose that, as someone who operates within the justice portfolio, I should therefore welcome the fact that five of the 16 Government bills will come within that portfolio. However, as we have heard in the debate, there are gaps in the programme in respect of priorities. There are bills that are welcome, but other bills that would be welcome have not been brought forward. I will expound upon those later in my speech.</p><p>I will start with the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill, which Christine Grahame and others have already mentioned. There has been much debate about and comment on the bill over the summer. The Government was very wise to withdraw the bill and to allow a longer timescale for consideration. There is no doubt that the submissions to the Justice Committee, many of which oppose the bill, show the scale of the task that still lies before the Government and this Parliament to make the legislation robust and worthy so that it can not only be passed but can be followed and implemented by police and by prosecutors and can have the confidence of the public.</p><p>Of course, we all support action against discrimination and sectarianism; we support action being taken when people are either attacked or discriminated against because of their religion, sex or race. We should use the existing laws to enforce that, but when a new law is made there always has to be a question asked about what it is seeking to achieve. The Government still has to answer that question.</p><p>Labour supported the principles of the bill at stage 1 and will continue to explore the bill&#8217;s merits through the committee process. The Government has a long way to go on the bill and it must seek to provide more clarity to ensure that it is a just bill that the Parliament will pass.</p><p>On police and fire service reform, the Government is correct to go down the route of a single police service. It is important that that is delivered with local accountability and it is also key that there is effective front-line policing. There is no point in having the police numbers, which the SNP likes to remind us about, if at the same time the number of support staff is being slashed throughout the country. The public need to have the confidence that is provided by seeing police on the beat, so it is important that the reform delivers that.</p><p>On the fire service, there has been a bit more consensus in the debate about moving to a single service, but Labour has some concerns about the way in which the proposals have been drafted. Those concerns are underlined by the figures that have come out today, which show that there has been a 5 per cent reduction in firefighter numbers. Yesterday, we had the much-trumpeted increase in police numbers, but today, while everyone was watching the legislative programme, a release was issued that shows a 5 per cent cut in firefighter numbers, which undermines public safety throughout Scotland.</p><p>In examining the draft proposals for the fire service, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and others have highlighted the fact that the budget for firefighter numbers could be reduced by up to &#163;35&#160;million. That must be addressed as the Government works through the reform process. In doing so, it needs to involve the experts in the field&#8212;that is not a job for accountants or business analysts; it is a job for those who work in the fire service, if we are to ensure that we get the model absolutely correct.</p><p>There is a gaping hole in the Government&#8217;s legislative programme as far as justice is concerned. At the start of the election campaign, Alex Salmond told us that if the SNP Government were re-elected, it would introduce a victims bill, but it has failed to do that. A victims bill is essential not just from a rhetorical or a party-political point of view. It is clear from talking to victims of crime that they feel isolated by the system. That point was reinforced in yesterday&#8217;s Audit Scotland report. They need support, which a victims bill would give them.</p><p>The SNP Government proposes to introduce 16 bills. Alex Salmond told us that he would think big for Scotland. I think that it is time that he acted big for the victims of crime in Scotland. It is important that they have a voice in the Parliament; it is just a pity that they have not found such a voice among the ranks of the SNP Government.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.

Like other members, I associate myself with the comments that have been made and the condolences on the sad death of Lord Rodger, who clearly made a substantial contribution to the Scottish legal system all the way back to his initial task as an advocate in 1974.</p><p>I thank Lord McCluskey and his working group for their work on the report, which addresses a number of matters, as the cabinet secretary likes to say. As Mr McLetchie said, the clear view on the Supreme Court playing a role in these issues is central to that report. Alison McInnes was correct to point out that the First Minister made it absolutely clear a few weeks ago that he thought that there was no role for the Supreme Court. The working group&#8217;s interim report is therefore a slap in the face for the First Minister.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale was correct to point out that it was logical for the working group to have reached such a conclusion. We are signatories within the UK to the European convention on human rights, and it makes absolute sense that there is a Supreme Court to ensure that the convention is applied consistently throughout the UK.</p><p>Some speeches from SNP members seemed to suggest that members still have their football scarves on from last week&#8217;s debate; it was as if we would all turn up at the Supreme Court and cheer on our preferred point of view. However, if we consider the details of some of the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgments, we see that the court is seeking to apply the law. Some SNP members have suggested that the judges sit down and think, &#8220;How can we make this awkward for Scotland? Can we come up with a judgment that will cause difficulty north of the border?&#8221; Mr Dornan protests, but that is how his contribution characterised the work of the Supreme Court.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell painted a picture and suggested that if only we were independent and, like other countries in the European Union, had access to Strasbourg, everything would be fine and dandy. However, Strasbourg has a backlog of three and a half years. If cases were referred to Strasbourg from Scotland, decisions would take three and a half years. That would add to costs and would create considerable uncertainty in the Scottish legal system.</p><p>In recent weeks, clear issues have arisen to do with the use of language and a lack of respect. The cabinet secretary mentioned outspoken public statements, but what he did not tell us was that he had been at the centre of many of them. As Graeme Pearson said, the cabinet secretary threatened to withdraw funding from the Supreme Court, claiming that he who pays the piper should call the tune. That was immensely disrespectful. Again, a footballing analogy comes to mind: the cabinet secretary and the First Minister have lost the match, but now they want to take away the ball so that it will not happen again.</p><p>Listening to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments on Monday, I felt that he had tried to row back from his position. I hope that the First Minister will row back from his disrespectful comments about Lord Hope. Such comments do not help the debate at all.</p><p>I feel sorry for SNP members in the way that policy has lurched back and forward in recent weeks; I am glad to see that Ms Cunningham has just joined us. Exactly a week ago, SNP members were on their feet telling us that we needed emergency legislation on sectarianism, and they characterised those of us who wanted to extend the timetable as being not fully committed to erasing the blight of sectarianism in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649724", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill (Supreme Court)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.

Nigel Don referred to them as &#8220;the other side&#8221;, as if they were some dark, plotting group. There is a substantial archive of opinion there, which helps to inform this morning&#8217;s debate.

I do not understand why, once the group had been set up, there was a rush to produce an interim report. Some of the issues that we have discussed this morning are fundamental to the Scottish justice system. It would have made good sense to interview the appropriate people, to speak to the Edwards group and to take stock before reaching firmer conclusions.</p><p>There is an issue of ensuring that we get the law right. Richard Simpson and Alison McInnes highlighted the importance of an ECHR audit to ensure that we comply with the ECHR in any decisions that we make. It is also important that we provide proper training and support to our judges to ensure that they are adequately briefed on ECHR issues in order to minimise the instances in which Scottish law does not comply with the ECHR.</p><p>I endorse the Law Society&#8217;s view that we must take our time on these issues. We need a more considered, reasonable and well-informed debate. Scottish Labour supports proposals that make the justice system more effective and which are more supportive of the rights of victims.

Indeed, they are particularly significant for Scotland; after all, John Logie Baird invented TV, which has come to dominate so many of our lives. I grew up in the TV age and iconic images such as the first man on the moon, the freeing of Nelson Mandela and the election of Barack Obama as the first black US President, which came to us through our TV screens, illustrate how powerful the technology is. We should be thankful that it is a Scottish invention.</p><p>I support the creation of a new Scottish digital channel, as other members do. With the greater Scottish input and diversity that would occur, it would present tremendous opportunities for those who work in the Scottish broadcasting and digital industry, and give great opportunities to expand the range of programmes and therefore provide greater entertainment to communities throughout Scotland. The tools that would be at the disposal of a new broadcasting channel in Scotland would allow significant expansion. The minister mentioned Creative Scotland and Skills Development Scotland, and gave examples of work that has already been undertaken. Those bodies can do much to underpin the work in the existing broadcasting infrastructure and in a new digital network.</p><p>As we expand the network, it is important that we get a proper balance and do not compromise on quality in considering the programme set-up.

Ruth Davidson mentioned a 150 per cent increase in programming. It is clearly important that we get to the 8.6 per cent production figure that has been stipulated. The meeting of the interim 7.4 per cent target for Scottish programmes is to be welcomed, but we must be vigilant about quality. It is not just a case of churning out programmes; it is important that we get appropriate Scottish quality.</p><p>There is a real opportunity with broadband and technology in general. Things have moved on. Those of us who are old enough to have done so used to watch flickering black-and-white TVs with four buttons that sometimes had to be pressed and held in to get the right picture.

It is important that we be able to expand broadband coverage to all areas of Scotland, but it is not just a matter of covering rural communities.

I share the concerns that Christine Grahame, Graeme Pearson and Patrick Harvie expressed about the rush to legislate. I am glad that modern Scotland has moved on from the situation 50 years ago, when people who gave the wrong answer when asked in employment interviews what school they went to were immediately shown the door and had no prospect of employment. We have moved on from that but, sadly, even previous members of the Parliament have been threatened with letter bombs. Such hate campaigns and instances of sectarianism are unacceptable and there is agreement in the chamber that, if there is a need to fill a gap in the current legislation, any such legislation should be brought before the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>That said, as Alison McInnes pointed out, complex technical and legal issues are raised by a sectarianism bill that we have, I remind members, yet to see. Despite that, we have been told that the Government expects the bill to be passed by 30 June at the Parliament&#8217;s final meeting before recess. I share Christine Grahame&#8217;s concern that appropriate time for considering the issues is not being allocated either to the chamber or to the Justice Committee.</p><p>Surely one difficulty with the bill is how we will assess crimes in relation to the internet. For example, where is the internet site in question being hosted? How will we track down those who perpetrate internet hate campaigns? A parliamentary committee would play a real role in considering not only such questions, but the actual definitions of sectarianism. After all, on the first Saturday after the bill comes into force, police officers will need to know what the new sectarian crimes are, and how they will enforce the bill&#8217;s provisions. The committee could strengthen the legislation by taking evidence from ACPOS and other appropriate groups, but we are not going to have that opportunity.

That responsibility will be tested soon, when we look at the proposed sectarianism legislation that is to come before the Parliament shortly.</p><p>It is clear that sectarianism is an issue that concerns all in the Parliament and many in communities throughout Scotland. Scotland has moved forward a great deal from the time when some people were barred from taking up employment in certain factories because of the schools that they went to. Modern Scotland has moved on but, sadly, as recent weeks and months have shown, with parcel bombs being sent to leading individuals in public life, sectarianism is still rife in certain groups in our communities. If there are gaps in the legislative process for tackling sectarian abuse and outrages and the hate campaigns that are run on the internet, Labour will be supportive of legislation that the Scottish Government introduces to fill those gaps.</p><p>However, it has become clear that the Government is keen for the legislation that it seeks to introduce to be passed by the end of June. The timetable that has been outlined means that the parliamentary process, from stage 1 to stage 3, would take only a week, when it has usually taken considerably longer in previous sessions of Parliament. Although there will be agreement on the bill&#8217;s policy intent, there are likely to be significant legal and technical issues. Serious questions need to be asked about whether those can be addressed within a week&#8217;s consideration. That is one of the first issues on which the Government will face a test.</p><p>Another key issue in the justice arena is the implications of the Carloway review, which was set up in the aftermath of the emergency legislation that the Parliament passed in relation to the Cadder case. Lord Carloway has set out his interim thoughts, which indicate that central tenets of the Scottish justice system, such as corroboration and the right to remain silent, should now perhaps be up for consideration. That is a key issue that the review, the Government and all the parties will have to consider.</p><p>Linked to the issue of corroboration, there is an opportunity to consider how rape cases are examined. An issue of serious concern across the whole Parliament is that only 10 per cent of complaints of rape are translated into prosecutions and only 4.6 per cent of complaints result in successful prosecutions. I therefore suggest that the law on corroboration needs to be examined to establish whether it would be correct to change it so that we switch the emphasis in favour of the victims of rape, in order to address these distressing statistics.</p><p>Now that we have all left the election campaign and returned to the Parliament, it is important not to forget the voices that we heard when we were on the election trail. One of the areas that I represent&#8212;Blantyre&#8212;sadly experienced eight murders, a number of which were a result of knife attacks, in 18 months. It is important that we do not give up on the victims of crime and that we ensure that they have a voice in this Parliament. It is important that we are not complacent as we go about our business.</p><p>Clearly, the Scottish Government has a major task on its hands over the next five years. The voices that I heard during the election campaign were saying that the priorities for Scotland have to be jobs, standing up for the victims of crime and ensuring that our elderly people have dignity in retirement. I urge the Government to tackle those priorities with the powers that it has in the Parliament over the coming five years.</p>", "hdate": "2011-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the taking Scotland forward debate.

It is a measure of his class as a parliamentarian that, in his final speech to the Parliament, he was so dignified and made so many strong points about the bill that we are discussing and about his attitude to his colleagues. Today marks the end for him of 35 years of public service. I pay tribute to him for that public service as a councillor in Glasgow, as a Glasgow MSP and as convener of the Justice Committee. He has always been a very fair person, although we have had our disagreements. As the Justice Committee convener, he was always very supportive of other committee members and we saw that in his contribution today. I have a great regard for that. It is also right that his Conservative party colleagues have turned out in such numbers for his final contribution, which was fitting indeed.</p><p>I echo the comments that have been made about Robert Brown. If he does not return after the election, it will be a loss to the Parliament and the Liberal Democrats. He has a great deal of experience in justice matters and the constitution. He was a minister for education and he can speak in the Parliament on a breadth of issues. His contribution has been significant during the past 12 years and I wish him all the best for the future.</p><p>I also briefly mention Alasdair Morgan who, as Deputy Presiding Officer, chaired the beginning of the debate and who is standing down. It is significant that I have managed to reach the end of four years in the Parliament and he has never once switched off my microphone.</p><p>I pay tribute to Trish Godman, Deputy Presiding Officer, for the way in which she has handled proceedings. She has always been fair and dignified, but perhaps her choice of outfit today shows her true colours. I wish her all the very best as she heads off to the paradise of her retirement.</p><p>It is right that this session should close on a debate on the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill, about which there is consensus across the parties. We are passing a serious piece of legislation by, as Stewart Maxwell pointed out, putting the 800-year-old principle of double jeopardy into statute. It is right to build on the work of the Scottish Law Commission and, as Lord Gill said, this is a matter of considerable constitutional significance.</p><p>It is also correct that there should be exceptions to the double jeopardy rule and the principal reason for that is that victims and their families must get justice. For someone who has been the victim of a crime or who has lost a family member, there must be no feeling worse than that of not seeing justice done, or seeing someone acquitted when there seems to be evidence against them that could lead to a conviction but which is not allowed by the current law of the land. The main driver for the change must be justice and there is a strong moral argument in favour of that.</p><p>We have reached this point in 2011 because tremendous advances in science and DNA technology mean that a lot more information can be made available to retry cases than was the case 20 or 30 years ago. The bill&#8217;s principles will also allow the law to be applied consistently and with certainty.</p><p>There has been some disquiet in legal circles about the bill&#8217;s principles, but the Parliament has considered those issues carefully through all the stages. In its final form, the bill takes the correct position.</p><p>On tainted acquittals, it is correct that if someone has acted inappropriately to pervert the course of justice, the case should be brought back to court. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service got the right balance in its input into the legislation on tainted acquittals.</p><p>On admissions, there was some debate in the committee evidence sessions about whether it is right to include admissions when the new information is received pre or post acquittals. The weight of the evidence, including from Victim Support Scotland and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, supported taking the new evidence regardless of whether it was pre or post acquittal, and for me that is absolutely correct. It gets the balance right.</p><p>There has been some discussion about the general new-evidence exception and whether it is correct to apply it. Ultimately, as with so much of this debate, when new evidence comes forward we need to consider the impact on the victims and their family. It is correct to introduce the new-evidence exception.</p><p>On the offences to be covered, the Government&#8217;s original approach was to draw up a list. I had some sympathy with that approach, but it was discussed at length in the committee at stage 1 and the committee put forward an alternative. That has been fine-tuned by the Government, so that the cases to which the exceptions apply will be those that have been tried at the High Court. On reflection, I think that that is the correct approach, as it captures the correct number of offences and gives the right amount of flexibility to bring appropriate cases forward.</p><p>There was quite a bit of discussion at committee about whether another case should be brought when a person is assaulted, someone is acquitted of the assault and the victim subsequently dies. Some concerns were expressed about that but, again, I agree with the approach in the bill. Appropriate safeguards have been built in to apply before a new investigation could be started. Such an investigation would clearly bring different aspects of evidence, and prosecutors would have to look closely at them to decide whether to bring forward a case.</p><p>Retrospectivity is one of the key principles of the bill. It is correct that the new evidence exception should be applied retrospectively. Obviously, the advance in DNA technology means that a lot more data can be acquired and brought forward as evidence than previously. We need only to consider cases such as the Dunlop case that Cathie Craigie has quoted in this and previous debates and which lends great weight to the argument that it is correct to apply exceptions retrospectively.</p><p>As there appears to be some time, I will highlight some of the contributions that have been made during the debate.</p><p>The cabinet secretary looked back to the debate on double jeopardy that took place just before the 2007 election. He was right to highlight that there were a lot of important contributions in that debate and that, in many ways, it set the scene for the bill. I was not a member of the Parliament at the time, but I have read the Official Report of that earlier debate and it is interesting to see how the issue has developed through to this closing debate of 2011.</p><p>Robert Brown, Stewart Maxwell and Nigel Don have all spoken about the importance of the Justice Committee and the contributions that it has made. Nigel Don was right to bring out his file&#8212;although it might be said that it is one of the lighter files that we have had over the session. Nigel Don is a great supporter of the Justice Committee. He is always telling us how hard we work to examine things diligently. With his display of the folder, he was showing the large amount of work that produced this much smaller bill. That is not in any way a criticism of the bill&#8212;legislation worded correctly and succinctly is much easier for legislators and lawmakers to interpret. The Justice Committee, along with civil servants and the ministerial team, has made a tremendous contribution to that.</p><p>Cathie Craigie spoke about how opinion has progressed through the years. That is correct. When there is potential for a miscarriage of justice, the internet and 24-hour news mean that there is now a lot more publicity about it, so the concerns of victims are highlighted greatly. That is part of the reason that we have got to the situation that we are in today in passing the bill.</p><p>Like others, I pay tribute not just to the Justice Committee, but to the clerking team, which has given us great back-up and support. That has helped tremendously in enabling the committee to look expertly not only at the bill, but at the other aspects of legislation that have been dealt with in the Parliament.</p><p>This has been an important debate with which to close the session. There have been serious issues to consider and Scottish Labour firmly supports the passing of the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill at stage 3. It is in the interests of justice, it will instil public confidence and it will ensure the consistent application of the law. With that in mind, we will support the bill at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647375", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to close the stage 3 debate on the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.

Rhoda Grant said that at times she wondered whether she would get to the finish line, which I think sums up the hurdles that she has had to overcome on the bill. That she has been able to overcome those hurdles is a tribute to her fortitude. It is fair also to pay tribute to the minister and his team, who worked constructively with her.</p><p>As many members have said, domestic abuse is a blemish on Scottish society. As Fergus Ewing said, the issue has been given focus in the coverage of recent events around old firm games, but domestic abuse happens every day in Scotland, as Richard Baker and Stewart Maxwell said. That should drive us not to be complacent, and it is one of the reasons why legislation is not only appropriate but necessary.</p><p>The bill that will be passed this afternoon will have two practical effects: it will improve access to justice for domestic abuse victims and provide more robust processes for prosecutors. To be specific, section 1, as Bill Butler mentioned, removes the requirement for a course of conduct in relation to non-harassment orders. That will make it easier for victims of domestic abuse to apply for such orders and achieve a more appropriate result. That is why section 1 in particular had the support of the Strathclyde Police domestic abuse co-ordination unit and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.</p><p>Section 3 will make it a criminal offence to breach an interdict with a power of arrest. It is difficult to prove breach of an interdict in a civil context, and the onus is put on the victim. The bill&#8217;s provisions will make the law more robust and should assist victims of domestic abuse.</p><p>Bill Aitken quoted R A Butler, a famous Conservative from the 1950s&#8212;I knew who he was talking about&#8212;who said that politics is</p><p>&#8220;the art of the possible.&#8221;</p><p>Another big political figure from the 1950s, Aneurin Bevan, spoke about the language of priorities being an aspect of politics.

When we look at the proposed budget cuts in England and Wales, it is quite clear that, if we stand still, public safety will be undermined and the ability of the police to carry out their roles effectively under the current structures will be seriously under threat.</p><p>The same principles apply in the fire service. That is why the Fire Brigades Union Scotland has taken a proactive approach to the issue. It represents the rights of firefighters, but it is also close to the interests of public safety and believes that if we are going to have a model that not only protects firefighter and police numbers but delivers public safety, we need to move away from the current structure and consider an alternative.</p><p>It stands to reason that money can be saved by moving away from a structure that involves eight police authorities and eight fire boards. We do not need eight human resources divisions, eight information technology divisions and eight central services departments and all the buildings that house those sections.</p><p>We should also consider fleet management. If we had a central service that managed the procurement of police cars, fire engines and so on throughout Scotland, we could make substantial savings. There are examples of that south of the border, such as in the Metropolitan Police. Obviously, there will be short-term costs involved in setting up the new structures, but it stands to reason that moving from eight organisations to one organisation will enable savings to be made.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats&#8217; argument is that centralisation would result in poor delivery of services and a decline in local accountability. However, I see the move to a single service as being an opportunity to enhance and build on local accountability. For example, there is currently limited opportunity for the community in Cambuslang to liaise with Cambuslang fire station. However, under our new proposal, which seeks to give people a say at ward level, we could introduce a structure to give people the ability to interact more proactively with the police and fire service at local level.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that there is a bit of hypocrisy in the Liberal Democrats&#8217; position.

As other members have done, I congratulate Willie Coffey on securing this debate on the celebration of the Fenwick Weavers Society&#8217;s 250th anniversary. It is right that so many members have not only stayed behind tonight but spoken in the debate so eloquently and articulately.</p><p>The story of the weavers is a fantastic one, and we owe a lot to John Smith and John McFadzean for rediscovering it and doing so much to bring it to life. This is the second debate on the Fenwick weavers in the current session of Parliament. It is a fascinating story and it is right that so many people will gather on Monday to sign the charter and to commemorate the event. As a co-convener of the cross-party group on co-operatives, I certainly look forward to that.</p><p>It is not only the historical significance of the Fenwick event that is important but what the Fenwick Weavers Society was about. As Margaret Mitchell and Cathy Jamieson said, we must remember the values that the weavers espoused and the way in which they went about establishing their organisation 250 years ago. Not only did they contribute to a spirit of bringing the community together, they showed how people should conduct themselves&#8212;what was right and what was wrong. That was developed in their strong sense of the importance of education in the community, not only 250 years ago but in the years following. That was shown by the setting-up of a local library, which was significant because it demonstrated that the Fenwick community thought that it was important not only that people could feed and clothe themselves but that they could be educated to go on and better themselves. There are some excellent examples of that in the Fenwick story.</p><p>Bringing the issue all the way forward to 2011, the importance of co-operatives today and the extent to which they are important to communities show how much we owe to the forebears of the co-operative tradition who lived 250 years ago.</p><p>At the weekend, I attended an event at the West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative in my constituency, which involved the opening of a new sports pitch. I should say that, as the dignitaries waited to open the pitch, the young kids were dying to get on to the park, which was great to see. That housing co-op has been able to improve the housing stock and branch out into other areas. It is the first technology co-operative in the UK, and it has improved the sporting facilities. That shows us what co-operatives can achieve and how they can benefit the community.</p><p>It is right to celebrate what happened in Fenwick 250 years ago, but we should also use this debate as a platform to re-emphasise the co-operative movement&#8217;s message and take it forward.</p><p>It is also right to draw attention to the fact that this debate marks Cathy Jamieson&#8217;s final contribution in this chamber. She has been an excellent MSP and a minister over the past 12 years and has contributed superbly to the development of this Parliament. It is only fair also to point out the contribution that Christopher Harvie has made. I have always enjoyed his unique historical insights, which we heard again tonight. I thank him for that.</p><p>I congratulate Willie Coffey again, and I congratulate those in Fenwick who have been at the heart of the 250th anniversary events.

I pay particular tribute to Hugh Henry, the committee&#8217;s convener. The committee&#8217;s work was recognised at the Scottish politician of the year awards; the award that it received was richly deserved. The committee does important work.</p><p>I disagree completely with the tenor of Anne McLaughlin&#8217;s remarks. The committee has not limited itself to scrutinising aspects of the Government&#8217;s work over the past four years; plenty of the reports that come before it make comparisons with what happened in previous years. The cabinet secretary referred to capital projects. The committee was complimentary about the improvements that have been made to monitor and measure such projects.</p><p>The key themes are governance, transparency and accountability, and they are brought out in a number of the committee&#8217;s reports. The First ScotRail franchise report highlighted serious concerns about the lack of a documented business case on whether the franchise should be extended. It was a case of government by PowerPoint. The information may have been available in different files and sources. However, when in my previous life as an internal auditor I asked an organisation to provide a business case, I expected to see it in a file, properly documented. We did not get that in this case.</p><p>Astonishingly, it transpired that Guy Houston, the previous finance director of Transport Scotland, held shares in FirstGroup at the time that discussions were taking place about whether to extend the franchise. Not only was that quite staggering, but it was difficult for the committee to establish whether Mr Houston was involved in any of the discussions about extending the franchise. Initially, the committee was told that he was not, but it transpired that he attended meetings relating to the issue. To me, that showed that there were some difficulties with the civil servant. Hugh Henry was right to take a robust approach with the permanent secretary. It is important that, when a civil servant appears before a parliamentary committee that is scrutinising aspects of work, they realise that they must be open and transparent and must take the committee seriously. It is unacceptable for civil servants to be, at best, inconsistent in some of their explanations.</p><p>The examination of the First ScotRail franchise report raised a number of key issues, some of which fed into the committee&#8217;s work on The Gathering 2009 Ltd, which Jamie McGrigor has highlighted. The Government gave a loan of &#163;180,000 to the company. The lack of robust checks and due diligence around The Gathering 2009 Ltd raised concerns about what was involved in passing over the loan. Those were compounded by the fact that the Government did not join the steering committee and did not pass on to it information that the loan had been made. In fact, the First Minister admitted to the committee that that approach was not correct. In addition, the steering committee lacked accurate and up-to-date financial information to examine, which led to some of the problems. The people who suffered at the end of the day were the creditors, because they were left in the dark about what discussions were taking place.</p><p>On capital projects, as I said earlier, I recognise that some improvements have been made in measuring up-to-date information, which is important, as Nicol Stephen said. However, the revenue consequences of capital spend are also important. A recent Audit Scotland report highlighted that in forecasting future spend there are difficulties in establishing future revenue because of factors such as depreciation, so that issue must be looked at.</p><p>This debate has been worth while. There are lessons to be learned around accountability and transparency.

When there are wrongful deaths&#8212;for example, in accidents at the workplace&#8212;it is very stressful for the families who are left behind. That stress is compounded if the legal process is lengthy, with contentious issues being fought out in the courts by both sides. As Bill Butler said, the purpose of the bill is to create a cohesive and modern approach to achieving settlements. I believe that the bill will substantially improve the current situation: it will give greater clarity; it will reduce the time required; and it will mean less stress for the relatives. People will receive compensation more quickly, which will allow them to move forward, regain an element of stability and try to rebuild their lives.</p><p>During this stage 3 debate, members have drawn to our attention two main issues that have changed since our stage 1 discussions. First, there is the 25 per cent deduction for living expenses&#8212;and the corollary of that, which is the 75 per cent available for family support. At stage 3, that has become the default position, which will change only if the settlement is &#8220;manifestly and materially unfair&#8221;. The Parliament must be clear that that will apply only in exceptional cases, and I am glad that so many speakers in the debate have pointed that out.</p><p>A similar principle applies in relation to spousal disregard. The minister again made the position absolutely clear: he said specifically that it would be in only truly exceptional cases that the default of spousal disregard would not be followed&#8212;that is, only when something was &#8220;manifestly and materially unfair&#8221;. It is clear that the Parliament speaks with one voice on those issues, giving a clear signal to the courts.</p><p>In politics, it is important to make a difference.

Blantyre is another strong mining community and it is important to recognise the work in the mines and the events that shaped such communities. In 1877, Blantyre had a pit disaster in which almost 200 people died. It brought the community together, and we can still see that in the Blantyre community today. It is important to support the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and the funding that it makes available in areas such as Blantyre because we have to have a sense of community and of people sticking together. That is not only important for the generation of employment, it is important to help to reduce crime and to contribute to the well being of the area.</p><p>There is a strong industrial heritage in the area that I represent. The mines are long gone, although there is still a steel works. The strong manufacturing base that existed in Cambuslang and Rutherglen was attacked and undermined at the advent of the Thatcher Government in 1979, which pursued the policy of worshipping at the altar of Milton Friedman and controlling the money supply rather than supporting communities such as Cambuslang and Rutherglen. Many still remember when the steel works were closed, and there are people who worked there who never worked again. That is the legacy of the Thatcher years. Sadly, as John Park pointed out in his speech, there are generations of people who have not worked since.

However, that has not been without difficulties, and&#8212;sadly&#8212;that remains the case in 2011.</p><p>The media are partly to blame.

The points that the committee makes about public awareness are important not just for the Parliament but for the media and wider society to take forward.</p><p>We must continue to reinforce the message of fair treatment for migrants. It is sad that too many employers do not give migrant workers appropriate contracts.

I thank the Justice Committee clerks and everyone who gave evidence to the committee and contributed to its detailed report.</p><p>There is no doubt that the issue is serious, so it is right that the committee gave it serious and detailed consideration. There is much agreement on the matter, but we owe it to the Parliament and to the public to show that we are considering the issues appropriately. As Stewart Stevenson said, double jeopardy is an 800-year-old principle. The Scottish Law Commission took the issue forward in its report, having given it appropriate consideration, as John Lamont said. It is correct that the principle of double jeopardy be codified in law. As Lord Gill said, it is a matter of considerable constitutional significance that in 2011 we begin the process of establishing in statute a principle that has been around for 800 years.</p><p>Much of the debate has centred on the exceptions to the double jeopardy rule and why they should be made. As many members said, it is right that we consider the experience of victims and their families. There can be no worse experience than the tragic loss of a loved one in a violent incident, and the inability to see justice done must eat away at families every day.</p><p>We must ensure that only the right cases are taken forward. The delivery of justice must be paramount. We can look to examples in England and Wales. Many members mentioned the Mark Weston case, which shows that justice can be achieved by introducing exceptions to the double jeopardy principle and lends a strong moral case for what the bill is trying to achieve. We can also learn from what has happened internationally.</p><p>Bill Aitken talked about how DNA analysis and other scientific techniques have greatly improved, which lends tremendous weight to the argument for giving further consideration to cases in which a person was cleared but there is new evidence.</p><p>Also on the subject of modern technology, we live in the information age and people are much more aware of cases in which there has potentially been a miscarriage of justice. It is not just about people who might have been wrongly cleared; DNA evidence can be used to clear the names of people who have been wrongly convicted. The public&#8217;s greater awareness of such cases lends greater weight to the need to consider the bill and take it forward.</p><p>Important legal principles of consistency and certainty are at the heart of the bill. The committee was right to support the approach in section 2, on tainted acquittals, which deals with situations in which a result was achieved by perverting the course of justice. As the committee&#8217;s convener, Bill Aitken, said in his opening speech, the Scottish Human Rights Commission and the Law Society of Scotland questioned the application of the provision to all offences, but I agree with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service that the bill strikes the right balance. It is right that we revisit trials in which witnesses were intimidated or jury members were unduly influenced, so that justice is done.</p><p>Section 3 is on admissions made or becoming known after acquittal and the committee had to consider whether the provision should apply to pre-acquittal and post-acquittal admissions. Some witnesses thought that it should apply only to post-acquittal admissions. However, Victim Support Scotland gave powerful evidence on the matter and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland said that section 3 will help to deliver public confidence in the Justice Committee&#8212;I meant the justice system; I assure Bill Aitken that we always have confidence in the Justice Committee. ACPOS made a valid point.</p><p>Members talked about the standard of proof and I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s acknowledgement that the bar might be raised and the approaches in sections 3 and 4 made more consistent. That might help to address the fears about section 3 that were expressed in evidence.</p><p>The new-evidence exception in section 4 is in the public interest. New techniques such as DNA analysis will supply new evidence.</p><p>There has been much discussion this morning of the list of offences to which the new-evidence exception should apply. The Scottish Law Commission stated in its report that the provision should apply only to murder and rape. The Government was right to extend the list of crimes in the bill to cover more serious offences such as war crimes and certain sexual offences.</p><p>There has been a certain amount of debate this morning about whether a list is appropriate, or whether the provision should apply simply to cases that have been tried on indictment or in the High Court. There has been a lot of support for that argument, but I see some attraction in having a list of offences. A list is quite transparent, so the public can see the offences to which the retrial provision would potentially apply.</p><p>Introducing an alternative system would potentially open the way for the provision to apply to other cases, and the public might think that it would not apply in certain cases.

He murdered Cassandra McDermott in 2001 and was found not guilty in 2002, but the case was subsequently retried in 2009.

The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth spoke about the importance of promoting economic growth, as he does in every budget speech, but let us take the retail tax as an example. That tax will result in the business rates bill for a supermarket in my constituency that employs 500 people rising by a third, to &#163;1 million, and potentially undermining the security of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s jobs in that supermarket.</p><p>Duncan McNeil mentioned the cuts in regeneration in Greenock. Those cuts are not an isolated example. The Clyde gateway, which covers my area of Rutherglen and Cambuslang and the east end of Glasgow, faces cuts of 46 per cent. SNP ministers have backtracked on promises to the Clyde gateway and that is threatening to undermine the 2014 Commonwealth games legacy for Cambuslang and Rutherglen and the surrounding area. In light of the way in which the SNP has tackled the budget, it is little wonder that the relationship with business that Jim Mather worked hard to build up before 2007 has melted away in recent times.</p><p>The SNP promotes a safer Scotland, but there is a &#163;40 million black hole in the policing budget. That is not my assertion; it was made by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland. The SNP has made great play of maintaining police officer numbers, but the reality that police authorities face is that, in order to deliver that aim, they have the task of cutting back on support staff. The SNP has failed to deal with the challenge of how to deploy police resources effectively. When the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, appeared before the Justice Committee, he was not interested in a discussion about how to construct front-line police officer services and set up support staff to back them up. We are used to hearing him say that that is an operational matter.</p><p>The reality is that front-line police officers will be taken off the beat to backfill the work of support staff as those staff are taken away from their positions, some through the threat of redundancy. That will mean that police officers will be taken away from crime hotspots and moved back to the filing cabinets in police stations, which will undermine public safety and get a round of applause from Scotland&#8217;s criminals. That is not a first for the SNP.</p><p>As we move towards 1 February and the introduction of a presumption against short-term sentences of three months, concern continues to grow not just about the policy, but about its budgeting aspects. It is not just that under the current legislative plans 6,000 criminals who would go to jail will brandish their SNP get-out-jail-free cards and make their way on to Scotland&#8217;s streets. Shirley-Anne Somerville spoke about how the budget protects funding programmes for victims of domestic abuse, but she did not speak about the fact that, under the plans, 50 per cent of those who would currently be found guilty of domestic abuse and would go to jail will not do so. Moreover, those plans will require thousands of additional community service orders to be created. The SNP has not provided additional money for that. It has cut the budget for community justice authorities by 1.3 per cent in real terms, which leaves another multimillion-pound black hole in the SNP budget.</p><p>When the SNP is challenged on those issues&#8212;Kenny MacAskill was challenged on the police officer support staff mix in the Justice Committee, for example&#8212;it does not want to engage or interact. It says that that is someone else&#8217;s problem.</p><p>The SNP is falling short in meeting the challenges on many fronts.

We have technology that enables people to communicate with the other side of the world, and we have the internet, which is great for our young children who are learning in schools. However, as Cathie Craigie pointed out, there has been a widespread problem with domestic abuse throughout history and, sadly, as we get into the 21st century, the problem still exists. Although there has been a small decrease in incidents of domestic abuse in the past year, which is welcome, there were still more than 51,000 cases. As Bill Butler pointed out, many cases go unreported. As the minister said, that is a stain on modern Scotland and the Parliament has a duty to act on it.</p><p>The bill contains some important elements that can make a difference and will give some respite to victims of domestic abuse. In particular, section 1 will remove the requirement to show a course of conduct before a non-harassment order can be granted by either a civil or a criminal court. As Rhoda Grant said to the committee, domestic abuse is difficult to prove. It is often committed at home, so there is no corroboration. If the requirement to show a course of conduct remains, many victims will suffer.</p><p>Also important is section 3, which will make it a criminal offence to breach an interdict. The bill also addresses a shortfall, in that the common-law interdicts are difficult to prove. As Bill Aitken pointed out, there is low uptake of them. The bill will, therefore, address a current gap.</p><p>On section 4, the committee heard much evidence about the definition. In her opening speech, Rhoda Grant said that she continues to wrestle with the issue. There is no doubt that, if we can arrive at a proper definition, that will make things easier for lawmakers, better for victims who are trying to progress their cases and better for the accused, who will have more of an understanding of what they are being taken to court in relation to.</p><p>Many members have spoken about section 2, which deals with the removal of means testing with regard to claims involving domestic abuse cases. I believe that the section, as drafted by Rhoda Grant, is well intentioned. I know that Rhoda Grant intends to continue talks with the minister on the issue, and I hope that some means can be found to address the concerns that have been raised by the committee.</p><p>As Nigel Don said, we have a duty to examine areas in which legislation is currently ineffective, and there are some quite clear gaps around domestic abuse. The passing of the major parts of the bill will make a difference. It will send a signal to the perpetrators of domestic abuse that their behaviour is unacceptable.</p><p>I urge the Parliament to support the general principles of the bill at 5 o&#8217;clock this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642717", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I pay tribute to Rhoda Grant for the amount of work that she has put in while getting the bill to this stage and for the work that she has done in Parliament in recent years to highlight domestic abuse.

They are both visually impaired, but that does not stop them being active members not only of the cross-party group, but of many community and trade union groups and campaigns. We should hold them up as a shining example to us all.</p><p>There is no doubt that we all take eyesight for granted. As we get near Christmas time, people, particularly those with young families, enjoy the time with young children. However, imagine if we were robbed of our eyesight and were not able to see the pleasure on the children's faces when they open their presents on Christmas morning. We take eyesight for granted. Thinking about the potential loss of eyesight demonstrates how important the work is on issues such as age-related macular degeneration.</p><p>As Robert Brown says, the condition accounts for half of registered blindness. As the age profile of the population is changing, there is potential for the problem to affect more people. The debate has focused on what the NHS can do and, as with many such debates, it is set against the background of budget reductions. However, a clear case can be made for appropriate treatment of the condition to be provided. As Nanette Milne said, early diagnosis and intervention are key. If health boards are geared up to diagnose the condition at an early stage, there is an opportunity to treat it and to introduce appropriate improvements.</p><p>Consistency among NHS boards is important, particularly when costs are an issue. To be honest, I am not aware of examples of good practice in NHS boards throughout Scotland, but they must exist, and that good practice could be rolled out to other boards that are perhaps not as proactive. As Robert Brown demonstrated through the statistics that he quoted, if we can give people quality eyesight for longer, they can make more of a contribution to the economy and we can give them the appropriate quality of life.

Companies would employ consultants, who would write up an approach and fill the pages and then hand over the bill at the end of the day.

That is perhaps why politicians found it difficult to design a solution that satisfied everyone. Many people in Scotland give up a great deal of time to support the system and to support children.

It is right that we should be aware of the ECHR and ensure that the rights that it ascribes to people are given an appropriate place in Scotland. However, as Karen Whitefield said, it is important that we remember the welfare of the child in the process. We do not want the process to become overburdened and intimidatory to children.

We are moving from a system of 32 children's hearings panels to having a national panel. Many of those who participate in local panels throughout Scotland have a great deal of local knowledge and expertise and identify with their local panels. Let us hope that the new training system that has been put in place will reassure those panel members and ensure that they stay with the new arrangement that is to be established on a national basis.</p><p>As Liz Smith said, it is clear that the bill will be passed this evening, but Parliament still has a watching brief.

I congratulate him on securing this evening's debate, in which he highlights an important issue.</p><p>In reading the briefing for the debate, I was interested in the various statistics on people with communication difficulties. I had not realised the extent of the problem. Willie Coffey mentioned the statistic that 60 per cent of young offenders suffer from communication difficulties. One study shows that almost 70 per cent of young offenders in Polmont have literacy and numeracy problems. Those statistics are worrying. When we consider the problem, we can see why there is a link from it to reoffending. If people have communication difficulties, they will find it more difficult to interact with the environment around them. Obviously, if they are in prison, that is a hostile environment, which probably causes the situation to spiral. Interaction with the criminal justice system can be complicated for capable people, but people who have communication difficulties will feel more and more disfranchised. We can therefore understand why people reoffend when they leave the system.</p><p>Although we have had strong debates in recent months on sentencing policy, one issue on which all members agree is that the rates of reoffending are too high and we want to bring them down. Willie Coffey has identified an area in which there is potential to make progress on that. As he clearly outlined, there are budget constraints. In the coming months, the Government and all members will be lobbied strenuously by current recipients of budget amounts, who will make a case for why they should continue to receive funding. The clear point that they will have to demonstrate is that there are outcomes from the money that they receive. Willie Coffey has been able to demonstrate that there could be a case for <place-holder colnum=\"29841\"/> investment in tackling the issues that he raises, which would reduce reoffending rates.</p><p>We need to assess properly the extent of the problem so that we can get an evidence base. We have some research, but we need more. We need research on the effects of the current programmes that operate at Polmont and Cornton Vale to find out whether it can be demonstrated that, after participation in such programmes, people are less likely to reoffend.</p><p>Willie Coffey has highlighted an interesting issue to the Parliament. If the Government and other parties consider the issue and give it the correct treatment, we might be able to address communication support needs in the prison and judicial systems and, I hope, to prevent some of the current entrants into that system from reoffending.

The bill introduces procedures to deal with that and sets a 21-day limit, which will, I hope, put a cap on any challenges that emerge under those provisions.</p><p>The issue of finality and certainty, which was cited in the judgment and which we discussed earlier, had to be addressed; it could not have been left aside. As such, the provisions under section 7 of the bill are relevant.</p><p>I remain concerned, as I said earlier, about the costs of the legislation. The financial memorandum states that there will be costs of &#163;30 million. A police summit took place earlier in the week that was attended by the cabinet secretary and other justice spokespersons. A direct consequence of the legislation would be &#163;20 million of police costs, which would have an implication for front-line policing. The Government must carry out an impact assessment on that.</p><p>It is welcome that the judgment was not retrospective, and there has been some debate about how many live cases the Government is potentially exposed on. It is hoped that the provisions that we will progress today will limit the number of cases that can be challenged.</p><p>We will engage constructively with the work that Lord Carloway will undertake, because it is absolutely key. It will examine some central features of Scottish law, such as corroboration, and will provide an opportunity to review the bill that will be passed today and to assess any changes that may be required. That will, we hope, give some comfort to members who have reservations.</p><p>I emphasise that Labour supports the bill at stage 3. We have engaged constructively with the Government; SNP back benchers who lined up to attack the Labour Party in their speeches should perhaps remember that. We have put a certain element of trust in the Government, so we will look closely at how the provisions work in practice and bring forward changes in the future if they are required.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21037334", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Procedure (Legal Assistance, Detention and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is no doubt that this has been a long and, at times, difficult afternoon, but the process has been absolutely necessary.

I am too young to remember that, although I have seen the black and white photographs.</p><p>In more recent times&#8212;this week in fact&#8212;a Scot, Colin Montgomerie, led the European Ryder cup team to victory over the USA in a nail-biting contest. To date, we have six medallists in the <place-holder colnum=\"29525\"/> Commonwealth games, including Robbie Renwick, who has won a gold medal in the 200m freestyle swimming. With silvers, we have the women's cycling sprint team and the 4x200m freestyle swimming team. On bronze, we have David Carry in 400m freestyle swimming, Lauren Smith in synchronised swimming and Jennifer McIntosh and Kay Copland for the 50m rifle shooting. I am sure that I speak for Parliament in congratulating all the medallists to date and in wishing all the competitors all the best in future events. Let us hope that they can bring home a strong haul of medals for Scotland from the games.</p><p>Those medallists will no doubt give heart to the many people who participate in sport throughout our communities and the 900,000 members of sports clubs who participate vigorously and who are supported by volunteers, all the way from Cambuslang to Carnoustie and from Dumfries to Dundee. I pay tribute to the many coaches. In my time as a member of Cambuslang Harriers, I was ably coached by people including Jim Cunningham and Robert Anderson, who gave willingly of their free time. I compliment the many members of the Rutherglen and Cambuslang sports council, who do so much to promote sport in my constituency.</p><p>In the coming years there will be big events and opportunities for Scotland in the Ryder cup and the 2014 Commonwealth games. From an economic point of view, the recent open golf championship was worth &#163;80 million to Scotland and it is reckoned that the Ryder cup in 2014 will be worth &#163;100 million. It is also reckoned that, in the three years after the 2014 Commonwealth games, tourism will increase by 4 per cent, which will obviously bring much-needed revenue to the country. Key to the build-up to the Commonwealth games is the hope that participation in sport will increase, as that affects some of the other issues that we discuss in the Parliament.</p><p>It is often said that sport and politics do not mix, but never could a saying be more untrue than that one in the current times when we face tightening budgets and a difficult financial situation. Rightly, across all budget areas, all the spend has to be justified, but there is a fear that those who think of sport as a leisure activity and a bit of a luxury will believe that it could be an easy area in which to cut spending. That would be short sighted. There are strong arguments that investment in sport is crucial and could bring big dividends in some of the other areas for which the Parliament is responsible.</p><p>There is no doubt that a fitter and healthier nation will boost our economy. It is reckoned that if people are healthy, fit and active it improves their work performance by 5 per cent and that they <place-holder colnum=\"29526\"/> have 27 per cent fewer sick days. We know from the recent obesity statistics that 1 million adults and 150,000 children in Scotland are categorised as obese. Think about it: there are more people in Scotland who are obese than there are members of sports clubs. If we can get those who are obese to participate in sport and join sports clubs, that will drive down the &#163;6 million that we have to spend in the national health service purely on equipment for obese patients.</p><p>Some 25 per cent of all Scots will suffer mental health problems at some time in their life. A lot of the work that the Scottish Association for Mental Health does highlights the benefits of driving that figure down.</p><p>In the justice arena, there is an excellent example in Lothian and Borders, where a street rugby programme has driven down the number of calls that are registered with police: the number of calls on a Friday night is now down to the number that there are during the week.</p><p>All that shows that if we can get more people to participate in sport, it will help us in the other areas for which we are responsible in this Parliament and will, I hope, help us get more value for money out of our budget.</p><p>We should celebrate the successes that we have as a sporting nation. We should praise our communities who participate in sport, but we should also understand the benefits of investment in sport in the hard times ahead. We should not just celebrate the sporting triumphs, but celebrate a country where sport is seen as a contributor to a healthier and economically more successful nation.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21007025", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members are suggesting memories of their own from a sedentary position.

That has helped us to reach where we are.</p><p>The big issue that divided us in the Parliament&#8212;although I am sure that we will not be divided at decision time&#8212;was ownership. It is recognised that the Government has moved from its original position of allowing 100 per cent ownership of ABSs by others to 51 per cent ownership by regulated professionals and 49 per cent by others. Other members, including my colleague Richard Baker and Robert Brown, have promoted other positions and advanced the arguments articulately. However, as Bill Butler said, we are democrats and we need to accept the will of Parliament. The Labour Party will support the bill at decision time. It is recognised that the Government has moved from allowing 100 per cent ABS ownership by others and tried to address the concerns of lawyers and individuals throughout communities in Scotland.</p><p>I also recognise the move that has been made to enhance the role of the Lord President. One of the early concerns was that the bill vested too much power in the hands of ministers. The enhanced role for the Lord President in the bill will ensure that there is a counterbalance, which I am sure will help Government ministers, whether the current team or another that is elected in future.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the number of regulators has been limited to three. I agree with Robert Brown, who said earlier that there is the potential for too much complexity. We do not want to be overburdened with regulators, which could make the system too cumbersome and not effective for good market processes.</p><p>I support the fact that the arrangements around the guarantee fund have been resolved. There will be a guarantee fund administered by the Law Society, but there will also be the option of a compensation fund for other regulators that enter the field. That will address some of the concerns. The guarantee fund, which provides guarantees to customers who suffer wrongdoing at the hands of unscrupulous solicitors, is held in high esteem in the Scottish legal system.<place-holder colnum=\"29352\"/></p><p>I agree with the points that my colleague Cathie Craigie made about citizens advice bureaux and unemployed workers centres being able to take on solicitors. That is a positive aspect of the bill. She managed to mention the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth unemployed workers centre for the second week in a row, for which she is to be commended. That shows what a doughty fighter she is for her constituency, which I am sure will lead to her re-election next May.</p><p>One concern that I have raised throughout the process relates to the financial memorandum&#8212;I see the minister smiling. The sums in the financial memorandum, of &#163;37,000 for the approval of regulators and &#163;29,000 for monitoring, are not really adequate. At one point, someone pointed out&#8212;I do not know whether it was the minister&#8212;that, on the Legal Services Bill in England, the &#163;6 million for regulation was like an overpriced Rolls-Royce. It seems to me that we have a 1970s Hillman Imp for our regulation and monitoring, which is not adequate.</p><p>Where does the process leave us? Let us hope that as we move forward, legal firms throughout Scotland will be able to take advantage of the bill in order to grow, enhance their services, build the Scottish economy, create jobs throughout Scotland and enhance the role of Scottish legal firms on the international stage. Let us also hope that we will deliver an enhanced service and access to justice for legal services customers throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Services (Scotland) (Bill)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "So much so that when Bill Aitken moved amendment 141, to allow associate membership of the Law Society, I was tempted to support it on the basis that I could join up and join in.

In England and Wales, where there has been reform, the establishment of the dedicated Tribunals Service has brought advantages in the provision of information to tribunal users, better and more specialised management of tribunals, publication of the documents that are used in tribunals, and the provision of schedules, so that the process is more transparent and people are aware of how it works.</p><p>Many members have spoken about the five options that the AJSG has brought forward, which have been well covered during the debate.

Obviously, that is particularly relevant as we move forward to a financial situation in which money will be tight and the challenge will be to identify areas in all budgets, not only the justice budget, in which money can be saved. The proposal is a potential winner, in that it is a way to save money and produce a more effective service.</p><p>Robert Brown made a valid point about the children's hearings system. I understand that the system is not covered by the tribunals process, but it is relevant in the sense that our children's hearings panels have operated very effectively&#8212;Mike Pringle told us that, unfortunately, there are 43,000 children's hearings each year&#8212;and the Scottish system is seen by many as the jewel in the crown. I know that the system is under review, but as we move forward we do not want to change things that operate in a satisfactory manner; we need to bear that in mind.</p><p>Dave Thompson made valid points about how complaints are initiated and how we need to make the process more user friendly. Many people who come into contact with the tribunal system find it to be a minefield. They find it very difficult and it is incumbent upon us to make the process more user friendly.</p><p>Cathie Craigie, in an excellent speech, highlighted the work of the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth unemployed workers centre and how it gives a voice to those who need to use tribunals.

There is an element of crossover between the work that is taking place on tribunals and that review.

It is completely untrue that we are anti-Dundee.</p><p>Option two will enable us to retain more local expertise, to maximise service delivery and to make the most of efficiencies, as Ken Macintosh said. In February, Strathclyde police authority indicated that it had issues with cases coming from Dumfries and Galloway and that it was unable to address the resulting backlog of work, which had to be diverted to Edinburgh. There are efficiency issues that need to be addressed to enable us to maximise our handling of demand.</p><p>Like other members, I think that there are weaknesses in the other options. I point out to the cabinet secretary that option two represents a saving of &#163;5.663 million. Maureen Watt was correct when she said that we must look not just at the bottom-line numbers but at the effect that each option would have on the service that is delivered.</p><p>There are obvious weaknesses in options three and four, in particular. There is the issue of relocation of staff. Linked to that is the issue of losing key staff members. Anyone who has looked at organisations in the public or private sector will know that they operate well when they build up staff expertise over a number of years. It is one thing to have a lot of qualifications, but nothing can beat experience. If we close some existing labs, we will lose some of the available expertise and experience, which will undermine the effectiveness of forensic services in Scotland.</p><p>Options three and four fail to take into account the need for local analysis in turning around urgent casework.

I recognise that, on the issue of drug misuse, there is a great deal that unites us across the chamber. I look forward to a constructive debate. There may be differences on some issues, but I believe that MSPs and parties are united in wishing to tackle drug misuse in Scotland's communities.</p><p>There is no doubt that \"The Road to Recovery\" is a step in the right direction, and we all welcome the fact that the recent drugs deaths statistics show a drop of 29 from the previous year. That is welcome, but the number of deaths, at 545, remains too high and the overall trend continues upwards. There is a great deal to be concerned about with regard to drug misuse in Scotland. Adult experience of drugs has risen from 18 per cent in 1993 to 33.5 per cent in 2009. Recent statistics show that nearly a quarter of 18 to 24-year-olds have taken illegal drugs. There is therefore no room for complacency on this issue.</p><p>There is also an underlying issue with hard drugs. Of the 545 drugs deaths, 322 related to morphine and heroin. In recent weeks, the Glasgow <em>Evening Times </em>has been running a feature on the extent of heroin use in Glasgow and the west of Scotland over the past 30 years, in which we read about the experience of those who have had to live with drug misuse. In reading some of the letters to the newspaper, we can sense the frustration people feel that the drug still blights the city and the west of Scotland.</p><p>We must be very concerned about the supply of drugs, particularly given that, per capita, Scotland is the highest user of cocaine and the fifth-highest user of heroin. A recent \"Newsnight\" investigation highlighted the fact that 99 per cent of the supply of heroin is from Afghanistan. It is important that there is a link between \"The Road to Recovery\" and \"Letting Our Communities Flourish: A Strategy <place-holder colnum=\"28527\"/> for Tackling Serious Organised Crime in Scotland\". The Government is doing some work to learn lessons from drugs squads in Holland, but there must be more co-ordination and a detailed implementation plan for tackling the supply of drugs.</p><p>The issue of drugs in prisons is also a cause for major concern. Unfortunately, many who enter the prison system do so as drug users. Statistics from 2008 showed that, of those leaving prison, 26 per cent tested positive for drugs. That shows that people are still using drugs once they are in the prison system and that drugs are available in prisons. In 2009, there were only 1,705 drugs finds in prisons, so there is a great deal to be done to tackle drug use in prisons. We want not only to eradicate drug misuse in prisons but to ensure stability in prisoners' lives as they try to return to normal society.</p><p>Sadly, when many prisoners leave the system, the first person they meet is a drug dealer who is only too happy to peddle them back into lives of misery. If we can clean up more prisoners within the system, we will have a better chance of ensuring that they have more stability in life and of steering them away from drugs.</p><p>Like the minister, I pay tribute to the job that the police and front-line workers do in tackling drugs misuse and tracking down drug dealers who inflict misery on our communities. My constituents feel great frustration when they know that a drug dealer is operating in their close and that people are turning up regularly to purchase drugs. From speaking to the police and constituents, I also know how they feel lifted when the police are able to track down and bust drugs users. It sends out a strong message to communities that such activities are unacceptable and lets citizens know that they do not stand alone. It is important that we reinforce our support for the police in those activities.</p><p>I think that we all agree that the focus on the treatment of drug users is proper. I have a lot of sympathy for the points that the Liberal Democrat amendment makes on drug treatment and testing orders. It is a matter of concern that, in recent years, their use has fallen from 696 to 601. A lot can be done through such orders to move people away from drugs. I understand that a pilot of DTTO IIs has been undertaken. It is important that we learn the lessons of that pilot and consider how effective a Scotland-wide roll-out of the new orders would be.</p><p>I also indicate my support for the importance of early intervention in young people's lives to give them some stability. Sadly, between 40,000 and 60,000 children in Scotland have a drug-using parent and between 10,000 and 20,000 of those children live with that parent. That will clearly have <place-holder colnum=\"28528\"/> a major impact on young children under the age of five, so there is a clear role for early intervention in that situation. There was an important conference on that at the weekend.</p><p>I also know from discussions that my colleagues and I have had with the WAVE Trust that a key project has been carried out in Croydon in England, which is worth examining. Obviously, as we enter a spending review period in which money will be tight, such projects will face big challenges in demonstrating that investment in such programmes not only has an impact on people's lives but saves money across different budget areas. If we can introduce more stability into people's lives at an early age, they will contribute to the economy through full employment and will not place such a strain on the health service or the justice system. There is a lot to be said for early intervention.</p><p>It is important that we support projects that do all that they can to tackle drug use. Earlier in the year, I visited the Alternatives West Dunbartonshire CDS project in Dumbarton. It is important that such projects are not unduly cut in the coming spending review period. They will have to demonstrate their value, and I know from discussions that I have had with organisations such as the Princess Royal Trust for Carers that they understand that point. They have a positive contribution to make.</p><p>I welcome the minister's remarks and the work that has been done. There is still a lot to do; we cannot be complacent. Drugs have blighted too many lives and dealers still rule the roost in too many communities. \"The Road to Recovery\" is a step in the right direction, but we must continue the fight, defeat the dealers and clean up Scotland's communities.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-6978.2, to leave out from \"welcomes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"acknowledges the serious problems with drug misuse still blighting too many communities; recognises that, despite the small reduction in drug-related deaths in the last year, significant challenges remain in achieving a further reduction; is concerned about recent funding cuts to voluntary sector organisations and the impact that this could have on services; notes the high number of prison inmates abusing drugs, and urges the Scottish Government and Scottish Prison Service to do more to stop illegal drugs entering prisons.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20995658", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.

The bill is complex and technical and, as Robert Brown said, we must pay tribute to those who make sense of our policy intentions and turn them into amendments.</p><p>It has been a long day of debates and we have covered a lot of issues, but the decision comes down to short-term sentences and knife crime. We do not support the policy of a presumption against short-term sentences. Sixty-eight per cent of those who are found guilty of domestic abuse are serving sentences of three months or less; others are serving such sentences for crimes such as indecent assault and robbery. To me, it stands to reason that the correct place for such individuals is to serve time in prison. Some members have argued with that by saying that reoffending rates have gone up. I will not run away from that issue; I have spoken about it consistently throughout the process. However, I do not accept that, because there is an issue with reoffending rates, we should just release difficult prisoners into the community. That is illogical.</p><p>The challenge is for all political parties to come up with a policy programme that makes prison work and ensures that we work with prisoners, particularly in the final days of their sentences, to try to transfer them into the community with some stability. The Wise Group in Glasgow has had some success in that, and 19 per cent of those in the group that it has been working with have been <place-holder colnum=\"27992\"/> able to go on to stable employment, compared with 6 per cent of those who have been on the normal Scottish Prison Service scheme. We should be looking towards such schemes.</p><p>As I have said throughout, the presumption against short-term sentences is the wrong policy. I also do not believe that the correct amount of finance has been put behind it, and real problems could lie ahead if there is no additional money to support the policy intention.</p><p>Today's other major issue was knife crime. The cabinet secretary spoke at length about crime statistics, indicating that homicide rates had fallen, and I understand all that. However, it is quite clear that, over a period of time, knife crime continues to rise in Scotland. Last year, 58 per cent of homicides involved knife crime, and over a 20-year period from 1982 to 2002, during which homicides rose by 83 per cent, homicides by knife rose by 164 per cent.</p><p>We heard earlier about the costs to the national health service associated with knife crime. <em>The Sunday Times</em> indicated that there are costs of &#163;500 million as a result of 1,170 admissions, but that figure has risen&#8212;as Iain Gray revealed yesterday, last year there were 1,857 admissions to national health service hospitals as a result of knife incidents. Clearly, that puts a great deal of pressure on NHS finances. The violence reduction unit has acknowledged that and the cost of violence in general. There is also an issue as people are more vulnerable in certain parts of Scotland. For example, someone is 32 times more likely to be the victim of a knife attack if they stay in a socially deprived area. Considering all those factors, I submit that action on knife crime would save costs in certain areas.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell characterised the argument as whether we want more people in prison or more police officers on the street. As I look at it, if we pursued the minimum mandatory sentences for knife crime, we would perhaps not have to hear sad tales such as the one that Charlie Gordon gave of his constituent, Craig McCulloch, and we would save more lives. That point weighs much more heavily than the issue of cost.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats have faced both ways on a number of the issues. In December 2008, Robert Brown was quoted in <em>The Sun</em>&#8212;he was pictured in it as well&#8212;saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Carrying knives is always stupid and should normally lead to a prison sentence for those caught with weapons.\"</p><p>There has clearly been yet another change of policy from the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>Knife campaigners arrived here this morning looking for the Parliament to make a difference, but they were given a slap in the face by the <place-holder colnum=\"27993\"/> Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats. Actions speak louder than words. The SNP and the Lib Dems ignored the powerful messages from John Muir and Kelly McGee, the voices of the 30,000 who signed the petition, and the voices of knife campaigners throughout Scotland. That is shameful, and Labour will stand with the campaigners at half past 5 and vote down the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20874884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As others have done, I pay tribute to the clerks and members of the bill team who assisted with the amendments.

As other members have done, I thank Sheriff Principal Bowen for his contribution in putting together the report. I also thank the team that worked on the report, which is a comprehensive and important piece of work and a major contribution to the discussion of the sheriff and jury system in Scotland. The report highlights the importance of the court process. It covers, among other issues, the impact on victims and witnesses. The point that comes out is that it is absolutely crucial that the correct result is arrived at once the process has been gone through. Therefore, it is crucial that we get the reforms right to improve the process.</p><p>As many members have said, there has been a vast increase in the number of cases that go through the sheriff court&#8212;the figure rose from 3,064 in 1988 to 8,022 last year. That is a tremendous increase that has obviously put a great deal of pressure on the system. As the cabinet secretary said, there are sound reasons for that increase, including the increase in sheriffs' sentencing powers.</p><p>The cabinet secretary also pointed out, with some justification, that the system has not fallen apart under that pressure, but that was at odds with the comments from Nicol Stephen, who drew on his time as a solicitor. He spoke about the inefficiency of the process and how slow it is and appealed to the chamber to move things forward to produce a more efficient judicial system in the sheriff courts. He said that although 6,000 witnesses might be cited, only 1,000 of them are brought to court. That demonstrates a huge inefficiency and underlines the need for the <place-holder colnum=\"27777\"/> compulsory business meeting that many of today's contributors mentioned. The purpose of such a meeting would be to bring together the various parties to act as a clearing shop and to improve communication, so that we can get a more efficient process that streamlines the system and produces quicker decisions. It makes sense to increase the time from indictment to first diet from 15 to 29 days to improve the communication process.</p><p>Robert Brown and Richard Baker spoke about the inexperience of procurator fiscal deputes, which is a matter of concern. If, as the report outlines, experienced defence agents are up against inexperienced procurator fiscal deputes, there is potential to skew the process unfairly in the defence's favour. The sheriff principal made some practical suggestions to improve the experience of procurator fiscal deputes, including allowing them to sit initially in quieter courts and the introduction of a mentoring process. The problem is not easy to address&#8212;as in any area of life or work where a lot of expertise is required, experience must be gained. The sheriff principal has made an important contribution in that area.</p><p>As many speakers said, the priority must be victim support. It is traumatic for a victim to go through a trial process and we must minimise any potential for them to take the stand. We must also ensure that victims have appropriate support&#8212;communication is key. Several members spoke about their constituency experience of victims of crime. It has been my experience that victims are not communicated with properly as the process makes its way to a conclusion, resulting in increased stress for victims at a difficult time.</p><p>Ian McKee gave a good account of his experience as a witness. The amount of intimidation of witnesses that takes place is an understated issue. The report makes the key point that infrastructure must be updated where that has not already been done to ensure that defence and Crown witnesses are held in separate rooms. That would reduce intimidation and give support to witnesses who could then give a proper account when they got into the witness box.</p><p>There was an interesting exchange between Stewart Maxwell and Bill Aitken about TV links. As Stewart Maxwell said, a working group on the issue could be set up with the aim of reducing the need to take the stand and, where appropriate, allowing people to give evidence via a TV link. I hope that that would reduce the amount of time that police officers would need to spend in court. John Lamont quoted statistics on the amount of police time that is tied up in court. We should be moving away from that and getting police officers back on the beat so that they can protect the public and help solve crimes.<place-holder colnum=\"27778\"/></p><p>Several interesting contributions were made on the subject of jurors. I have been a juror twice&#8212;in the sheriff court and in the High Court. I was one of the individuals whom Bill Aitken spoke about who arrived at Glasgow sheriff court on a Monday morning. In fact, it was late on Tuesday morning before the jury was eventually sworn in. We were left sitting about and were not informed about what was happening. I will not give away any secrets of the jury room, but it was not quite \"12 Angry Men\"&#8212;I kept waiting for Henry Fonda to turn up in his white suit, but it did not happen.</p><p>From that experience, I formed the strong impression that the public take their responsibilities as jurors seriously. It is quite a task to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty, which could mean that they go away for a prison term. The process is difficult and we must give jurors appropriate support. As Cathie Craigie said, people's working and family lives could be disrupted by jury service. Richard Baker gave the example of someone who was called to be a juror for five days but who spent only three hours on the jury. We must bear in mind such situations, on which the sheriff principal makes salient points.</p><p>Legal aid should be used appropriately to help conclude processes speedily. Legal aid budgets are experiencing pressures. The report says that, between 2005 and 2009, legal aid costs increased by 7 per cent and solicitors' fees increased by 16 per cent. We need to examine that issue closely. The new guidelines that have been introduced to give suspects access to a lawyer will increase the pressure on legal aid budgets.</p><p>The Labour Party supports the Government's motion and the Tory amendment. As Bill Aitken said, it is important to consider costs and to have an efficient justice system. I agree with the Liberal Democrats that we must make progress urgently and that the Government should work with the relevant parties.</p><p>The Labour Party welcomes the review's publication. We support the proposals, which will lead to a more sound justice system that operates more effectively and helps to deliver justice for the victims of crime.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20862522", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive Question Time &#8212; Health and Wellbeing: \"Independent Review of Sheriff and Jury Procedure\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to close the debate on behalf of the Labour Party.

It is worrying and disappointing for all parties that in the devolution years, during which we have spent more money on services in health, education and justice, reported incidents of domestic abuse have gone up from just more than 49,000 to nearly 54,000. Analysis of the causes of domestic violence is a complex process, but the media have a job to do in relation to the role models that are promoted. As Johann Lamont said, there is a cultural issue. The world cup is coming up, and footballers are often promoted as role models in the media. I am a football supporter, but I have to say that all too often footballers behave inappropriately. Sometimes a footballer has ended up in the courts after an incident. It is little wonder that young men behave inappropriately. The issue to do with the media must be tackled.</p><p>We must also ensure that we can have confidence in the criminal justice system. Rape prosecutions are at their lowest level for 25 years, so it is clear that there is an issue that must be tackled.

The proposal is flawed and the SNP should think again.</p><p>Many key issues have been raised in the debate, which we must understand.

He has made a significant contribution to Scottish life and society. There is no doubt that <place-holder colnum=\"27044\"/> the model that Robert Owen set up at New Lanark was very much a trailblazing and groundbreaking one back in the 18th century. Among other things, he wanted to abolish child labour, set up a free health care system and provide affordable food.</p><p>Some of the ideas that were first mooted at New Lanark are still very much alive and debated in the Parliament. Education is central to many of our debates, as are care for the elderly, responsible citizenship, social inclusion and early intervention. Politicians in the 21st century are still grappling with the ideas that Owen put forward in the 18th century about how we can provide effective solutions for the people of Scotland.</p><p>Karen Gillon was right to highlight the relevance of the New Lanark site and spoke knowledgeably&#8212;as she always does&#8212;about the constituency that she represents. I pay tribute to Jim Arnold and Lorna Davidson, from New Lanark, who do so much to promote Robert Owen's work and to educate schoolchildren. During the festival of politics last year, I took part in an event to celebrate the 10th anniversary of devolution, at which we looked at the history and future of the co-operative movement. Lorna Davidson's contribution to the event attracted a great deal of interest and discussion. She talked not only about what Robert Owen had done in New Lanark but about how his ideas remain relevant.</p><p>The co-op movement is still very much making a contribution in Scotland. As Bill Butler said, co-operatives contribute &#163;3 billion to the Scottish economy annually. As Margo MacDonald said, there is an opportunity for the Scottish Government to promote co-operatives, which contribute to economic growth as well as a sense of community and wellbeing. In recent economic times, when things have been squeezed, credit unions have made an important contribution. Housing co-ops, too, have made a contribution. West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative, in my constituency, is one of the foremost housing co-ops in Scotland.</p><p>I am delighted to speak in the debate and to support the campaign. The ideals that Owen set out in the 18th century are still relevant.

As well as liaising with trade unions and securing a recent members' business debate on the subject, he has lodged a proposal for a member's bill, which I hope will progress through Parliament. I also pay tribute to USDAW, which has supported Hugh Henry's work, and its freedom from fear campaign, and to the other trade unions that have worked tirelessly to promote the safety of union members and of workers in general throughout Scotland. It is correct that we debate the issue and give it proper prominence. As a Parliament, it is important that we recognise the need to protect the wellbeing of staff and workers throughout Scotland. I hope that Parliament's consideration of Hugh Henry's proposed member's bill has a positive conclusion.</p><p>As others have said, it is totally unacceptable that workers should be assaulted as they go about their duties. When people leave to go to work in the morning or in the evening, they do not expect to be abused or assaulted. Such events often lead to a great deal of trauma and stress. As a Parliament, we have a duty to recognise that and to look at what we can do to prevent such circumstances from arising and to back up workers who find themselves in such situations.</p><p>Some statistics report that 35 per cent of retail workers have experienced physical or verbal abuse. Such abuse seems to be a bigger problem in Scotland. One recent survey showed that 80 per cent of retail workers in Scotland reported having experienced verbal abuse in the past year. The equivalent figure for the UK was 65 per cent. As regards threats of physical violence, the figures were 40 per cent in Scotland and 32 per cent at UK level. Those statistics show that, unfortunately, it is clear that there is a bigger problem in Scotland, which makes swift action by the Parliament a priority.</p><p>There has been some discussion about the categorisation of workers and who would be covered by the proposed bill. As Hugh Henry correctly said, that issue can be dealt with as the bill moves through Parliament. The important point to bear in mind is that if public-facing workers face threats, intimidation or abuse, we as a Parliament require to back up those workers by ensuring that we militate against such circumstances arising.</p><p>In my constituency, I have worked closely with the Community union on the campaign against <place-holder colnum=\"26397\"/> violence towards betting shop workers. Unfortunately, there have been such incidents in my constituency even in recent months. I pay tribute to the work that the Community union has done on the issue, which highlights the importance of protecting our workers. It is not just an issue for Parliament&#8212;employers have a responsibility to ensure that their workers are protected.</p><p>A number of factors underlie violence against or abuse of workers. As Hugh Henry mentioned, the staff in retail stores that sell alcohol and cigarettes find themselves in particularly vulnerable situations. I have spoken to people in such stores in my constituency, which gave me a real sense of the fear and intimidation that they feel. If there is only one member of staff in the shop at half past 9 at night and a number of unruly people, who might be underage, come in and start demanding alcohol, the situation is extremely difficult to deal with. It is often women or younger workers who are put in vulnerable situations in which they are intimidated.

As other members have done, I congratulate Jim Tolson on bringing the motion to the chamber and on highlighting the effectiveness of the bluelight initiative and the way in which it has negated the impact of antisocial behaviour in Fife. That has come across clearly in the experiences of the various Fife members who have spoken.</p><p>In general, members are well aware of the negative effects that antisocial behaviour can have on their communities. Recently, there was a 31 per cent rise in the number of antisocial behaviour penalties issued in the Strathclyde area. Added to that, the 2009 social attitudes survey demonstrated that 70 per cent of people in Scotland have witnessed some form of antisocial behaviour and that 87 per cent reckon that it is a major or serious problem. However, we need to do more than quote statistics on antisocial behaviour; we need to consider the human impact on communities. Pensioners are afraid to leave their homes because they have a feeling of fear and are worried about what might be visited upon them by people who perpetrate antisocial behaviour. Obviously, such behaviour is unacceptable and there is a need to combat it.</p><p>From that point of view, the bluelight initiative is welcome. As Jim Tolson said, although it was pioneered internationally and has been set up in Dunfermline, it is starting to have an impact throughout Scotland. A successful bluelight event, which was praised by local police and stakeholders, has been held in Larkhall in Lanarkshire.</p><p>The initiative has several key advantages. First, it tackles crime and antisocial behaviour. As Jim Tolson said, on the nights when the discos take place, activity in the hot spots decreases significantly. As Claire Baker pointed out, because the events continue until 11 o'clock, there is a greater chance that those attending will go home when they leave, rather than participate in unsavoury activities. The initiative also does a lot to involve young people and reinforces the strong <place-holder colnum=\"26209\"/> education message that we want them to be model citizens who respect others in society.</p><p>Because the events are alcohol and drug free, they reinforce a message that we are trying to get across in schools. Recent drug statistics have indicated the alarming fact that youngsters under the age of 15 are starting to be admitted to hospital as a result of taking drugs. At a recent meeting of the Public Audit Committee, health board chiefs said that the same trend is starting to appear in relation to alcohol. It is good to see multi-agency working, with people from various agencies participating in the events and talking to young people.</p><p>The format is excellent and should be rolled out throughout Scotland. However, that should be linked to general Government support and strong action on antisocial behaviour. We need to assess the effectiveness of the current legislation and be proactive in tackling the negative impacts of antisocial behaviour.</p><p>I again congratulate Jim Tolson on the motion and on highlighting the initiative, which I hope is successfully rolled out throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766413", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bluelight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.

As a member of the Justice Committee, I thank the clerks and the team at the Scottish Parliament information centre for the amount of work that they put into assisting us during our nine evidence sessions on the bill at stage 1.</p><p>The committee's consideration of the bill was my first outing as a member of the Justice Committee, and I was advised that it would be a relatively calm and uncontroversial journey. How wrong that proved to be. As we took evidence, it became clear that there were strong views on both sides about the benefits and the disadvantages of the bill. As many have said during the debate, there are divisions of opinion within the legal profession and the Law Society. That has made it difficult for the members of the committee to navigate their way through the bill, to understand it, to grapple with the issues around it, and to map a way forward that will ensure that the passage of the bill benefits the legal profession and the consumers and users of legal services throughout Scotland.</p><p>As I have said, there are strong arguments for and against. In favour, there are those who point to the modernisation of legal services in England and Wales, and there is a feeling that we do not want Scotland to be left behind. If we are left behind, Scottish firms could become disadvantaged. The minister pointed out that there are potential economic advantages to moving down the ABS route. We do not want to disadvantage our Scottish legal firms. If we can, we also want an opportunity to boost that sector of the Scottish economy. Consumer Focus Scotland pointed out that, if ABS is successful, the bill provides the opportunity of helping consumers by giving them better access and reducing prices.</p><p>Against those strong arguments are those who say that the independence of the legal profession is under threat, and that long-standing arrangements, such as the guarantee fund, will be in danger of being terminated. There are also fears that the bill spells the death of many small firms, and that there is a danger of unscrupulous third parties becoming involved.<place-holder colnum=\"25785\"/></p><p>The committee's role in assessing the effectiveness of the legislation was not helped by the lack of evidence. The Law Society gave the committee some strong evidence but, as Robert Brown pointed out, some of the other evidence was not so strong. It was also difficult because we did not have strong international examples. The changes that have been introduced in England and Wales have yet to be implemented, so we cannot see the advantages or disadvantages of them yet. The minister quoted Australia, but there are no strong examples nearer to home that allow us to assess whether this is the correct route to take.</p><p>Throughout the process, we have seen divisions in the Law Society. It has gone through a number of processes and taken different views on ABS. As far back as 2008, there was a strong vote in favour. There was then a special general meeting, which was halted. In between times, a referendum voted narrowly in favour of alternative business structures, and then the reconvened special general meeting voted against. We are now awaiting the results of the Law Society's executive's discussions and a further AGM. I am sure that we all wish Ian Smart and the officers well in their efforts to come up with a consensus and a way forward that can be agreed by the majority of members. That will not be an easy task.</p><p>A number of important issues are still to be addressed as we move to stage 2. There are concerns that the legislation could undermine the independence of the legal profession. As Bill Butler and others said, the proposal made by Mike Dailly of Govan Law Centre for a co-ownership model with a 75:25 per cent split is one way forward. Mr Dailly has been critical of ABS structures, and his proposal gives us the opportunity to build consensus.</p><p>The issue of regulation is complex. Concerns were expressed at the committee about the power vested in ministers. I welcome the minister's commitment to look at an enhanced role for the Lord President. That is the correct route to take. David McLetchie is right to point out that we want a level playing field, no matter how many regulators we have. It is important that those proposals come forward.</p><p>If the change is to be successful, it must be properly resourced. As I said earlier, ICAS said that the new regulatory system would be costly to operate. The financial memorandum is sketchy on detail, and the finances to back up the bill are not adequate. The estimated cost for moving applications through the process is a minimum of &#163;27,000 and a maximum of &#163;71,000, and the estimated cost for the monitoring of the process is a maximum of &#163;48,000, depending on staff <place-holder colnum=\"25786\"/> numbers. If we are to address the concerns that members have raised about potentially unscrupulous third-party involvement, we need greater resources to perform the task properly and not the paltry sums that we see in the financial memorandum.</p><p>As Bill Butler, Richard Baker and others have said, it is important that we can demonstrate that the proposals give adequate access to justice. As Robert Brown helpfully pointed out, there is an important role for the minister in getting the interested parties round the table to discuss the issues and hammer out a way forward. I recognise that the minister wants to make a robust defence of his bill, but some of his criticisms went a bit too far. He must reach out to those in the legal profession who have been critical and get them on board, so that we can all move forward on the issue.</p><p>Labour supports the bill at stage 1, although it will have to be amended heavily at stage 2. We will await further developments with interest.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764258", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Services (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to close on behalf of the Labour Party.

In examining exceptions in double jeopardy&#8212;a law that was established 800 years ago&#8212;we must look at current thinking. Down in England and Wales, the driver for change was the Stephen Lawrence murder case, and further to that changes were made to the law to introduce exceptions to the double jeopardy principle. In Scotland, as many have mentioned, the issue was given focus by the collapse of the World's End murder trial. I well remember the Lord Advocate coming to the Parliament to make a statement on the matter and there is no doubt that it was a sombre and serious occasion. I point out to David McLetchie that, following on from that, Paul Martin called for action to look at exceptions to the double jeopardy principle.

There has been a lot of discussion of that important issue; it needs proper consideration and therefore it is only correct that it goes out to consultation. If the measure is taken forward, we will need to establish whether the new evidence is relevant and whether there should, as a result, be a new trial, and any such process must involve the High Court's due consideration.</p><p>Important arguments have been made in favour of considering new evidence. For example, there have been important developments not only in the use of DNA evidence but in other scientific fields including, as the cabinet secretary pointed out, image processing. There is a strong moral case for considering fundamental new evidence that might change the result of the original trial, but we need to bear in mind the important legal principle of consistency.</p><p>It is useful to consider examples from England and Wales, where changes to the law that were set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 were implemented in 2005. As has been said, very few such cases have been taken forward. One <place-holder colnum=\"24907\"/> particular case, however, involved the conviction of Mario Celaire&#8212;as the result of a new confession&#8212;for the murder of Cassandra McDermott. I am quite sure that that outcome reassured Ms McDermott's family, but we should also remember that, after he had been cleared originally, Mr Celaire carried out a very serious hammer attack on another woman. Such circumstances strengthen the case for there to be exceptions to double jeopardy, because the outcome can not only reassure victims but ensure that the people who are actually guilty of crimes are placed in prison where they belong, instead of being let out to commit other violent acts.</p><p>There has been a lot of discussion about the crimes to which the new evidence rule should apply. I welcome the fact that the Liberal Democrats intend to withdraw their amendment, which mentions only murder and rape. In England and Wales, the list of crimes to which the rule applies is extensive and provides a reasonable starting point for the consultation; nevertheless, it should not represent the conclusion. The good thing about the consultation is that it allows us to consider the list of offences in England and Wales and take on board other comments and evidence to produce a list that is relevant to Scots law.</p><p>I strongly support the retrospective application of exceptions. In that respect, Cathie Craigie highlighted an excellent example in the case of Billy Dunlop, who was retried and convicted of a crime that had been committed in 1989. Again, that gave some reassurance to the family of the victim of the crime.</p><p>We must be diligent in the drawing up of any new evidence and ensure that it is properly constructed, can be assessed correctly and is relevant to a new trial.</p><p>In one of her many interventions, Margo MacDonald made some points about publicity. The consultation deals with publicity, and examines the possibility of giving powers to the court to ban press reporting. That idea needs to be considered seriously. As has been said throughout the debate, such a measure is likely to apply in only very few cases.</p><p>Double jeopardy is an important issue, and this has been a good debate, in which a lot of excellent contributions have been made. I look forward to the conclusion of the consultation in the autumn and to the Government taking action to strengthen the law on double jeopardy and to shift it in support of victims and their families.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20720552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Double Jeopardy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although a confession has been made, it must still be examined in a trial.

As many members have said, this has been an important debate in which a number of serious issues have been raised. Unfortunately, serious and organised crime affects many areas throughout Scotland. Many members quoted the figure that 4,066 individuals and 367 groups are involved in serious organised crime. It is not just the figures but the scale of the havoc that those groups and individuals wreak throughout Scotland that cause concern to many of our constituents&#8212;many members have raised those concerns today.</p><p>Such crime has a social and economic cost. The cost of drugs misuse totals &#163;2.6 billion a year and the cost of fraud is &#163;330 for every person in Scotland. Those are shocking and serious figures.<place-holder colnum=\"24582\"/></p><p>I think that everyone in the chamber would agree that we must tackle those issues. They would also agree with many of the sentiments that the cabinet secretary expressed in his opening speech. We agree with the actions that are being taken by the serious organised crime task force on the four Ds&#8212;diversion, disruption, deterrence and detection. It is absolutely correct that those actions be taken to tackle the activities of those who are involved in serious organised crime.</p><p>The debate has raised some serious questions about how the SNP Government moves forward in certain areas. Richard Baker, Cathie Craigie and others talked about the awarding of public sector contracts to organisations that have links to serious organised crime. A number of things can be done to try to undermine those who try to win contracts who should not be doing so.</p><p>The cabinet secretary referred to the strategy document in his opening speech. Under the heading, \"Deter\", the strategy refers specifically to:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a new service to ensure public sector contracts are not awarded to companies with links to crime.\"</p><p>We did not hear anything about that new service in the opening speech. Perhaps the cabinet secretary will give us a bit more detail on the progress on that. If we are to address some of the concerns that members have raised during the debate it is essential that he does that.</p><p>There is a job to be done in providing advice to public authorities on good practice to ensure that contracts do not get into the wrong hands. Information and intelligence could be shared with authorities so that they are aware of the background of those who bid for contracts.</p><p>It is clear that local authorities have a big part to play in all this. I am thinking in particular of licensing. There must be close working with local authorities to ensure that we get the best out of the current arrangements.</p><p>If we are to tackle the many issues that have been raised in the debate, it is crucial that the appropriate resources are put in place. The mapping project outlined the scale of the task that we face. It is important that all our agencies pull together and that they are fully resourced. Central to that must be the timeous establishment of the crime campus at Gartcosh. The cabinet secretary said that the current site at Pitt Street is not fit for purpose. A timetable needs to be put in place as soon as possible for the crime campus to be up and operational at Gartcosh. Elaine Smith made some important points in that regard and pressed the cabinet secretary firmly on the matter.</p><p>As other members have said, it is important that we congratulate the SCDEA on its work. I welcome the additional moneys that the cabinet <place-holder colnum=\"24583\"/> secretary announced today. That said, I note in the SCDEA's 2009-10 annual plan that 2 per cent cashable efficiency savings are to be made. I am not against efficiencies, but if they are cashable and result in cuts in budget lines, the matter is of concern.</p><p>If we are to support those who are at the front-line in such activities, a detailed implementation plan will be needed to back up the strategy document. I understand that the cabinet secretary might not want to publish the plan&#8212;obviously, he does not want to reveal the detail to the forces of crime&#8212;but we need to know how the plan is being taken forward.</p><p>Bill Aitken and other members raised serious points on the confiscation of the assets of those who are found guilty of such crimes. Recent figures illustrate that, of the &#163;60 million that was frozen in the past three years, only &#163;6 million was confiscated. On Sunday, SNP councillor Billy McAllister was quoted as criticising the lack of progress in that area.</p><p>When the legislation was introduced, it was cited as an example of good working between Westminster and Holyrood. We need to look again at the legislation to examine whether it needs to be fine tuned or amended in any way. We need to ensure that we have more success in confiscating frozen assets and redistributing them through the cashback for communities scheme. I agree with Hugh Henry that we must ensure that the money goes to areas that have been affected by crime. If 77 per cent of the 161 groups that are involved in violence and murder are in the Strathclyde area, funding must go to the areas that are most affected in Strathclyde.</p><p>As Patricia Ferguson said, a job has to be done to instil confidence in people. We need to ensure that the public are confident enough to come forward and act as witnesses. Patricia Ferguson described that as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the missing piece in the jigsaw\".</p><p>Many proponents of serious and organised crime try to dominate areas by bullying and intimidating people. We must ensure that our police forces are visible, in order to give communities greater confidence, so that they are better prepared to stand up to the criminals.</p><p>This has been an important debate, and there is much that we agree on. However, the cabinet secretary needs to address a number of points of detail. If those points are dealt with, and the Parliament unites, we can silence and defeat the forces of organised crime.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20683362", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious and Organised Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to close the debate on behalf of the Labour Party.

There is no doubt that the Parliament is better for that expertise.</p><p>In preparation for general practice week I visited the local Craigallian Avenue practice in Halfway in my constituency, where I have been registered as a patient since I was nine. It was interesting to return there this week. Fortunately, I do not have to visit the practice that often, but when I do I am always reassured by the excellent service that the GPs and the team there provide.</p><p>I have young children and elderly parents. People at that stage often find themselves in and out of GP surgeries. We look to GPs for reassurance as they treat those who are close to us&#8212;and we often get it; that is why, according to the BMA survey, 82 per cent of people said that they got a lot of reassurance and support from their GPs.</p><p>I am registered at the Craigallian Avenue practice but, like a good constituency MSP, I manage to have an interest in another practice, as my wife and children are registered at a practice nearer home, in Rutherglen. As well as paying tribute to the Craigallian Avenue practice, I pay tribute to the work of Dr Colville, who is on the Scottish GPs committee, and to others who work at Rutherglen health centre.</p><p>There is no doubt that GP practices have changed over the years. When I was a youngster, one GP in Cambuslang used to chain-smoke his way through consultations. Thankfully, times have changed and we have moved on. The nature of GP practices has changed too; work is done by practice nurses and health visitors, and coverage is more comprehensive. That helps not just with diagnosis but with anticipating potential health problems, which is to the betterment of communities throughout Scotland.</p><p>GPs are the driving force of the NHS and have a big role to play in tackling many of the issues that we discuss at the Parliament, such as health inequalities. In the west of Scotland, health inequalities remain a very challenging issue, but the way in which practices are organised there allows them to tap in and track heart disease, lung disease, liver disease and cancer from an early stage and GPs are able to prolong people's lives.</p><p>I share Richard Simpson's disappointment at the demise of the GPASS IT system. I remember one <place-holder colnum=\"23882\"/> of my very first jobs as an analyst/programmer a very long time ago. I was not directly involved in GPASS, but I worked in a team that worked on its roll-out. I know from that, as well as from various experiences of GP surgeries over the years, how important a system it was.

The statistics quoted in the report tell a story of a lack of stability. Those who are in charge of sentencing must be aware of that. As other members have pointed out, there are also important issues around the women's mental health, which must be addressed.</p><p>Some practical measures should be considered to make progress. Robert Brown mentioned visiting facilities, and the report considered family contact time. Many women prisoners have children, and one of the sad facts in the report is that, if we continue on the current route, more than half of those children will also end up in prison. It is important that there is proper contact between women and their children, and the committee's recommendation that we should try to have flexible visiting facilities to establish such contact is important.</p><p>In recent weeks, there has been a lot of discussion in the Parliament about literacy. That is clearly an issue for prisoners generally, and specifically for women prisoners. If we do some work on literacy in prisons, particularly in Cornton Vale, we will increase the level of education of women prisoners and help them when they return to the outside world and look for a job.</p><p>As Bill Aitken said, there are clearly issues around drug use. Other more general issues also need to be addressed. For example, Elaine Smith mentioned community penalties. Such penalties clearly have to be properly funded and properly evaluated in respect of how they apply to women. There is obviously an issue around community penalties, given that statistics that were published earlier in the week show that a third of them are breached. I have severe reservations about the funding of community penalties, but perhaps that is a debate for another day.</p><p>We must have another look at how we make facilities work.

In looking at that decision, we must first examine the starting points for it. As Charlie Gordon outlined in his point of order, a parliamentary bill was passed on the subject. In addition, back when the spending review was published in 2007, GARL was a line in the proposals for 2010-11.</p><p>When the draft budget was published, the GARL line was taken out, which, in effect, was an act of economic vandalism that moved against the creation of 1,300 jobs and the promotion of the economy of not only Glasgow but Scotland. When the Finance Committee and other committees hold meetings throughout Scotland, businesses, unions and local organisations point out the importance of transport and connectivity. The cancellation of GARL undermines connectivity both within Glasgow and the west of Scotland and between the area and other centres in Scotland. That hinders the Scottish economy's ability to grow.</p><p>Contrasting the treatment of GARL with that of the Scottish Futures Trust&#8212;the most expensive job creation scheme in the Scottish budget&#8212;shows how the Government's priorities are not correct. Mr Swinney spoke about saving money on salaries that are paid for out of the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"23404\"/> budget. If he wants to do that, he should bin the Scottish Futures Trust, which has failed to create jobs or add to economic growth.</p><p>Robert Brown spent a good part of his six-minute speech supporting GARL, but I object to his comment that the Labour Party is simply acting out a political manoeuvre in supporting GARL. We have said consistently in debates throughout the session that we support the creation of jobs and economic growth. That informs our thinking on GARL. I, along with other Labour MSPs, will be watching the Liberal Democrats closely at 5 o'clock to see how they vote on the Labour amendment. Talk is cheap; it is how members vote on the issue that the public will look at.</p><p>The issue is linked to a general malaise in economic policy that affects the Government. The Government took 10 months to come to a decision on the Beauly to Denny power line, but there is still confusion over the funding of underground parts of the line and the timing. In addition, the Council of Economic Advisers has been slow to respond to the economic crisis.</p><p>As other members have pointed out, the approach to the budget has been secretive, rather than open and transparent. The Government has been slow to release information such as details of the capital spending programme or the level 4 details. When the level 4 details were produced, they were interesting. For example, it transpired that the budget for the monitoring of sex offenders, which should concern all members, has been cut in real terms by &#163;21,000. When the Cabinet Secretary for Justice was challenged on that, he told us not to worry because it is merely loose change. That displays a slap-dash approach to the budget. When all else fails, the Government resorts to trying to blame the UK, which is not good enough on this occasion.</p><p>An interesting feature of the debate has been the silence of the SNP list members for Glasgow&#8212;I think that, at the moment, they have all left the chamber. Those members have become puppets, controlled by the SNP head office. They have put their place on the SNP list for the 2011 elections before the wishes and desires of their constituents.

Like the minister, I thank Paddy Tomkins and his team for their work on this comprehensive report, into which all the experts whom Paddy Tomkins pulled together have put a lot of work. It is an important document for Parliament to consider this afternoon. The minister will be able to examine carefully and to take forward the report's recommendations. This afternoon he has indicated that he will set up a water rescue working group, which is a welcome development.</p><p>The report comes at an appropriate time, given the weather that we have had recently. Floods hit Scotland and other parts of the UK before Christmas. Recently we have had heavy snow and cold weather, followed by melting snow that has produced further floods. At rural affairs and environment question time, the Minister for Environment indicated that flood warnings are in operation in two parts of the Highlands. That shows that, even today, when the weather has become milder, there are flood issues that we must face as we debate Paddy Tomkins's report in Parliament.</p><p>I turn to the background to the report. I was surprised to find that there are 27,000 lochs in Scotland&#8212;that is an astonishing number. There are also 120,000km of rivers; clearly, there is a great deal of water surrounding and within the country. Although that presents many people with an opportunity for enjoyment, it also poses a potential threat when people get into difficulties and when waters flood.</p><p>When examining how to progress matters, the group looked at the \"Preparing Scotland\" guidance, which sets the scene on many issues and establishes that we expect increased river flows over the next 50 years. That is due partly to climate change. The events of the past couple of months, in which we have had heavy rains followed by extremely cold weather and heavy snow, have shown the effects of climate change.</p><p>The minister indicated that there are about 40 deaths a year due to people drowning in inland waters. We want to reduce that figure, and I hope that the group's work will contribute to doing so. It is important to put the issue in context&#8212;for example, each year there are 330 deaths as a result of road traffic collisions. Even so, the issue must be treated seriously.</p><p>As the minister said, the group has had to take a multi-agency approach, as different agencies&#8212;the police, the fire and rescue service, the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"23038\"/> Ambulance Service and voluntary groups&#8212;are involved. When different groups are involved, there is potential for communication lines to become crossed and for an operation to become ineffective. We want to get the best out of the four excellent feeder services that I mentioned.</p><p>The approach that the group adopted&#8212;rightly&#8212;was to split flood rescue and acute rescue. Flood rescue is subject to longer-term planning, with certain areas of the country being more susceptible to flooding than others. Flood risk management and flood prevention plans can be put in place, as can emergency plans for floods and situations in which people get into difficulty. Acute rescue is for situations in which people unintentionally end up under water and require to be rescued by the emergency services.</p><p>The process for all that had to be examined to ensure that it was effective and efficient. The expert group sensibly considered previous reports in the area, including the Pitt report, which looked into the flooding of 55,000 homes in the north of England, during which 7,000 people were rescued and, unfortunately, 13 people died. That good body of work helped the group to form its opinions. A number of people fed their views into the group's consultations, so it was able to draw on their expertise and experience.</p><p>On the report's comments on the role of various agencies, it is clearly important, as the minister said, that the police continue to play their co-ordination role in the response to incidents. The fire and rescue service is clearly at the forefront of rescues, and 14 teams are involved in responding to incidents around the country. As the minister mentioned, consideration has been given to whether statutory changes are required, but the review concluded that no such changes are needed. A big factor is that flooding only accounts for 1 per cent of the incidents that the fire and rescue service attends.</p><p>The Scottish Ambulance Service also plays a key part in water rescue incidents. The swift-water training that has been undertaken has been helpful, although I emphasise again the key role of the fire and rescue service. I pay tribute, as the minister did, to the work that the fire and rescue service continues to do in attending difficult incidents, with staff putting their lives on the line on many occasions.</p><p>The voluntary sector also plays a key role, and we must pay tribute to those public-spirited individuals who, recognising potential dangers in their areas, have set up voluntary groups to assist when people get into difficulty. One useful observation in the report is that there has been no risk assessment of the work that the voluntary sector does. If that was to be done, we could get <place-holder colnum=\"23039\"/> more out of the excellent contribution that the voluntary sector makes.</p><p>I turn to some of the report's key recommendations. We must ensure that data on incidents are recorded correctly. To learn and to make effective progress we need accurate data so that we can see where there are problems in flood and acute rescue. It is important that we have a proper asset register so that we can see what equipment the teams that tackle incidents have at their disposal. We can then identify potential shortfalls and ensure that the equipment is robust and adequate. We need an audit of that equipment. It is one thing to have some equipment, but it is also necessary to ensure that it works effectively and is ready for action in all the right places if incidents occur.</p><p>As the minister said, we should consider public awareness. We hear a lot about the importance of preventing fires, and rightly so. For example, there was a good advertising campaign on the issue before Christmas. Perhaps we need to do more to warn people about the dangers of water. If we doubt that, we need only consider the sad incidents of recent weeks, when people walked on frozen lakes, fell through the ice and got into difficulties, sometimes with tragic outcomes. Such incidents are a clarion call to us to increase public awareness by running appropriate campaigns.</p><p>The report's author made the point that we must get the most out of equipment and said that we should consider international best practice. He referred to the potential for use of the private sector, which is worth assessing. The Fire Brigades Union has criticised that option, but it is worth considering international experience and assessing all options that might help us.</p><p>I welcome the recommendation that the Scottish Government and COSLA work together on procurement of training services. In a time of challenging budgets, anything that can save money is welcome. Labour highlights the importance of training and equipment in its amendment, and there are recommendations that relate to the issue in the report, such as the recommendations that an asset register be compiled and that an audit of equipment be carried out, to identify deficiencies.</p><p>It is important that staff are properly trained. The FBU was critical of the training and equipment that staff had been given in the context of the difficult tasks that they had to take on in the north-east before Christmas. The issue should be borne in mind. I welcome the Government's support for the amendment and I hope that the water rescue working group will address training and equipment.<place-holder colnum=\"23040\"/></p><p>I welcome the recommendations in the report. It is important that we focus on the key recommendations, which, if they are implemented, can create a better working environment and save lives throughout Scotland. I look forward to considering how the working group will take the issues forward.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5573.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that includes adequate equipment and training being made available to staff required to attend water and flood incidents.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20514570", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Affairs and the Environment: \"Independent Review of Open Water and Flood Rescue in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this afternoon's debate, opening on behalf of the Labour Party and in support of the Labour Party amendment.

Imprisonment has a number of purposes, including punishment for a crime and the hope that we will be able to ensure that those who are in prisons do not reoffend. <place-holder colnum=\"22689\"/></p><p>Nanette Milne and other members quoted Andrew McLellan, the former chief inspector of prisons, who in his annual report for 2006-07 cited important research showing that good family contact was important and contributed towards a reduction in reoffending. The Public Petitions Committee took on board that important finding.</p><p>A number of problems are associated with the decision to close Craiginches and, in effect, to move the prison to HMP Peterhead. As other members have said, the decision will move prisoners away from their families. As Nicol Stephen outlined, there is a real problem with transport links on the 35-mile journey&#8212;a 70-mile round trip&#8212;from Peterhead to Aberdeen. That makes it more difficult for families to visit prisoners and, therefore, for prisoners to retain the contact and reassurance that, hopefully, will contribute towards reducing reoffending.</p><p>As Richard Baker indicated, there must be serious concerns about the fact that the sex offender unit will no longer be centralised and sex offenders will be dispersed throughout Scotland. Recently there have been a number of alarming sex offender cases, which have brought to the fore concerns among the public. In the treatment of sex offenders, the public are looking for them to be kept in one central location, in so far as that is possible, so that specialised treatment can be provided in such cases.</p><p>Nicol Stephen made the alarming point that politics are in play in the decision. The prison has been moved to be sited in the Westminster constituency of the First Minister and the Scottish Parliament constituency of the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change. As Lewis Macdonald said, in this case we should take into account not politics but the views of local people. From the views that members have expressed in this afternoon's debate and the local views that were communicated to the committee, it is clear that there is a strong view in the Aberdeen community that a community-facing prison should have been retained in the area.</p><p>John Farquhar Munro made some good points about community-facing prisons. In all honesty, the cabinet secretary did not make a robust case for his view that Peterhead would be a community-facing prison.</p><p>This has been a good debate, in which many strong points have been made, especially by local members. I urge the cabinet secretary to put politics aside in this case, to consider carefully the views that have been expressed here and by the Public Petitions Committee, and to ensure that, in the delivery of justice in the Aberdeen area, the views of local people and local prisoners' families are strongly taken into account.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20495405", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Prisons"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to sum up the debate.

As others have done, I thank the clerks and committee members for the work that they put into producing such a comprehensive report on a very important subject for the Parliament.</p><p>There are many great traditions in this Parliament, such as First Minister's question time and time for reflection. The pre-Christmas debate on the Finance Committee's report on the draft budget is another. Given that I am a former member of the committee, I could not resist coming back to take part in the debate before we break up for Christmas.</p><p>The other reason why I wanted to take part in the debate was to explode the myth that we heard from Alex Salmond last week at First Minister's question time, which has been repeated by SNP members this morning&#8212;that the budget has been cut by more than &#163;800 million. The fact is that, in cash terms, the budget has increased by &#163;943 million to &#163;35.5 billion. That is a record budget under devolution. The Government has also had at its disposal over the spending review period &#163;1.5 billion. In addition, as Malcolm Chisholm said, the gross domestic product deflator figure is less&#8212;at 1.5 per cent&#8212;which potentially provides an additional value of &#163;880 million. With all those assets at its disposal, the Government should focus on how to get the best out of the budget, rather than bleat and complain to Westminster.</p><p>It belittles the position of the First Minister for him simply to say that the capital acceleration that was spent in a previous year is now a budget cut. He is a bit like a kid who eats his ice cream before dinner and then, when it comes to the ice cream course, wants to eat somebody else's. He cannot have it both ways&#8212;that is just not good enough.</p><p>There are clearly some black holes and gaps in <place-holder colnum=\"22288\"/> the budget. At the Finance Committee's meeting in Glasgow, when the cabinet secretary was questioned about the referendum bill, it was clear that there are no lines in the budget to cover the &#163;9 million for the referendum.</p><p>In the justice arena, there are flaws in the budget process, to which Robert Brown has alluded. The Labour Party is opposed to the SNP's policy of introducing a presumption against short-term sentences, although I do not want to dwell on that today.</p><p>On the Government's attitude to the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, I believe that there are flaws in the financial memorandum and the budgeting. The financial memorandum stated that take-up of community service orders would be between 10 and 20 per cent, but it gave no evidence to back that up. Just short of 7,300 prisoners are received on sentences of six months or less. If the bulk of them were not to go to prison to serve their short-term sentences, the cost would be in the region of &#163;22 million a year, which has not been budgeted for. As Mr Brown said, in next year's budget, the money will be found from underspends, but we hear continually how much pressure the budget is under. It is bizarre at least to say that the money will come from underspends. That is a black hole and that does not represent a good approach to budgeting.</p><p>We heard from the cabinet secretary about increased police numbers. In recent weeks, he has spoken about what he regards as an excellent local government settlement. However, Strathclyde police authority reckons that its budget for next year will have a &#163;16 million shortfall as a consequence of pressures on local government budgets, whose effect we have seen in recent weeks in the collapse of some SNP education policy commitments. Police boards will experience more pressure to deliver police numbers at the front line and to police effectively overall, because backroom services will also be under pressure.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20463609", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Process 2010-11"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.

It is a pity that there are not more members in the chamber for this important debate&#8212;it is unfortunate that it has been scheduled for an afternoon when some members might be gathering in another area of Scotland. It is also unfortunate that we have had <place-holder colnum=\"21196\"/> only 10 days to assess the report and that the detailed analysis that backs it up will not be published until the end of 2009.</p><p>The issue concerns all members. Recently, in Blantyre, which is in the constituency neighbouring mine, a mother and daughter were tragically killed as a result of a fire. The tragic loss of such young lives and the impact on their family and friends bring home the importance of work on the issue. As members have said, although fire deaths have reduced since 1990, they rose by 62 per cent in 2007-08, which is clearly a cause for concern. That should be viewed alongside the fact that the level of deaths is greater in Scotland than in other parts of the United Kingdom. Despite the fact that, relative to the population, there are 30 per cent more fires in England than there are in Scotland, the level of deaths in Scotland is double that in England.</p><p>Some of the statistics in the report bear out Scotland's social problems and their link to fire deaths. Alcohol was a contributory factor in 62 per cent of the fire deaths that were analysed and, as members have said, smoking was involved in 41 per cent of the deaths. Of the deaths, 31 per cent occurred in the 15 per cent of data zones that are most affected by deprivation, so there are clear links to alcohol, smoking and deprivation. I see two tasks for us. First, we must address the policy issues that we discuss often in the chamber about the need to reduce alcohol consumption, the number of people who smoke and the need to tackle deprivation throughout Scotland. Secondly, the fire service has a job to do, particularly through fire safety visits, which must target the areas that are affected by those factors.</p><p>The report contains useful suggestions. As the minister said, the introduction of reduced ignition propensity cigarettes, which self-extinguish, would reduce the number of fire deaths. We must support work to bring about a European standard. My colleague, the Labour MEP Catherine Stihler, has supported work on that in the European Parliament. The cigarettes are cost neutral to produce and regulations backing them up have already been introduced successfully in New York, Canada and Finland.

There is a cost issue: the sprinklers cost &#163;3,000 to install, which means that they would incur a cost of &#163;7 billion throughout Scotland. It is not practical to proceed with that, but there is a challenge for the Government to consider how it can reduce that cost. Some experts have suggested that sprinkler systems could be installed for as little as &#163;600. As we embark on social housing programmes, it is worth considering making it incumbent on housing providers to include the installation of such sprinklers.</p><p>Education is also important.

In addition, the number of deaths that are attributed to alcohol in Scotland is much higher than the number for the UK. In my constituency the number is 238 per cent higher than the UK rate.</p><p>Whatever the precise figure, that has an impact on the economy. There can be no doubt about the health impact, taking into account the number of people who require to be seen and treated by the health service. As a knock-on effect of alcohol-related illness, people are sometimes not able to attend work or even continue in work. That has an impact on the economy at a time when we want our economy to be strong and vibrant.</p><p>In addition, as Bill Aitken has outlined, there are also clear impacts in the justice arena. There is no doubt that many serious crimes, including murders, are committed as a result of alcohol-related incidents. Those of us who represent urban constituencies are only too aware of the impact that alcohol plays in crime and antisocial behaviour. In addition to that, the report on fire deaths that was published earlier this week showed that alcohol has a role to play in some of the fire deaths in Scotland.</p><p>It is against that backdrop that the minimum-pricing proposal has been brought forward.

Other measures must be addressed, such as the use of alcohol treatment and testing orders to deal with problem drinkers. In addition, it is worth thinking about a mandatory challenge 21 scheme and tougher sanctions on those who break the licensing laws.</p><p>Overall, we need to change our culture.

That view is shared by the business community, as we have seen from the submissions from the Confederation of British Industry Scotland, the Institute of Directors and others.</p><p>Comments have been made tonight about the number of jobs that will not be gained if we do not go ahead with the project: 1,300 jobs are likely to be lost.</p><p>As Patricia Ferguson eloquently pointed out, one of the big successes in recent years has been the bringing of the Commonwealth games to Glasgow. An infrastructure that will be sustainable in the future, which will involve building strong transport links, is central to that. The Glasgow airport rail link had the opportunity to contribute to making the games successful. We want visitors who arrive in the city to be able to get from the airport to their hotels and the Commonwealth games venues as quickly as possible. The decision that the SNP has taken will prohibit that.</p><p>Some SNP members have asked where we would take the money from. In previous contributions to finance debates, I have made suggestions about how money could be cut from the budget. I will make just one suggestion this evening: the Government should scrap the Scottish Futures Trust. At a cost of &#163;23 million, it is a waste of public money and has brought no new projects into the Scottish infrastructure.</p><p>The SNP's attitude to the Glasgow airport rail link has been inconsistent to say the least. We have heard from others how the clarion calls came from the SNP in 2006 in support of the airport rail link, but tonight it is almost like we have the silence of the lambs. It is time that the SNP took its blinkers off. It should stop ripping off Glasgow and move forward with a decision that would support not just Glasgow but Scotland's economy. It must move forward now and support the airport rail link.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20287416", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Airport Rail Link"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in tonight's debate.

We wait and wait on the Beauly to Denny line; it is time for action.</p><p>The Council of Economic Advisers produced a report on all aspects of energy policy that Mr Mather told us three weeks ago was still in his in-tray.

It will be post-2011 before any of the schools that were announced a couple of weeks ago come to fruition. When 8,500 construction workers have been made redundant, the Scottish Futures Trust is an abysmal failure and a white elephant that the Government must bear.</p><p>The scrapping of six-month sentences and the creation of community payback orders will cost about &#163;28 million. We are not only telling prisoners that prison is \"a skoosh\", as the Cabinet Secretary for Justice said, and scrapping six-month sentences, but costing the public purse money in due course.

It comes at a good time, because it is important for us to consider energy policy and our strategy for it, and the report makes an important contribution to that debate.</p><p>I worked in the energy sector for a number of years. People who work in the sector sometimes get caught up in buzzwords, such as line loss factors and group correction factors, but looking from a bit more distance it strikes me that there are two key issues: we must produce a secure and efficient energy system that supports the economy, and we must ensure that we have policies that contribute to lower carbon emissions and lower bills, particularly for our pensioners. From that point of view, the report is crucial in that it highlights the importance of a political action plan in relation to energy. It strikes me that, although the minister may have a lot of initiatives and he obviously put a lot of work into the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, we need a bit more speed and urgency in several areas if we are to address concerns about energy in Scotland.</p><p>It is important to recognise the importance of energy to the economy. As Lewis Macdonald pointed out, Scotland is a net exporter of electricity via the interconnector to Northern Ireland and down to England. We want to ensure that our electricity system continues to produce surplus energy so that we can export it and, in the process, support the economy and Scottish workers' jobs. From that point of view, it is disappointing that the minister has yet to review the Council of Economic Advisers' report on energy, which can make an important contribution to the debate. I urge the minister to look at that promptly.</p><p>As others have said, it is important that we support renewables and get more on stream, but that must be tied to action on the Beauly to Denny line, which is an important part of the link. The Crown Estate has noted that its scheme to bring online 1000MW from the Pentland Firth depends on approval of the Beauly to Denny line.

There is no doubt that the bill is significant and that it will make an important contribution to the health and wellbeing of Scotland. All members will have received a number of submissions from different organisations, which shows the level of debate over the bill. The substantive part of the bill is obviously part 1, the main driver of which is to reduce smoking rates, which is an important policy driver in Scotland.</p><p>Although significant progress has been made in recent years&#8212;the percentage of people who smoke has dropped from 45 per cent to 25 per cent&#8212;and the smoking ban has clearly been a success, Michael Matheson was right to point out that 13,000 deaths each year can be attributed to smoking, as can the high prevalence of heart and lung disease.</p><p>Smoking also results in significant costs, which one briefing reckons amount to &#163;409 million for the NHS and &#163;837 million for the economy. At a time when we are struggling through an economic downturn, those are costs that we can ill afford.</p><p>As Robert Brown pointed out, smoking is also a health inequality issue. Smoking prevalence runs at 43 per cent in poorer areas but at only 12 per cent in more affluent areas. In terms of how people spend their money, the poorest 10 per cent of households spend 2.43 per cent of their income on smoking, whereas the equivalent figure for more affluent households is only 0.52 per cent.</p><p>From that point of view, the provisions in part 1 of the bill are important because they seek to reduce the incidence of smoking, particularly among young people, by introducing a number of different measures. The first of those is the ban on the display of tobacco products, which has been the subject of some discussion in this afternoon's debate. My feeling, which is backed up by evidence, is that tobacco advertising displays have an influence on young people. One study indicates that young people are 38 per cent more likely to purchase cigarettes if they have been exposed to <place-holder colnum=\"20024\"/> tobacco advertising. In addition, the statistics from Iceland show that the proportion of 15-year-olds who smoke has dropped from 18 per cent to 11 per cent over an eight-year period. That evidence weighs in favour of those who argue for a ban on tobacco displays. I know that some members, for example Ross Finnie, have cited the practical difficulties involved in such a ban, but I am sympathetic to the Government's proposal. I hope that the minister can work at stage 2 to address some of the concerns that have been raised.</p><p>On vending machines, Kenny Gibson was right to point out that 10 per cent of 15-year-olds and 13 per cent of 13-year-olds are able to purchase cigarettes from vending machines. The ban on cigarette vending machines will curtail the ability of young people to purchase cigarettes and to take up smoking. Evidence shows that, in some council areas in England, 100 per cent of young people were able to purchase cigarettes from vending machines. Those statistics are very concerning. Although concerns have been raised about job losses, I hope that appropriate discussions will take place to address the concerns that constituency members have raised.</p><p>I support the requirement to draw up a register of retailers, which will help to identify where sales of cigarettes take place. That will contribute to the success of schemes such as the enhanced tobacco sales enforcement programme, which aims to reduce the sale of tobacco to under-18s by 50 per cent by 2011. Information on the incidence of sales and on where tobacco retailers are located will help the targeting of test purchases and visits by trading standards officers.</p><p>The fixed penalty notices and tobacco retailing banning orders that the bill will introduce will also help because consistent breaches will result in a ban.</p><p>I will touch briefly on part 2 of the bill. I have concerns about the ability of community co-operatives and social enterprises to enter into contracts for medical services if part 2 is agreed to.</p><p>However, in summing up, let me return to part 1. There is no doubt that smoking kills. Eighty per cent of smokers take up smoking before they reach the age of 19, 41 people start smoking every day, and 35 people die every day as a result of tobacco use. Those are chilling statistics, which should focus the minds of the ministers on putting in place a bill that can be supported by all parties at stages 2 and 3.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20197534", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this important debate.

We have heard a number of important contributions this afternoon from committee members of all parties that demonstrate not only their knowledge and experience but the sound advice that they are able to give to Government ministers.</p><p>The importance of this debate is highlighted by the statistics, which are outlined in paragraph 9 of the report, on those who are overweight and those who are obese. The proportion of overweight men rose from 56 per cent in 1995 to 64 per cent in 2003, while the proportion of overweight females rose from 47 to 57 per cent during the same period. Obesity rates also rose during that time, from 16 to 22 per cent for males and from 17 to 24 per cent for females. That shows the scale of the challenge that we face.</p><p>The issue is not only the fact that Scotland now has more people who are overweight or obese but the knock-on effect that that has on the country's health. It means that more people in Scotland are suffering from heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which undermines their quality of life and affects their life expectancy. Given that we will, crucially, consider the budget tomorrow, we should acknowledge that those problems put a lot of pressure on the NHS budget, which has a knock-on effect on the economy. If people are not fit and able to do skilled jobs in Scotland, we will not be able to participate in economic competition with other countries.</p><p>The sporting events that will take place here in coming years offer opportunities to increase participation levels. The children's games are taking place in Lanarkshire in 2011; the Commonwealth games are taking place in 2014; and many people are looking forward to the Ryder cup coming back to Scotland, the home of golf. It is hoped that, in the run-up to those events, many youngsters will take part in sport to a greater extent, not only because they see the chance to represent their country but because the events give sport a higher profile. We are already beginning to see the benefits of that in the improvements in infrastructure around the country. In Toryglen, in my constituency, the football development centre has recently opened. I have been there a number of times for events; it is a fantastic facility, which is already being used by a lot of youngsters. I can only hope that it will provide an inspiration for the national football team to be a bit more successful in the next competition that it enters.<place-holder colnum=\"19606\"/></p><p>As the minister outlined in her speech, it is important that we consider the legacy from the Commonwealth games. That brings us to the question of what we seek and what we want to achieve with regard to sport in our country. We are looking for more participation, particularly among younger people, which would improve fitness and health. We would also like to see more success at a sporting level. It was good that the committee took evidence from elite athletes such as Liz McColgan who have had a degree of sporting success. Those elite athletes spoke in particular about the importance of PE and participation in sport at a younger age, and about their participation when they were at school.</p><p>Members have already commented on the fact that the two-hour PE target has not been met. In order to meet those objectives, we need to look not only at the targets but at our infrastructure. I was interested to read in the report that it would take &#163;540 million to upgrade the 338 swimming pools in Scotland so that they are fit-for-purpose facilities. I was disappointed to read that Meadowbank, the scene of great Commonwealth games in 1970 and 1986, has fallen into a state of disrepair. We must look at our facilities.</p><p>The SNP must take more responsibility for the PE target and for improving the infrastructure.

In addition, the Government has access to end-year flexibility money, which it has still not drawn down, to the value of at least &#163;95 million. Therefore, the Government will in fact have a &#163;700 million increase.</p><p>The SNP has wasted some money in the Government's budget. For example, &#163;22.9 million has been spent on the Scottish Futures Trust, which to date has not delivered a single project. The national conversation has cost &#163;700,000. That might keep the SNP bloggers happy, as they sit up all night logging on to the website, but it has done nothing to address the problems that Scotland faces. The infamous leaked memo has revealed that 14 Government teams are working on referendum bill issues. That must involve very high running costs&#8212;towards the &#163;1 million mark, I suggest&#8212;but it is not addressing the issues in Scotland that need to be addressed.</p><p>In addition, the Government has made some poor policy choices. I realise that I am running out of time, so let me mention just one such policy&#8212;I see that the Presiding Officer is indicating that I have perhaps a bit more time&#8212;which is the pursuit of community service orders and the scrapping of jail sentences of less than six months. I know from my experience as a constituency member that the <place-holder colnum=\"19542\"/> policy is very unpopular in my constituency, where people want a strong message to be sent out to criminals. Not only is that arguably the wrong policy, it will cost &#163;7.5 million this year alone and it will obviously cost money in future years.</p><p>Another issue is the fact that the Government is wedded to the Scottish Futures Trust and to a single funding mechanism, that is, the non-profit-distributing model. That has resulted in the pipeline of capital projects drying up. Compared with 2007, when &#163;1.3 billion of projects was in the pipeline, the two subsequent years have seen a &#163;2 billion decrease. We can see that in the 20,000 construction workers who lost their jobs last year.

The net loss of 31 bodies is part of the drive to achieve the SNP's target of a 25 per cent reduction in the number of public bodies, and an official at the Finance Committee gave the impression that the proposal is still very much on the table for the Government.

My constituents, Mr Balmer and Mr Dryden, had difficulty at times acquiring information about the process as their application went through the pharmacy practice committee and the national appeal panel. I have specific concerns about the role of Community Pharmacy Scotland in the application. At the appeal on the original application, the organisation's chairman and a senior member of its executive committee both objected. They have pharmacies locally, but Community Pharmacy Scotland has representation on the national appeal panel and I submit that that is a conflict of interest. In this case, it was not declared. That is a problem, and it must be addressed in the consultation.</p><p>Mr Balmer and Mr Dryden have an excellent case for their application.

In that regard, I welcome initiatives that have been taken at the UK and Scottish levels, including the bringing forward of the capital acceleration programme, which has brought much-needed investment into the Scottish economy, measures in the budget earlier in the year to create 7,800 apprenticeships, and support for the PACE scheme to help people whose jobs are under threat find employment in other areas. Those are important aspects.</p><p>I know a lot about the threat of unemployment in my area. In January 2009, the Vion plant in Cambuslang announced 142 proposed job losses. Fortunately, as a result of the good work of the trade union and the company, 56 of those jobs have been saved in the short term, until the end of the year. That is a positive development, which is to be welcomed. However, building on that is important. Shortly, I will host a meeting in the Parliament that will involve Unite, Vion, the Scottish Government and agency representation, to consider how we can protect the Cambuslang plant and build a sustainable future for it.</p><p>In that context, the ProAct initiative, which has been welcomed, is worth considering. The minister and Derek Brownlee questioned the scheme's viability and asked whether such a scheme would contribute towards economic growth in Scotland. Such a scheme would introduce short-time working in Cambuslang, keep people in employment there and contribute to protecting the local economy, which would contribute to the wider Scottish economy.</p><p>The SNP must do more for the economy. Last October, it announced a six-point plan, which in essence tinkered at the edges. We need a plan that gives more details about some of the announcements that were made in the budget and which reflects the new economic circumstances. It is essential that we know how the 7,800 apprenticeships will be rolled out across Scotland. Last week, I was contacted by a constituent whose 16-year-old son is keen to get a job as an apprentice joiner.

It is important that we learn the lessons of 2007, but we should also look to the future rather than rehearse the arguments that were made in the run-up to the 2007 elections, as some other speakers have done.</p><p>There is no doubt that elections are very much at the heart of politics and close to politicians. I participated in my first election campaign in 1982, and I have always enjoyed elections. I enjoy the process of engaging with voters, competing with the other political parties and the build-up to election day itself, which is the climax of the process, when people turn out and vote and the results are declared.</p><p>It was, therefore, a matter of great pride to me when I stood for the first time as a constituency candidate in the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007. That pride diminished somewhat as I witnessed the events of the day. I stood in polling stations and watched voters being confused by the number of ballot papers that they had to complete and the different electoral systems that they had to deal with, and I saw them leaving the voting booths and being horrified when they were told that they had not completed their ballot papers correctly. As the day and the night unfolded, it became clear that there were thousands of uncounted ballot papers in the Scottish Parliament elections and that, as others have said, there was an unusually high proportion of spoiled ballot papers in the local government elections.</p><p>Clearly, lessons had to be learned. From that point of view, I think that decoupling the elections is the right thing to do, as that will allow voters to be clear about the elections that they are participating in. Following on from that, it is logical that we will have to introduce a new cycle of elections, and it is correct that the next local government elections should be in 2012 and 2017 and that, thereafter, they should revert to a traditional four-year cycle.</p><p>There has been a great deal of discussion about voter turnout. One risk of decoupling the elections concerns the impact on voter turnout in 2012. We should remember that 2012 will be the third year in a row that the public will have participated in elections: this year, we have the European elections; next year, we will probably have a UK general election; and the following year, we will have Scottish Parliament elections. I should correct myself&#8212;that means that the elections in 2012 will be the fourth time in a row that people will have been asked to vote, but that just strengthens my point.</p><p>It is therefore important that we address the issue of voter education and try to increase voter turnout. Having witnessed the STV system at work in 2007 and in subsequent council by-elections, I <place-holder colnum=\"17457\"/> am clear that there is still some confusion about the system. I have seen voters appearing at the polling station a bit worried about the process of casting their vote in this new system. We have to overcome those fears by embarking on a proper programme of voter education.</p><p>There are also important issues about the differences in turnout across the country.

The budget comes at a time of economic crisis throughout the world. In the US, industrial production declined in 13 of the past 14 months. In Japan, car production is down 56 per cent on the previous year. Even in a growing economy such as China, growth is declining.</p><p>I welcome the measures that the UK Government has introduced. Listening to SNP members in recent times, one might wonder what the UK Government has done for Scotland. Alex Salmond was at it again at First Minister's question time today. Only six months ago, an intervention of &#163;50 billion was made to support the banking system, of which the main beneficiaries in Scotland were the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. That positive intervention by the UK Government averted a catastrophe and saved jobs in the financial sector throughout Scotland.</p><p>In November, we saw the &#163;20 billion stimulus package, &#163;2 billion of which will have a direct impact on the Scottish economy in these difficult times. In last week's announcement, we heard of the action that is being taken to guarantee jobs for the long-term unemployed and of investment in offshore industries&#8212;which is obviously of help to Scotland&#8212;and carbon capture and storage, including at Longannet in Fife. Those are positive measures. As other members have mentioned, the Scottish budget will increase by &#163;2.2 billion over <place-holder colnum=\"17010\"/> the next two years. That will give Scotland a budget that is twice the level that it was when Donald Dewar was appointed as First Minister back in 1999.</p><p>It is also important to explode the myth that the SNP puts about when it says that the 2010-11 budget has been cut in real terms. The figure of 1.3 per cent is given in Stella Manzie's letter and the figure of 0.5 per cent is given in the SPICe table; both documents say that the budget will grow in real terms. The budget is not being cut, so it is disingenuous of the cabinet secretary to suggest that it is.</p><p>It is particularly annoying that the reprofiling of capital has been taken out and displayed as a cut. That is a bit like a person getting their salary in advance, going to the boss on pay day and saying, \"Wait a minute, boss. I've still not been paid.\" The SNP must spend more time promoting jobs and the Scottish economy rather than talking down Scotland and talking about cuts when the budget is growing in real terms.</p><p>I have some practical suggestions about how the SNP might get more out of the budget. The provisions relating to community payback orders in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill send a signal to Scotland that we will take a soft-touch approach towards criminals by relaxing sentences of less than six months. There will also be a &#163;10.6 million drain on the public purse, according to the financial memorandum to the bill, which lacks detail&#8212;that is not the first time that that has happened. In my opinion, the financial memorandum underestimates the costs of the policy.</p><p>We are two years into the SNP Administration and we still do not have a business plan from the Scottish Futures Trust, which costs &#163;22.9 million. What a shocking waste of public money.</p><p>In the ministerial reshuffle, Mike Russell was given responsibility for independence, but independence is a dead duck. The other three main parties in the Parliament do not support it, and having ministers and civil servants spend time on it when Scotland faces a difficult time with jobs is a waste of public money.</p><p>The Government should support microgeneration, for example, and introduce its energy efficiency plan instead of delaying it for a year. That would reduce carbon emissions, cut fuel bills and put money back into people's pockets. It is also important to support credit unions at this time.</p><p>These are serious times. We must consider how to move Scotland forward. Alex Salmond and John Swinney are the grumpy old men of Scottish politics.

There is no doubt that if we build modern schools in which our children can learn, our children will be skilled up in order to take advantage of the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy. If we invest in transport projects, we will improve connectivity and promote economic growth. If we invest in housing, we can take construction workers off the dole and give homes to the homeless.</p><p>There are a lot of issues to cover, but I have only four minutes in which to do so. I will pick out a few highlights. I will start with some comments on the non-profit-distributing model. Back in 2007, when the SNP was drawing up its manifesto&#8212;when, it seemed to me, it was in fairyland&#8212;it told the voters that it was going to abolish PPP and replace it with a low-interest scheme that would develop public infrastructure projects throughout the country. The reality is that, just because the non-profit-distributing scheme includes the words \"non-profit\", that does not mean that there are no profits. There are profits, and they are generally similar in an NPD scheme and in a PPP scheme, except that under an NPD scheme, profits are <place-holder colnum=\"16383\"/> capped, which prohibits some investors from entering the market. In addition, the Scottish Government's default option is NPD, which will put investors off coming forward. That limits competition from bids, so taxpayers do not obtain value for money. The NPD option is not value for money.</p><p>The report discusses options appraisals. Full options appraisals that cover all funding methods should be undertaken. That would allow us to explore what achieves the best value for the taxpayer. I have no doubt that that would introduce the option of PPP. KPMG told the committee that PPP finance rates were 0.6 per cent greater than Public Works Loan Board rates. There is no doubt that PPP provides certainty, delivers 80 per cent of projects on time, as Gavin Brown said, and minimises risks.</p><p>The SNP has different messages for different audiences. I have no doubt that Joe FitzPatrick's speech would go down well at the SNP conference but, last week, Alex Salmond was at Forth Valley hospital to open a PPP facility. All over the country, SNP ministers are ready with their hard hats and shiny trowels for topping-out ceremonies at PPP facilities.</p><p>The clocks went forward at the weekend, but the SNP is stuck in reverse.

I thank all the MSPs from different political parties who signed the motion and the MSPs who wrote in support of the workforce.</p><p>The redundancies, 150 of them in Cambuslang, were proposed in January as part of a loss of 820 jobs in the Vion Food Group. The main reason for the redundancies was the withdrawal of contracts by Marks and Spencer. There are 450 jobs in the factory and it is proposed that 150 of them be cut. If the job losses go ahead, the effect on Cambuslang will be devastating. Vion is one of the largest employers in the area, and it has a history that goes back more than 25 years&#8212;initially, the company was called Chunky Chicken, then it was called Grampian Foods.</p><p>As the constituency MSP for the area, I am concerned about the human cost of the potential loss of jobs and the stress that individuals and families will be under as people try to chase alternative employment. Earlier in the week we heard that 10 people are chasing every vacancy. I do not want that to happen in Cambuslang; it would have an adverse effect on the local economy and a knock-on effect in areas such as the neighbouring town of Rutherglen.</p><p>Unite has fought a strong campaign against the proposed job losses, which has been headed up by Scott Walker and Tom McAndrew, the local shop stewards, who I am delighted to say are in the public gallery this evening, and they have been well supported by local politicians, including Tommy McAvoy MP and Walter Brogan and Richard Tullet&#8212;two of the local councillors in the Cambuslang East ward. I am also delighted to say that we have had support from other MSPs and <place-holder colnum=\"16090\"/> that the stewards were recently visited by Margaret Curran MSP and Catherine Stihler MEP.</p><p>Situations such as the one that we are discussing should make us glad that there are trade unions. Decisions to cut jobs have a bad effect on the community and the workforce, and there is a requirement on trade unions to organise in workplaces and take a stand against decisions that will adversely affect working people.</p><p>I understand that commercial organisations will make decisions based on viability, but Marks and Spencer, like other retail organisations, is pushing an ethical trading policy and talking up social responsibility. I would argue that one of the reasons why it is doing that is to try to attract customers to its stores and, therefore, to boost its income&#8212;but it cannot have it both ways; it cannot talk up ethical trading and claim to be socially responsible while it is taking a decision that will rip the heart out of Cambuslang. I challenge Marks and Spencer to reverse its decision.</p><p>I welcome the responses that I and other MSPs have received about partnership action on continuing employment&#8212;PACE&#8212;and alternative markets, but I think that the Scottish Government could have done more. In October, Richard Lochhead announced investment in the food industry of &#163;75 million over five years, but none of that money has come to Cambuslang. In the latest tranche of grants, &#163;230,000 has gone to factories in John Swinney's constituency and more than &#163;360,000 has gone to a factory in Alex Salmond's constituency.</p><p>I would also be interested to know what pressure ministers have exerted on Marks and Spencer. I ask the minister to say in his summing-up speech whether there have been any meetings between Government officials or ministers and representatives of Marks and Spencer in the past fortnight and whether the concerns of the workforce in Cambuslang have been raised with Marks and Spencer.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, this morning, John Swinney agreed to meet the local trade unions, although I note that the request for that meeting was submitted a month ago. I think that progress has been a bit slow in that regard. It seems to me that other areas have taken priority over Cambuslang. I note the closure of NCR in Dundee and I wish the Dundee community well and hope that their jobs are safeguarded. The Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism was quick to get to Dundee, but it has taken me a month to get that meeting with local unions at Cambuslang.</p><p>The motion provides a platform from which to support the workforce at Cambuslang and challenge Marks and Spencer to reverse its decision.

He recently became blind because of an accident. When I spoke to him, I was struck by how much that had affected his life. That made me reflect on what it is like for people to lose their sight or never to have had sight. We all become caught up in our own hectic lives, but when we reflect on such situations, we realise the struggles that blind and visually impaired people must face and the situations that they must overcome.</p><p>The advent of the Braille system has helped people to read, to communicate and to experience much more in life. The life of Louis Braille shows that he was used to struggling against adversity. It is obvious that he was a strong character to overcome his circumstances. Robert Brown and Stuart McMillan spoke about that. At the age of 10, Louis Braille left his village in France to go to a school in Paris, which must have been daunting and intimidating. He was determined to learn to read. The school that he attended had only 14 books with raised-type letters. He read them all, but he encountered difficulty in reading the sentences, because the letters were so large that by the time the end of the sentence was reached, it was sometimes difficult to remember what the sentence conveyed. As a result, he became determined to produce a more concise system, so he developed the coded format that we have now.</p><p>Society owes a lot to Louis Braille's work. We are glad that Scotland has a number of campaigns and campaigners who continue the work on behalf of the blind. I pay tribute to two campaigners in my constituency&#8212;Jimmy and Margaret O'Rourke&#8212;who are steadfast workers on behalf of such organisations.</p><p>As for what the Scottish Government can do, it can consider several issues. It is important to learn the lessons of the previous elections and to consider the report on them. In more than 25 years in which I have been involved in elections, several times when blind people have turned up to vote, people at polling stations and&#8212;it must be said&#8212;representatives of political parties have been unsure of how to deal with them. I am struck by how a blind or visually impaired person feels about that. Are they likely to return to vote and to participate in the democratic process? The lesson is that we must put in place the correct procedures if we are to encourage people to come and vote.</p><p>I am aware that I am running out of time, Presiding Officer, but I want to mention two further important areas: access to health and social care, including support for the Scottish vision strategy; and education and the right to learn campaign.<place-holder colnum=\"15427\"/></p><p>I welcome the motion that Robert Brown has brought to the chamber and the opportunity that it has given to celebrate Louis Braille's life.

Like others, I compliment the Justice Committee on its report. There is no doubt that an extensive and comprehensive piece of work has been produced by the experienced members of the committee. When I attended a recent meeting of the committee for a constituency matter, I saw the committee's work at first hand and was very impressed by members' knowledge of justice matters. That knowledge has been brought to bear in the report.</p><p>For many of us, at our constituency offices and surgeries issues of crime and antisocial behaviour continue to dominate. Only last night, I was contacted by a constituent who was frightened to leave her house because of criminal activity and antisocial behaviour in her local community. In Cambuslang last week, while council workers were attempting to clear the local bandstand, they came under attack from local youths. In the face of such incidents, the increasing presence of community police officers will help. As Cathie Craigie said, there is no doubt that they are a good thing. They are essential in our communities, and people are looking for them to be visible and to provide reassurance and stability for our communities.</p><p>A number of aspects of the Justice Committee report can be implemented to strengthen community policing. It is important that training at the Scottish Police College is enhanced by ensuring that it includes modules on community policing. There is no doubt that community policing is a different kind of police work. As Stuart McMillan noted, speaking to the public requires skill. Community police officers have to speak to different groups, such as younger and older people, and to build up support and confidence in the community. To be able to do that, community police officers must be trained up. In addition, as the report states, it is important that middle and senior-ranking officers are also trained so that they <place-holder colnum=\"15166\"/> understand the importance of community policing and how it can be used to combat crime and minimise its impact on communities.</p><p>I note the report's comments on the delivery of community policing in multimember wards, which make a lot of sense. Many communities and their services are in multimember wards, and community groups and other organisations can identify with their local community police officers.</p><p>I support the report's comments and the comments of members, including Paul Martin, about the tenure of community police officers. That issue is raised with me regularly in Rutherglen and Cambuslang. When community police officers are appointed, there is a learning curve. They have to learn the job, establish themselves within the community and win the confidence of different groups. Sometimes, once that process has been completed and the officer has settled in, they are moved to another post, which results in some instability in the community and the whole confidence-building process having to begin again. I therefore support the proposal for a minimum tenure of two years. I understand that that is an operational matter, but, on balance, the needs of the community are better served by community police officers who serve for at least two years.</p><p>On the issue of police numbers, the committee notes the importance of resources. The Scottish National Party's stated objective is to go from 16,236 to 17,236 police officers, and the Parliament will monitor that closely. The Government might have difficulty with that policy, because it has not thought it through and considered the number of retirals, which will be in excess of 600. Resources need to account for that if we are to reach the target of 1,000 additional officers.</p><p>I commend the committee for its work in raising the profile of community policing, which, when used effectively, can provide reassurance to Scotland's communities and help to combat crime and antisocial behaviour.

Indeed, the Liberal Democrats described the budget as \"woefully inadequate\". There was a lack of investment in jobs and not enough hope for our youngsters. There were concerns that there had been a failure to protect front-line services in the national health service. As a result, the budget was voted down. Today, we have before us an improved, enhanced budget, on which I think we can all agree.

As I said, the Parliament sent the SNP Administration a clear signal that the budget was not good enough. To give the cabinet secretary his due, he has worked hard over the past seven days in discussions with other political parties to bring to the chamber an amended budget that can be agreed on tonight. A week on, we have ended up with a budget that, I hope, can be agreed upon, and the world has not fallen apart, despite what the Conservatives predicted last Thursday.

In the past week, 150 jobs have, unfortunately, been lost at the Vion plant in Cambuslang. Job losses are being announced regularly throughout Scotland. In such times, we should look for a package that will boost communities and jobs and lead to investment in skills. Those are priorities.</p><p>Protecting the NHS is also a priority. There are 37 general practitioners in Rutherglen and Cambuslang. That is the fourth lowest number of GPs in the 73 Scottish parliamentary constituencies. The NHS budget becomes more important at a time when we need to address health inequalities.</p><p>The Scottish Government has come up short in delivering in those areas. With respect to jobs and skills, it has not supported the Labour Party's proposal to produce 23,400 apprentices over the three-year period. Proposing that at this time is correct for two reasons. First, jobs would be boosted and our young people would be helped. Secondly, people would be skilled up for when we come out of the recession or economic downturn in the future.</p><p>The full 3.9 per cent increase in health spending will not be passed on to health boards in the budget; only 3.2 per cent will be passed on to the boards.

That underspend would fund the spending that is required to meet the shortfall in NHS board budgets.</p><p>The Government should ditch the Scottish Futures Trust. For a start, that would raise &#163;23 million from that organisation's budget, particularly from its payroll costs. To coin a phrase, film-star wages are being paid. Furthermore, if the Government is serious about boosting the economy, it should drop the local income tax proposals. Doing so would bring forward &#163;281 million from future budgets.</p><p>The budget should be opposed. It will not meet the needs of our times; it will not lead to investment in skills or jobs; and it will not protect the NHS.

A recent report by Experian noted that Rutherglen is likely to be one of the five towns that are worst affected by the recession. Almost at the same time that the report was published, that was shown by the closure of Woolworths on Rutherglen's Main Street. Sadly, the situation has deteriorated this week with Vion's announcement of the proposed loss of 150 jobs in the food processing plant in Cambuslang. That is unfortunate, given that Vion took over Grampian Country Foods only last June. The First Minister had a meeting with Vion&#8212;as did Richard Lochhead in October&#8212;and he said that he hoped that Vion would change the landscape. It has certainly changed the landscape in Cambuslang by proposing to put workers on the dole, which is not welcome.</p><p>I note the Council of Economic Advisers report's contribution to the economic debate, but we are more concerned about the impact of the economic situation on the ground. We do not need an economics doctorate to see the impact in Cambuslang and Rutherglen, given the \"for sale\" and \"to let\" signs that are going up in shops in the main streets. We can also see the effects in the faces of the workers at Vion who are facing <place-holder colnum=\"14277\"/> potential redundancy. Those workers and their families are experiencing a really emotional and difficult time. They are looking for practical actions. They are looking to see what Jim Mather, as Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, can bring forward and what Richard Lochhead, who has responsibility for food, can do to revitalise the food processing plant. Overall, people are looking for jobs and skills to be prioritised to revitalise their communities and boost our town centres. We have to face those major issues.</p><p>The report addresses the major issue of energy, to which the Conservative amendment refers. There are big challenges for the SNP Administration, given its stated aim to bring forward plans to reduce emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. It is one thing to make such a policy commitment, but it is another to deliver it. We are all committed to boosting and encouraging renewables, but the SNP Administration has turned down a number of renewables schemes, and there is still a delay in the Beauly to Denny network. If we are really going to push renewables, the infrastructure must be in place to support that.</p><p>The Administration attempts to face both ways on the nuclear question: it is prepared to extend the lifespan of nuclear plants, but, at the same time, it says that it is not in favour of the nuclear option.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621968", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill: Stage 3: \"First Annual Report of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers: December 2008\" (Scottish Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate, which comes at a relevant time, given that the economy has dominated the Scottish, UK and world political scenes in recent months.

That this debate is important has been shown by some of the speeches that we have heard.</p><p>As MSPs, many of us have experienced people coming to our surgery to express frustrations about criminal activity and the inability of the police and court service to track down and punish such activity. We must keep those frustrations to the fore in recognising the issues that we are considering.</p><p>Like Bill Butler, who spoke about public safety, and Bill Aitken, who spoke about public confidence, I think that it is important that we reassure the public by the legislation that the Parliament makes. We need to reassure communities and punish criminals.</p><p>We also need to look at how we tackle prison overcrowding. Recent trends show that there has been a decline in crime, but there has also been a rise in the amount of serious crime in certain areas, along with a rise in detection rates, which has contributed to the rise in prison numbers.</p><p>Some aspects of the McLeish commission's work are to be welcomed and are being included in the offender management plan. It makes sense that we have an efficient prosecution service that operates effectively so that those who are charged with crimes are brought to court quickly and justice is administered effectively. That would restore the public confidence that members have been talking about.</p><p>I echo other members' comments about younger prisoners. Mingling with older prisoners can have an adverse effect on younger people who are entering prison for the first time, so it is important to keep them separate from older prisoners and to have separate youth facilities. It would also be helpful to have a separate youth hearings system.</p><p>Angela Constance made some important points about consistent sentencing and she gave some good examples of the variations that exist. Sentencing guidelines need to be consistent and some aspects of the McLeish commission's work on sentencing are being implemented.</p><p>If we are to stop people reoffending, we need to reintegrate them into society, so it is crucial that social work and health services are able to provide backup and support as people return to the community. Again, some work on that is being taken forward.</p><p>There are, however, some flaws in the SNP's thinking. Richard Simpson noted the logic around the numbers, which I do not think stacks up. It seems that the commission, and the Government in its work that followed the commission, are <place-holder colnum=\"13874\"/> saying that prisoner numbers are at 7,500 and they want to get them down to 5,000. There does not seem to be a lot of evidence on how and when we will get to that figure of 5,000. More work needs to be done on that.</p><p>We also need to look at why serious crime is on the rise in certain areas, and why people are reoffending, re-entering prison and boosting the prison population. I share some of the concerns that have been expressed about the ruling out of six-month sentences. For example, that could allow 81 per cent of knife criminals to re-enter the community, and that is dangerous. Mr MacAskill and Mr Ewing are in danger of becoming the \"Softly Softly\" task force with regard to that.</p><p>There are also some important issues about costs. Robert Brown mentioned the brief from the ADSW and the fact that one council indicated that there would be a 30 per cent increase in its workload if it had to take on those who are currently serving sentences of less than six months. If that situation were to be replicated throughout the 32 councils in Scotland, it would put a lot of strain on budgets, which, as other members have pointed out, are already under severe pressure in areas such as Fife. Indeed, in the past 18 months, we have seen that the number of staff who deal with such cases has been cut by 500. We need to take a joined-up approach to dealing with those issues. We need to look at how to reduce prison numbers and consider the costs of resourcing that properly.</p><p>I welcome some of the proposals in the offender management plan, but I am concerned about the ruling out of sentences of six months or less. We need to pay greater heed to victims and I welcome David Stewart's work on a member's bill to create a victims commissioner. We need to send out a strong signal; a soft approach is not the way forward. We need to continue to make it clear that crime does not pay.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551667", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offender Management Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak in support of the Labour amendment.

As Angela Constance said, it is appropriate in the week preceding Christmas that we debate a theme that relates to religious issues.</p><p>The motion is important because it raises environmental issues and mentions what communities can do to tackle them, by reducing carbon emissions and raising awareness of the issues. As leaders in the community, churches are well placed to do that. After all, as Des McNulty pointed out, they are places where people gather. I think that the environment is an ideal issue to educate the community about and those who practise in churches throughout Scotland will be able to raise its profile.</p><p>In my area, not only has St Cuthbert's church in Cambuslang been awarded eco-congregation status but King's Park church has recently applied for it. On Monday, I met representatives of Burnside Blairbeth church to discuss their very active eco-congregation programme, which has been promoted very effectively by a parishioner, John Redshaw, and the minister, William Wilson. The programme's three aspects include finding ways of being more energy efficient and tackling environmental issues in the church itself; to that end, church members have looked at ways of recycling litter and saving energy in the church building. Such buildings&#8212;many of which were constructed 100 years or more ago, have quite <place-holder colnum=\"13512\"/> high ceilings and tend to use a lot of heat and energy&#8212;raise interesting challenges with regard to reducing energy consumption.</p><p>The organisation has encouraged the various groups who use the church to think about how they might tackle environmental issues; for example, the local scout group regularly clears up litter in the area. Moreover, the church has used its position to engage the community and is working with the Energy Saving Trust on publicising ways of saving energy in the area. For example, stalls have been set up in local supermarkets.</p><p>The Parliament needs to consider how to take forward such issues. Indeed, we can do a number of important things. As well as supporting the work of eco-congregations, we could think about how best practice might be extended to other parts of the community. We should also ensure that, in our debates on energy saving, microgeneration, fuel poverty and so on, we tie the work of eco-congregations into the relevant policy areas.</p><p>Des McNulty's motion has certainly given rise to an excellent debate, with many positive comments from members.

Against that backdrop, the Scottish budget is important, and Parliament and the Finance Committee have a crucial job in scrutinising it.</p><p>However, there are flaws in the process. We require more information about and more transparency on the efficiency savings, which amount to &#163;1.5 billion over the spending review period. When the cabinet secretary was questioned about where the efficiency savings were in the different budget lines, he said that they had been netted off. Therefore, if someone is looking for the results of the efficiency savings and how they will boost schools, promote the health service and improve the housing sector, they will not see them in the budget documentation. In some cases, they will not see them in the efficiency delivery plans&#8212;the Scottish Prison Service, for example, did not provide any description of its planned savings. A 21<sup>st</sup> century Parliament needs more information than that. We <place-holder colnum=\"13482\"/> need a direct link between efficiency delivery plans and the draft budget document so that we can see the results of efficiency savings.</p><p>The concordat is much trumpeted by SNP members, but we still do not have detailed costings on it. As we examine the budget documentation, it is inappropriate that we cannot see the costings of a set of promises or commitments that have been made. I regret that the Tories joined forces with the SNP to vote down amendments on that. As a result, we will not see the appropriate level of scrutiny.</p><p>The council tax freeze was much lauded by Joe FitzPatrick, but it is essential to consider local government as a whole. There is no doubt that cuts are being made in local government and that councils that are considering their budgets for next year face increasing pressures because of efficiency targets and rising energy costs. I listened carefully to last week's debate on the local government finance settlement, and my colleague Hugh Henry gave details from Renfrew on the education budget cuts, the closure of day centres and recycling cuts.

If we boost the rail network and improve connectivity, we can also boost the economy and retain and grow the number of jobs in Scotland. Increasing the number of passengers who use the rail network is also important to reducing carbon emissions and helping the environment.</p><p>There are serious concerns about the process. The contract's value is &#163;2.5 billion over its lifetime and the three-year extension is worth &#163;900 million. The fact that no formal business plan was produced for the extension is astonishing. The minister chides Des McNulty about detail, but the minister did not examine the detail of a business plan. The extension seems to have been granted on the basis of a PowerPoint presentation. Rather than signing up to a contract extension, the approach seems to have been, \"Click on the contract extension button and off you go boys, that's your extension.\" It is clear that several members are concerned that the extension was awarded before Audit Scotland's investigation was completed. In addition, trade unions and passenger groups were not consulted.</p><p>I draw members' attention to a case that my constituent Scott Bowie from Rutherglen raised with me recently. He and his partner were stuck on a train from Glasgow Central station to Rutherglen for two hours, during which communication about the problem was lacking and the train's toilet facilities did not work. He described other train delays in the area and said that three-carriage trains were being operated at peak times. That is clearly unacceptable against the backdrop that he and his partner spend &#163;1,500 on rail fares each year. I have taken up those matters with ScotRail, because they are for it and not for the minister. However, when passengers have such concerns about ScotRail's service and the lack of facilities on trains, surely when the contract extension was being considered pressure should have been put on ScotRail to seek improvements. Passengers were not given the opportunity to be involved.<place-holder colnum=\"13295\"/></p><p>Another concern is that the extension agreement raised the revenue-sharing threshold by 8 percentage points. That says clearly to ScotRail that although the Government made great play yesterday of putting in place transport infrastructure, improving infrastructure and boosting the economy, ScotRail can continue earning money and can do so up to a higher limit before the taxpayer shares those higher income levels.</p><p>Questions must be answered by the PowerPoint wizard&#8212;the minister.

The town has a number of other facilities and sights.</p><p>The debate gives us an opportunity to celebrate St Andrew's day, to reflect on the successes of Scottish life and to contemplate what sort of future we want for Scotland. When we look back at the history of Scotland, there is much to reflect on. It is interesting that the debate is being held on the same day as the statement on science. We have proud engineering and scientific traditions. Each day, as I come to Edinburgh on the train, I look across at the Forth rail bridge and often marvel at what a tremendous engineering achievement it is.</p><p>For its scientific achievements, which include those of Fleming, Bell and Baird, Scotland stands out as a beacon to the world. One in every 100 <place-holder colnum=\"12911\"/> people who are employed in Scotland is a scientist. Challenges have been faced in the past, and our scientists can face them in the future, in key areas such as energy, renewables and climate change. They can help us to tackle some of the Parliament's policy priorities, such as reducing carbon emissions, tackling fuel poverty and keeping Scotland's lights burning.</p><p>I welcome Linda Fabiani's comments about the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns. The spirit of Burns is alive and well in my constituency. Many of the schools in Rutherglen and Cambuslang participate in the Bridgeton Burns competition that is held every January. Calderwood primary school and St Columbkilles primary school were successful in the competition last year, and I wish them every success in the coming competition. Participation in such competitions and celebration of the life and poetry of Burns help with the creation of good young citizens. I see evidence of that in the schools in my constituency, where many of the youngsters who take part in Burns-related events go on to participate in fair trade events and to campaign on such issues.</p><p>The debate gives us an opportunity to consider what sort of Scotland we want to create and allows us to speak up for the people of Scotland. We want a Scotland that has modern schools, not a Scotland where a third of schools are not fit for purpose. We want schools in which we can educate our young people so that they can go on to be leaders in society. We want a Scotland that has a strong health service that will tackle health inequalities, not a Scotland where&#8212;as is the case in my constituency&#8212;there are fewer general practitioners in areas of deprivation than there are in more prosperous constituencies, where life expectancy is higher. We want a Scotland that will make progress on meeting the 2012 homelessness targets and achieve the campaign objectives that many of us signed up to last week when the Shelter campaign came to the Parliament.</p><p>A number of members have mentioned the independence debate. Some people wave the saltire and claim that St Andrew's day will help the cause of independence, but I do not subscribe to that view. Recent events have weakened the case for independence. The arc of prosperity has crumbled. One need only look at the situation in Iceland, where the banks are in crisis, where interest rates went up by 6 per cent in one day&#8212;a greater rise than took place under the Tories on black Wednesday&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271646", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew's Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate on St Andrew's day and, in a spirit of consensus, I endorse the Tory amendment.

I thank members across the chamber who have supported and signed it, and welcome the many members of the Parkinson's Disease Society who have joined us in the gallery following a successful event this afternoon, which showed the Scottish Parliament at its best. Many members of the society were at the event in committee room 1, and I think that more than 50 MSPs attended the event to listen to the society's concerns and meet constituents. The event was positive and is to be welcomed.</p><p>I pay tribute to the work of the Mansionhouse Parkinson's support group, which covers the Rutherglen and Cambuslang area in my constituency. In particular, I pay tribute to Harry Hay, who is a stalwart of that group. Harry was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease five years ago at the age of 53, but has not let it get him down. He has campaigned steadily and raised many funds for the society. He cannot be here today, as he is at a farmers club in Stonehouse, which has agreed to contribute &#163;500 to the society. That in itself tells a story. The club has six members with <place-holder colnum=\"12547\"/> Parkinson's disease, which shows how the disease impacts on many families throughout Scotland.</p><p>There are 10,000 Parkinson's disease sufferers in Scotland. That equates to around 130 sufferers in the Rutherglen and Cambuslang area. There is a considerable human impact not only on those who have the disease, but on their families and carers as they look after those who are near and dear to them. The importance of getting the correct medication on time is crucial in order to stabilise and minimise the disease's effects. In that context, the Parkinson's Disease Society must be congratulated on its get it on time campaign, which has won awards.</p><p>There is no doubt that the effects of not getting medication on time can be detrimental. There can be physical impacts on people&#8212;they can be unable to move, speak, eat or swallow. In addition, there can be cost implications, because additional interventions can be required to stabilise patients. Admission to hospital may be required and higher levels of nursing and medical support can be associated with extended hospital stays.</p><p>As well as raising the profile of the issues through the get it on time campaign, other measures can be taken to alleviate the problems. Those include self-administration policies and other practical measures such as the use of pill timers and alarm clocks to remind Parkinson's sufferers when to take their medication. Hospital audits to ensure that hospitals use the correct procedures could be positive. The Parkinson's Disease Society has been active in issuing materials, including wash bags, to those who are admitted to hospital. It also has a best practice guide so that people can follow the correct procedures.</p><p>Overall, it is important to raise awareness of the issues so that we can try to alleviate the effects of Parkinson's for sufferers. An increase in the number of Parkinson's disease nurse specialists would also help. I pay tribute to Jacqui Kerr in my constituency, who is a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist in the Glasgow area. The nurse specialists are expert in specialist care and in ensuring that patients get their medication on time. There is no doubt that there is a shortage of such nurses, as there is only one to cover every 500 Parkinson's sufferers in Scotland. We really need more. It would certainly be advantageous to get the number down to one nurse for every 300 sufferers. I ask the minister to say what actions have been taken to ensure that health boards recruit more Parkinson's disease nurse specialists to address the issues.</p><p>I congratulate the Parkinson's Disease Society on the success of its get it on time campaign. I urge the Government to provide more resources <place-holder colnum=\"12548\"/> and more Parkinson's disease nurse specialists. Politics is about making a difference.

It is logical that we have it the day after we had a debate on the economy.

Added to that, as David Whitton noted, the Scottish Building Federation fears that 20,000 jobs will be lost in the construction industry by Christmas. The human impact of those job losses and the recession will be felt throughout Scotland's communities. When such events occur, people look to Governments for a response. One way in which the SNP Administration can respond is by speeding up its infrastructure programme in order to boost the economy.</p><p>The schools building programme is crying out for investment. A third of Scotland's schools are in need of repair or new build. However, the programme has ground to a halt. The clock continues to tick on the Scottish Futures Trust, but <place-holder colnum=\"12428\"/> as yet it has produced no new projects and no new finance. There continue to be questions about the Scottish Futures Trust. Despite the cabinet secretary's comments today, people will continue to ask questions about how the SFT will attract finance. The cabinet secretary reiterated the objective of attracting savings of &#163;150 million a year, but we have been given no details of how that will be achieved. In addition, we have been warned that building inflation is starting to rise.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the cabinet secretary's ambitions appear to be overstated. We still do not know any detail about the use of local authority bonds, which, it turns out, have been legal since 1975. Scotland's councils are still asking questions about the funding that will be available to them. Under traditional PPP projects, the Government provided 80 per cent of funding, but there have been no clear answers on whether that will continue.</p><p>Joe FitzPatrick spoke about the evidence that the Finance Committee heard on the NPD model. In my opinion, very little of that evidence suggested that the NPD model was value for money, and the Institute for Public Policy Research shares my view on that.

Governments around the world, and in the UK and Scotland in particular, face the challenge of reducing fuel bills, tackling fuel poverty and reducing emissions to help in the fight against climate change.</p><p>I welcome the work that is being done on the proposed climate change bill and the fact that some of the measures in Sarah Boyack's proposed member's bill have been incorporated. It is worth noting the work that Sarah Boyack has done over a long period. She has campaigned consistently on the environment, even when environmental issues were not as popular as they are now.</p><p>Unfortunately, although some progress has been made, it has been a bit on the slow side. We need to see some practical measures being taken. It is one thing to set a target of an 80 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, but we need to help households throughout Scotland, particularly at this time of economic decline. From that point of view, some of the practical measures included in Sarah Boyack's bill are very useful indeed. We could look at incentivising council tax payers by giving them a &#163;100 rebate if they install microgeneration. That would encourage the installation of microgeneration and reduce fuel bills.</p><p>In my constituency, Cambuslang and Rutherglen Housing Association piloted a scheme to install solar panels.

It appears that the iron laddie has been patted on the head and sent homewards. That is reinforced by this morning's announcement on the stock exchange that many of the senior positions at Lloyds TSB have been filled. Indeed, the crisis has raised questions about Alex Salmond's credibility. At the start of the crisis, he told us that in an independent Scotland, he would come up with a mythical &#163;100 million from a Scottish central bank, and that he would reduce corporation tax. That is one to tell to the fairies at the bottom of the garden, particularly as one of Mr Salmond's economic advisors recently told us that a move to independence would result in a shortfall of &#163;1.1 billion.</p><p>I disagree with Alex Neil's comments about Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling. Recently, they have exhibited strong leadership and have very much steadied the ship. The people of Scotland are looking for practical advice. I will offer some suggestions. First, the Scottish National Party <place-holder colnum=\"11889\"/> Administration could ditch the local income tax policy. If it is trying to attract jobs and investment to Scotland, it should not introduce a policy that would make Scotland the highest-taxed part of the UK. In addition, the SNP should abandon the discredited Scottish Futures Trust. Here we are, 18 months into the Administration, and no finance has come forward from the trust and it is not funding any capital investment programmes. The Government should speed up the capital investment programme and projects such as the Raith interchange.</p><p>In addition, the Government should ensure that it pays its bills on time. Recent analysis of the consolidated accounts for last year shows that rather than meeting the 100 per cent target for paying bills, the Government was paying its bills only 93.6 per cent of the time, thereby putting business cash flows under pressure.</p><p>It would also be practical to introduce incentives to council tax payers to introduce microgeneration into their homes. That would encourage business innovation, help to stimulate growth and encourage the economy. Those are important matters.</p><p>The merger is an issue for the shareholders. However, if HBOS were to stand alone, a greater amount of money might have to be invested in recapitalisation, which could undermine shareholder confidence.

That is a unique and honourable position to be in. Therefore, we must ensure that we involve as many voters as possible in the process and that voters can have confidence in the integrity of the process. I commend the committee's work to try to make the <place-holder colnum=\"11652\"/> process more robust in future and to increase voter turnout.</p><p>Members have referred to the important issues that the committee highlighted in its report. I have given considerable thought to the decoupling of local government and parliamentary elections. Michael McMahon and other members pointed out that decoupling the elections might reduce voter turnout at council elections, which would reduce the mandate that councils have. That is a strong point, but on balance I favour decoupling. I watched voters enter polling stations in 2007 and spoke to a number of voters from different political parties afterwards, and I am in no doubt that there was a good deal of confusion among people who had had to vote for a constituency MSP and a list MSP, and then for three or four councillors in a system that was being used for the first time. A confusing system puts voters off and we do not want to do that; we want as many people as possible to vote in elections.</p><p>For that reason, I support proposals to simplify ballot papers. The use of two separate ballot papers would be more straightforward and would be an easier system for voters to follow. Voter education is also important. We are talking about serious elections, in which members are elected to legislate on important issues in the Scottish Parliament and councillors are elected to manage large budgets. If we want voters to be aware of issues and to understand how to vote, we must invest seriously in voter education. The number of rejected ballot papers in 2007 is a matter of regret. In my constituency, there were 1,495 rejected ballot papers in the constituency election alone. I support moves to publish more electoral data, which I think will show that we have much to do in areas of social deprivation, where I think that turnout is lower and more ballot papers are rejected. We must address that issue.</p><p>Alison McInnes glossed over some facts about STV. She mentioned the increased number of candidates but did not talk about the three-fold increase in wards. The alphabetical bias in the STV system must be addressed before the next elections.</p><p>David Whitton talked about problems with postal votes. In my constituency some people did not receive their postal ballot papers until the day of the election or afterwards, so they were debarred from taking part in the process.</p><p>I support the restoration of manual counts for the Scottish Parliament elections. Transparency is important. The experienced election watchers among us are used to seeing the ballot boxes being opened and&#8212;this is my experience&#8212;all the Labour votes spilling on to the table. I make a serious point. Manual counts enable people to see how the votes are stacking up as the process goes <place-holder colnum=\"11653\"/> on, which did not happen during the e-count, when my sight was blurring as I tried to follow what was happening on bar charts. I also support overnight counting. I am a traditionalist in that respect. People who work hard all day during an election are entitled to learn some results by 10 o'clock and the public and the media expect to hear the results as soon as possible.</p><p>I commend the committee for its report. I support Duncan McNeil's call for voters to be central to the process. The committee's recommendations would do much to ensure greater voter turnout in future elections.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate and I commend the committee for its work in producing its comprehensive report.

I support the Labour amendment and the Conservative motion. The debate is an excellent opportunity to ask questions about the local income tax, and it gives the Scottish Government a platform from which to provide information and clarification.</p><p>There is no doubt that serious questions arise about the local income tax. It has been criticised for its potential to make Scotland the highest-taxed part of the UK and to drain talent from the country. However, that is not the major issue that is before us. The local income tax will require a major bill to be brought before the Parliament. If we are serious about our role as policy makers and legislators, we must have detailed information to allow us to scrutinise the impact of the proposed legislative changes. We must know how the local income tax will impact on councils, businesses and Scotland's citizens.</p><p>The key issues on which we require more information and clarification are the administration of the tax, the costs and the stability of future revenues. On the administration of the local income tax, it is important to know whether HM Revenue and Customs will administer it. We also need to know whether a property register and a register of individual citizens will be required. The cabinet secretary's announcement today on allocations to local authorities will be studied in detail, not only by MSPs but by people from throughout the business and financial community. Inevitably, there will be implications for new tax rules&#8212;questions will arise about second homes and residency rules. There will also have to be an appeals process, so we need to know about how it will be put in place and its transparency. Questions remain about legal competence. The European Charter of Local Self-Government deems that taxes should be set locally. That must be considered carefully. Another issue is how water and sewerage rates will be levied under the new system.</p><p>There is no doubt that a new system such as the local income tax would involve a lot of set-up costs. I imagine that the system costs alone would be dramatic. I worked in the electricity industry when VAT on electricity was introduced. The system changes were complex and the electricity companies required significant resources to put the changes into effect. The local income tax would have an impact on employers. The Burt <place-holder colnum=\"11395\"/> review in 2006 indicated that the costs would be in the region of &#163;55 million to &#163;60 million.</p><p>Issues arise about how the stability of future income would be guaranteed through local income tax revenues and about the impact on economic growth. Research shows that stable inflows of finance result in greater economic stability and certainty, whereas variability can result in fluctuations, which are not good for our communities.</p><p>The debate is important.

Sport is something that is central to a lot of our communities. When I embark on my weekly run, on a Sunday morning, I see people of all ages and profiles out running&#8212;they are a bit like me, struggling to get around the 3 or 4 miles that they are attempting. That very much brings home to me the fact that people are participating. I see it in my constituency, from Cambuslang and Rutherglen rugby club to Rutherglen Glencairn football club. I <place-holder colnum=\"11178\"/> also acknowledge the work that volunteers do and the work that people in the Rutherglen and Cambuslang sports council do to promote sport and to invigorate and inspire youngsters. That is important.</p><p>There are important policy areas with which we can find common ground. In recent weeks, we have discussed in the Parliament the obesity action plan. One of the facts that was raised in that discussion was that 21 per cent of primary 1 pupils are overweight. The Health and Sport Committee has considered in detail the issue of health inequalities. If we start to plan the sporting legacy of the Commonwealth games, we can encourage people to get on to the streets and the sports field to participate in sport and so become healthier. That will benefit the health service, as fewer people will have to use its facilities. It will also benefit the country's economy, because, hopefully, if the country is fitter, people will contribute more to our economic growth.</p><p>The Commonwealth games represent a fantastic opportunity for youngsters who are training just now and are considering joining sports clubs, because the event allows them to have the ambition of competing for their country in the 2014 games. I also acknowledge the benefits for infrastructure before and after the games.

I know that that will inspire many young footballers in the Toryglen area.</p><p>I recognise the importance of lottery funding to the Commonwealth games. We won only one gold medal in the 1996 Olympic games, and our success in the recent Olympics shows that our lack of success in the 1996 games was due to underfunding.

It will be tremendous to have the event in Scotland in 2014, as it will focus on Gleneagles and our other golfing venues. St Andrews is very much the home of golf and is a great visitor attraction throughout the year. People go there to look at a course where the likes of Tom Morris, Tom Watson, Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have strolled up the fairways. The course is a terrific venue and St Andrews is a terrific town.</p><p>It is right that the Ryder cup should come to Scotland in 2014 because that will be the first time that it has been held here since 1973. One of the <place-holder colnum=\"10916\"/> disappointing things about this week's Ryder cup is that, for the first time in the history of the cup&#8212;I think&#8212;there is no Scottish representation on the European team.

It is an important debate, given the scale of the issue in Scotland. We live in a country in which people who are obese have an 18 per cent greater chance of ending up hospitalised. Forty-seven per cent of cases of type 2 diabetes can be attributed to obesity. As has been mentioned, 21 per cent of primary 1 schoolchildren are overweight. In addition, obesity doubles the probability of sight loss. I welcome this afternoon's debate, which is a serious attempt to look at those serious problems.</p><p>I welcome the action plan, which builds on some of the work of the previous Executive, including the 2006 diet action plan and the hungry for success initiative. A key part of the plan is to look at the work that takes place in schools and early years. There is a big job to be done to ensure that young people choose fresh fruit over fast food. Many positive initiatives are in place throughout Scotland. In my constituency, the Rutherglen and Cambuslang community health initiative does a great deal of work to promote healthy eating. St Andrew's Hospice, which does a great deal of work with Lanarkshire schools to promote healthy living and eating, has a stall in the garden lobby.</p><p>It is critical that there is a healthy environment and promotion of healthy living in the workplace, because that feeds into successful local authorities and successful businesses and has an impact on the economy and the health service. Yesterday we heard a great deal about economic growth, but for that we need a healthy Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"10551\"/> and a healthy workforce. We also want to reduce the strain on the NHS and, in the longer term, to use funds for more positive programmes.</p><p>I highlight the work that is being done with older people. People are starting to live longer and, as Margaret Curran indicated, we want that to continue. If people's minds and bodies are agile and fit, they can remain well when they are older. We should build on the success of the recent Olympics and use sport as a catalyst for encouraging healthy living and fitness activity. The action plan indicates that the incidence of walking has increased from 39 to 46 per cent, but we must do much better than that. The 2014 Commonwealth games and the 2012 Olympics can help us to promote many more fitness programmes throughout Scotland.</p><p>As the action plan says, there is a link between social deprivation and obesity, particularly among women. That is why it is important to get the allocation of primary care resources and health professionals throughout Scotland right. There are 34 GPs in Cambuslang and Rutherglen, with a population of 55,500, but 42 GPs in Livingston, which has a population of 52,000&#8212;and a longer life expectancy. If we are going to tackle obesity, some thought must be given to how we allocate resources and health professionals.</p><p>I welcome the action plan, but the SNP should consider some wider issues. For example, health spending is growing at 4 per cent in England and Wales and at 1.5 per cent in Scotland. Further, although the SNP manifesto mentions free access to swimming pools and health checks for the over-40s, neither of those policies has been taken up. There is concern that the school building programme is grinding to a halt when 33 per cent of schools are in need of attention. If we want schoolchildren to have two hours of physical education and to meet the target, we need gymnasiums that are fit for purpose. We therefore need to take forward a schools modernisation programme.</p><p>This has been an important debate. I welcome the publication of the action plan, but to tackle obesity the SNP Administration must consider wider policy priorities.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Obesity Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this afternoon's debate on the obesity action plan.

Obviously, I support the principle of the bill to establish creative Scotland, which takes forward the initiatives of Patricia Ferguson, the previous Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. The bill will provide us with one organisation, which will strengthen the arts and culture in Scotland and provide a stronger platform from which to move forward.</p><p>There is a view in certain areas of the media that the arts and culture are all about lavish shows and grand performances that are attended by the great and the good. I do not subscribe to that view. On Saturday, I had the honour of attending my local gala day in Rutherglen&#8212;Landemer day&#8212;at which there were many community representatives and bands performing on Rutherglen Main Street. One such band was the Stonelaw high school soul band The Elements, which put on an excellent performance. The role for creative Scotland is to reach out into such communities and younger groups, build that talent and ensure that it flourishes and makes a contribution to Scotland as the 21<sup>st</sup> century progresses.</p><p>Some in the chamber have criticised the Creative Scotland Bill as being vague and unclear. As a member of the Finance Committee, I will concentrate on what I see as some of the bill's financial shortcomings. I note that the minister announced the commitment of an extra &#163;5 million. Essentially, that will replace the &#163;5 million cut in real terms that was announced when the budget was set for the new body. What sort of message was sent out about the establishment of creative Scotland when it was clear that it would have to do its work with a cut of &#163;5 million in real terms? That was not a great start.</p><p>We need to monitor how the &#163;5 million is released and spent. Members expressed concern <place-holder colnum=\"9877\"/> about the additional workload that creative Scotland will take on. Even though creative Scotland will have the extra money that the minister pledged, the body will have to do more work from a reduced financial base, which is of concern.</p><p>The Finance Committee said that the financial memorandum was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the weakest that has been produced in the current parliamentary session.\"</p><p>That was the unanimous view of committee members, including Scottish National Party members. Members of the Finance Committee expected the financial memorandum to provide detail about the costs involved in the implementation of the bill. We had serious concerns about creative Scotland's set-up costs. A figure of &#163;700,000 was provided in the financial memorandum, according to which,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"work is at an early stage and a detailed estimate of one-off costs is not yet available.\"</p><p>When the committee asked a Government official about the matter, he explained that the figure represented a \"shared judgment\" between the people who were involved in discussions. I do not know what a \"shared judgment\" is, but when such sums of money are involved we need detailed costings, which have been built up from an accurate cost base and accurately reflect the cost of the bill's implementation.</p><p>The figure of &#163;700,000 over two financial years was not even accurate, because the official admitted that spend would be greater in 2008-09 than it would be in 2009-10. In addition, there was to be no meeting to discuss the budget until September. If we are serious about drawing up costings and budgets, the issue must be considered before September.</p><p>I am concerned that incompetence is beginning to seep into the workings of the Government. The Law Society of Scotland had to point out that the first draft of the Public Health etc (Scotland) Bill was legally incompetent; <em>The Sunday Times </em>reported last Sunday that officials had had to alert the Government to an overspend on the budget; and the Creative Scotland Bill suffers from financial illiteracy.</p><p>The minister is responsible for the bill and must step up to the mark at stage 2, because the documents that were drafted at stage 1 were not up to the job.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13753500", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Creative Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate and I acknowledge the previous Executive's work on the arts and culture.

We spend a lot of time in the Parliament debating health and other big issues&#8212;for example, how we spend the &#163;11 billion budget, deal with drug and alcohol policy and tackle health inequalities. There is no doubt that we need to have a framework in which to deal with public health. If we get that right, it will contribute towards the overall health and wellbeing of the Scottish people. It is important that the bill, which I hope will be passed today, serves those objectives. It is definitely a step in the right direction.</p><p>Other members have spoken about the need to modernise our public health legislation, much of which, as Ross Finnie said, is rooted in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. We must pay heed to the fact that, as the world changes and everyone travels more, we are more likely to come into contact with different diseases. From that point of view, I welcome the amendments that the bill makes to the Environmental Protection Act 1990, particularly in relation to the addition of premises from which insects emanate or premises that give rise to artificial light nuisance, and situations in which water covering land becomes a public health risk or nuisance.</p><p>If organisations or companies are found to be responsible in such instances, their unsociable behaviour should be dealt with. We need to take a strong stand against them, and the provisions in the bill will help us to do that. The bill will help to protect individuals from such public health risk or nuisance and will encourage organisations and companies to respect individuals and communities.</p><p>Most speakers have rightly paid tribute to Ken Macintosh, who has been instrumental in developing the part of the bill that deals with the regulation of provision of sunbeds. His work has been critical, not only during the passage of the bill<place-holder colnum=\"9749\"/> but over the years, during which he has campaigned constantly on the issue. The point of being involved in politics&#8212;I am talking not only about Labour members but members across the chamber&#8212;is to make a difference. Ken Macintosh has made a difference, particularly in relation to part 8 on the regulation of provision of sunbeds.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, campaigners set up a stall in the chamber lobby to raise awareness of melanoma. Like many members, I visited the stall. I talked to one woman who spoke eloquently on the subject. Sadly, her husband had passed away the previous month as a result of skin cancer. She spoke passionately about why it was important that the Parliament pass the bill, particularly the part on which Ken Macintosh has campaigned. She told me that it would make a difference by raising awareness and reducing the incidence of skin cancer throughout Scotland. I acknowledge the importance of all the other aspects of the bill, but if politics is about making a difference, the work that Ken Macintosh has done sends out a strong message throughout Scotland on the dangers of sunbed use. I welcome that. I reiterate Margaret Curran&#8217;s comments on the number of sunbed salons in some communities. As she said, a high proportion of such salons can be found in areas of social deprivation, which is of concern. </p><p>The committee and the minister spent a lot of time looking at the issue of licensing. The minister has given a commitment that, if the Government feels that the provisions in the bill do not, in practice, meet its objectives, she will come back to the chamber on the matter. </p><p>I welcome the provisions that are being introduced to modernise the investigation of public health incidents. Those provisions are absolutely correct, given that no new legislation has been passed on that area.</p><p>In the stage 1 debate, I raised concerns about the intention to use the summary application procedure in Scottish civil court proceedings, as that was not legally competent. That provision has now been revised at stage 3. I hope that the mistake is not repeated in other bills that are brought before the Parliament.</p><p>The alignment of the appointment of public health inspectors with the appointment of appropriate competent people by local authorities and health boards is absolutely correct. That should help to instil public confidence when investigations take place, which is paramount. On health protection plans, it is important that health boards and local authorities work together. However, the bill talks about consultation on that, rather than agreement. We must consider that issue in future.<place-holder colnum=\"9750\"/></p><p>As others have done, I pay tribute to the work of the Health and Sport Committee. I am not a member of the committee, but I have read many of its deliberations. It is clear that there is a lot of expertise on the committee. If one considers the development of the bill from stage 1 to stage 3, one can see that the committee has made many positive contributions and has affected the eventual outcome, in part through positive discussions with the minister.</p><p>The bill is an important one that lays down an essential framework for public health that can make a real difference in some areas.

There are clearly limitations to the funds that are available from current funding pots, even though the Scottish budget has doubled to &#163;30 billion since the start of devolution.</p><p>Consider the position of the schools estate at the start of devolution: 40 per cent of schools were not fit for purpose. The Executive had to consider how it would raise finance. The option of PPP was one that was very much supported, because it could be used to raise the &#163;5.3 billion that has been required to improve the school estate over the past eight years.</p><p>In recent weeks, I have visited a number of schools in my constituency, some of which were funded by PPP. Contrary to what Christopher Harvie said, those schools have been well received by pupils, teachers and parents. They will provide an excellent platform to enable the children to learn and, I hope, go on to make a major contribution to the Scottish economy.</p><p>If the SNP had its way, those pupils would still be housed in the old school buildings. In the run-in to the last election, the SNP opposed PPP tooth and nail. In its manifesto, which on this policy issue was basically a drive to say anything to get a vote, it developed the Scottish futures trust. As Elaine Smith said, the SNP told the Scottish people that it would provide funds at low costs of <place-holder colnum=\"9459\"/> interest and that there would be limited profits. We see the realities of power now that \"Taking forward the Scottish Futures Trust\" has been published. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth acknowledged to the Finance Committee last week that the model to be used is the NPD model, which is essentially a variant of PPP. As other members have said, it will still involve profits because the profits will be built in at the start. That is clearly at odds with what the SNP told the electorate and possibly some of its own members before the last election.</p><p>There are holes in the proposals in the document. Private sector finance is clearly an important policy area to explore in order to fund infrastructure projects, particularly when we consider that a six-month delay in a &#163;100 million project costs &#163;3 million. However, page 39 of the document admits that details of how private finance will be raised are still to be explored. Alex Neil talked about an intellectual vacuum; that is not just an intellectual vacuum but a gaping hole in the policy.</p><p>Much was made in the press release launching the policy of the &#163;150 million-worth of savings that would be generated. Of course, the issue is covered in the document but, as its terms were drafted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, there is, as we might expect, a lot of consultant-speak about \"value-for-money drivers\" but very little information about how those savings will be derived. If no work has been done on how private finance will be raised, how can it be said that the policy will generate &#163;150 million of savings?</p><p>It will be a long time before the first school is delivered under the Scottish futures trust. It is no wonder that SNP members have been squirming as the debate has progressed. If the SNP's answer to investment in Scotland's infrastructure is the Scottish futures trust, it is time to send it the message that it cannot be trusted with Scotland's future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13727519", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Infrastructure (Investment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.

Concerns have been expressed throughout the chamber about the reduction in the number of double-crewed ambulances throughout Scotland. People call on ambulances to deal with emergency situations where lives are often under threat and people need a quick response from a fully equipped ambulance. In those circumstances, single units do not provide what is required. When they reach the scene, they provide a temporary solution and they are often unable to move the ill or injured person. That undermines the effectiveness of the service.</p><p>We also need to consider staff safety. Sadly, emergency services are called out to scenes where violence has occurred or is occurring. That is particularly difficult if a single-crewed unit attends; unaccompanied staff should not be exposed to such situations. Our staff have key skills and expertise and provide quality care, so it is important that we back them up and ensure that they are protected.<place-holder colnum=\"8886\"/></p><p>As other members have said, the trade unions have expressed concern that patient care is becoming a casualty, that vacant shifts are not being covered because of budgetary restrictions and that, because of staff reductions, training and health and safety are being compromised.

Efficiencies are a big theme for the SNP, which proposed &#163;1.6 billion of them. Such a large figure had to be put in place because the SNP overpromised in its manifesto commitments.</p><p>The changes that we are discussing seem to be quite a clever scheme. They allowed the First Minister to stand up last week and say that there are more ambulance crews in the streets of Scotland than there were previously. No doubt, when the scheme was discussed around the table, it seemed to be a wise way forward, but if patients' lives are in danger and they are required to wait when there is a delay in a twin crew turning up, it is not an efficiency saving&#8212;it is a cut.</p><p>The debate is important and it has allowed members to discuss their concerns about the Ambulance Service.

As other members have said, the subject is important, as it affects not just the treatment of type 1 diabetes but the whole NHS.<place-holder colnum=\"8837\"/></p><p>As Nanette Milne said, type 1 diabetes is an extremely serious issue in Scotland, given the high incidence of the condition here&#8212;the third highest in the world. We have about 197,000 sufferers of diabetes, more than 26,000, or 15 per cent, of whom have type 1 diabetes. That is an extremely large number.</p><p>As other members have said, the condition has a significant impact on young people, 35 per 100,000 of whom are affected by it. That has an impact not only on their lives, but on those of their families and on the support that the NHS provides through treatment of continuing illnesses.</p><p>It is clear that the use of insulin pumps can make the treatment of type 1 diabetes more effective, in that it can help people manage their condition, make them more disciplined and contribute to an improved quality of life. The disparity between the use of insulin pumps in Scotland and in the rest of the UK and internationally is a concern. About 1 per cent of people in Scotland who have type 1 diabetes use insulin pumps, whereas the figure for the UK as a whole is 2 per cent. The disparity is even starker if we compare the situation in Scotland with that in other EU countries, where the figure ranges between 10 and 20 per cent. In the United States, too, the figure approaches the 20 per cent mark.</p><p>As other members have said, there are wide variances between the rates in different health board areas. There are more than 5,000 sufferers of type 1 diabetes in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board area, but only 31 of them use insulin pumps, which equates to a rate of 0.6 per cent. The rate in Lanarkshire, too, where only 21 out of more than 3,000 sufferers use insulin pumps, is only 0.6 per cent, which is well below the Scottish average and even further below the UK average. It is clear that urgent action is required. It is important that we raise the standard. I endorse Richard Simpson's suggestion that we should try to raise the level of insulin pump usage to 2.5 per cent across Scotland.</p><p>The provision of an insulin pump costs about &#163;1,600 a year, whereas injections cost about &#163;500 a year, but as Karen Whitefield and David Stewart said, the use of pumps can result in the NHS recouping &#163;23,000 over two years because type 1 diabetes sufferers can go on to suffer from heart disease, stroke, kidney problems and blindness, which has an impact throughout the service. The use of insulin pumps to tackle type 1 diabetes has two main advantages: to improve people's health and to reduce the long-term strain on the NHS.</p><p>I congratulate David Stewart on raising this issue.

On Tuesday, the Scottish Court Service published proposals to close Rutherglen district court and transfer the business of that court to Glasgow. To me, that is an illogical decision. At a time when electoral and health board boundaries are moving away from Glasgow, it does not make sense to move the court towards Glasgow. The decision will cost local people more money, for travel. Further, the local court is recognised as being an effective court that serves a local purpose. I give notice that local people will oppose the decision and will make their views known loud and clear during the consultation process. I have raised the matter with the cabinet secretary, and I raise it again today not only to register my opposition to the proposal, but because it illustrates something that is at the heart of the discussion about the reformatting of the Scottish Court Service.

I welcome the opportunity to participate in this evening's debate on the Fenwick weavers, and I congratulate Willie Coffey on securing the debate and for his opening speech.</p><p>It is important to focus on the work of the Fenwick weavers&#8212;not just because they were the first formal co-operative, blazing the trail in 1761, but because so many of the ideals from Fenwick all those years ago still burn brightly in 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland.</p><p>As other members have said, it is fascinating to look at the story of the Fenwick weavers; and as other members have done, I want to pay tribute to John Smith and John McFadzean for the research that they have done. I also pay tribute to the work of East Ayrshire Council and, in particular, to the work of Jim O'Neill.</p><p>The story is really interesting and has many different aspects. The Fowlds family grew up in Fenwick and among their descendants were the first education minister in New Zealand and a member of Parliament in the United Kingdom House of Commons. That shows the quality of people who were about in Fenwick at that time. The quality of the ideals in which they grew up was such that they were able to go forward and <place-holder colnum=\"8102\"/> occupy such positions of responsibility and leadership both in the UK and in New Zealand.</p><p>Such history is important not just because it is interesting, but because it is relevant to today's Scotland. Lessons that we can learn from the history of the Fenwick weavers can be applied in modern Scotland. In fact, when I look round my constituency, I see links that go all the way back to those events of 250 years ago. When I see the Co-op retail stores in Halfway and Cathkin and consider the foundation of the Co-op retail group, I see a sound business model that includes strong ethics. The Co-op is very much recognised as taking a strong moral stand even to this day, but that stretches all the way back to Fenwick. When I see such examples in my constituency, I am very much reminded of that.</p><p>The Fenwick weavers also set up a savings scheme to look after fellow members of the community. That community-based scheme was perhaps a forerunner of today's credit unions. In my constituency, credit unions in Cambuslang and Rutherglen give help to the community just as the Fenwick savings scheme gave help to the community all those years ago.</p><p>Another outstanding example of how the people of Fenwick sought to advance the wellbeing of the community is their setting up of a library in 1808. They recognised the importance of education. That struck me last night as I attended a local school meeting, which happened to take place in the library, during which I thought about the importance of education. In Parliament, we often talk about how education can be used to grow the economy. Back in 1808, the people of Fenwick set up a library to educate the community better so that people could advance their knowledge and go on to do better jobs. That was demonstrated by the fact that so many of them emigrated to take on more skilled jobs. We still see the benefit of that approach in the work of the Co-operative Education Trust Scotland. CETS is an excellent example of how co-op ideals are still being taken forward.</p><p>To sum up, the co-operative model in Fenwick is an excellent example that has carried all the way through to modern Scotland. I see examples of its effect in my constituency. In finishing, I wish the co-op movement well and I hope that it continues to flourish.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403342", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fenwick Weavers Society"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a Labour and Co-operative Party MSP.

The debate is certainly relevant, given the concerns that have been expressed in the chamber about the organisation. Indeed, at last week's general question time, Alex Neil raised his own strong concerns with the minister.</p><p>However, I will be positive about Historic Scotland and draw the chamber's attention to its work with South Lanarkshire Council on the refurbishment of Rutherglen town hall. Indeed, that project highlights the positive aspects of the Labour amendment and shows how Historic Scotland can work with local councils.</p><p>Rutherglen has a strong history; in fact, it was granted royal burgh status in 1126. The town hall, which was built in 1861, originally had not only a council chamber and public hall but a courthouse and a jail. However, I should point out that the jail is no longer part of the building, just in case the Cabinet Secretary for Justice is thinking of using it to tackle overcrowding in prisons.</p><p>One of the town hall's most impressive features is its 110ft clock tower, which stands in both old and more recent photographs of Main Street as a strong symbol of continuity and community. Sadly, in the 1980s, the town hall fell into disrepair and became unfit for public use. However, in the late 1990s, South Lanarkshire Council took up the cudgels and began a refurbishment programme that led in 2007 to the building reopening. Historic Scotland contributed &#163;500,000 to the programme, which stands as a model of how historic buildings in a modern Scotland should be renovated Rutherglen town hall is now very much used as a community base. Indeed, since becoming MSP for the area, I have attended a fair number of community meetings there. Disabled access has been much improved and lifts ensure that all the facilities on every floor, including the very excellent cafe, are open and accessible to all sectors of the community.</p><p>The building's original stone facades were retained, which required a lot of skill from stonemasons. The need for such skills shows the relevance of apprenticeships&#8212;and the modern apprenticeships scheme&#8212;in Scotland, which is an <place-holder colnum=\"7818\"/> issue that Labour has been pushing not only this afternoon but in its overall political agenda.</p><p>As for joint working with councils, the minister mentioned the introduction of key performance targets for planning. I should point out that South Lanarkshire Council was given an award for the way in which it planned this refurbishment, and its work should be praised.</p><p>As an MSP who represents an urban seat, it is important for me to point out that there are many historic sites in urban constituencies. Such sites are not exclusive to rural constituencies or to constituencies in the Highlands, to which people often look when they think of Scotland's history. Quite a lot of archaeological work is being done along the route of the new M74, for example, and the digging up of the site of the Caledonian pottery mill in Rutherglen has got many local schools involved and has reignited an interest in Rutherglen's history. The television series \"Time Team\" has shown all of us how interesting such exercises can be. There is strong evidence of that in my local community.</p><p>As regards the debate's political implications, we want a Historic Scotland that is strong, open and relevant, which works closely with local authorities and which listens to and has a strong base in communities. If those aspects are taken into account, we can ensure that Scotland's history has a role to play in shaping the country's future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Scotland and Local Authorities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this debate on Historic Scotland and its joint working with local authorities, because we should discuss its role in administering Scotland's historic sites and making the country's history relevant to today's society.

As other members have said, this might not be the most exciting debate, but there have been a number of interesting and informative speeches on this important issue.</p><p>We often talk about the big issues of tackling heart disease, lung disease and cancer and reducing health inequalities. The Government has various levers at its disposal to do that, including the &#163;11 billion health budget, the setting of health priorities, and legislation. The bill will be crucial in underpinning all that work. As Ian McKee made clear in his historical perspective, if we do not get the administration of public health right, we will not be able to tackle some of those major issues. As a result, I welcome the bill as a step in the right direction.</p><p>Other members have stressed the importance of joint working. Generally, in politics, such co-operation leads to the establishment of better policy priorities and better service to the public. In that respect, joint protection plans are something that NHS boards and local authorities can very much work together on. I note the Health and Sport Committee's comments on the need for those bodies to collaborate rather than to consult, and I hope that that will be emphasised in stage 2 amendments.</p><p>The bill's proposed amendments to the Environment Protection Act 1990, particularly the various additions to the list of statutory nuisances that local authorities can act on, will be important <place-holder colnum=\"7745\"/> in protecting communities. As members have pointed out, the nuisances include insects emanating from premises, artificial lighting and land that is covered with water. The introduction of fixed penalty notices should help to prevent the spread of such nuisances. Such environmental provisions tie in with Parliament's strong messages on protecting communities and individuals from antisocial behaviour, on abuse of the environment and so on. That kind of behaviour is simply unacceptable; indeed, the actions that are covered in the bill can pose health risks, so we must act strongly against the individuals and bodies that perpetrate such actions.</p><p>It is also appropriate that the bill includes provisions to investigate public health incidents, given that at the moment there is no legislation in that area. In setting out five circumstances in which an investigation might take place, the bill is clearly working in the public interest.</p><p>Members have already indicated that the bill's provisions on the summary application procedure for public health investigation warrants are not competent. Although I accept the minister's assurances that the issue will be dealt with at stage 2, I am disappointed that such a situation has occurred&#8212;after all, the Government's legislative programme is rather light at the moment.</p><p>Ken Macintosh has already dealt comprehensively with sunbeds. I pay tribute to him not only for his speech but for his work in raising the issue in a number of forums, and his success in getting his proposals incorporated in the bill. As he said, the incidence of skin cancer&#8212;especially among young people&#8212;from sunbed use is a matter of great concern, so proposals to ban under-18s from using sunbeds and to ban coin-operated sunbeds, and to provide more information for users will be helpful. Mr Macintosh pointed out that eight local authorities have introduced sunbed licensing. Such moves have certainly been effective, especially in preventing sunbed premises from being used in other inappropriate ways.</p><p>The bill is useful and will make progress in a number of areas in public health. The Health and Sport Committee asked for clarification on some matters, so I hope that the minister will take its comments on board.

I endorse the cabinet secretary's announcement and, obviously, I support the Labour amendment.</p><p>There is no doubt that HAIs are a serious issue. The human impact of such infections, which Margaret Curran mentioned, was driven home to me earlier this week when I read an obituary in <em>The Herald</em> for Drummond Hart, who was a hospital consultant. I did not know anything about Drummond Hart beforehand but he was clearly an active man who was successful professionally and had many interests in life. Sadly, in his last five years, he was wheelchair bound after he contracted MRSA while in hospital for an operation on his spine. That shows the indiscriminate nature of MRSA and how it can strike innocent people. People enter hospital looking to be cured of their illnesses; they do not expect to leave with an illness that they did not have when they went in. That shows the seriousness of the task that the Government faces.</p><p>The cabinet secretary spoke about the costs and strains that MRSA imposes on the health budget. This year's health budget of &#163;10.25 billion is targeted mainly at heart disease, cancer and strokes. However, MRSA results in more people being admitted to hospitals, which imposes greater strain on the health service and its budget and diverts resources from the main health issues that the Government and the service are trying to tackle. Addressing health care associated infection is not only right but, hopefully, will lead in the long run to a healthier Scotland and more efficient use of the health budget.</p><p>I support the publication of the delivery plan and many of the measures that it contains, which build on the work of the previous Executive. Like other members, I welcome the publication of the MRSA screening programme. Much can be done to track the programme and lessons can be learned from it, to ensure that we have in place an effective plan to combat MRSA.</p><p>I reiterate the comments that many members have made about hand hygiene. It seems basic, but poor hand hygiene is one of the major causes of the spread of infection in hospitals. I agree with Michael Matheson that we need to put across a consistent message throughout the country, in all health boards, to ensure that people take hand hygiene seriously and that we meet the hand hygiene compliance target of 90 per cent that has been set. Audits can be an effective way of measuring progress towards the target and of learning positive lessons.<place-holder colnum=\"7342\"/></p><p>Local campaigns are also important. The NHS is a big organisation; even boards cover large areas. It is important that we get down to the grass roots of the NHS, through local campaigns to put across the key messages in tackling the spread of infection. Education is important in that regard. The necessary staff must be in place in boards and we must work closely with the trade unions and patient groups such as the Scottish patient safety alliance.</p><p>I reiterate my colleague Helen Eadie's comments on the importance of in-house cleaning services. We should work towards establishing a presumption in favour of such services.</p><p>The Labour amendment refers to care homes, about which Mary Scanlon and Irene Oldfather made good points. I pay tribute to both members for their excellent record of promoting investment in care homes. Patients in such homes are less able than patients in other parts of the NHS to look after themselves, so they are potentially more vulnerable to the spread of diseases such as MRSA. I welcome the positive announcements that the cabinet secretary has made on the issue.</p><p>This has been a good debate, although it has not evoked much interest in the press gallery, which is empty. Parliament has an important role to play on the issue. As Ross Finnie said, it is important that there should be accountability on both the delivery plan and the action plan. I look forward to the cabinet secretary giving us regular updates on those.</p><p>Health care associated infection is a serious problem that affects communities and families throughout Scotland. Today there has been much agreement on the issue across the chamber. I am sure that Scotland will watch closely as we seek to continue to make progress towards making our hospitals and care homes free from infection.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401480", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Care Associated Infection"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this afternoon's debate on health care associated infections.

As a number of speakers have indicated, housing is a major issue in Scotland. That was brought home to me at my surgery on Monday night, when a young woman came in with a housing issue. She felt intimidated <place-holder colnum=\"7139\"/> by antisocial behaviour and was staying in an overcrowded house. All that she wanted was a quality house, in a safe environment, in which to stay. Providing that is the challenge that we all face.</p><p>I was interested to note that the minister said that housing is a priority, but I believe that the SNP has let the housing sector down by reneging on its pledge to provide grants to first-time buyers, by a lack of detail on funding and by cutting the housing supply budget by 6 per cent in real terms. \"Firm Foundations\" does not give enough priority to communities. It talks up the regional developer model&#8212;a kind of Tescoisation of housing policy&#8212;and is insufficiently committed to community-based housing organisations. An excellent example of such organisations is the West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative in my constituency. I remember campaigning in the area in the 1980s, when the lifts did not work, the housing quality was poor and the people whom one met at the door did not match up with those on the electoral register. However, in 1989 a housing co-op was formed. With the commitment of the community, there has been a real turnaround in the area, with stability and good-quality housing. That shows what can be done by co-ops and community-based housing organisations. Those models should be given priority over the regional developer model.</p><p>The Government's policy is to identify savings and efficiencies that drive up investment and produce greater numbers of houses, but those efficiencies have not been quantified. I suggest that many of them will take at least three years to kick in. Some of the new arrangements will not be in place until 2009, but the Government has budgeted for them to start to kick in in 2008. We are still waiting to hear the detail of how the reorganisation of Communities Scotland will take place. That undermines the housing target that the SNP has set&#8212;it is illogical, as the numbers do not add up.</p><p>I caution against seeking economies of scale. West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative has a concierge service for residents who run into difficulties, with a response time of 40 seconds. In larger local authorities, the response time is 40 minutes. The West Whitlawburn initiative has saved four lives in recent years. Cutting it would not be an efficiency saving&#8212;it would cost lives.</p><p>I also caution against moving housing association grant funding away from community-based organisations. That will put pressure on rents, which will affect poorer tenants. It will also impact on the ability of organisations to meet the Scottish housing quality standard.</p><p>We all agree that housing is a major issue that affects many lives and communities. It is clear that <place-holder colnum=\"7140\"/> the SNP's credibility has been called into question in the area. We need to involve communities and to ensure that efficiencies are not made into cuts. The document is called \"Firm Foundations\", but perhaps it should be called \"Shifting Sands\".

As she said, the debate is at the end of Fairtrade fortnight, but in many ways that is useful because it allows us to celebrate the fortnight's success. Several members have mentioned initiatives in their communities&#8212;I will touch on some such initiatives later.</p><p>Fair trade is crucial when we consider that 30,000 children under five die every day from preventable diseases. The task that we face is still immense, but fair trade allows us to tackle poverty and to bridge the inequality gap. The importance of working together is summarised in a quotation from Martin Luther King:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Before you finish eating your breakfast this morning, you've depended on half the world. This is the way our <place-holder colnum=\"7124\"/> universe is structured ... We aren't going to have peace on earth until we recognize this basic fact.\"</p><p>The theme of that quotation is that we must work together. Fair trade achieves that across international boundaries&#8212;it involves &#163;1.2 billion and 7 million people, as Shirley-Anne Somerville said.</p><p>Much work has been done in Scotland and the UK on fair trade. Iain Gray's speech on some of the history of fair trade was interesting and useful. As other members&#8212;including Aileen Campbell&#8212;said, the UK market for fair trade products is worth nearly &#163;500 million and one in four bananas is fairly traded.</p><p>I will give the local perspective from Rutherglen and Cambuslang in my constituency. Ted Brocklebank mentioned that St Andrews had achieved Fairtrade town status. Camglen Fairtrade forum is campaigning in Rutherglen and Cambuslang to achieve Fairtrade status for both towns. A successful campaign has been launched, which has involved several good events in Fairtrade fortnight, including the screening in Rutherglen town hall of the documentary \"Black Gold\". Stonelaw high school also ran s a successful stall in Rutherglen's Main Street on successive Saturday.</p><p>Jamie Stone said that fair trade has been great because it has encouraged many young people to campaign for honourable values. A positive feature of the campaign group in my constituency is its mix of people. Young people, old people, schools, churches, community groups and elected representatives are involved, and people think that a real community spirit exists in a time when it is sometimes felt that the community ideal has been undermined. It is great to be involved in practical action to tackle poverty and injustice.</p><p>The objectives of fair trade have been summed up by Nelson Mandela, who said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.\"</p><p>Politics is about making a difference. Members recognise that the ideals of fair trade allow us to participate and see real practical differences.</p><p>I commend Patricia Ferguson for lodging the motion and I commend the work of the groups in my constituency.

He is committed to eradicating fuel poverty by 2016. In a recent debate, the Scottish National Party said that tackling poverty was at the core of its aims. Therefore, I am disappointed that it has not given support to Sarah Boyack's bill on energy efficiency and microgeneration. Measures in the bill include incentives to householders and housebuilders to put energy efficient measures in place and to offset council tax payments. Such incentives would tackle energy efficiency and fuel poverty. There is an excellent example of that in my constituency, where Rutherglen and Cambuslang Housing Association is putting solar panels in the housing stock, which is resulting not only in energy being used more efficiently but in reduced bills, particularly for pensioners. Sarah Boyack visited the scheme with me and we spoke to a number of pensioners who had experienced real benefits from it. The minister would be better going down that route than down the council tax freeze route. The &#163;70 million from the council tax freeze would have been better invested in the scheme that Sarah Boyack proposes, which would have done more to tackle fuel poverty.</p><p>The minister should be a lot more robust in his discussions with energy companies. Prepayment meters have been mentioned. Direct debit customers pay &#163;137 more and online customers &#163;214 more.

The health budget in Scotland grew by almost 40 per cent between 2000 and 2007, to about &#163;11 billion, so it has a big impact on people's lives. A number of issues must be tackled: our population is getting older; we have made progress on the big three&#8212;cancer, heart disease and stroke&#8212;but much work remains to be done; and we must continue to consider health inequalities. There are big issues in Glasgow and central Scotland to do with how we tackle the health of people who live in areas of social deprivation. We must consider independent scrutiny against that background.</p><p>Major decisions about accident and emergency and primary care services will continue to have to be made. When such decisions are made, emotions run high. We need to balance communities' and patients' requirements with clinical requirements. Independent scrutiny can be useful in pulling together and balancing all those points of view, but it is important that that role is not pre-empted in any way, as has happened in recent cases. Independent scrutiny panels must be set up correctly. As Malcolm Chisholm rightly said, that is in part about organising efficiently the process of appointments to panels. We need the correct level of expertise and a proper vetting process. We need to balance clinical and community interests and we need transparency in the appointments process. Overall, scrutiny panels need accountability, so that people do not feel that their views are being ridden over roughshod.</p><p>Once a panel has been set up, it is crucial that the process is absolutely clear so that people know what job the panel is undertaking. The process should be logical from start to finish and people should be aware of what will happen at each stage so that, at the end of the process, whatever decisions are taken, the various parties feel that the process has been followed fairly.</p><p>Important points arise about evidence and data gathering. I do not agree with some of Ian McKee's points about presumptions and proving a case. It is incumbent on independent scrutiny panels to collect relevant data and to ensure that they are accurate, so that they can make decisions. Recently, several decisions have been criticised because they were based on out-of-date data or, in some instances, not enough data.</p><p>A big issue is the fact that these matters are complex. Stuart McMillan mentioned modelling, which is often used. A lot of data are fed in, <place-holder colnum=\"6830\"/> assumptions are made and scenarios are built up&#8212;the process can be complicated. It is important that that part of the process is explained properly to the public, politicians and professionals, so that people are aware of the impact of the modelling and the outcomes of that process. That part of the process can be important for the ultimate decisions, so it is important to get it right.</p><p>Health is a major issue in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, so it is important that, if we go down the independent scrutiny panel route, we get it absolutely right. The process must be fair and transparent. The correct appointments must be made, the process must be clear and there must be a correct balance between health care, communities and professionals.

The bill contains several technical measures that are crucial to supporting the Commonwealth games, and it is important that they go hand in hand with other work that is being done, so that we have a successful Commonwealth games in 2014.</p><p>As others have done, I acknowledge the important contribution of the previous Scottish Executive and Glasgow City Council, which worked for several years to ensure a successful bid. The bill and the other work will have several pluses for Glasgow, not just for sport but for the economy. The games will benefit my constituency of Glasgow Rutherglen directly.</p><p>One technical aspect of the bill is the measures on ticket touts. I share Stuart McMillan's concerns about ticket touting. Sport is for fans and communities, but we all know of instances in which ticket touts have ripped off fans by overcharging. Touts exclude ordinary supporters and fans from attending events. It is important for Glasgow 2014 that we reach out to the communities of Glasgow and the rest of Scotland, so that many people participate in the excitement of sporting events. I hope that they go away from those events and take up sport, which will improve the sporting infrastructure throughout Scotland.</p><p>The bill contains important measures on street trading and advertising. Established street traders' concerns need to be addressed, but street trading must be regulated properly. We need to maximise the advertising revenue, so that we boost the funds for the games. Members have raised concerns about a financial overrun, but one advantage of the Glasgow project is that much of the infrastructure is in place, which will minimise the required capital spend and, I hope, limit the exposure to financial overrun. Those technical aspects must be taken care of.</p><p>The games are a tremendous opportunity for Scotland. There are great sporting benefits to be had for Glasgow and the nation. To see that, one need only consider the successes of the 1970 and 1986 Commonwealth games in Edinburgh. One of the images of 1970 is that of Lachie Stewart in the 10,000m race running away in the last lap to win. Members will understand that I have seen only the archive footage of that and that I do not remember it from the time&#8212;perhaps some older members, such as Bill Aitken, could tell us about it. Sandra White mentioned the 39 medals that we won at the most recent Commonwealth games but, until then, 1986 was our biggest medal haul, with 33 medals. That shows the advantage of being the base for <place-holder colnum=\"6357\"/> the games. I hope that we better those totals in 2014.</p><p>I echo Johann Lamont's comments about volunteers. I recently met my old athletics coach from Cambuslang Harriers, Jim Cunningham. We spoke about the many events that we competed in up and down the country, and it really brought home to me the amount of work that volunteers put in and the enthusiasm that they bring, and the mark that that can leave on youngsters. As we run towards 2014, it is important to support the work of volunteers.</p><p>I disagree with Stuart McMillan's comments about the Olympics. It is a distinct advantage that we have the London Olympics in 2012. Members should not forget that elements of those games, such as the football, will be situated in Scotland, so we will see a direct impact. We should think back to the big impact in Belfast when Mary Peters won a gold medal in 1972. Just think how it could invigorate Scottish sport in the run-up to 2014 if we got a Scottish Olympic gold medal winner.</p><p>There are obvious economic benefits to be had from the 2014 games. I welcome the recent decision on the M74. It is important that such infrastructure is in place for the games. In addition, jobs and investment will be attracted to Glasgow and the wider area, not only in the run-up to the games but post-2014.</p><p>As others have mentioned, it is important to promote fitness and healthy living. It is good that, today, we have a stall in the lobby on tackling inequalities in health care. The games give us an opportunity to promote healthy living, get people into sport and ensure that more people in Scotland live healthy lives.</p><p>I welcome the bill. The games are an opportunity to build up Scotland and Glasgow, strike a blow for sport in Scotland, boost the economy and improve the nation's health. I hope that we make the most of the opportunity in 2014.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399029", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this stage 1 debate on the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill.

I attended my first football match in 1969, along with my dad and my brother, and football has been a passion ever since. I have been hooked on the game all that time, so it is an honour to open this debate, which focuses on the topic of football.</p><p>I speak in favour of the motion in the name of Marilyn Livingstone. I know that she supports the work of Supporters Direct and that she is a strong supporter of the work of the Raith Trust in her constituency.</p><p>Football is very important throughout Scotland's communities. It is very much the staple diet of people's lives and conversations&#8212;in fact, I believe that some members are heading off tonight to a football match, and I wish them a happy, enjoyable and successful evening.</p><p>There is no doubt that the attendance at football matches has changed a lot since my first game in 1969. One of the positive developments has been the increase in the number of women who now come along to the football. When I used to go in the 1980s along with my cousin Rose-Marie, she was the sole woman in large parts of the ground, but when I took my daughter Carys to her first game a couple of years ago, I am pleased to say that that situation had changed. That is positive for football and for Scottish society.</p><p>A range of clubs is involved in football throughout Scotland, as can be seen in my constituency. On the professional side, there is Clyde&#8212;a team that has moved to Cumbernauld, but which still has strong links with the Rutherglen constituency in which it resided when it won the Scottish cup in the 1950s. On the junior side, <place-holder colnum=\"6137\"/> Rutherglen Glencairn and Cambuslang Rangers have both been very successful, and we are lucky enough to have successful amateur sides in Eastwood United and Rutherglen Amateurs.</p><p>There is no doubt that the financial impact of the game looms large these days. Indeed, in the next round of English Premier League contracts, the English premiership clubs will get &#163;40 million of television money. We live in a time in which some players earn more in a week than the people who go to watch them earn in a year&#8212;a time in which the combined debt of Scottish Premier League clubs is &#163;200 million.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the importance of supporters and communities is very important. As Jock Stein said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Football without fans is nothing\".</p><p>From that point of view, the work of Supporters Direct is absolutely essential, because it promotes a co-operative approach, and it promotes work in the community. It gives supporters voices, through the supporters trusts, and it gives an element of accountability and democracy. Football supporters feel strongly about their clubs, and it is important that they have a vehicle through which to communicate their feelings to the directors about the way in which the club is run.</p><p>One of the successes of Supporters Direct has been the setting up of 35 supporters trusts throughout Scotland, which have 15,000 members. Supporters Direct has been instrumental in saving six clubs&#8212;Morton, Clyde, Clydebank, Dundee, Raith Rovers and Falkirk&#8212;and it has facilitated the investment of &#163;2 million in clubs. Supporters Direct has also moved into rugby union, and it is considering how it can move forward supporters trusts in that field. There is a lot of support for the trusts throughout Scotland and across the political spectrum.</p><p>Tonight's debate comes at an appropriate time for Supporters Direct. It is currently funded by the reduction in pools betting duty, but that funding runs out at the end of March. It has submitted a funding programme of &#163;140,000 a year over the next three years to the Scottish Government; there have been a number of meetings and discussions but, at this point in time, no hard cash. Time is clearly running out, and I take the opportunity of this debate to call on the Scottish Government to provide the funding that is necessary for Supporters Direct to do such essential work throughout Scotland.</p><p>The minister could respond to the debate very positively by giving a positive commitment on funding for Supporters Direct. This is an excellent debate to take part in&#8212;it has allowed me to showcase the work of Supporters Direct, and that would be reiterated if Marilyn Livingstone were in <place-holder colnum=\"6138\"/> the chamber. The debate has to have a purpose; as I said, it gives the minister a chance to come forward and score a goal by providing funding to Supporters Direct, and by giving it a platform to develop its future and to roar forward to success in 2008-09.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398510", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporters Direct in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate and to express my support for the work of Supporters Direct.

However, as I was walking down to the Parliament this morning, a passing bus went through a large puddle and splashed me with water, so my enthusiasm for buses dimmed somewhat at that moment.</p><p>Transport is a major issue in my constituency of Rutherglen, partly because we have a larger than average number of pensioners and also because some people do not have cars&#8212;in fact, a third of Scots do not have cars. Bus and other transport links are very important in allowing people to <place-holder colnum=\"5664\"/> access major centres such as Glasgow and East Kilbride and services such as hospitals. From many parts of my constituency, it takes more than two bus journeys to get to hospital.</p><p>I support many of the positive comments that have been made about the concessionary scheme. When I spoke at a meeting of the Rutherglen Workers Educational Association recently, its members told me that one of the biggest benefits that they have received since devolution is the concessionary travel scheme. Politics is about making a difference. The scheme makes a difference because it allows older people to get to places in Scotland that they might not have visited for quite some time, such as Oban.</p><p>I also support the extension of the concessionary travel scheme to those who are on the lower rate of the disability living allowance. That issue was raised by a number of my constituents.</p><p>There is a concern about the bus service operators grant. In the current budget, it flatlines at &#163;57.5 million per year. That means that, over the next three years, there will be no cash increase and a real-terms cut. The effect of that will be to put Scotland at a &#163;7.5 million disadvantage to England and Wales. If we continue at that level, the gap will grow to &#163;26.5 million over the next three years. That point was raised at First Minister's questions on 20 December but, as ever, we did not get a straight answer from the First Minister.</p><p>The present level of funding could also have an adverse effect on bus fares and an impact on bus routes. Fares could increase and a number of bus routes could be withdrawn. In my constituency, routes have been withdrawn in recent times, but we have conducted campaigns and managed to get some of them reinstated, most notably those to Cathkin and Springhall. The withdrawal of bus routes has a knock-on effect, particularly for pensioners. It also has an environmental impact, given that the increase in the number of bus journeys in recent years has helped us to meet climate change targets as well as boosting the economy.

Energy policy, covering gas and electricity, is one of the big challenges of the 21 <sup>st</sup> century. It is essential that we produce a secure energy policy that keeps the lights on, reduces consumption and carbon emissions, and tackles fuel poverty. In that light, it is important that we have a balanced energy policy. Currently, the balance for electricity generation includes renewable sources, gas, coal and nuclear. That mix is important to protect us against future shortages and changes in market conditions. When the new electricity trading arrangements were introduced in September 2001, the price per megawatt hour fell below &#163;20. Over time, market conditions changed and the price rose towards &#163;40. If we had put all our investment into one source of energy, that source would have fallen short and we would not have been protected against those market conditions.</p><p>It is important that we do not end up as an electricity importer, as has happened with gas. Currently, we are an exporter, which is an economic asset that we must protect. To be honest, some of the SNP analysis in the past week has fallen a bit short. Alex Salmond trumpeted the fact that the nuclear share of electricity generation fell from 38 to 22 per cent from 2005 to 2006, and he spoke about, in effect, being nuclear free in 2007. He also downplayed the importance of exports. However, he did not speak about the fact that Hunterston was offline for much of that time, nor did he make much play of the fact that coal generation has increased from 25 to 33 per cent, or that gas generation has increased from 19 to 22 per cent. Cockenzie power station had to be run at full capacity to meet the shortfall. The fact is that Torness produces 8 terawatt hours of energy, which is a significant contribution to electricity generation. No sprinkling of energy fairy dust by the minister can simply replace that in the future.</p><p>It is important that we have a strong and stable base-load, and a mixed energy policy would contribute to that. As coal currently accounts for a third of electricity generation, it is important, as the minister said, to pilot and prioritise the production <place-holder colnum=\"5150\"/> of clean coal, as Scottish Power has done at Longannet.</p><p>Energy and electricity generation are crucial to economic growth.

On Friday, I was in Stornoway in Alasdair Allan's constituency, where, unusually for January, it was not a very windy day, so some of the wind farms were not generating as much energy as normal.

We have to make great strides towards tackling fuel poverty, and rising energy costs are a threat to that. A 5 per cent increase in energy costs can put 30,000 households into fuel poverty. If the npower increase is replicated throughout Scotland, 90,000 households could be put into fuel poverty. If the SNP is serious about eradicating fuel poverty by 2016, it must back up its warm words with strong actions. It is therefore disappointing that the SNP has not supported Sarah Boyack's proposed energy efficiency and microgeneration bill. Some of the measures in that bill would go a long way towards tackling fuel poverty.</p><p>In my constituency, Rutherglen and Cambuslang Housing Association has been installing solar panels, which Sarah Boyack came to see in August.

I see the debate as an opportunity to celebrate St Andrew's day, to reflect on the successes of Scottish life, and to contemplate what sort of Scotland we want in the 21 <sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>I want to be positive about St Andrew's day and positive about Scotland. We have a proud history and heritage, and one of the aspects that I will concentrate on is science and innovation. If we consider Fleming, Bell's work on the telephone and Logie Baird's creation of the television, we have some tremendous examples to follow. That continues in current Scottish life, because one person in 100 is employed as a scientist. That is positive and we want it to continue. It is a relevant point to make on the back of yesterday's science in the Parliament event, which was organised by Bristow Muldoon, a former MSP.</p><p>Yesterday's event considered some key challenges for Scotland, including energy, renewables, electricity generation and climate change. As we look back at Scotland's great heritage and talent in science and innovation, we must also consider how to reduce carbon emissions, tackle fuel poverty and keep the lights burning in Scotland. Those are key tasks.</p><p>It is also important to celebrate Scotland's success in engineering. As I came into Edinburgh this morning on the train from Cambuslang, I saw the Forth rail bridge emerge through the morning gloom. It reminded me what a great advert for Scottish engineering the bridge is. Recently, I looked at some pictures of the building of the bridge. It was tremendously interesting to see each part being built. We should not forget that it took 4,600 workers to put the bridge up over a good number of years. Nor should we forget that there were 71 deaths during the process.</p><p>I pay tribute to those in modern times who have made efforts to encourage the Scottish workforce. I pay tribute to Karen Whitefield for the work she did on the Christmas Day and New Year's Day Trading (Scotland) Act 2007, which gave workers in large shops the opportunity to spend some much-needed time with their families on Christmas day. The Parliament agreed that a pilot study would be run in relation to new year's day. The matter has been raised by a number of my constituents and I wrote to the minister about it. He said that he is not prepared to go ahead with <place-holder colnum=\"3994\"/> that pilot. That is most disappointing. It is also disrespectful to the Parliament and its decision.</p><p>The minister thinks that a pilot would not be a good use of public money. I wonder whether he would like to tell workers who have to go out and work in large shops on new year's day whether the &#163;100,000 that was spent on changing the Scottish Executive's name to the Scottish Government, or the &#163;100,000 that was spent on coming up with the \"Welcome to Scotland\" slogan, was money well spent Perhaps we should not be surprised. When one of the major pieces of legislation on the workforce was voted through in the UK Parliament&#8212;on the stipulation of the minimum wage&#8212;two members of the Scottish Cabinet were not present. Regrettably, both Alex Salmond and John Swinney were absent on that occasion.</p><p>As we reflect on St Andrew's day, we should consider what sort of Scotland and Scottish society we want. A lot of members rightly mentioned the number of festivals and events that take place throughout Scotland. It is also important to reach out to other groups who do important work to build up Scotland as a society and as a country.</p><p>For example, in my constituency, the local community health initiative is doing important work&#8212;a lot of it resourced voluntarily&#8212;to promote healthy living, but it is worried about its funding in 2008. The mental health campaign groups are worried about changes in funding, which is being transferred to local government, and various housing campaign groups and organisations are concerned about whether the current local government settlement will deliver adequate social housing and help to meet the targets on homelessness.</p><p>From Rabbie Burns to Alexander Graham Bell, there is a lot to celebrate in Scottish life. We must remember our heritage and tap into Scotland's talent, but we must also speak out for the disadvantaged in Scotland. If we can continue to do all those things, Scotland will flourish and we can celebrate many more successful St Andrew's days.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393421", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew's Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to speak in this debate on St Andrew's day and to support the Labour amendment.

The point of being in politics is to make a difference. As Nanette Milne said, autism sufferers throughout the country are looking for assistance and want politicians and the Parliament to play a positive role. We can make an impact through supporting the autism parliamentary network, which has a vital role to play, working in tandem with the National Autistic Society, linking with autism campaigns throughout the country and bringing the issue to the Parliament and the committees. It will help to raise awareness of the issue in the Parliament and throughout the country and enable us to make a difference to the lives of autism sufferers and their families.</p><p>Nanette Milne touched on the crucial importance of raising awareness of autism. Fifty thousand people in Scotland have autism, but 92 per cent of people are unaware of how common it is. Autism sufferers and those who support them have to overcome a number of obstacles in trying to raise awareness of the condition. One of those is the perception that all autism sufferers are a bit like the Dustin Hoffman character in \"Rain Man\", who has special gifts. In fact, only one in 200 autism sufferers falls into that category.</p><p>Another difficulty for parents of young children who have autism arises when they are out and about in public. Some autistic kids have behavioural difficulties and the public might not be aware of what those parents must deal with. Such issues must be overcome. If we can raise awareness, people will have a better understanding, which will lead to improved resources that will help communities and provide much-needed support.<place-holder colnum=\"3297\"/></p><p>Education is vital. We talk a lot about education in the Parliament and it is a big priority for MSPs. Education is vital for autistic children and adults. With better education, we can provide autism sufferers with the skills and techniques to cope better in the difficult world that they must face.</p><p>Resources are important to that, particularly for young children in primary schools, as Nanette Milne said. In my area, a campaign was launched two weeks ago in Rutherglen and Cambuslang to improve resources for autistic children. South Lanarkshire Council provides excellent resources in all other areas of South Lanarkshire but, unfortunately, Rutherglen and Cambuslang are lacking. The campaign wants the council, which has an excellent record of reaching out to communities, to extend those resources to Rutherglen and Cambuslang. The campaign had a successful petition with great feedback on the streets at the weekend. I will work with that group to achieve a successful outcome.</p><p>I am conscious that I am running out of time to mention other important issues, such as the need for early diagnosis and early intervention.

When I first saw the subject in the <em>Business Bulletin</em> , it did not strike me as one of the more exciting topics for debate. However, having heard members' speeches this morning and having looked into the matter, I recognise that ADR is important to Scotland and its communities. It has a crucial role to play and it is vital in resolving disputes. The debate presents an opportunity to highlight on-going work on ADR and to focus on potential ways forward for people in difficulty. It also lets us explore the different methods of ADR, which we should try to ensure are more widely used.</p><p>Clearly, ADR is an alternative to going to court, which is a major advantage and is attractive to people who are a bit averse to going to court and are intimidated by it. Another barrier to going to court is legal costs. ADR is attractive as an <place-holder colnum=\"2945\"/> alternative to court, because arbitration or a third party can be used to find a solution to a problem.</p><p>Some lawyers are wary of ADR&#8212;we have heard from a few learned friends during the debate. However, a strong social justice issue is involved, and ADR has an important role to play from that viewpoint. ADR can help to solve problems and resolve disputes, and can help people to win their rightful compensation. It can also protect their confidentiality.</p><p>In dealing with constituency cases, I often find that people come to my surgery feeling frustrated and upset. They come to their MSP when they have been badly treated by organisations or individuals because they feel that there is no one else they can turn to for help. ADR can provide a platform for justice in such cases and give people who feel powerless a voice.</p><p>The SNP's legislative programme, which was announced in September, was somewhat light. It could have provided a window of opportunity to introduce ADR proposals. However, I welcome the cabinet secretary's announcement that a bill will be introduced in the new year. I am sure that that is welcomed throughout the chamber.</p><p>I pay tribute to the work of citizens advice bureaux in trying to resolve disputes. They provide an invaluable service to local communities. I am fortunate in having two citizen advice bureaux in my constituency&#8212;one in Rutherglen and one in Cambuslang. The latter office, which was opened in the summer by Princess Anne, is staffed by experienced people with expertise in a range of areas, and it uses the latest information technology to provide an important service to local people by advising on disputes and providing guidance on ADR.</p><p>Recently, the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman acknowledged that health is one of the biggest areas for complaints. That is mirrored in some of my surgery cases. Where possible, it is important to try to resolve such cases at a lower level&#8212;at the general practitioner level. GP practices do important work in that regard.</p><p>I visited a GP practice recently that has a mature attitude to complaints. When someone makes a complaint, not only is the practice not defensive about it, but the complaint is investigated and the practice tries to learn from the experience. That is an example of good practice in the complaints process.</p><p>ADR arbitration can also be used to address housing issues. For example, there are many neighbour disputes about harassment and noise. I am sure that many members get such cases at their surgeries. Many councils use mediation in such cases, which plays an important role. It is <place-holder colnum=\"2946\"/> important to stand up for the victims and ensure that justice is done.</p><p>In my constituency, there is an on-going housing dispute for which mediation is important. Residents of south Toryglen have an issue regarding repairs to the external fabric and roofs of buildings that were promised at the time of stock transfer. The repairs have not been carried out because of the lack of funding that is available to Thistle Housing Association.</p><p>The Toryglen home owners group feels aggrieved at the role that Communities Scotland&#8212;which is soon to be abolished&#8212;has played in the situation, and has taken its case to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. It is a serious matter, because housing in Toryglen has been underfunded. I tried to mediate in the dispute by requesting that the Minister for Communities and Sport, who has responsibility for housing, meet me and Thistle Housing Association. The request was declined, but I will continue to press the matter.</p><p>I have enjoyed the opportunity to take part in the debate, which has helped to raise the profile of alternative dispute resolution. ADR provides a way forward for people in communities throughout Scotland who are looking for a voice.

It has quite clearly been positive for the North Lanarkshire community and economy and I hope that it will be sustainable in the area.</p><p>Like my colleague Helen Eadie, I am a Labour and Co-operative MSP. The local Co-operative groups in my area and the Co-operative retail group in general have done a great deal, not just in Scotland but throughout the UK. The Co-op has a proud tradition of piloting ideas of community and social responsibility that runs from New Lanark and the Fenwick weavers to the modern Co-op of today.</p><p>The Co-op retail group is an excellent example of good practice. It was the first retail organisation to push anti-apartheid ideas and it has been at the forefront of action on climate change and labelling. It picks up on such ideas because it is close to communities and to what people believe in, unlike some other profit-making organisations, which are close to shareholders and the bottom line and are sometimes not driven by the ideas of fairness and justice.</p><p>During the summer, I was interested to visit two Co-op stores in Cathkin and Halfway in my area, where I saw how the Co-op's social responsibility role has been developed. By working with the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, those stores have ensured that their workers are protected from unfortunate aspects of local crime and antisocial behaviour. This afternoon, we debated alcohol and it was clear that the Co-op shops that I visited took extremely seriously the control of sales of alcohol to underage people.

Its promises have crumbled as it has taken the reins of power and has had to deal with the reality of doing so.</p><p>One example of the hype versus the reality is the situation with probationer teachers, which is a live issue in my constituency. Over the summer months, I was approached by 15 probationer teachers throughout Cambuslang, Rutherglen and Toryglen, who were made unemployed at the end of June and faced a summer of uncertainty about their future prospects, because they were unsure whether they would get a job in education.</p><p>In June I noted the cabinet secretary's announcement of 300 new jobs, but the previous Administration had committed funding for 1,000 probationer teachers. Moving that forward would have given those probationers real hope.</p><p>The school that I went to taught me that 1,000 minus 300 leaves 700. That deficit of 700 means that many probationer teachers have spent the summer chasing jobs. The minister might respond that a lot of those teachers are now doing supply jobs, but many of those to whom I have spoken over the past few days have said that they get to work a day here and a day there. One teacher e-mailed me last night to tell me how delighted they were that they were getting another morning's work. I certainly welcome that, but when someone is working only two and a half days a week, it is difficult for them to plan their future life and career.</p><p>We should not waste the talent of probationer teachers. Among them are lawyers who have given up their profession to move into teaching, mature students and young people who have come out of school to follow their dream of working in the classroom. They are committed and we must not lose their talent but invest in it.</p><p>One of the issues on which all parties agreed during the election was the need for economic growth.

There is no doubt that global warming presents a tremendous threat not just to Scotland but to the international community. We have a great opportunity to combat climate change and the increase in greenhouse gases in order to build a country that will be safe not only for our children but for future generations.</p><p>In meeting that challenge, carbon offsetting has been identified as a mechanism giving individuals and businesses the opportunity to compensate for their carbon dioxide emissions. It is well intentioned, but it has a minimal impact. A recent investigation by the <em>Financial Times</em> indicated some flaws. The investigation revealed worthless credits, through which the carbon that was defined was not in fact recovered and it showed that some brokers were not providing value for money and, in some instances, were providing very little service. It further indicated that verification was flimsy, with a lack of controls. Carbon offsetting can be used, but it should be used as a last resort. When it is used, it is important that appropriate controls are in place in order that the offsets can be measured and we can see what the CO<sub>2</sub> reductions are.</p><p>The best way to combat climate change is to reduce our carbon footprint by reducing carbon emissions. There is a duty on Government to drive that agenda forward, but there is also a duty on us all&#8212;individuals, businesses and the public sector. There are some excellent practical examples in Scotland of organisations that are carrying the agenda forward. In my area, South Lanarkshire Council, which covers 300,000 people, 686 square miles, 1,300 buildings and 600 staff, produces 48,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. The council has measured and recognised that and it has signed up to a five-year plan to combat carbon emissions and reduce their effect.</p><p>Building specifications are a big area in which improvements can be made. The Scottish Natural Heritage building in Inverness has a specification that is 30 per cent greater than the current convention. As a report on \"Good Morning Scotland\" this morning indicated, individuals are moving from using tumble dryers to drying clothes outside, which has resulted in a fourteenfold increase in the sale of clothes-pegs.</p><p>The way forward lies in strong Government action. Unlike the previous speaker, I welcome the strong action that has been taken by the UK Government and the previous Scottish Executive. Transport, which represents 18 per cent of our carbon footprint, is a key area. It is important to have an efficient transport system. A balance is <place-holder colnum=\"743\"/> needed, as transport is an important driver for the economy.</p><p>Carbon offsetting has a minimal impact and should be used only as a last resort.

Like many new members, I have been bombarded with mail from helpful and interested organisations that are trying to guide me in my early days in the Parliament, urging me to take up certain causes. However, the cause that is closest to my heart is to represent my constituents with diligence and a good conscience, working on behalf of all my constituents, not just those who voted for me.</p><p>I come to the chamber fired with a belief in social justice and a belief in the need for a strong Scottish economy that will provide good quality <place-holder colnum=\"224\"/> jobs and a platform from which people throughout Scotland can move forward. The areas that today's debate covers, under the heading \"Wealthier and Fairer\", are relevant to my constituency, where good progress has been made in recent years to build wealth and create more fairness. Since the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, 216,000 extra jobs have been created and we have seen the introduction of the minimum wage. In 1997, 85,000 people were earning less than &#163;2.50 an hour, yet all those people have now been lifted out of poverty. Those measures&#8212;which were introduced by the UK Government and backed up by the then Scottish Executive&#8212;have done a lot to build the Scottish economy and to create wealth and fairness.</p><p>Another example of driving the economy forward that will affect my constituency is the M74 project. That is a key driver that will create an estimated 12,000 jobs throughout Glasgow and the West of Scotland. I note the cabinet secretary's announcement of a review of transport projects, and I hope that the M74 project will not be affected.</p><p>In considering the big issues in wealth and fairness, the growth of the Scottish economy is the one that sticks out. The financial services sector, which supports 108,000 jobs directly and 90,000 jobs indirectly, has achieved growth of 36 per cent in the past five years and is still growing. The new Administration that has taken power should note that any sense of instability or unpredictability would undermine that growth, particularly since much of that business is generated from outwith Scotland.</p><p>I firmly believe that we need to move forward in the 21<sup>st</sup> century by trying to create full employment. From that point of view, I support the creation of a full employment agency tasked with moving Scotland towards full employment and creating jobs for all.</p><p>It is important that we tie that in with education. We need a strong emphasis on science and on languages. Scotland has one scientist for every 100 people. That is a proud tradition on which we should build. However, we must not forget those parts of our society and country that have not moved forward in recent years. We must legislate to help disadvantaged young people and do what we can to improve those who fall into the NEET category. I believe that raising the school leaving age to 18 and the introduction of skills academies would do something in that regard.</p><p>An international perspective is also important. From that point of view, the Executive should continue to encourage fair trade so that we support enterprise and fairness not just in our country, but throughout the international arena. In that regard, I welcome the campaign to secure <place-holder colnum=\"225\"/> Fairtrade town status for Cambuslang.</p><p>I believe that there are some flaws in the SNP's plans, not least its plan for a local income tax. Such a tax would raise the tax burden, which would be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"naive in a knowledge economy\".</p><p>Those are not my words, but those of the SNP's then enterprise spokesman, Jim Mather.</p><p>Some of the Executive's thinking around abolishing bridge tolls and not committing to new trams is confused. No amount of sprinkling fiscal fairy dust can iron out those problems.</p><p>I believe that the way forward is to create a fair and wealthy Scotland. This is the country that invented the television through John Logie Baird and the telephone through Alexander Graham Bell. Let us in the 21<sup>st</sup> century build an arena for trail-blazers like our forefathers Bell and Baird. Let us make this chamber an engine room for the politics of progress. In that regard, the Labour Party's priority will be to blaze the trail for policies that will create a successful Scotland where the economy flourishes hand in hand with fairness and justice.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wealthier and Fairer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am proud to make my first speech as the newly elected Labour MSP for the Glasgow Rutherglen constituency, which covers Rutherglen, Cambuslang, Toryglen and King's Park.
