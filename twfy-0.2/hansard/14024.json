I also thank him for his kind efforts in helping with the potential postponement of the debate&#8212;which, happily, we did not have to do&#8212;to aid the SNP group&#8217;s tribute meeting to our colleague Brian Adam. John Pentland put in a great effort on that, which is much appreciated. I also appreciate his gift of a purple memorial ribbon, which demonstrates our support for international workers memorial day to the world.</p><p>I want to put on record our friend Brian Adam&#8217;s dedication to ensuring that workers on the rigs and vessels that serve the oil and gas industry in the North Sea were represented whenever health and safety issues were raised. As a long-time trade union activist, Brian Adam knew the value and necessity of the work of unions and of the Scottish hazards campaign in keeping such issues to the fore.</p><p>On 2 December 1984, the Bhopal gas disaster at the Union Carbide site in India killed thousands of people. It continues to affect the lives of many hundreds more in that area who are still campaigning for redress for what took place in that disgraceful episode when business was more important than workers. The Governments of both India and the United States of America have been shown to have collaborated in allowing Dow Chemical, which now owns Union Carbide, to escape facing up to the liabilities that have affected the individuals and community of Bhopal.</p><p>We have all heard about the recent explosion at a Texas fertiliser plant: a full 29 years after Bhopal, we are still seeing a failure on an international scale to address safety issues. The Texas factory was last inspected in 1985&#8212;just after the Bhopal disaster&#8212;by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States. That is a full 28 years without a health and safety inspection. As a result of that failing, 14 people died and almost 200 were injured.</p><p>What is the UK Government&#8217;s reaction to the lessons? It has cut the Health and Safety Executive&#8217;s budget by 35 per cent and announced an end to proactive unannounced visits by the Health and Safety Executive to factories and other industrial sites.

I am also a member of the global council of abolition 2000 and Scottish CND.</p><p>The Norwegian Government invited me to an international conference that was held in Oslo two weeks ago, whose remit was to discuss the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. Some 127 Governments were represented, and there were more than 500 delegates from non-governmental organisations around the world. We heard from the Red Cross about how just one 1-megatonne bomb would create such a level of death, injury and civil damage that no country could possibly cope with it. Even countries that co-operated with one another would have difficulty in bringing any succour to those that had had that unfortunate occurrence happen to them. I said &#8220;unfortunate occurrence&#8221; but, obviously, an unfortunate occurrence is getting hit by a car when crossing the road or falling seriously ill. Somebody would have had to have dropped that 1-megatonne bomb on the country&#8212;they would have taken that choice, and they would have had that choice because they had a nuclear arsenal.</p><p>Only those countries with a nuclear arsenal present a danger to the world that this will come about. It is therefore incumbent on the countries that have these weapons to take their humanitarian impact seriously. However, the P5&#8212;the permanent five members of the United Nations Security Council, all of which are nuclear weapons states&#8212;refused to take up their invitations to speak at the conference alongside the other 127 nations that deigned to speak on such a serious issue.</p><p>The pretext of the P5&#8217;s refusal of these invitations was that the conference, which was addressed by the International Committee of the Red Cross, scientists, physicians and survivors of nuclear test explosions, was a distraction from the nuclear disarmament in which the P5 are engaged. For all we know, they might be engaged in it for another 50 years&#8212;after all, that is the plan for Trident. To my mind, that was just arrogant, patronising tosh.</p><p>Of course, such tosh comes from the likes of the Westminster Government, which has committed us all in the UK to &#163;100 billion of present and future expenditure on a weapon that can never be used because it is too dangerous and threatens mass destruction and environmental devastation from which the world might never be able to recover. The P5&#8217;s remarks did not go over well with a great majority of the world&#8217;s nations that had attended the conference. That said, I note that, although the conference was a one-off, there was a vote for a follow-up conference, to which the P5 will again be invited to explain their position on the humanitarian effects of nuclear weapons.</p><p>I have spoken at many international conferences to put forward my view that the wish of most people is for a world without nuclear weapons; I believe that the same is the case in this chamber. However, that is not going to happen simply because we wish it to happen. Someone has got to do something about it. The proposal from members on these benches is that, in an independent Scotland, there be no place for Trident or any other nuclear weapons system. That would leave Westminster having to find another home for its weapons of mass destruction. However, such a place could not be in England or Wales because, as some might be surprised to learn&#8212;although they should not be surprised, because this is well-known expert opinion&#8212;there is nowhere else for Trident to go on these islands other than where they are at the moment. In some people&#8217;s minds, that means Scotland will have to remain the repository of these weapons on behalf of the UK. I do not find that acceptable and will campaign and argue against such a view.</p><p>When Trident leaves Scotland, it will be heading for the knacker&#8217;s yard. We are not threatening to put it in Merseyside, Devonport or indeed Milford Haven in Wales. I note that the last was another option that was discussed but, once people noticed that there were three petrochemical facilities in the area, they thought that it might be a bit too dangerous to put Trident there and went against the idea.</p><p>As for the jobs at Faslane and Coulport, there are, according to the MOD, 564 jobs that are directly linked to Trident, while the conventional naval base accounts for the employment of all other staff. It is the intention of SNP members that the conventional naval base will take up the staff who are employed on Trident.</p><p>Moreover, the loss of so many conventional military jobs under the Westminster Government&#8212;we remember the disgraceful redundancy notices that were handed out to our front-line troops while on duty in Afghanistan&#8212;is another example of how money is being wasted on Trident and is therefore not available to maintain our useful conventional forces.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687091", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wish to note that I am a co-president of parliamentarians for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, which has more than 800 members from more than 80 Parliaments around the world.

With the advent of the industrial revolution, coal and iron ore&#8212;the raw materials of industry, which were found in plentiful supply in many areas of the country&#8212;were turned into the steel that ensured a solid base for the population growth of many communities that we all know today. The countless thousands of workers whose sweat oiled the businesses that made riches for some in the land are to be held in the highest regard. They are, after all, our own recent and distant ancestors, so we do well to honour them through support for the Scottish steelworkers memorial fund.</p><p>My memories of the fight to save steel production and thousands of jobs in Scotland revolve greatly around what we called the steel camp, which I and a number of friends established at the gates of Gartcosh in early 1986. I have probably aged less well than Elaine Smith since that time&#8212;I see that she is hiding her shyness, having left the chamber.</p><p>Gartcosh was a major campaign. For the people who worked there, it was more than that&#8212;it was their lives and their families&#8217; lives. We were happy to stand alongside them. It snowed, of course, but we had four tents and a camp stove and took two or three-day shifts at the camp, trying to show our support for the steelworkers and to provide our own focal point for protest at the threatened closure. We had the television, radio and newspapers visit us, as well as many well-wishers who brought supplies. However, it was the kindness of the staff and regulars at the nearby Gartcosh social club that sticks in my memory. They gave us a place to wash in the mornings and the occasional proper meal&#8212;because, although we tried, it is impossible to live on Mars bars for a month&#8212;and showed solidarity with us, much as we were trying to do with them.</p><p>My family background is in shipbuilding and engineering and, as is obvious, those required a constant supply of top-quality steel. The links between communities across Scotland are greatly shaped by the steel that was produced in the great mills of Ravenscraig and the other production sites that have been mentioned. My dad suffered from industrial deafness from working in engineering&#8212;at least, that is what he told us when we asked for a couple of pounds on a Friday night. That is the kind of person who showed support for the steelworkers, and the steelworkers were strong in showing their support for other people across the country, which was always welcome during the industrial disputes of the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>The coal mining communities worked in tandem with their industrial cousins, and we should mention them, too. The jobs were always dangerous and, as I have spoken at conferences that were organised by the STUC and the Scottish hazards campaign, I am well aware of the sad sacrifices of the many who suffered injury and death at their workplace in the course of steel manufacturing. It is fitting that those sacrifices should be marked by a permanent memorial.</p><p>It is with heartfelt pride that I speak here today to thank the generations of steelworkers and their families, who have contributed so much to the Scotland of today. I fully support the Scottish steelworkers memorial fund and the efforts of those who are in the public gallery tonight and others who are involved in marking the contributions of those who worked in the steel production that made our country what it is today and all those who were, sadly, injured or killed in that work.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672222", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Steelworkers Memorial Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank my friend and colleague, Clare Adamson, for bringing this timely debate to the chamber.

In the debate on conventional weaponry, I tend towards the non-proliferation element of the argument as I feel that pursuing achievable major reductions in the small-arms trade in particular will make a major difference to the lives of millions of people across the world.</p><p>I have spoken to the former UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Sergio Duarte, about the issue on a number of occasions and I know that his comments on the suffering of so many from the effects of both the legal and the illegal arms trade come from his in-depth discussions with politicians and non-governmental organisations over many years.</p><p>For many people, the threat of crime, violence and Government repression is a big part of their everyday lives. That is helped along no end by the extreme availability of weapons. For instance, despite a review of its arms transfer policies in 2011 following the Arab spring, the USA remains a major supplier of arms to both Tunisia and Egypt. Last year, the Americans delivered 45 M1A1 tanks to Egypt and it has an agreement to deliver another 125. On the other side of the coin is Russia, which supplied 78 per cent of Syria&#8217;s arms imports from 2007 until 2011. Such deliveries continue despite the political repression going on there. With surface-to-air and coastal defence missile systems and an order for 36 Yak-130 combat aircraft accounting for a 580 per cent increase in the volume of Syrian arms imports over a five-year period, the large countries in the world that manufacture most of those weapons have nothing to sit on their laurels about.</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa the blight of the small-arms trade goes on, unhindered by the humanitarian catastrophes of drought and starvation. There, as Ghana&#8217;s national commission on small arms and light weapons stated just yesterday, the result of the unregulated trade in those guns accounts for the diversion of arms into illegal markets and thence into the hands of criminals, gangsters, drug barons, warlords and terrorists. The Ghana national commission wants sanctions, an arms embargo and other international obligations aimed at preventing armed conflict, the displacement of peoples and transnational crime. It also wants a major international effort put into victim assistance for those affected by that untrammelled trade in misery.</p><p>This truly is an international problem that, to the greatest extent, affects women and children. Highlighting that, earlier this week in the Philippines around 80 women dressed in black gathered in front of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila to call on the Philippine Government to support a strong gender-responsive arms trade treaty. In support of their case they handed in not only a letter to President Aquino but, as was pointed out earlier, a bunch of bananas in order to highlight the fact that as there are global rules regulating the trade in bananas there must also be a treaty regulating the trade in weapons that at present sees 2,000 people die from armed violence in both conflict and non-conflict situations every day.</p><p>Guns and other weapons will not disappear from our world any time soon, but we need all developed and under-developed nations to sign up to regulation and to halting the cynical manufacture of such weapons without adequate concern for where they end up and the carnage that they cause.

However, it is symptomatic of events that have occurred at regular intervals over the past 90 years or so following the collapse of the European empires. Whether they were French, British or Italian, such empires of the late 18th and 19th centuries left something behind that has caused many lives to be lost long after the empires ceased. Many of the countries to have emerged following that period have unfeasibly straight borders between themselves and their neighbours. That is a result of the cobbling together of client states for the economic and trading benefit of their former colonial masters.</p><p>The modern Syrian state is just such a fairly recent construct, arising out of the Arab Levant on the fall of the Ottoman empire. That followed the first world war, when Syria and Lebanon were established as French mandates. Independence was at last gained in April 1946, although that was followed by a number of military coups, the last of which, in 1961, brought to an end the short-lived union with Egypt as the United Arab Republic.</p><p>This is not just a history lesson. The fact is that the Syria that we now see grew out of that tumultuous history. It has not always been thus, and it need not always be thus.</p><p>From 1963 to the present day, however, the country has existed in a state of emergency law that has suspended most constitutional protections for its citizens, with Hafez al-Assad ruling for 30 years and his son Bashar in effect inheriting that role in 2000. Although the constitution limits the holding of the presidency to Sunni Muslims, who make up 74 per cent of Syrians, in practice it is the Assad family who hold all of the real political power. Significantly, they are of the minority Alawi sect, which makes up only 12 per cent of the population, although the state is nominally secular.</p><p>It is true that Hafez al-Assad instituted modernisation, with a guarantee of women&#8217;s equal status in society and an attempt at industrialisation and by using Syria&#8217;s oil wealth to invest in growth in education, medicine, literacy and infrastructure. However, the cost came not only in oil but in the repression of free speech, summed up in the 1982 Hama massacre, which has been described as</p><p>&#8220;the single deadliest act by any Arab government ... in the modern Middle East.&#8221;</p><p>When Bashar Assad assumed the presidency in 2000, popular feeling had become rife with festering dissent waiting to bubble up. With the Arab spring of 2011, the stage was set for an outpouring of protest and calls for the establishment of a democratic Syria. The result has been approaching civil war.</p><p>The people of Syria need the support of outside intervention, but not through bombing or invasion. Instead, Russia and China, in particular, need to come into the 21st century and to start to use their international influence in a positive way, as is suggested by their belated support for the Kofi Annan six-point plan. As the states with the ear of their client&#8212;the Assad Government&#8212;they can cause the Government guns to fall silent and allow all parties to come to the table of diplomacy.</p><p>Proxy wars should be consigned to the history books of the 20th century; the people of Syria do not deserve it.

It has been acknowledged by members of all parties that all our MEPs work hard and well&#8212;we could probably do with having more of them. Members also acknowledged that our Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, Richard Lochhead, represents the Scottish Parliament well in negotiations. Given that 70 per cent of UK fish landings are made by Scottish vessels, we must ensure that we have direct representation at the agriculture and fisheries council when the final proposals on the CFP are decided in December.</p><p>The EU is not all about fish suppers. The European social fund, for example, has a continuing role to play in supporting our voluntary organisations and in delivering our social inclusion policy through community planning partnerships. Priority 5 funding can be provided for projects that will get people into work and help them to improve their career prospects when they are employed. Such elements are particularly relevant to parts of Scotland like my constituency of Glasgow Anniesland.</p><p>It is incumbent on the Scottish Parliament as a whole, and on parliamentary committees and individual MSPs, to consider those and other EU programmes, and to consider how we can best serve our communities by accessing the appropriate funding streams. In doing so, we should acknowledge that the current programmes involve access to structural funds through co-financing, in concert with public bodies. Tenders are invited from organisations for projects that align closely with the co-financing organisations&#8217; strategic priorities. The advantage of the approach is that the limited funds&#8212;as we know, funds could become even more limited&#8212;can be used more strategically and project providers will no longer be required to find match funding.</p><p>Other areas, including the EU budget or multi-annual financial framework, cohesion policy, Europe-wide reform of criminal proceedings, horizon 2020&#8212;the programme for research and innovation&#8212;and proposals for public procurement, which Helen Eadie mentioned and which are increasingly important for Scotland, impact on all our constituents.

I was frankly amazed to learn that the proposed cuts are larger than any cuts that have been proposed for the rest of the United Kingdom, which is simply unacceptable. We need to know why Scotland is being singled out in such a manner. It will mean a loss of the quality jobs that are being done expertly, and a loss of quality programming for the population of this country.</p><p>Since its foundation on 18 October 1922, the BBC has, overall, done a great job in the past century, which has seen huge political, cultural and technological change. If the BBC could handle those changes, why is it that, in the 21st century, it is said to be unable to respond to the changes in the political makeup of the UK? The advent of devolution in Scotland and Wales has undoubtedly thrown up challenges for the BBC in the way that it reports news and current affairs from Scotland and from outwith Scotland but, again and again, it has shown itself to be unable to respond, to evolve and, ultimately, to represent effectively those who pay the widely reported licence fee. That is not the fault of the people who work at the BBC, but the fault of the board.</p><p>As Aesop said, it is better to bend than to break. I agree with that wise man. The BBC board should bend to the will of the Scottish people before the BBC&#8217;s commitment to the service that it provides to the people is broken.</p><p>Perhaps a halfway house could have been found. The Calman commission, the mother of the Scotland Bill that is currently snaking its way through the Westminster Parliament, proposed just that in recommendation 5.4:</p><p>&#8220;The responsibility for the appointment of the Scottish member of the BBC Trust should be exercised by Scottish Ministers, subject to the normal public appointments process.&#8221;</p><p>Let us remind ourselves that the commission was, in the words of its founders, set up to find a way to make devolution work better for the people of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Scotland Bill Committee recommended that powers that are broadly in line with those suggested by the Calman commission should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament to regulate public service broadcasting aims. Has Westminster taken up those recommendations? The simple answer is no. What does that leave us with? A public service broadcaster that is not responsible to the people to whom it broadcasts and is totally out of touch with what is required in modern-day Scotland.</p><p>Ms White picked up on evidence that was given to the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Education and Culture Committee. In the same meeting, Iain Macwhirter went on to say that the setup is no longer acceptable. He said:</p><p>&#8220;We will have a referendum. We will have either independence or a move further towards a federal arrangement. Either way, we will have a different political and constitutional environment. I see no evidence that the BBC in the UK is even beginning to recognise that.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 24 January 2012; c 654.]</p><p>Even the former BBC chief, Jeremy Peat, has added his backing to the calls for Scotland to have more broadcasting powers. He said that the</p><p>&#8220;case for more and more production out of London remains and the pressure for increased devolution of programming must continue&#8221;.</p><p>Everyone seems to get the message and most of us seem to agree that the BBC needs to adapt to the changing political climate at this juncture in Scotland&#8217;s history and, even more than that, it needs to serve its listeners and viewers in Scotland.</p><p>Lord Reith, the first director general of the BBC, was born and raised in my constituency of Glasgow Anniesland.

However, we did not see much at all about what happened in the concentration camps, possibly because it was too close to the time when those events took place to screen programmes about them.</p><p>Although my generation was spared the rigours and sacrifices of the war, people we knew who lived through it had experiences that they often related&#8212;although, as Jackson Carlaw mentioned, perhaps not those who had been in Auschwitz or Treblinka.</p><p>Since then, however, even the cold war and the then ever-present threat of the mushroom cloud seem&#8212;I emphasise the word, &#8220;seem&#8221;&#8212;to have faded from people&#8217;s everyday consciousness. Now, schoolchildren and young people in Scotland are, thankfully, even further in time from such a conflagration. However, because of that, it is imperative that we do not take our eye off the ball that is war and &#8220;man&#8217;s inhumanity to man&#8221;. War is the responsibility of all of us, as are the effects that it has on our fellow human beings. Therefore, to enter into a war for reasons of political expediency, dogma, philosophy or a twisted religious faith leaves us open to responsibility for giving support to the gross excesses of the behaviour of the combatants.</p><p>Six million Jews, 200,000 Roma, 200,000 mentally and physically disabled people, Poles, Russians, socialists, communists, Christians, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses and homosexuals&#8212;all were the direct victims of the Nazis&#8217; hate and sectarianism, and many millions more died in the war for Hitler&#8217;s imperial expansionism. Those human beings were killed not by monsters or aliens but by other human beings.</p><p>Civilians were also killed around the world because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed 430,000 civilians and created the hibakusha&#8212;the survivors and their children who were affected by the radioactive fallout. Also among the dead are the unknown numbers of people who died in Japanese forced labour camps in the far east. All those people are victims of what Studs Terkel, in his wonderfully sad book of witness statements, called &#8220;the good war&#8221;.</p><p>It is for those reasons that I believe that I have been privileged to attend Garnethill synagogue in Glasgow for a remembrance of Kristallnacht. It is also for those reasons that we need to keep alive the memory of Jane Haining, the Church of Scotland missionary who refused to abandon the 400 Jewish orphan girls who were in her care in Budapest, and who died with them in Auschwitz two months later.</p><p>We need the Holocaust survivors and the hibakusha to continue to speak to the children of today. We need the Holocaust Educational Trust&#8217;s lessons from Auschwitz project to impart first-hand knowledge to our young people.

As someone who lives in Glasgow, close to the uni, I can say that it is great to see so many different people coming together, and it helps to make Glasgow a great place to be. That is why I am not too surprised that the international student barometer found that 96 per cent of international students found Scotland is a good place to be. That is a testament to the friendly, outgoing nature of people in Glasgow and the warm welcome that they give people who visit the city, and it is something that we should be proud of. It is also a testament to the fantastic work that is done by the staff of the University of Glasgow&#8212;and indeed all our universities&#8212;to encourage and attract international students to Glasgow and to Scotland.</p><p>We must also give credit to the Scottish Government for the support that it gives universities to bring foreign students here. Its strategic investment fund is an excellent example of what a joined-up approach can deliver for Scotland. Through enhancing Scotland&#8217;s profile in key international markets, increasing college and university engagement in international education, supporting postgraduate employment of international students and improving the experience of such students while they are here, the fund aims to build on the excellent international reputation that our further and higher education sectors have built up, in order to make them even more successful.</p><p>The projects that the fund supports include a campaign to promote higher education in India and China, and the students without borders initiative of the National Union of Students, which aims to integrate international students and encourage outward mobility of Scottish students. To my mind, the students without borders initiative has been a great success. Much of the information that has been gathered on the issues that international students face has been included in the core work of the NUS, and staff and student officers have received training and advice on those issues.</p><p>Another key piece of work of the students without borders initiative was its response to the UK Border Agency&#8217;s immigration proposals. It gathered a large amount of evidence and case studies on the points-based immigration system in Scotland and the implications of the changes for international students and Scottish institutions. Unfortunately, as Sandra White pointed out, much of that hard work is under threat from the changes to student visas that are being implemented under the short-sighted and xenophobic approach of the Westminster Government, which is once again applying a knee-jerk reaction to pacify its baying back benchers.</p><p>As always with the UK Government, it is managing to act in an incompetent and ill-thought-out way. I hope that our minister will tell us the direction that the Scottish Government is taking in order to alleviate some of the problems. I, for one, do not want to be a part of that situation. I want international students to come to this country and bring the great range of benefits that they have shown they can bring; in return, Scotland has a great deal to offer them.</p><p>I would go so far as to say that, if Scotland is to continue to be regarded as one of the best places in the world in which to study, and if it is to have the freedom to promote itself internationally and grow successfully, it needs powers over immigration to ensure that we have access to fresh talent.

Although it is a long time since she was young, I know that she remains passionate about the issues facing our youngsters today. Too often, young people are demonised and seen as layabouts or as trouble, hanging about on street corners. They are seen as folk to be avoided or ignored, but is that the truth about what young folk are doing and what they are like, or is it just a bit too convenient to look at them in that way? If we ignore them, or pigeonhole them as trouble, perhaps we feel that we do not need to bother with the issues that they are facing or to listen to what they are saying. I contend that to do that is a big mistake, because it risks alienating young people and engendering fear of them among older people. That just cannot be right.</p><p>That is why I think that the truth about youth project is an excellent initiative; it is one that I fully support. I want to give members an idea of its success so far. The project has brought together more than 3,000 young people and 1,000 adults, which is no mean feat. It has also teamed up with The Sunday Mail to produce a truth about youth supplement featuring positive stories about young people, more than 200,000 copies of which have been distributed throughout Glasgow.</p><p>When I cast my mind back&#8212;not to when I was young; I am not a miracle worker&#8212;but to January 2009, I remember securing a members&#8217; business debate congratulating Knightswood youth theatre on, among other things, its work on bringing together young asylum seekers and refugees with young people from the local area to talk and share feelings. That helps them to realise that they are all the same, and to gain a better understanding of young people&#8217;s views and aspirations on a wide range of issues. I went to secondary school with the minister who replied to that debate, Linda Fabiani, although she was the janitor&#8212;[Laughter.] I used that joke because I thought that she was going to stay behind and listen to this debate but, unfortunately, she has gone. She said then that the</p><p>&#8220;efforts ... made by the young people involved and those who have taken the time to organise, teach and support the group&#8221;</p><p>are</p><p>&#8220;a great example of community spirit.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 28 January 2009; c 14469.]</p><p>That community spirit extends across Scotland. In my constituency of Glasgow Anniesland, there are a number of groups who are to be commended for the work that they do in bringing the community together and in tackling stereotypes, wherever they might be. G15 in Drumchapel, which Liz Smith mentioned, and the Dumbarton Road corridor youth project in particular have grown to become organisations that now encompass the aspirations of a great number of the residents, young and old, in Drumchapel, Yoker, Scotstoun and Whiteinch. Their ambitious plans for those areas are a credit to the dedication and passion of all those who are involved in the various projects being taken forward, particularly in peer education on the issues of drink and drugs. Young people listen to other young people first and foremost.</p><p>One of the main aspirations frequently voiced in those areas is the need for more employment, particularly for young people. As Sandra White mentioned, we debated that issue last week, and I hope that some of the initiatives that the Scottish Government has brought forward, such as the 25,000 modern apprenticeship places a year for the next five years, the opportunities for all programme and the announcement of a dedicated minister for youth employment, will help young people as they strive to realise their hopes and dreams. Although no one is denying that much needs to be done, I am confident that those initiatives and initiatives such as the truth about youth project will deliver for young people.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656792", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Truth About Youth Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sandra White on bringing this timely motion before the Parliament.

I have also been very impressed by the genuine concern across the parties in the chamber on the issue of carers. It is not just something that we debate every six months or year; it is something that members make an effort to promote as an issue of concern.</p><p>I have learned a great deal more about the range of people who are carers, because there are around 657,000 carers in Scotland and we all know at least one person, friend or relative who carries out this vital role&#8212;we may live next door to these people. However, how often do we take the time to think about the carers we know, who are part of a large, generally hidden army of decent, caring Scots who are obviously not in it for the money? Do we just, unthinkingly, say, &#8220;Ach, that is just your mother looking after your father between visits from the district nurse&#8221;?</p><p>Although it is that, it is an awful lot more than that as well. Carers range from the more than 100,000 children and young people who provide emotional, physical and practical support to a relative at the same time as coping with all the normal and everyday issues surrounding growing up that we have all had to manage; to the more than 250,000 people who balance necessary paid work&#8212;very necessary paid work in most cases&#8212;with being an unpaid carer for a loved one; and on to the pensioners caring for adult children and grannies caring for grandas. The role of carer falls mostly&#8212;although by no means exclusively&#8212;to women, which results in low incomes and limited career prospects for them.</p><p>Four weeks ago, we had the latest meeting of the cross-party group here in the Parliament. I am pleased to say that the minister was in attendance&#8212;it was the first time that a health minister had appeared as a guest at the cross-party group. The minister spoke about the Government programme and the carers and young carers strategy and answered a range of questions from a varied group of carers and carer organisations. He was roundly welcomed as he addressed the issues raised and listened seriously to those gathered there.</p><p>The 10,600 extra respite weeks and the commitment to a guarantee of 20 per cent from the change fund to support carers were very much welcomed by all in attendance at the group, as was the commitment to continue to consult carers organisations in the on-going development of the carers strategy.</p><p>However, let us remember that, at the moment, we in this Parliament can deliver only part of the solution. It is my belief that in this place we should stand together to campaign for an urgent review of carers allowance, which is the lowest of the earnings-related benefits as it is paid at less than jobseekers allowance. I was on jobseekers allowance a number of years back and I know that it was low enough. Anything lower than that is barely worth claiming, except that people have to claim it if they are stuck in the position of being a carer with no other opportunity for income.</p><p>If Westminster continues its intransigence over the situation, we will need to have the powers over benefits brought to the Scottish Parliament to enable us to make the decisions here, instead of constantly fighting a rearguard action against carer poverty in Scotland. In the meantime, however, we must ensure that the commitments made on delivery through local authorities are evaluated. I ask the minister to tell us in his summing-up how the Scottish Government can ensure that the third sector, in its attempts to deliver on the rights under the carers and young carers strategies, is not stymied by some of the councils in this country. The minister mentioned that in his opening speech; I would like him to do so again in his closing speech. I know that this is not in the minister&#8217;s gift, but I just thought that I would throw it in anyway: I would like penalties to be considered for councils that receive money that is intended for carers but redirect it to other council priorities, which is a real shame.</p><p>I am very pleased by the steps towards carer proofing change fund resources, which is very much to be welcomed.</p><p>It has been said before, but it bears saying again: who cares for the carers? Let it not be said that this Parliament fails to answer that question. Let us support the full implementation of the Scottish Government&#8217;s carers and young carers strategy.

Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s support was thoughtful, and Liam McArthur was sensible and thoughtful in speaking about his support. Patrick Harvie was quite right to say that it is not about excessive alcohol consumption alone; rather, it is about how we encourage responsible drinking. Drink will not disappear from our society, so we have to think about how to encourage responsible drinking.</p><p>Every year in Scotland, there are 1,500 alcohol-related preventable deaths. It has been said that liver cirrhosis rates in Europe have steadily declined since the 1980s, but they have soared in Scotland. Indeed, since 1995-96, alcohol-related hospitalisations have increased. I used to work in admissions in Glasgow&#8217;s Western infirmary accident and emergency department, and I witnessed the regular carnage of drink-related damage. I witnessed bodies staggering or being carried into the waiting areas and innocent bystanders attending who had suffered violence at the hands, feet and knives of drunks.</p><p>Since the 1980s, alcohol has become more affordable, and there has been a noticeable and recorded shift from pub drinking to even cheaper private drinking at home. The domestic abuse figures shamefully mirror that. Supermarkets have moved into the mass alcohol sales market and made it their own. The supermarket chains have often used alcohol as a loss-leader, and they have driven many of the specialist off-sales and licensed grocers out of business through selling crates of booze so cheap that even bottled water fails to compete with them. That is an outrage that is an even worse face of capitalism than Tiny Rowland&#8217;s.</p><p>Why should we not use the powers of this Parliament to try to address this scurrilous state of affairs? Many studies on the issue, from Sheffield to Canada, have referred to a formula that demonstrates that an increase in price equates to a decrease in alcohol consumption.</p><p>Whether it is by education, taxation or pricing policy, we should get together and ensure that Scotland has a better future with an alcohol culture that is not the shame of Europe.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651953", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I presume, of course, that the Labour Party will support the public health levy.

It was very kind of them.</p><p>It gives me great pleasure to bring to the chamber of the Scottish Parliament a debate on the 30th anniversary of the United Nations international day of peace. Today, President Barack Obama and many other heads of state will address the United Nations General Assembly. Among them will be Laura Chinchilla Miranda, which is not a name that we often hear in here. I met her once and she is a very nice person. She is the President of Costa Rica&#8212;the country that introduced the original resolution that created this day. At this point we should remember that practically the first four words of article 1 of the &#8220;Charter of the United Nations&#8221; are &#8220;To maintain international peace&#8221;. There can be no more dignified or pressing aim than that.</p><p>We join in peace today with countries as diverse as Argentina, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Uganda and the United States, and with organisations including Amnesty International, the Arab League and the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict, which is based in The Hague&#8212;all of which recognise, promote and celebrate peace day.</p><p>Thousands of organisations and millions of people across the world are united in calling for peace in a world in which so many suffer the terror, hardship and pain of warfare and the indiscriminate use of weapons of all kinds. We know that here in Scotland there are weapons stationed on the Clyde that have the capacity to bring about the destruction of communities, cities, countries, civilisations and, potentially, our whole planet. Trident nuclear missiles have been condemned as being immoral by church leaders and as illegal by the chief judges of the International Court of Justice. They have been called useless by senior military chiefs of staff&#8212;but guess what? They are deemed to be indispensable for our protection and safety by politicians at Westminster who have a taste for sitting at the top table.</p><p>The Trident system, whose upgrade and replacement are earmarked to last for another 50 to 60 years, is a drain on scarce resources at a time of severe recession. The system is also an environmental disaster waiting to happen: it has experienced more than 100 leaks and on-board fires in which radioactive material has been discharged into the waters around our coasts. What is more is that if Trident were ever fired in anger or through a systems error, it would prove to be an abomination on a monumental scale. Even in a full-scale war, the military sees nuclear weapons as an outrage, as we know from General Eisenhower, who said in his autobiography that when he was informed of the decision to use the bomb in 1945, he thought that</p><p>&#8220;it was an unnecessary and inexcusable move to destroy the lives of countless thousands of innocent women and children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki when Japan was on the brink of collapse and surrender.&#8221;</p><p>General Eisenhower said that the real reason for using the bomb was to send a message to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, the evil empire, had not fired its weapon, but America, the land of the free, had fired its weapon. We must remember that politicians on both sides are to blame for the fear in which we lived throughout the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s, and which continues today.</p><p>Why should we have weapons of mass murder stationed on our land? No plan exists to have nuclear capability in Scotland beyond successive Westminster Governments&#8217; insistence on maintaining such a presence here. When the Vanguard and Trafalgar nuclear-armed and powered submarines go, so too will the Astute vessels that are being insinuated into the Faslane site. At the moment, we can do nothing to remove those hulks and their warheads but protest against their presence in our midst. We must at all times be prepared to protest. However, only with political power can we ensure that they go lock, stock and barrel. In their place can be conventional defence forces but&#8212;most important&#8212;use can and will be made of the transferable engineering skills of the workforce that remains, as Scotland develops its unique resources to become the green powerhouse of Europe.</p><p>With the benefit of the planned subsea interconnector and the North Sea grid, which are passing through the European Commission, we can be the fulcrum of a secure and affordable source of energy for Europe into the 21st century and beyond. That requires the engineering skills of the workforce at Faslane, in conjunction with our world-class university research facilities and development operations, which can put us at the forefront of that exciting development. The transformation of Faslane and Coulport from military bases to peaceful developments that enable the production of clean energy would be fitting.</p><p>The achievement of peace is never truly a passive process. Even the non-violent civil disobedience movements of Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jnr required thought, organisation, logistics and&#8212;most important of all&#8212;the channelling of bravery in the right direction. None of that happens in a vacuum. As we know, it takes more bravery to be seen standing shoulder to shoulder with other nations and peoples around the world in the cause of peace than it does to hide behind massive military force or the threat of doomsday weapons&#8212;even those that must never be used, as the cost of using them would lead to the annihilation of life on earth.</p><p>In line with that stand against such weapons, I was honoured to attend the &#8220;Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&#8221; review conference 2010 at the United Nations in New York and to present to the conference&#8217;s president, Ambassador Libran Cabactulan, a signed statement on behalf of First Minister Alex Salmond in support of a nuclear weapons convention. The significance of an NWC is that it would achieve what the conventions on biological and chemical weapons did in declaring such weapons to be illegal under international humanitarian law.</p><p>Actions in themselves do not speak louder than words, but words without the intention to act are less than worthless.

I am pleased that the report has been produced. It was a long and complex inquiry and it has proven to be worth while.</p><p>Migration is a natural human trend. If it were not, we would all be living in a congested great rift valley in Africa. It is important that migration is not looked on as some sort of bogeyman, as much of the red-top populist press and outrageous media present it. Of course consideration must be given to available resources in every country, and there should be serious consideration of integration issues with local communities and migrants, but if the starting point is one of rabid negativity, the outlook for humanity and dignity is very poor, as is the outlook for the potential benefits that we in Scotland, as a host community, can accrue from migrants.</p><p>Some of the issues relate to matters that are presently reserved to Westminster. One of those, which is well documented in the report, is the failure to collect viable and accurate data on migration. Improved data would enable resources to be better focused for the benefit of agencies and migrant groups. However, the provision of some local services is within the remit of the Scottish Government and its delivery agencies, such as those in health, education and policing. An obvious concern about the services that are devolved to Scotland is that migrants frequently fail to register with a general practitioner and thereby fail to receive the full benefits of the national health service. Similarly, schooling and housing services are often less well used by migrant individuals and their families, as they do not have a support group or signposting to services.</p><p>I am glad, therefore, that the Scottish Government has committed additional funding in 2011 for the teaching of English to speakers of other languages and that, through COSLA, resources have been made available for the local authority toolkit and the development of the relocation advisory service. I attended the Glasgow evidence-taking session that has been mentioned a few times and came away with some cases. I found local authorities supportive in helping with those cases.</p><p>Trafficking is a disgusting 21st century slave trade. It is often hard to identify because of the violent criminal nature of the beast and its international tentacles but, given the cross-border co-operation between the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and Europol and the work of TARA here in Scotland, there are signs that we are probably heading in the right direction, even if we have not quite got there yet. As the report says, TARA must be strongly commended for its hard work in helping the victims of trafficking to come forward and speak about traffickers and at the same time to receive help in recovering from their various ordeals. I say &#8220;various&#8221; because trafficking is not always about sex slavery and forced prostitution; there are other forms of serfdom to be found&#8212;in factories, farms and even private households.</p><p>It would be extremely useful if the Gangmasters Licensing Authority could operate more successfully and more widely in Scotland&#8212;I think that it is not legally allowed to do that at the moment.</p><p>I congratulate the continuing members of the Equal Opportunities Committee on their hard work&#8212;without me&#8212;and on their dogged persistence in following through this important report.

The Parliament should use all the opportunities that are provided to scrutinise proposed European legislation to best effect. In particular, we must look positively on the treaty because it provides the committee with an active scrutiny role and possibilities to assess any possible breach of subsidiarity. My late friend and SNP colleague Professor Neil MacCormick, who has been mentioned by a number of members, was a strong supporter of the treaty and led the debate on its likely effects in Scotland. I believe that his role deserves recognition, because he put the Scottish stamp on the Lisbon treaty. The protocol on application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality provides an opportunity for the Scottish Parliament to take part in the scrutiny process for legislative proposals from the European Commission. That opportunity to address the democratic deficit that we have all heard of is, of course, to be welcomed, and the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council will add to the efficiency of the processes. I particularly welcome the introduction of the charter <place-holder colnum=\"31480\"/> of fundamental rights to European primary law. Protocol 30 clarifies the application of the EU charter of fundamental rights, which reconfirms existing rights. That is to be welcomed. I must also mention that the recognition of the possibility of a state&#8217;s withdrawal from the EU&#8212;I think that Ted Brocklebank will be fully in favour of that&#8212;is a sign of political maturity that has been sadly lacking in the past.</p><p>Turning to how we can make our influence felt, I am pleased that the Minister for Culture and External Affairs has provided summaries following each joint ministerial committee meeting and I look forward to the further discussions among the Administrations that are involved in the JMC process as they move towards greater openness in those discussions.

With more and more legislative influence from Brussels becoming evident each year, the Lisbon treaty gives us an opportunity to directly intervene in European legislative proposals up to the point of objecting to any proposals that do not conform with the principles of subsidiarity.

I also thank those who have come here to observe the debate, including my parliamentarians for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament colleague Rob van Riet, who has travelled up from London especially for that purpose.</p><p>Nuclear weapons-free zones are now in existence across the world, from single-state nuclear weapons-free zones such as New Zealand and Mongolia to whole continents such as the entirety of central and South America, and from nations such as South Africa, which once harboured nuclear programmes, to countries closer to home such as our western European neighbours, from whose lands America&#8217;s tactical nuclear weapons will soon be removed and whose citizenry aims to keep things that way. The great majority of countries around the world are looking to unburden themselves of the 20th century legacy of nuclear weapons, which has affected them either directly or has made them live in the shadow of those weapons of mass murder. Sadly, all of us know of the countries that are termed rogue states, such as Iran and North Korea, which occasionally embark on brinkmanship against the existing nuclear states that hold permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. That causes all of us concern. We are also aware of nations such as India, which has pretensions to a place at the top table, and its neighbour Pakistan, whose nuclear capability sits cheek by jowl with a Taliban insurgency in its northern marches. Then there are countries such<place-holder colnum=\"31430\"/> as the United Kingdom and France, which cling to the idea of a post-imperialist importance through the maintenance of costly and unsustainable nuclear programmes, under the guise of deterrence.</p><p>However, we in Scotland could follow the example of New Zealand, where a nuclear weapons-free movement took root in the 1960s and grew to be a national statement of intent when, in 1997, the New Zealand Government declared its nation to be a nuclear weapons-free zone. Like New Zealand, Scotland can and should campaign via a popular organic movement led by the civic population of our nation, for the establishment of a nuclear weapons-free zone Scotland.</p><p>That should be done by means of a straightforward non-Government education programme, through which the Scottish people can debate the issues around the pros and cons of the Trident and nuclear weapons issue. I believe that, home by home, classroom by classroom, workspace by workspace, our land will become a coherent series of nuclear weapons-free zones. In that way, Scotland can join the majority view of countries at the United Nations that have signed the non-proliferation treaty in good faith&#8212;and not as a smokescreen for ill intentions.</p><p>To that end, NWFZ Scotland has written to schools, colleges, universities, faith groups, trade unions and businesses. It has produced cards such as the one that I am holding now, which allow individuals and groups to make contact to obtain further informative and display materials.</p><p>Lest anyone doubt that we are pushing at an open door, let me quote a recent YouGov poll, in which 67 per cent of respondents said that the UK Government should not buy a replacement for Trident, but should instead secure conventional defences. Only 13 per cent supported Trident replacement. To say it might seem pointless&#8212;no, it does not, because fortunately, Jackson Carlaw has been good enough to stay in the chamber for the debate&#8212;but Tory voters are 56 per cent against replacement of Trident and only 28 per cent are for it.</p><p>The proposal for the NWFZ Scotland campaign grew from an event in the Parliament that I sponsored in October to celebrate the UN international day of peace. Senior figures in the disarmament movement spoke about nuclear weapons, about how we can free our country and about how we can stop those weapons spreading across the world. Among the guests was Marian Hobbs, former Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control in the New Zealand Government. I have with me a recently received message of support from her to NWFZ Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"31431\"/></p><p>&#8220;Dear Bill, I am so impressed to read your Parliamentary Motion advocating for Scotland to develop a network of nuclear weapons-free zones leading to NWFZ Scotland.</p><p>A nuclear weapon-free zone in Motherwell, in Pitlochry, in Kirkwall, in Ullapool, in Aberdeen has two effects.</p><p>The first is education. When the local authority proposes such a nuclear weapon-free zone ... there is a public debate within the community, and having that debate is very important. People become too used to the threat of nuclear war, it seems so remote&#8221;.</p><p>Once a nationwide grass-roots movement develops in small towns, suburbs, schools, churches or wherever, the nuclear weapons-free mentality becomes strong.

The secretary-general restated that positive advances such as a new strategic arms reduction treaty&#8212;START&#8212;and further advances at the 2010 non-proliferation of nuclear weapons review should be built on, so as to outlaw the nuclear weapons that curse our world. They should be eliminated, and the risks that they pose should be removed. They offer mankind nothing but a threat of no future whatsoever. I hope that the Parliament will lend its support to the aims of such a campaign as our contribution to the secretary-general&#8217;s vision, through which the people of Scotland can become fully informed on the issues around the nuclear weapons that are in their midst, and can decide on having a nuclear weapons free-zone Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21137589", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Weapons-free Zones"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members who are present who kindly signed my motion to allow this members&#8217; business debate to take place.

We all agree that, at times of economic difficulty, vulnerable sections of society are in even more danger than usual of being marginalised, as the mainstream population is more prone to pulling up the equality ladder behind itself. It is incumbent on all of us to keep at the front of our minds the fact that we have an inclusive nation in which everyone counts and in which everyone must be treated as equally as possible.</p><p>Mainstreaming equalities is important. Lewis Macdonald said that mainstreaming should sometimes be put to the side and we should take more positive action on behalf of some sections of society, but I would like everyone to be considered to be in the main stream in the not-too-distant future. Unfortunately, that is not the case at the moment.</p><p>Of the general population in Scotland, 80 per cent work. That is not enough in itself, but only 37 per cent of people with disabilities have work, despite years of worthy talk from politicians of all parties and all Governments. Everyone has paid lip service to the idea that citizens with disabilities should be treated in a more befitting manner; it has taken a wee while to deliver on that.</p><p>As other members have done, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the future of Scotland's supported employment workplaces and to discuss people with disabilities who are looking for employment outside such workplaces. Helen Eadie sometimes becomes slightly aerated about the issue, but I know that that is because of her commitment. The welcome disability report that was issued four years ago shows that she has a genuine case.</p><p>It is important to talk about the whole range of people with disabilities who are looking for employment and for access to ordinary employment. As the Equal Opportunities Committee's disability reporter, I am&#8212;obviously&#8212;interested in the issue.</p><p>It is a self-evident truth that paid employment offers the best route out of the poverty trap in which many people with disabilities find themselves. A variety of inclusive policies has been developed over the years with the aim of removing barriers to employment for those who are furthest from the labour market. The obstacles to employment for people with disabilities should&#8212;sadly&#8212;be familiar to us all. As I said, less than half the disabled people in Scotland are in <place-holder colnum=\"29414\"/> employment, in comparison with more than three quarters of the general population. It is our duty as a society to overcome that.</p><p>All too often, disabled people are held back by low expectations. Those are sometimes their own, because society has led them to think that they cannot contribute fully, and they are sometimes the low expectations of the rest of us, who believe that people with disabilities cannot contribute to the same degree as we can. Of course, that is nonsense, as everybody in the chamber knows. That mindset has never had a place in Scotland and certainly has no place today.</p><p>It is important to recognise that many supported employment workplaces have been successful. Members might not know that Blindcraft Glasgow, in the region that I come from, began as a workshop for visually impaired people and has expanded to employ workers with other disabilities. The workforce consists of 125 employees who are registered disabled. It is important that public bodies support such workplaces. It is unlike me to do so, but I congratulate Glasgow City Council on its support for Blindcraft Glasgow, which has provided an example that I wish that many other local authorities and public bodies would follow.</p><p>Outside the debate about supported workplaces, I very much welcome the minister's list of examples of good practice that the Scottish Government has initiated. I am pleased that Glasgow Housing Association has been a big winner in the programme and has provided 1,500 places for disabled people in recent years. I am also pleased that 10 per cent of the workforce in the construction phases for the 2014 Commonwealth games is guaranteed to be for disabled people. Those big-ticket issues point all public bodies in the direction of ensuring that people with disabilities are not at the bottom of the list for employment and are included in employment programmes.</p><p>As Mike Pringle said, for the foreseeable future supported workplaces will be specifically required to employ disabled people. The demand for positions in those workplaces exists, so we need a demand for their products.</p><p>It is of great importance that article 19 is promoted as widely as possible and that the first-class products of Scotland's supported workplaces are put at the top of procurement agendas. I will make a suggestion, even though I have been told that I may be flying a kite that will not go anywhere. One intervention by the Scottish Government might be to encourage Scottish Enterprise to deliver product diversification advice to supported workplaces, so that they may benefit in the same way as private industry does. Scottish Enterprise may be reluctant to involve itself in <place-holder colnum=\"29415\"/> social enterprise businesses, but it should be encouraged to do so, as it has the expertise to help supported workplaces to ensure that there is a market for their products.</p><p>As the world changes, product development is always important, but it is no more important than social responsibility. The progress that the minister and his colleagues have made through community benefit clauses shows the Scottish Government's commitment to supporting disability employment. However, the minister will agree that article 19 must be delivered to ensure that supported workplaces achieve the position in society that they deserve and that people with disabilities are seen as full and equal partners in society.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006667", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supported Employment Workplaces"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Lewis Macdonald for bringing this important debate to the chamber.

We need to have mixed tenure housing developed and built and we need to ensure that there is a future for people to have proper, decent rented accommodation if that is what they choose or what they can afford.

That is the way forward these days. The GHA had 70,000 to 80,000 properties. It is not viable for such an organisation to be set up and to last forever when it was supposed to bring homes closer to communities. It is therefore important that the second-stage transfer is carried through. Des McNulty mentioned that he was greatly involved in that. That is recognised, but it was extremely important that it came to fruition, and that took place under the present Government, with the minister who is sitting in front of us today.

I would like to mention the role of the Scottish Government and, indeed, the Scottish Parliament in the delivery of services to a large and vital group in our society: the <place-holder colnum=\"28449\"/> 600,000 or so carers in Scotland. \"Caring Together\"&#8212;the carers strategy that was announced this summer by the Minister for Public Health and Sport, Shona Robison&#8212;is a welcome &#163;5 million commitment from the Government for a 10-point carers strategy supporting a new deal for the voluntary sector in supporting respite for carers of all ages.</p><p>In conjunction with COSLA, health boards, NGOs and third sector organisations, the Scottish Government has, in the face of what is expected to be a drastic reduction in public spending, committed to helping to support carers through increasingly difficult times. The strategy, which has been developed with carers, will make a valuable contribution not only to their everyday lives but to the lives of cared-for people across Scotland. That is vital, given that successive Westminster Governments have maintained the carer's allowance at the lowest possible level. In fact, at just &#163;53.90 a week&#8212;up a paltry 80p since last year&#8212;it is the lowest of all state benefits. The previous Labour Government and the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government have maintained the allowance at that level, but I believe that whatever Government we had in an independent Scotland would ensure that carers were better treated and not left to survive on such a ridiculously small amount of money.</p><p>As a result, I was delighted to hear the cabinet secretary's statement this morning that equality will be one of the checks and balances that the Scottish Government will ensure that departments use in compiling their budgets. Although every element of Government will look to ensure continued delivery of services, it is essential that those at the bottom of the economic heap who are always the most vulnerable at times of economic stringency are protected from getting into even worse financial straits.</p><p>I know&#8212;as anyone who has been in the chamber today knows&#8212;that there will be differences of opinion over how the forthcoming Scottish budget should be divvied up, and that there will be competing claims on the smaller cake that will be available. There will be plenty of yah-boo politicking, but that is only to be expected both in this place and in that other place down the road.

My inspiration for lodging the motion that has brought us here this evening is a young woman who is sitting in the public gallery, Julie McElroy. Julie was born with cerebral palsy and with deafness in both ears, but has worked tirelessly to prove that the human spirit can overcome any physical obstacles&#8212;and she does so with a healthy dose of good humour.</p><p>As I said, it was Julie who caused me to think more about deafness and living with a disability that everyone knows about but, unless they are directly affected by it, does not really seem to give a second thought to. It is therefore important that the theme of deaf awareness week this year is \"look at me\", which of course has at its base a number of connotations. Overall, it is about the need to improve understanding of deafness by highlighting the range of communication methods that are used by deaf people and their families. That is obviously of real importance when children are involved, in order to maximise their life opportunities through the development of language skills, with sign language, lip-reading and speech development.</p><p>Hearing aids are also of great significance, of course, and Julie has benefited tremendously through her practitioner at the Hearing Company, as have countless thousands of others through high street practitioners and national health service audiology departments. Hearing aid dispensers have recently transferred to the register of the Health Professions Council, which <place-holder colnum=\"27793\"/> assures professionalism on the part of high street practitioners. It has been suggested that we should have the voucher system that is in use in Ireland and other European countries, which is similar to the system that opticians use, so that hearing impaired people can have a wider range of services for the basic provision of hearing aids than they have at present. Might the minister look at that proposal? I will forward him some details, if he likes.</p><p>On the general situation with deafness, 90 per cent of deaf children are born to hearing parents who have little or no prior experience or knowledge of deafness and will require support from medical professionals and charitable organisations such as the National Deaf Children's Society in Scotland. The NDCS estimates that there are around 3,500 deaf children in Scotland, and many more who will experience temporary deafness at pre-school or primary age caused by what is known as glue ear. The NDCS also reports that the majority of deaf children are educated in mainstream schools, where they require additional educational support, which we have discussed in the Parliament. Further, there are older people who become deaf through physical deterioration of the ear, diseases of the inner ear or exposure to regular and continued loud noise. My father suffered hearing loss through his job working in a foundry, and his was certainly not an isolated example. Generations of older people who worked in heavy industry still carry that burden, having lost their hearing while contributing to society.</p><p>Deafness is all around us, but many of us choose not to notice it until we come face to face with it&#8212;a good phrase to use in relation to lip-reading. That is something from which many of us could benefit but, as my colleague Christine Grahame has said to me, it is possibly not something to teach politicians, as they might misuse it. It is, however, important in general.</p><p>Julie is a great example of someone who refuses to be fazed by her deafness and whose communication skills are second to none. As long as people are willing to see beyond the disability, Julie is perfectly capable, as are most people with hearing impairments. As with her cerebral palsy, Julie does not let her deafness get in her way. A couple of years ago, she took part in \"Beyond Boundaries\" on the BBC, in which a group of 10 young people crossed the Andes and travelled through dense tropical jungle, showing that, with the right motivation and support, they are as capable as anyone else in society. She has just achieved a first-class honours degree from the University of the West of Scotland and is launching herself&#8212;if that is the right word&#8212;on the catwalk as a model for young people with disabilities who have an interest in fashion.<place-holder colnum=\"27794\"/></p><p>Julie McElroy is a young woman of whom not only her family but all of Scotland can be proud.

In the work-related activity group, which is almost self-explanatory, the amount is &#163;91.40. If someone is deemed to be fit for work by Atos Healthcare, the company that is hired to make the assessments on behalf of the DWP, they are transferred on to jobseekers allowance.</p><p>As Hugh O'Donnell mentioned, there is widespread concern from, among others, Citizens Advice Scotland, Macmillan Cancer Support and the Scottish Association for Mental Health about the high number of people&#8212;almost 70 per cent&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"26787\"/> who are being refused outright any entitlement to ESA.</p><p>Benefits are for people who require support in order to meet the costs of everyday life when they are unable to do so from any other source of income. When people are disabled or ill to the point that they cannot work to support themselves, it is a duty that is incumbent on society to provide such benefits as will alleviate pressing financial need.</p><p>It is unacceptable in a civilised society to pressure people off benefits and towards work for which they are unfit, purely in order to cut the number of benefits recipients. However, that is what the Department for Work and Pensions is doing, in conjunction with its partner business, Atos Healthcare.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland has highlighted the 68 per cent of claimants who have been rejected for the employment and support allowance. It points out that two fifths of its ESA case load is made up purely of those rejections. Macmillan Cancer Support points to the cancer sufferers&#8212;including terminally ill patients&#8212;who have been told that they are fit for work.</p><p>SAMH points out that Atos has made recommendations of fitness for work for people with serious mental health problems without giving consideration to reports from their general practitioners, community psychiatric nurses or psychiatrists. We have heard of one case in which a man with serious mental health problems was passed as being fit for work by Atos, without any reference to his GP. He then took an overdose of pills, as his evidence had been denied and his benefits removed. That is not by any means an isolated incident, but it is utterly intolerable.</p><p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> today described all those who were rejected for ESA as \"scroungers\". That is front-page news for the <em>Daily Mail</em>. It contained no analysis of the evidence, which is nothing new for that newspaper.</p><p>The ESA system was launched through Westminster by Labour. Today Iain Duncan Smith announced on BBC breakfast news that the new Conservative-Lib Dem coalition intends to press ahead with reassessing everyone who is on incapacity benefit, under the new ESA rules. We all agree that those who can work must be encouraged to do so. However, when people are genuinely unable to work through ill health or disability, we must ensure that support is available. It is the duty of the Westminster Administration to address the distressing inadequacies of the present ESA assessments and to ensure that the watchwords in applying the benefit procedures are consistency, accuracy and fairness.

Offences against workers are usually opportunist and are always cowardly.</p><p>Cultural change is required in Scotland. It has been mentioned that the numbers of such offences in Scotland are different from the numbers for the rest of the UK. There are several reasons for that, which are not hidden. A major reason is alcohol, to which I will return later. Some in our society seem to believe that those who serve the public are somehow fair game as targets for aggression. Initiatives such as medics against violence and the safer streets programme are important. I believe that they are helping to educate our population away from shameful behaviour towards public sector workers and people in private sector jobs who deal with the public.</p><p>I have worked in face-to-face public service roles in hospitals, shops and bars, and in Buchanan Street bus station, so I have experienced the problem in a range of settings. I have, unfortunately, often seen at first hand how a small number of maladjusted individuals behave towards people who are simply doing a job and trying to help the general public. I have observed verbal and physical abuse, bullying and the attempted intimidation of shop and transport workers, hospital and administrative staff and emergency workers. Having worked in administration in the accident and emergency department in the Western infirmary, I know that pain, discomfort and even fear can lead some people to act irrationally&#8212;and even abusively&#8212;on occasions.</p><p>However, as I witnessed, such behaviour is often associated with the consumption of too much alcohol. Drink is never an excuse for violent behaviour, but sadly it can be a reason for it. That includes situations in which infantile group bravado leads to confrontation with people whom those youths seem to think have some kind of authority over them and therefore must be <place-holder colnum=\"26405\"/> challenged. The ease of availability of alcohol to young and inexperienced people must be examined. That includes pricing and sales point practices. However, it most certainly is not only youngsters who are violent in drink. There should be full sanctions on anyone of any age who is violent, including to shopkeepers who refuse to sell them drink when their behaviour or age is inappropriate.</p><p>On Sunday I was walking down Byres Road, and I saw a woman, who was no younger than 30, trying to put in the window of a cafe because she had been refused alcohol. It was about 5 o'clock in the evening, and a crowd had gathered. The woman seemed to get a great deal of comfort from the idea that she was being taken seriously. She made four or five attempts to break the window with chairs and was eventually restrained. People were afraid of restraining her, including the cafe staff, who were trying their best to get her away from their place.</p><p>Alcohol was involved in that case, but it is not an excuse. The person's behaviour had very little to do with the fact that she had had a wee bit to drink. She thought that she had a right to be served again by the cafe staff, and since they had done their duty in refusing her, they were at risk of violence. That is the type of thing that Hugh Henry's proposed bill would address. We must all stand alongside him in saying that such behaviour is totally unacceptable.</p><p>I welcome the debate, and I share with the representative trade unions the desire to add whatever protection might be possible&#8212;on top of what already exists&#8212;for shop workers and others who deal face to face with the public to that which already exists for all of us under the common law.</p><p>The previous Administration should have considered the issue when the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 was introduced. Members in all parties should regret that it was not considered, because there have been seven years of wasted opportunities to protect workers.</p><p>Although violent crime levels have fallen year on year due to increased police numbers, which we should welcome, a number of individuals&#8212;mostly drunken, but not always&#8212;still think that it is okay to carry out assaults on shop workers and others who provide face-to-face service to the public. That must be addressed so that those workers can feel that we in the Parliament are fully taking into account their concerns and safety.</p><p>I ask the Scottish Government to consider carefully the proposals in Hugh Henry's proposed bill, and to consider where it can improve the current legal framework on the safety and assurance of those who serve the general public <place-holder colnum=\"26406\"/> face to face, in whichever working environment they operate.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20808795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protection for Workers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like all members, I welcome the fact that Hugh Henry has brought the issue of the protection of workers back to the chamber.

It says a great deal about the presence of mind of those who established the museum in 1994, and I congratulate them, the Scottish Football Association Museum Trust and people such as Robert Craig and Ged O'Brien. It is important to remember that Scotland has been at the forefront of developments in football throughout the history of the modern game, from the first football club&#8212;Edinburgh&#8212;in 1824, to the invention of the passing game and the innovation of the pitch and goalpost removal service in 1967.

Not exactly. As is the case for tourism in the rest of Scotland, Glasgow is having to fight its corner in the face of competition from other holiday venues across Europe. It is important in the modern tourism climate that VisitScotland ensures that city breaks are promoted equally with the longer, more traditional holiday patterns of coach and golfing tours. That would help to boost the numbers of people visiting the great range of museums and galleries that Glasgow boasts. Further to that, I have had discussions with the National Galleries of Scotland about the possibility of establishing a permanent exhibition in Glasgow that links with those in Edinburgh, thereby providing a twin-city visiting experience that would benefit both cities.</p><p>Let us remember that in common with the rest of Scotland, Glasgow suffered many years of financially necessary emigration to, among other places, England, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and the USA, so many thousands of ex-Glaswegians and their descendants from those countries would happily come back to visit grannie's Hielan hame in Partick and Govan before touring B and Bs in the more traditional tourist areas. We need to target that market as heavily as every other.</p><p>Glasgow, as a large city, still has many problems that need to be addressed, and resources require to be invested to overturn generations of shameful deprivation. The same can be said of New York. The I love New York campaign helped to turn that city into an attractive city break destination, despite the continuing problems in Brooklyn and the Bronx. Glasgow can do the same.</p><p>I know that the Scottish Government aims to ensure that all agencies, local government and businesses large and small work together to enhance and enlarge the tourism industry in Scotland.

In the main, the crimes that women commit and the social circumstances that lead to their offending are different from those of their male counterparts.</p><p>The committee visited Cornton Vale women's prison, as has been mentioned. We also visited Hydebank Wood prison in Northern Ireland and the 218 centre in Glasgow, which was an eye-opener for all of us. We took a considerable number of statements from witnesses at oral evidence sessions and received 15 written submissions. Great interest was shown in the inquiry, the contributions to which have produced <place-holder colnum=\"23841\"/> a report that is worthy of Government consideration.</p><p>The report is a substantial piece of work. I add my thanks to those from the convener to all those who contributed to it, particularly as it has added greatly to my knowledge of the circumstances that have led to the issues and concerns that a number of my constituents bring to my surgeries.</p><p>The committee reached the view that preventing reoffending through fully addressing female offenders' needs and individual circumstances is of major importance while they are in the prison system&#8212;or the justice system, as not all women offenders go to prison. As almost all members have said, many of the women have suffered abuse or some kind of neglect from an early age. They have carried into their adult lives the attitudes that those pressures created. That has shaped their relationships with others, with society and with authority figures.</p><p>Of course, as Angela Constance said, poverty contributes to the often chaotic lifestyles that have meant that offenders have been sent to prison or sentenced to carry out other court disposals. The same, sadly, is true of mental illness, which is present to some degree in a significant proportion of inmates at Cornton Vale. Mental illness can be exacerbated by drug abuse, which is also a factor in the theft or prostitution that results in many women being jailed.</p><p>All those issues must be addressed when prevention of reoffending programmes are being assessed. The women may appear to have arrived at the same place through the same circumstances, but their circumstances are all different. We have to remember that prevention of reoffending programmes must be tailored to each individual case.</p><p>Some women may be helped by programmes that raise literacy levels, which can then be enhanced by further education programmes. In many cases, that is very important, given that, because of their family circumstances, many women offenders had a poor attendance record or poor disciplinary record at school. Other women need some form of training to enable them to find work and to understand that employment is a way out of the despondency of the cycle of reoffending and repeat sentencing by the courts, leading to depression and drug and alcohol abuse.</p><p>Although it is important to remember that prison and other forms of court disposal are to some extent meant as a punishment for wrongdoing, it is vital to remember that rehabilitation is of considerable importance, too. No member in the Parliament is in the business of locking them up and throwing away the key; nor do we believe that <place-holder colnum=\"23842\"/> the out of sight, out of mind approach is acceptable.</p><p>Along with my colleagues on the Equal Opportunities Committee, I know that good work is being done for women in our justice system. However, as our report suggests, there are still issues to be addressed and improvements to be made. I mentioned earlier one such issue: the sending to jail of women with mental health problems. In many cases, prison exacerbates their mental ill health and achieves nothing.</p><p>It is equally important to remember that there are many mothers among the female offender population in the Scottish justice system. Their children are often the innocent bystanders, caught up in the system of crime and punishment. Every possible means must be looked at to ensure that they suffer as little upset in their upbringing as possible, if for no reason other than the fact that a disturbed upbringing is often the cause of their mother having committed the crime in the first place. If we can avoid that vicious circle, so much the better&#8212;[<em>Interruption.</em>] Hugh O'Donnell looks as if he is swatting a fly; I am not sure what he is doing.</p><p>Avoiding a jail sentence whenever possible and whenever appropriate by ordering women to a place such as the 218 centre is more beneficial to their continuing family life than prison is. I was happy to hear the cabinet secretary report on the developments that are to take place in Inverness and Aberdeen. I am not certain that they will be exactly the same as the 218 centre, but if they serve the same purpose, they will be extremely useful.</p><p>If it is judged that prison is necessary, Hydebank Wood's family visiting centre, which we saw on our visit, is an ideal model for us to follow. Cornton Vale is developing a similar facility. I ask the Scottish Prison Service to consider the Northern Ireland experience as a model that it might wish to follow.</p><p>It is a privilege to have taken part in this debate on the Equal Opportunities Committee's report.

The proposals might be contained in a green paper, but the fact is that green papers have a habit of developing into white papers and becoming law. It is important that we ensure that, since we were not asked previously, we in Scotland have the opportunity to put our point of view on the issue.</p><p>Having lobbied on the issue at every opportunity since the changes were mooted last July, I must say that I am saddened that the media in Scotland have, in general, been painfully slow to make our public aware of the situation. I see that no member of the media has bothered to turn up to observe today's debate from the press gallery.<place-holder colnum=\"22823\"/></p><p>I am upset about that lack of media coverage because, although the proposed major change to what is an important benefit was consulted on the length and breadth of England, not one Scottish pensioner, disabled person or organisation was consulted.

In other words, the benefit will be scrapped.</p><p>It is inconvenient that attendance allowance is a UK-wide benefit, because it means that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have care systems that are different from the one in England, will all be affected as well. The number of people who will be affected is quite staggering. As the minister said, according to the Institute for Social and Economic Research, more than 67,000 of the 168,000 recipients of attendance allowance in Scotland would fall below the poverty line if they did not receive that allowance.</p><p>We are told that attendance allowance will not be removed but will simply be delivered in a different way.

There, the flame of peace, which was lit at Hiroshima, the site of the explosion of the first atomic bomb, will be held aloft as the sun rises on a new year of hope for the world. The relevance of 2 October, the start date, is that it is the anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi and the international day of non-violence; the relevance of New Zealand, the start point, is that it allows no foreign military bases on its soil and no nuclear weapons to be stationed there.</p><p>Among the signatories who have supported the world march are United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former Ireland President Mary Robinson, former United States President Jimmy Carter, the Dalai Lama and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond.</p><p>I was delighted that, after visiting 40 countries in 50 days on the way to visiting 100 countries in total, the core team of the world march accepted, at very short notice, my invitation to come to Scotland. On 20 November this year, Alexander Mora Mora, a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica and the envoy for human rights in Latin America, flew into Edinburgh for a two-hour visit, with the flame of peace, on his way from Spain back home to central America.<place-holder colnum=\"22173\"/></p><p>Prior to coming here, Mr Mora Mora had met Mikhail Gorbachev, Lech Wa&#322;&#281;sa and Pope Benedict, but he emphasised, through his interpreter, that it was a matter of major importance that the march and the flame of peace should come to Scotland because this Parliament had made clear its commitment to work to remove nuclear weapons from our land.</p><p>Mr Mora Mora also told us that the world march for peace had not received an invitation to visit Westminster, and that Scotland was therefore the only place in the United Kingdom to accept the message that he carried. I express sorrow on behalf of many of our parliamentary colleagues at Westminster, of all parties, who had hoped to welcome the world march delegation as they carried the flame of peace, but who had their hopes dashed. Although it was lobbied for, no invitation was issued from Westminster. The world march for peace has visited Parliaments across the world and many thousands of people have joined it, from Sydney to Los Angeles, from Rabat to St Petersburg; it is shameful that it has been ignored by the UK media. It has been wilfully ignored by the press probably because of the Westminster Government's failure to issue an invitation to the delegation. That is very parochial of the UK media.</p><p>Just two days before they came to the Scottish Parliament, the same core team of the world march for peace were received in Berlin by the 10<sup>th</sup> world summit of Nobel peace prize laureates, with the words:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For the first time in history an event of this magnitude has been put in motion by the participants themselves. The true strength of this impulse is born in the simple act of one who, out of conscience, joins a dignified cause and shares it with others.\"</p><p>Three days before, the team had been received at the Vatican by the Pope with the blessing:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"May God bless you all.\"</p><p>It is incumbent on all of us here to celebrate the human spirit that has carried the flame of peace, which was lit at Hiroshima, around the world as a symbol of hope and of the belief that there is a better way than war and violence to settle disputes.</p><p>The aims of the world march for peace and non-violence have been stated as nuclear disarmament at a global level; the immediate withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories; the progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons; the signing of non-aggression treaties between countries; and the renunciation by Governments of the use of war as a means to resolve conflicts.</p><p>Some people might believe that those aims are just pie in the sky or wishful thinking, but the <place-holder colnum=\"22174\"/> impact that the world march for peace has had on so many Parliaments and populations around the world suggests that we might be pushing at an open door, even though there will still assuredly be those with vested interests and closed minds.</p><p>Scotland might be a small country in square miles, but we carry a big responsibility, as has been demonstrated by the determination of the world march for peace to ensure that this place was one of the stops that it made on its historic journey. Let us not allow the message to falter here. The flame of peace should burn strongly in this place.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20449567", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World March for Peace and Non-violence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased and honoured, on human rights day, to open this members' business debate on the world march for peace and non-violence, which started in Aotearoa&#8212;New Zealand&#8212;on 2 October this year and will arrive at its finish in the high Andes on 2 January 2010.

Unfortunately, neither do some of the owners of those establishments, until they are challenged on the issue, which Mark Cooper is doing. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, there are duties of liability on service providers who offer goods, facilities or services to the public, whether they are free or paid for.</p><p>An example that has been quoted is of the bar manager refusing to serve a deaf man because he thinks the man is drunk. The man explains his deafness and his hearing aids are clearly visible, but he is nonetheless refused and is shown out of the pub by the bouncer. Under the DDA, the owner of the bar is liable to be charged with discrimination. Furthermore, if the man's hearing friend remonstrates on his behalf and finds herself barred for doing so, she also has a claim for damages from the licensee.</p><p>However, as Mark Cooper has said, there are other ways of achieving justice than going through the courts, even if they can be challenging. I heartily congratulate Mark on his initiative and determination in finding the right people to approach and going ahead with his campaign in a logical and reasoned manner. I know that he has the strong support of Capability Scotland, this nation's largest disability rights organisation, and I know that he will also have the support of all in the Parliament, across all parties, as a result of his tireless campaigning for the publication of a good pub guide that includes information about establishments that are wheelchair-friendly and have disabled access and disabled toilet facilities.</p><p>To that end&#8212;and although I come from Glasgow&#8212;I congratulate the City of Edinburgh Council on agreeing with Mark's campaign and including on its licensing portal a list of accessible pubs and clubs. I am sure that we will all, in any way we can, support Mark's efforts to persuade other local authorities to follow Edinburgh's encouraging lead.</p><p>Disability discrimination is a blot on Scotland's landscape, and it needs to be tackled wherever it is encountered. All local authorities should follow Edinburgh's lead by writing to their licensees, reminding them of their obligations under the DDA, and ensuring that they are followed.</p><p>I have only water in my glass, but here's to Mark Cooper and Capability Scotland for working to make Scotland a more civilised place in which to live.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20432825", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Licensed Premises (Access for Disabled People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank George Foulkes for having secured tonight's debate, and   for speaking so well on a serious issue that affects a significant proportion of our fellow citizens across Scotland.

As has been said, there is cross-party consensus on that.</p><p>If a child is locked up for a potentially indefinite period without automatic oversight by the courts and without any crime having been committed, a wrong is done to that child and, by extension, to all children and to society as a whole. As Sandra White and Linda Fabiani said, the detention period in Dungavel has been limited to 72 hours. That is bad enough, but that period is in most cases a precursor to transfer to Yarl's Wood or another detention centre. It is known that that approach is used to cause maximum disruption to claimants' maintenance of full legal representation.</p><p>All members will know that stress is one of the greatest medical complaints of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. If members think that they have known stress, they should think about what I am about to say and consider what they would think if the children involved were theirs. What would be the impact on them of a dawn raid at home followed by transportation in a van by people they did not know, while their parents and siblings were terrified by the prospect of an imminent return to a war zone or into the hands of an oppressive <place-holder colnum=\"21778\"/> regime? That is stress. It should be remembered that the impersonal approach allows all that to take place; the people are not known and it is not known where they came from or what they are going back to. There are attempts to keep it that way because if the people involved are not known they are unlikely to be empathised with.</p><p>Earlier this year, I secured a members' business debate to congratulate the youngsters of Knightswood Youth Theatre on their well-deserved winning of a Philip Lawrence award, which they won exactly a year ago today. Knightswood Youth Theatre brings together young asylum seekers, refugees and local Glasgow children. Through hard work and just by being together, those people learn that they have many more things in common than things that separate them. They are fine young people with intelligence, determination, good manners and a lively sense of humour. Given a chance, those young asylum seekers and refugees will grow up to contribute greatly to their adopted homeland of Scotland. That they or others like them should be subjected to arbitrary detention in a prison setting is unconscionable.</p><p>I whole-heartedly support the Parliament's work in promoting the welfare of children in Scotland and in the rest of the United Kingdom through increased engagement with the UK Border Agency to consider how it deals with children. I also whole-heartedly support our continuing commitment in the Parliament to alternatives to detention, which will see an end to children being locked up at Dungavel.

Sadly, we must recognise that there are people in our society who will abuse anyone who they deem to be different or who they view as an easy target.</p><p>With an estimated 800,000 disabled people in Scotland, and approximately 500,000 LGBT citizens, it is our duty to provide in law safe and strong communities where no one faces the fear of crime or intolerance born from the cowardice or ignorance of others. Discrimination on the ground of disability was legislated against only with the passing of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, 20 years after the outlawing of racial and gender discrimination. That gap was a serious lapse in equalities legislation, which we should have learned from. It is time for us to bring aggravations by prejudice against disability or sexual orientation or status fully into line.</p><p>The 2004 research by the Disability Rights Commission and Capability Scotland found that 47 per cent of disabled people in Scotland reported experiencing hate crime. A third had to avoid certain places, and a quarter had moved home as a result of an attack. Disabled people are four times more likely to be violently assaulted than non-disabled people. Visually impaired people are four times more likely to be assaulted or attacked than their sighted neighbours. People with mental health issues are 11 times more likely to be victimised, and 90 per cent of adults with a learning disability report being bullied.</p><p>All of that says more about the perpetrator than about the abused. Let us put the abuser and the bully in full sight of the public gaze, name their crime and have it taken into account when sentencing is carried out so that, as Patrick Harvie said, the sentence will be appropriate.</p><p>Most, if not all of us will have had constituents come to us with cases of discrimination due to disability. In the worst cases, that will include fears for their physical safety.<place-holder colnum=\"18108\"/></p><p>After today's vote, I will be proud to say that we in the Scottish Parliament, the Parliament for all the people of Scotland, are specifically targeting those people who carry out disgusting antisocial behaviour towards people simply because of their disability or sexual orientation.

Sadly, the present recession brings them closer to their neighbours, although only by degrees and then for all the wrong reasons. The benefits system is a mess. At present, the Parliament cannot address that directly, but the issue must be considered. Many more families, through no fault of their own, are finding themselves in the worrying situation of unemployment, debt and living on benefits that do not meet their outgoings.</p><p>That is why I am glad that John Park's motion is, in essence, positive in its presentation and that it gives the Scottish Government the opportunity to look for a like-minded approach from Opposition members. The Government, by bringing forward capital investment in the housing sector, will help with the training of the 1,000 modern apprentices in Glasgow over the next three years, which is backed by &#163;6 million of Government money.

A growing number of our citizens are suffering from unemployment or are worried for themselves and their children in the job market in the short and long term. I have been there more than once, so I know the humiliation, and the fear that the longer someone is without a job, the less likely an employer is to take them on. We must therefore keep our eye on the ball in the Parliament and consider ideas from elsewhere, such as the ProAct initiative in Wales. However, we must ensure that such an initiative would work here, or we risk wasting the limited resources that are at our command. We will also have to work alongside Westminster, as long as it will let us, and only while it still holds the purse strings.</p><p>We should remember the need for Scottish solutions to Scottish problems. One size does not fit all, so with any joint economic programmes to boost employment, or in launching any initiative, we must ensure that it fits with the requirements in the Scottish jobs market and with the funding that is available to us under the present economic constraints. Investment in renewables is an ideal medium for a longer-term solution for Scotland. It will help us to ride out future recessions, while helping to save our planet's environment and all our futures. After only six years in business, the renewables company SgurrEnergy in Glasgow is growing internationally&#8212;it recently opened an office in Beijing. Welcon in Machrihanish, which Jim Mather knows well, is creating long-term construction jobs in the hundreds.

Players travel to it from throughout Scotland because of the first-class coaching at the club. As Bill Butler said, that has been due in great part to the dedication, hard work and passion for the sport of Terry McLernon. He has worked since the 1980s to ensure the development of table tennis as a core activity in Drumchapel. People like Terry have driven sport throughout the country over the years&#8212;often without the level of support that their dedication has deserved. I believe that we all want that situation to be addressed sooner rather than later.</p><p>The legacy of Glasgow's 2014 Commonwealth games will come into its own in combining established coaching, such as Terry McLernon provides, with a robust infrastructure for sport at the local level. That can be achieved by developing a network of community sports hubs throughout Scotland, as has been proposed, which will bring sport in Scotland fully into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Drumchapel table tennis club is an example that should be followed.</p><p>We cannot and do not all aspire to be Commonwealth games champions. However, at whatever age and at whatever ability level, Drumchapel table tennis club has shown that the taking part is what it is really all about. If someone happens to become a champion due to their inherent skill and the sheer hard work that that takes, they will also be a role model for others in their community. That in itself is a reward worth seeking.</p><p>I recently visited the sports centre at Scotstoun, which is near my home, and was impressed by the on-going developments that are taking place there with a view to the Commonwealth games in 2014. I was even more impressed by the friendly and hard-working staff and by the high level of usage by fellow Glaswegians. I do not use the centre as yet, but I intend to. Many of those people have been greatly encouraged by champions from local clubs such as Drumchapel table tennis club.</p><p>The Commonwealth games will come and go, as such events do, but their legacy should be facilities that ensure that Scotland loses the sick-man-of-Europe tag as a result of our citizens, young and old, taking regular exercise.

This morning I had the pleasure of attending Carers Scotland's annual general meeting. I apologise to Cathy Peattie for the fact that she will have to listen again to pretty much the same speech, but I do not think that the issues that it raises have changed in the past couple of hours.</p><p>We all know that carers are the Cinderellas of the benefits system. That is not an irony, because the great majority of carers are women. In our society, the culture is to assume that it is natural for women to look after the family, so people ask why they should expect to be paid for doing so. That is the attitude that men have had down the years and, of course, most politicians are men. Hopefully, things may change.</p><p>I find it appalling that in this day and age carers are treated so shabbily that carers allowance is lower than any other benefit. I will concentrate on that issue, as members should be able to agree that bread-and-butter issues concern all of us.</p><p>The Westminster Government claims that reform of carers allowance is complicated and that it will get around to the issue in due course. That is fair enough, but due course has lasted a long time&#8212;carers are not looking for one review after another. All of us in the chamber, as well as members at Westminster, need to be aware that the issue of carers allowance is again in danger of being kicked into the long grass. The UK Government should implement the long-awaited review of <place-holder colnum=\"15130\"/> carers benefits now, in recognition of the essential role that carers play in our society.</p><p>In a recent motion that I lodged in the Scottish Parliament, I emphasised the inequity of carers allowances compared with other state benefits. I will not go through a huge list, but the state pension is &#163;90.70 a week; incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance is &#163;84.50; statutory sick pay is &#163;75.40; jobseekers allowance is &#163;60.50; and, at the bottom of the heap by a long way, carers allowance is &#163;50.50.</p><p>Unpaid carers make a huge contribution to society as a whole, in respect of both wellbeing and public finance. As Mr O'Donnell said, they make a massive contribution to our society by taking on jobs for very little pay because they care; they care about the person whom they are looking after and, in my view, we take a loan of them. In the name of social justice, there should be an urgent and substantial increase in carers allowance to support more fittingly those who unselfishly sacrifice time, energy and often their own health to look after others. As a first step, carers allowance could be brought in line with the state pension, low though it is&#8212;I hope that we in this Parliament will put pressure on the people who have the power to do that&#8212;and then we should work towards the poverty threshold of &#163;158 a week that was calculated in a Joseph Rowntree report.</p><p>Carers should have access to working tax credits under the 16-hour rule, rather than the ludicrous situation in which those who care gain such access only after 30 hours. Carers should be entitled to additional carers allowance on top of retirement pension, which at the moment has an overlap. Changes for carers have made a dent in what is needed, but continued political will is required. There is no room for anyone in any Parliament to rest on their laurels until the national disgrace of carers being treated as second-class citizens has been addressed. To do that, the Parliament must speak on carers' behalf on all issues, whether they are devolved or reserved to Westminster.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14734043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Unpaid Carers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee, I am happy to speak on this issue.

Last year saw the 12<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Philip Lawrence awards, which were established in memory of the headmaster of a school in north London. In his three years at the school, Mr Lawrence was able to turn around its poor academic record and worked to improve its problems with violence. During a fight involving an attack on one of his pupils, whom Mr Lawrence went to protect, he was, sadly, stabbed in the chest; he later died. Mr Lawrence was a brave man who was dedicated to improving the lot of young people in local communities, and the awards are a fitting tribute to him.</p><p>Knightswood Youth Theatre received its Philip Lawrence award at a presentation hosted by Sir Trevor McDonald at London's Bloomsbury Theatre on 2 December last year. It won the award for using drama to bring together young asylum seekers and refugees with young people from the local area in order to develop and enhance mutual understanding and friendships. We should remember that the awards are made by young people's peers&#8212;the judging panel is made up of representatives of previous winners, who get <place-holder colnum=\"14464\"/> together to choose those who embody the spirit of Philip Lawrence.</p><p>The theatre group works closely with the LINKES project, whose name is a combination of Lincoln and Kestrel, the names of the streets that border the high flats where the project is based. There are also connections with Kingsway and Drumchapel groups, through the west integration network. Football, a pensioners club, a gala in summer and the national obsession for cooking that has erupted recently are all catered for at the LINKES base at 200 Lincoln Avenue.</p><p>We are here especially to commend Knightswood Youth Theatre for its success in bringing together a range of young people from varied backgrounds and giving them a direction through drama. The theatre's work strengthens the whole community and provides those young people with opportunities that they would not otherwise have enjoyed. Some of those who won the award cannot be here tonight, as they have since moved on to drama education; that speaks volumes for the group. However, those who recently performed the collection of short plays entitled \"Windows on Our Lives\" at Knightswood Congregational church feel that that the work of Knightswood Youth Theatre and youth group&#8212;and the friendships and enjoyment that they get from belonging to those groups&#8212;go on. That work includes visits by high school student members to local schools to bring back new recruits, spurred on by the enthusiasm and confidence that those inspirational young people bring to all that they do.</p><p>Even though members of the group are under threat of deportation from this country, they are young Scots. Wherever they originate from, they work together and support one another to deliver a message of hope for all of us.</p><p>I am sure that the members of the group want me to mention a few names&#8212;I do not know whether I should do so, because I might miss someone out. However, I mention Aileen Ritchie and Euan Girvan, who planted the seed that blossomed, everyone at Knightswood Congregational church, and Rhona Dougall, who told me how the youth theatre was paired with Lochaber youth centre at the National Theatre of Scotland youth exchange in Stirling in July. It was a great honour for both groups to work together and enhance each other's work.</p><p>Rhona Dougall also told me that everything has been achieved on limited finances. Funding and sponsorship are always sought. I must ask the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture whether I can come to her for guidance on the matter at some point&#8212;I am taking it for granted that she will meet me and I thank her.<place-holder colnum=\"14465\"/></p><p>Glasgow has always been a place where hard work and fun go together, and Scotland has always had people of whom it can be proud.

I am happy to participate in the debate as an MSP, as a councillor on Glasgow City Council and as the disability reporter to the Parliament's Equal Opportunities Committee.</p><p>Legislation on disabled people's parking places is long overdue. Reliance by local authorities and other public bodies on the courtesy and consideration of non-disabled drivers not to take reserved parking spaces could be seen as a basic abrogation of their DDA duties. It should be redundant to say that disability is not a lifestyle choice. For many people, the use of a car is the only way in which they can access education and employment. For people in rural areas who do not have regular and reliable access to public transport, it is often the only way of reaching shops and ensuring continued social contact.</p><p>Therefore, abuse of disabled parking spaces by non-disabled drivers is an abuse of disabled people themselves. Such abuse is most often carried out by people who, in a non-driving situation, would be horrified to have it pointed out to them that they were behaving in a discriminatory manner. However, until everyone can be trusted not to indulge in the&#8212;shall we say&#8212;slight transgression of stopping a wee bit closer to the shops because they have a lot of bags to carry or have children with them, or because it is raining, we must protect disabled parking spaces, because there are disabled people who have all those reasons for parking closer to the shops, as well as a disability to manage.<place-holder colnum=\"12758\"/></p><p>That being the case, we must consider legislation that will protect the rights of disabled people to use designated parking facilities and which will impose penalties on those who abuse those facilities. The only way of doing that is to create enforceable bays, which are cost effective to implement and operate. Many calls are made on local authorities' finances for delivery of a wide range of services, but their service-provision duties are to all their citizens, both those who are able bodied and those who have disabilities. It is therefore incumbent on our councils to work together to establish best practice in areas such as the one that we are debating.</p><p>The estimated costs of creating cost effective and enforceable parking bays that are patrolled by local enforcement officers who have specific knowledge of areas where non-disabled drivers abuse such spaces should not vary as widely as they do&#8212;from &#163;12.20, which is the figure that West Dunbartonshire Council quotes, to &#163;400 in Glasgow. To ensure compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and effective mainstreaming of opportunity for disabled people in the general population, our councils must actively co-operate in addressing such wildly varying quotations for the implementation of viable and enforced disabled parking bays in our cities, towns and villages.</p><p>Emphasis must be placed on councils' duty to deliver on the disability equality scheme and on their action plans to meet it. No additional administrative burdens are being imposed. Councils already have a disability equality duty, as well as a duty to demonstrate their delivery of it. There needs to be a standardisation of enforceable disabled parking bays, as the complex system of advisory bays has failed to deliver and proved to be open to abuse.</p><p>As the debate has demonstrated, there is good will on all sides to deliver a legally enforceable system. I understand that some of the costs and operational figures that have been presented might make some members balk but, in some cases, the figures are because the necessary will is lacking among the people who made the estimates.</p><p>It will be up to us to promote a legislative agenda that will result in the publicly funded bodies in question delivering on their duty to all our citizens, both those who are able bodied and those who have disabilities. We are all aware that the financial consequences of implementing the proposals have not yet been fully evaluated, but I wish to register my support for the aims of a much-needed bill.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271268", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jackie Baillie for introducing the bill for Parliament's consideration.

However, it has also been said, and it will be repeated, that when people are exposed to asbestos through employment, they are exposed to the considerable risk of developing pleural plaques, asbestosis and mesothelioma. That exposure will have been as a result of the manufacture of chrysotile or its use by employers in construction, shipbuilding and other industrial processes. Secondary exposure of workers' spouses and children only compounds the problem of the insidious nature of white asbestos.</p><p>Who is to blame for the illnesses of all those who have been exposed to such material? Surely such exposure must be a result of employers' negligence. By implication, the only people who can provide recompense, albeit of a paltry amount, are the insurers of those employers, as stated by the ABI in the quotation. So where is the problem?</p><p>The idea is that workers and/or their families who are injured or made ill by exposure to asbestos as a result of employers' negligence make employers' liability claims, and then justice prevails. However, that does not happen. The insurers have decided that they will take the premiums but renege on their part of the deal. They challenge whether pleural plaques&#8212;the scarring and thickening of the thin membrane that covers the lungs and the lining of our chests&#8212;can be considered to be an injury.</p><p>Pleural plaques are an indicator of considerable exposure to asbestos, which has been shown to be a major factor in the development of other related illnesses, such as asbestosis and <place-holder colnum=\"12043\"/> mesothelioma. If someone has witnessed their family, friends and work colleagues develop such serious and life-taking illnesses, they might be excused for demonstrating a little anxiety about or possibly even fear of the same thing happening to them. That is especially the case when, as the minister and other speakers have mentioned, Dr Rudd, the leading expert on asbestos-related illness, was quoted as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"People with pleural plaques who have been heavily exposed to asbestos at work have a risk of mesothelioma more than one thousand times greater than the general population.\"</p><p>That would make me anxious, as anyone with pleural plaques has every right to be.</p><p>The idea that those with pleural plaques are just uninformed and worrying needlessly or that pleural plaques are really a sign that lungs are healthily forming scabs over invasive asbestos fibres is an insult and takes a diabolical liberty with the feelings of the ordinary men and women who made this country's wealth with the sweat of their brows.</p><p>It has been my privilege to get to know the men and women who, through Clydeside Action on Asbestos, have campaigned for justice&#8212;for themselves, their families and for others whom they do not even know. I am proud to be on their side in this struggle for compensation for the injuries caused to their bodies by the insidious scourge of white asbestos.</p><p>The insurance companies' view is that pleural plaques are asymptomatic thickening and scarring of the lining of the lungs&#8212;so what. Pleural plaques are a non-malignant disease&#8212;so it does not matter. Pleural plaques do not cause any symptoms or disabilities&#8212;so there is no cause for concern. What a disgraceful attitude.</p><p>How many of the insurers put their hands up when I asked them recently whether they would volunteer to contract such a benign condition during the course of their employment? Not one did so, and I do not think that any of the rest of us would do so either.</p><p>If someone has pleural plaques, they are more likely to develop asbestosis and mesothelioma. No one knows who is going to develop those killer diseases, so those who have plaques have every right to be anxious. Their lungs have an unnatural scarring that is caused by exposure to a dangerous material. Those people got that condition by working hard in order to raise their families. They paid their taxes and helped our industries to reach the stage at which they could pay big insurance companies to compensate employees financially when required.</p><p>The Association of British Insurers says that there is a duty on its part, and on the part of its <place-holder colnum=\"12044\"/> members, to pay out when there has been employer negligence. There has been employer negligence when exposure to asbestos has caused scarring to workers' lungs.</p><p>This Parliament will deliver on its duty to our people; by doing so, it will set an agenda that I hope will cause the London Government to give serious thought to reversing the House of Lords decision that affects people with pleural plaques in England and Wales.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14206682", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Justice Committee for its report and my colleagues in the chamber, who have conducted today's debate in the dignified manner that the subject calls for.

Almost all the attendees where wheelchair users, and all of them had experienced problems in ensuring that they had the best chair for their disability. Given their ages, that will continue to be an issue for some time, as they grow, but all wheelchair users&#8212;regardless of age and whatever their disability&#8212;require the best wheelchair that can be provided to allow them the maximum possible social inclusion. Disability or not, we are talking about people who have hopes, aspirations and ambitions. They also have abilities, which their disabilities often overshadow for the able-bodied who, when they see someone <place-holder colnum=\"6638\"/> in a wheelchair, see the chair, not the person sitting in it.</p><p>It is hard for people who are able bodied and who take mobility for granted to imagine how a person in a chair feels if they are dependent on it for their comfort and mobility. We should think, if we can, about what it means if the seat causes sores&#8212;the person is confined to bed for a long period while the chair is sent away and a new body mould is made. They are socially isolated for a long time and find themselves at a severe disadvantage that none of the rest of us, if we were feeling ill, would expect to have to put up with. As Trish Godman suggested, lacking a wheelchair in that way is a health issue.</p><p>Minor repairs to chairs, even just to a foot rest or a neck rest on a self-guiding chair, require two or more weeks to carry out. During that time, the person has to sit in a chair that is not made for them and, in most cases, is not suitable for them. Although the use of a supervised manual chair is a way of getting round that situation, it robs the person of the limited independence that they normally have. If we think of those frustrations, we can understand how wheelchair users feel every day when their chair has broken down or requires a repair. That point was emphasised to me by the visitors from Quarriers, whom I was pleased to meet and speak to earlier today&#8212;some of them are in the public gallery. It is a pleasure to see them here. I hope that we will have good news for them as soon as possible.</p><p>It is imperative to consult wheelchair users when formulating policy, right from the very start. We should listen to bodies such as the Scottish Disability Equality Forum and Quarriers, which have the expertise of disabled people and their carers. They have stated that disability issues have for too long been at the back of the queue when allocating resources. Quarriers and the Scottish Disability Equality Forum are not-for-profit agencies with great expertise in providing services to adults and children. They cover the whole range. I know that we are all grateful to them for their input and for providing us with facts and figures, which I hope the minister will examine to guide her response to this debate on the needs of wheelchair users.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399832", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wheelchair Users (Human Rights)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Trish Godman for initiating this debate on an issue that is significant to all those who depend on wheelchairs to live their lives in as dignified and independent a manner as possible.

We should therefore hold up as examples organisations that recognise diversities and which implement equalities legislation as intended.

Sad to say, there are at present only two wood recycling projects in Scotland&#8212;one in Glasgow and one in Edinburgh. The Glasgow Wood Recycling Project is modelled on one in Brighton that now collects around 450 tonnes of waste timber a year. That is a fantastic achievement for a community-based project.</p><p>The Glasgow project has a three-year plan to become a self-sustaining wood reuse and recycling business through the collection of wood from businesses, schools and households. That will ensure a financially viable and sustainable local business in the Drumchapel area, where low incomes and poor business start-up rates and investment have combined to leave many adults and young people with low expectations.</p><p>That is where the social aspect of this type of recycling project comes in. The unskilled, the long-term unemployed, pensioners and young people are all benefiting from access to the facility. However, the project is not a school; it is a business and social enterprise. At present, its resources are too limited to take on board the number of people who would like to enjoy working with wood and pick up skills. Such enterprises rely on support from public bodies, and the all-too-familiar cry about the funding gap has gone up.</p><p>However, the returns for the wider community are great. They take the form of improved mental and physical health, the socialisation of young people, the acquisition of woodworking skills, the <place-holder colnum=\"3629\"/> provision of education and an improved local environment. It might therefore be beneficial if the Scottish Government considered the possibility of establishing a one-stop shop to allow such social enterprises to receive advice and funding. I hope that the minister will be able to look into that.</p><p>We already know that the budget has pointed the way towards minimising the amount of waste materials, with the eventual aim of a zero-waste society. There can be no better way of achieving that aim than through the use of what are currently seen as waste materials to create new products, such as furniture, shelving, frames, household items and even works of art to enhance the local area from which the waste was recovered. Glasgow School of Art is a regular customer of the Glasgow Wood Recycling project, and its product design department has worked with the project to develop products from reclaimed wood that will extend the enterprise's income-generating potential.</p><p>Another excellent example of local co-operation is in the donation of old barrels from Edrington, the bottling company, whose Drumchapel plant gives the Glasgow Wood Recycling Project old, solid, wooden kegs to be transformed into furniture. Such generosity and vision are to be welcomed, and as a member for Glasgow, I extend my thanks to Edrington's management for that.</p><p>The planners who were involved in the rebuilding of Drumchapel town centre&#8212;New City Vision&#8212;have also expressed an interest in using street furniture and art installations that have been made from waste wood from the demolished buildings of the old scheme. Similarly, the new Shetland museum and archives at Hay's dock in Lerwick is an impressive example of the use of recycled materials, wood prominent among them. In that case, the wood was taken from 19<sup>th</sup> century German ships that have been excavated from the harbour.</p><p>Wood recycling is an idea whose time has come. Socially and environmentally, such recycling is beneficial and, as the idea, grows, it will easily be able to clear its feet financially. However, in the short term, projects such as the Glasgow Wood Recycling Project will need some help with funding, business advice and the possibility of public contracts. I hope that the minister will be able to look on those issues favourably.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392527", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Recycling Waste Wood"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to open this debate on an issue of growing importance: the recycling of wood and wood products.

The fact that we can stand here and, in the spirit of natural justice, stand alongside those who are victims of pleural plaques and other asbestos illnesses shows that this Parliament is a Parliament of the people. I am happy to stand here to speak up for those many victims, but I am saddened that it has proven necessary for me to do so.</p><p>Sadness is experienced by many people in communities across Scotland who, over the years and up to the present day, have lost relatives and friends to the various asbestos diseases. Pleural <place-holder colnum=\"3142\"/> plaques, which can cause breathlessness and various other health problems, may or may not lead to more severe life-threatening illnesses such as pleural thickening, asbestosis or mesothelioma. However, pleural plaques exist only in the lungs of people who have worked with asbestos or been exposed to asbestos as a result of being related to such workers. They do not exist in any other form. They exist only in people who have been exposed to asbestos. On that basis, we can say that those employers who exposed their workers to asbestos are liable. If those employers had a liability policy with an insurance company, that insurance company will have to pay up.</p><p>Today I met representatives of the insurance companies. At a very civilised meeting, they impressed on my colleagues and me that medical evidence suggests that pleural plaques have no impact on the lung capacity or general health of the affected person. I am not a medic, but the suggestion that pleural plaques, which occur only as a result of exposure to asbestos and are scars or calcified areas on the lungs, are not injuries or injurious is insulting to those who are affected. Calcification of living tissue by exposure to asbestos is an unnatural injury to the human body and, by extension, an injury to the mind and spirit of the victim. The anxiety that victims and their relations feel is real. In my opinion, they are due whatever compensation a payment from employers or insurers will achieve.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391117", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pleural Plaques (House of Lords Ruling)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Stuart McMillan for securing the debate.
