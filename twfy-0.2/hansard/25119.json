There were some fantastic speeches from across the chamber from members who touched on their personal experiences, which I will also do.</p><p>There was almost universal condemnation of the campaign. It is a campaign so iniquitous, cruel and shameful that it is hard to believe that it came from a Government department. It is a campaign that genuinely&#8212;as Patrick Harvie said&#8212;threatened to derail much of the progress that we have made to reduce the levels of racist bigotry that we have seen in the past. It probably has derailed some of that progress.</p><p>Scotland has a long history of welcoming people from all over the world, whether they are visitors, students, migrant workers or asylum seekers. We want to be a progressive and socially responsible nation that provides a place of safety and fair, humane and sensible policies on asylum.</p><p>In response to Alex Johnstone&#8217;s comments, I do not believe&#8212;and certainly I do not think that any member in the chamber believes&#8212;that anybody in the Conservative party, for example, is a racist. That is not the point that we are trying to make at all. The point that we are trying to make is that that phrase&#8212;that language&#8212;has been taken from the National Front; it has been taken from the British National Party. It is a phrase that has been used by racists up and down the country over the ages and over the years and there is no way that anybody in Government, be they a minister, a cabinet secretary or even a civil servant, would not have known the impact of using that language and why it was so hurtful and so offensive.</p><p>Mr Malik was spot on in describing how it made him feel. Much like him, having grown up in Glasgow&#8212;having been born and bred in Glasgow&#8212;I have been called every name and every racist slur under the sun. I have been called the four-letter word for a Pakistani; I have been called a black b; I have been called anything that people can imagine from when I was in primary school to, most recently, a couple of weeks ago on social media. However, the one that gets to me the most&#8212;the one that hurts the most and the one that really grinds against the grain the most&#8212;is when I am told to go home. As Mr Malik was saying so correctly, when I have worked hard for this country, when this is my country, when I was born and bred here and am just as Glaswegian and just as Scottish as anybody else, and somebody tells me to go home, I think, &#8220;What the&#8212;&#8221;. Dinna worry, I stopped myself. I think, &#8220;What right do they have to tell me to go home?&#8221; It does hurt.</p><p>I respect that perhaps Alex Johnstone agrees that the language that was used in the campaign was not fair and not sensible and, more than that, it was offensive.</p><p>We cannot take that campaign in isolation. Members have touched upon this point. There is a sense that when it comes to issues of asylum and refugees as well as immigration&#8212;we do not want to conflate them but there are similar themes around both issues&#8212;there is a trajectory and the UK is regressing. We have heard EU commissioners saying that the UK is now being viewed as a nasty country.</p><p>That is the trajectory that the UK is on. My appeal to colleagues in the Labour Party is honest and sincere. There is no difference&#8212;not an iota&#8212;between Jackie Baillie and me in our belief about how asylum seekers and those who are seeking refuge in this country should be treated. We believe that they should be treated humanely and compassionately. However, I am genuinely worried that the UK political parties, including Jackie Baillie&#8217;s party, are on the wrong trajectory. I know that she says that that is not true, but I genuinely think that they are going in the wrong direction. I also believe that they are pandering to the UKIP agenda.</p><p>Diane Abbott, who is a very senior member of the Labour Party, said:</p><p>&#8220;Ed Miliband has made two speeches on immigration in recent months ... all parties need to be careful of &#8216;dog whistle&#8217; politics on immigration where the text is fine but the underlying message is one that is not so fine.</p><p>The rise of Ukip has made people panicky about immigration but the truth is that the fear of immigration is just that&#8212;it is fear.

Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s speech and the story that she told were extraordinarily powerful. She talked about public opinion perhaps not chiming with the go home campaign. By and large, I agree with that, but the honest reality is that many members of the public have an irrational fear of immigration, who asylum seekers are, and why they are in the country. I think that the defining difference is in how politicians choose to respond to that. I do not believe that the language that is coming from politicians, particularly the Conservative-led coalition Government and the Conservative Party, is helpful.</p><p>We have seen an almost united front in the chamber&#8212;a pretty unanimous display of why we believe that immigrants and those who seek asylum should be welcomed to Scotland. That is the right political message, and I hope that it filters down to people. I appeal to those who have influence in their parties in the UK to try translate that tone and feeling to those parties, as they are not going in that direction. We have displayed something in the Scottish Parliament that I do not think would quite be heard in the UK Parliament, certainly not from senior members of the UK Government.</p><p>We have published &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future: Your Guide to an Independent Scotland&#8221;, a white paper in which we have very clearly given our priorities for asylum and immigration.

We believe in no longer allowing refugees to become destitute, but providing them with continued support, and in no longer carrying out dawn raids and dragging families and children out of their homes at 3, 4 or 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning. That is not just a legal duty; it is our moral duty. It will help us to build a more successful nation that is based on diverse, inclusive and skilled communities that work not only for economic growth but for better social and cultural diversity.</p><p>I will end with the poignant and aspirational image that Christian Allard MSP painted.

Of course, Graeme Dey&#8217;s constituency, Angus South, achieved Fairtrade zone status last year. I also thank all the members who spoke about fair trade events that take place in their local schools, churches and supermarkets.</p><p>The Scottish Government is proud to have supported the Scottish Fair Trade Forum since 2007. It was a real pleasure for me to be able to announce in February that Scotland had achieved Fairtrade nation status following the report, &#8220;Can Scotland call itself a Fair Trade Nation?&#8221; Two themes that were picked up on by Ken Macintosh and Fiona McLeod were important when I made that announcement. One was footballs. We used footballs that came from Sialkot in Pakistan&#8212;many of Mr Macintosh&#8217;s constituents will come from that district&#8212;when we had a kickabout at a school in the east end of Glasgow. Playing football with 10 and 11-year-olds made me feel quite old, because I was puffed out after the first 10 or 15 minutes. Using the footballs was a great, fun way of getting the message across, just as Fiona McLeod said. When I talked to the kids about fair trade footballs and asked whether they had any questions, a kid put up his hand and said, &#8220;Can we get the ball, sir, and start playing?&#8221; They got the message.</p><p>I thank Ken Macintosh for raising the issue. The important thing about the footballs is that in a day and age when a footballer can be sold for &#163;100 million and no one bats an eyelid, nobody gives enough thought to the football that that &#163;100 million foot will be kicking. Given that football is our national sport, there is a lot more that we can do in that respect. Graham Spiers, the columnist, wrote a good article about that, which I commend to everybody. He set the Government and the Parliament the challenge to see what else we can do on that front.</p><p>The Scottish Fair Trade Forum was instrumental in driving forward the agenda to achieve the Fairtrade nation accolade. Wales was the first country to achieve that accolade, but I am pleased that we can now say that we are the other Fairtrade nation in the world. I was at an event in Perth at the weekend, where Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales, sent a great video message congratulating Scotland on achieving Fairtrade nation status.</p><p>I am delighted by the opinion poll that Graeme Dey and other members highlighted, which shows that the number of people in Scotland who support fair trade continues to rise. I accept George Adam&#8217;s point that fair trade is about more than just a brand, but the recognition of the brand is phenomenal. At the event in Perth, one of the people receiving an award was Tracy Mitchell, who got involved in fair trade when her two-year-old daughter recognised and pointed to the Fairtrade sign at the supermarket. She started getting involved in making her child&#8217;s nursery a Fairtrade nursery. The brand has great recognition, but we can undoubtedly still do more.</p><p>One of the great things that everybody mentioned was the number of different people involved in the fair trade movement, which is one of the best things about fair trade. That extends from businesses, such as tea and chocolate companies, right down to local schools. Thousands and thousands of people are determined to ensure that we send the message from Scotland that we do not believe in the inequality of the supply chain and that we want to do something to change and fix that so that we have a much better, more equal and more prosperous society for all.</p><p>Scotland is a caring nation that is determined to ensure that producers in the developing world are paid a fair price for their goods. As I said, that was demonstrated in villages, towns and cities across the entire country. Primary 6 children of Carlogie primary school in Carnoustie, which Mr Dey mentioned, run Fairlogie, a successful fair trade cafe and tuck shop that benefits the local community and helps to raise awareness. The children of St Elizabeth&#8217;s primary school in Hamilton, whom I met at the weekend as well, have a rap song that they have recorded as a single, which is played across many schools. I will not attempt to sing it.</p><p>Members: Go on.</p><p>No, it would do this debate a disservice if I were even to attempt it.</p><p>St Elizabeth&#8217;s primary received a community award, which recognises the work that the children put into that song.</p><p>Like Nanette Milne, I want to make a special mention of churches. I think that the churches in Scotland can give themselves a thoroughly well-earned pat on the back for their efforts with regard to fair trade and the Fairtrade movement. It would not be an exaggeration to say that, without their efforts, we would not have achieved Fairtrade nation status when we did, and it would have been a lot more difficult without their efforts, so I want to put that very much on record.</p><p>Claudia Beamish and others mentioned legislation, and I agree that legislation can most definitely play an important role. Third sector organisations and non-governmental organisations from Oxfam and the Scottish Fairtrade Forum all the way through to the many hundreds that are working with the Fairtrade movement have had discussions with the Deputy First Minister and, previously, Alex Neil, who formerly led on the procurement bill. Indeed, local MSPs, including myself, have held meetings to try to feed into the procurement bill process.</p><p>I will endeavour to get a response to Claudia Beamish with an update on that issue, which I know is being considered. In truth, there is a difficulty with naming particular brands in legislation, but we can perhaps find a way of getting a positive outcome by addressing the issue of the underlying principles.</p><p>I was delighted that Claudia Beamish mentioned Justine from Uganda. Having met Justine at the Fairtrade status announcement, as well as having met farmers from Malawi and people who are involved in the Fairtrade movement in Indonesia, I know that hearing from people about the difference that fair trade makes to their lives brings the issue to life. For all the people who are involved in fair trade, there are still a lot of people who see the products on the shelves with the Fairtrade label and do not put out their hands to pick up those products. As George Adam said, we still have a heck of a lot of work to do. It is important that we consider ourselves to be at the beginning, not the end. Further, let us face it: at that event in Perth, I had Fairtrade candy floss, brownies, crisps and chocolate&#8212;never has doing good work ever tasted and felt so good, so it is an easy thing for us all to do.</p><p>I am proud, like all the members here, of everything that we have achieved in Scotland and of the way in which people have worked together in communities across the country to help us to achieve this fantastic status. I believe that countries the size of Scotland can set an example for the rest of the world, as George Adam said, and that, through our commitment to fairness and equality, we can be a standard bearer for other nations in the world.</p><p>I am delighted to make the important announcement that, on Sunday, I will be playing in a football match on the hallowed turf of Celtic Park&#8212;[Applause.]</p><p>I knew that at least one person would applaud that. More than that, I am delighted that MSPs, MPs, councillors, elected representatives of all parties, all colours and all hues have played their part, and I think that they should give themselves a pat on the back for that, because we are leading by example. However, the thanks really go to the people of Scotland, as Nanette Milne said.</p><p>I am delighted that we have had this debate. We have achieved a fantastic status, but there is much more work to be done.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:44.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am honoured to close the debate and I thank Graeme Dey for bringing it to the chamber.

It is a great asset and resource for the Government, along with other partners such as the European and External Relations Committee, which has advised us in a very thoughtful and insightful report, to which there will be a response in the fullness of time. There are of course also other partners, such as Consul General Lee, who strains every sinew to ensure that we have closer collaboration between Scotland and China.

I mention that in jest, but the serious point is that that in itself shows the closening relationship between our two nations.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s China strategy is an important statement of commitment to the Chinese Government on the importance of the relationship to our nation. The refreshed China strategy contains four guiding principles that will continue to shape our engagement with China. The principles, each of which is important in its own right, are securing sustainable economic growth; respect for human rights and the rule of law; the understanding of culture, which Graeme Pearson mentioned; and increasing Scotland&#8217;s influence on the international stage. I agree entirely with Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s sentiment that respect for human rights, which Margaret McDougall referred to in her closing words, and the rule of law is imperative. That is why it is part of our strategy. However, as Malcolm Chisholm rightly said, that should not preclude us from continuing to do what is right for Scotland&#8217;s economic interests&#8212;there is no contradiction in addressing both issues.</p><p>The importance of China as a growing economic superpower has been reaffirmed in the debate. We have an opportunity through our relationship with China to contribute to Scotland&#8217;s economic growth.</p><p>We should have no doubt about it&#8212;China is incredibly competitive. I have been there and I was certainly not the only delegate from other parts of the world.

We can always do more to ensure that businesses&#8212;particularly small and medium-sized businesses&#8212;know about the outcomes that we have and about the expert services that SDI provides, such as market research and incubation hubs. The point is well made in the report and we will certainly look to reflect on it.</p><p>The demand is there from Scottish businesses, which rank China as their number 1 future market. In the past five years, there has been an increase of more than 80 per cent in exports to China. The point that both Jamie McGrigor and Graeme Pearson made about small and medium-sized enterprises was well made. SDI is leading another mission of Scottish businesses to China, and 80 per cent of them are what we would classify as small and medium-sized enterprises. We take that point on board, but we also reflect that there is more that we can do.</p><p>On my recent visit to China, one of the small enterprises that we helped&#8212;I do not think that I could call it medium sized&#8212;was TEFL Scotland, and we witnessed it signing a contract. A husband and wife team in Dingwall literally started that business from a garden shed, subsequently employing 10 people, doubling their workforce and securing a contract with one of China&#8217;s biggest online teaching resources. That is a fantastic example, but I absolutely agree that more can be done.</p><p>We heard today from a variety of speakers. Gil Paterson made the point&#8212;I thought very well&#8212;about higher education and the importance of languages. In university education, we attract a phenomenal amount of Chinese students and Scotland has an excellent offer in its teaching and research. I believe that, through collaboration, both sides can learn from each other and gain a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities that the world faces.</p><p>As many speakers said, Scotland has been successful in attracting Chinese students and those from Hong Kong, but it is not just about the students who come to study here. We should also consider not only the economic benefit that they bring when their families come and when they spend here but what they bring culturally and academically.</p><p>I will talk more about the visa regime in a second, but I agree that there is a difficulty there&#8212;if nothing else, at least a difficulty of perception of Scotland&#8217;s and the UK&#8217;s openness. We will continue to encourage the UK Government and have discussions with it where and when appropriate, saying that the message should be that Scotland and the UK are open to the best academic and business talent that China and the world have to offer. My colleague the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs has had that discussion many a time on behalf of Universities Scotland, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses and others and she will continue to do that where and when appropriate.</p><p>Language was mentioned, and that point is extraordinarily important. As Roderick Campbell said, to change the cultural mindset can be a difficult task, but the pragmatic and practical things that we can do&#8212;and have done&#8212;include the development of 13 Confucius classroom hubs in Scotland, each linked with a school in Tianjin, covering 17 local authorities. Learning Chinese languages is just one part of learning about China, its history and its growth in the modern world, but it is an extraordinarily important part and we will continue to do what we can to increase the uptake of languages.</p><p>Almost every speaker mentioned air links. Well before I became a member of the Scottish Government, the Government was pursuing the issue vigorously through ministers with responsibility for tourism, external affairs and many other departments. My ministerial colleague Fergus Ewing sought the establishment of a stakeholder group, to bring businesses together to discuss collaboration between Scotland and China, and one of the main comments from businesspeople is that there is a need for a direct air link.</p><p>We are straining every sinew in that regard. I was lucky to meet the Chinese civil aviation authority, and we agreed on a number of steps to take forward to promote the idea and, I hope, get to the point at which we have a direct air link between Scotland and China. I will endeavour to ensure that we keep the cross-party group and the European and External Relations Committee updated on progress.</p><p>Under the China strategy we have committed to establishing a stakeholder implementation and delivery forum, to help to promote collaborative working and share best practice and practical expertise. I am pleased that the forum&#8217;s first meeting will be held at the end of the month and I look forward to hearing the outcome of the discussions.</p><p>I am delighted to announce that an online information hub on Sino-Scottish links will be launched very soon. I know that that is of particular interest to Graeme Pearson and the cross-party group.</p><p>I thank members for their speeches. I will endeavour to keep members, committees and the cross-party group up to date on progress on the points in the motion about language, air links, universities, visas and tourism.

I also thank all the members who signed her motion. I welcome the many people in the public gallery from the Shia community and beyond who have attended the debate.</p><p>I share everybody&#8217;s concern at the level of religious violence in Pakistan, in Iraq and throughout the world that is directed towards Shia communities. As we have heard, in February, more than 30 people were killed and about 190 injured in a spate of car bombings in mainly Shia areas of Iraq. Tragically, that has continued, with more than 60 people killed in car bombs in Baghdad yesterday.</p><p>Twin bomb attacks on 10 January in Quetta in Pakistan killed 100 people and injured up to 200 more. Further bombings in February took the death toll to more than 200, most of whom were from the Shia community. The attack was definitely directed towards them.</p><p>I do not know a single person who was not affected by the scenes that we saw in the aftermath of the bombings in Quetta, when mothers refused to bury their dead and sat next to coffins in defiance until protection for their community was guaranteed.</p><p>Members from across the chamber made good speeches. To answer the questions from John Lamont and James Dornan on working with the UK Government and the Government of Pakistan, I inform members that, on 20 January this year, I wrote the consul general of Pakistan to condemn the attacks and express our condolences to the families that were affected. Then, in a meeting, I reiterated the Scottish Government&#8217;s offer of assistance to work with the Government of Pakistan to do what we can.</p><p>From what the consul general and other Government officials in Pakistan said, I have no doubt that they have a resolve to tackle the issue. I will come on to the new Government of Pakistan a little later.</p><p>Freedom of thought, conscience and religion are closely related rights that reflect the freedom of an individual or community to think and freely hold conscientious beliefs. It is incredibly important to manifest religion in teaching, practice, worship and observance. Those rights sit under international treaty and are central to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p><p>As a good global citizen, Scotland has a strong and enduring commitment to securing democracy, the rule of law and fundamental human rights throughout the world. We would, of course, expect all states to comply with international and human rights law, and we condemn human rights abuses wherever they occur. In our view that is a basic minimum requirement of any state under international law, although I appreciate that human rights are an immensely complex and challenging issue, especially for Iraq and Pakistan, which both have monumental challenges to address.</p><p>When I last spoke to Pakistani officials, they gave an unwavering commitment to defeat that type of violence. I do not doubt for a minute that the resolve of the new Government in Pakistan will be just as strong, and it may offer a fresh opportunity to tackle the evil scourge of violence that is directed towards the country&#8217;s Shia population.</p><p>I reiterate that the Scottish Government, working with the UK Government, will seek to provide any assistance that it can that might be useful to Iraq or Pakistan in defeating sectarian violence. I will happily raise that issue, and reiterate that offer, the next time I meet an FCO minister.</p><p>The opportunity exists for us to engage with Pakistan. The elections on 11 May were a crucial milestone in Pakistan&#8217;s democratic history and journey, as that was the first time that power was transferred democratically between one civilian government and another following a full term. I am sure that all of us in the chamber welcome the strengthening of democracy in Pakistan.</p><p>Tomorrow, I will be speaking at an event that is designed to address the question of how Scottish businesses can invest in Pakistan. We have a vested interest in seeing greater stability in Pakistan so that we can do business and trade with the country, and thereby help to lift it out of poverty and improve its economic circumstances.</p><p>In addition, we subscribe to the moral argument that&#8212;as members have rightly said&#8212;there should be no attacks on anyone, particularly minorities, who must be protected. Importantly, we in Scotland, as good global citizens, want to see an end to that violence. I was delighted to announce earlier this month the award of &#163;1.8 million from our south Asia programme to fund some development projects in Pakistan.</p><p>In Iraq, religious-based attacks are still far too common. However, with democracy holding, and with statistics showing that violence has fallen from its 2007 peak, there is cautious hope&#8212;I emphasise the word &#8220;cautious&#8221;&#8212;that religious violence can be curbed. Scotland is playing whatever part it can&#8212;even if that is a small part&#8212;in Iraqi development. The Scottish Government has awarded a total of &#163;1.5 million to NGOs for projects to develop civil society in Iraq between 2010 and 2013.</p><p>The Scottish Government values and appreciates the contribution that diverse faith and belief communities make to enrich Scotland economically, socially and culturally. We have a vibrant Shia community in Glasgow&#8212;and throughout Scotland&#8212;which is part of the rich cultural diversity of that city that adds so much to its character.</p><p>I am pleased to say, speaking from a personal point of view, that relationships between the Shia and Sunni communities in Glasgow are very good. Both communities are members of the Muslim Council of Scotland, and they attend each other&#8217;s events.</p><p>Sandra White spoke about the mutual respect and dialogue that exists. She also mentioned food and how people are always well fed when they go to a mosque event, whether it is a Shia or Sunni mosque. Food is a good place to start the dialogue&#8212;I am thinking of the response to the recent unfortunate and tragic events in Woolwich, and how English Defence League members were given tea and biscuits yesterday by a mosque in York. That helped to break down the barriers, and discussions took place, so we have a great amount for which to thank the humble custard cream.</p><p>After the bombings in Quetta, I attended a cross-party event with the Shia community in Glasgow, along with many members from all sides of the chamber. There were Sunni and Shia imams present, and all stood united in their condemnation of the attacks. It is important that that bond of common friendship is maintained, because those who terrorise our communities and minority want us to forget that common bond and remain divided.</p><p>I join all members in the chamber in condemning the recent violence that was targeted at the Shia community. It is in all our interests for Pakistan and Iraq to be stable and prosperous.

I also welcome members of the Save Wemyss Ancient Caves Society, who have come in great numbers. I also pass on an apology from the cabinet secretary, Fiona Hyslop, who is on Government business in Germany. She asked me to respond to the debate on the member&#8217;s motion and I know that she would have welcomed the chance to recognise the good work of the society.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s local historical and archaeological societies make a substantial contribution to protecting and managing our historical environment. Indeed, the best and sometimes the only way to get involved with archaeology and history is through the local societies. They arrange talks, walks, guides and events nearly every week in Scotland, and they do much to provide opportunities for us all to use, enjoy and understand our cultural heritage. On the Scottish Government&#8217;s behalf, therefore, I am happy to recognise the work of the Save Wemyss Ancient Caves Society. As many members have commented, since 1986 the society has done so much to promote public understanding, awareness and enjoyment of the Wemyss area and the caves in particular.</p><p>I also put on the record our understanding of the national significance of the caves. They are a scheduled site and, as such, their national significance should not be underplayed, although I agree entirely with Murdo Fraser&#8217;s comment that perhaps many people in Scotland do not know enough about them. Hopefully, tonight&#8217;s debate, secured by David Torrance, will help to raise that awareness.</p><p>The society&#8217;s work typifies the passion, commitment, hard work and enthusiasm that we see in many local archaeological and historical societies across Scotland. I am aware of some of the guide books that it has produced for the caves and of the walks that it leads year after year to show local people and visitors the rich heritage of the area. I am sure that we all recognise that that work is given freely on weekends and after work by people who are balancing family life and commitments with the wider benefits to the community. I am also sure that those people will not mind me saying that having looked at the work that they have done since 1986, I believe that it is fair to say that the society is tenacious&#8212;and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible.</p><p>The society&#8217;s work shows us why it is vital that we recognise and empower local groups and communities to continue to be involved in managing and promoting our archaeological sites. To that end, the Government supports the work of Archaeology Scotland, which helps people from all walks of life to get involved with archaeology through learning about and promotion and support of Scotland&#8217;s unique historic environment. Many members will be aware of the great work that is done through the Scottish archaeology month each September.</p><p>We recognise the fact that local communities face difficulties in protecting and understanding archaeological remains in coastal areas. As Claire Baker mentioned, we fund the work of the SCAPE trust to provide a national approach on the issue. SCAPE&#8212;a charity based at the University of St Andrews&#8212;undertakes national monitoring programmes and archaeological investigations of key monuments that are affected by coastal erosion. The charity is focused on engaging with coastal communities to complete those programmes.</p><p>Using technologies such as phone apps, Scotland&#8217;s coastal heritage at risk project, which was developed by SCAPE, provides information for local communities to use to monitor and record sites at risk. I am glad that one of SCAPE&#8217;s projects is at the Wemyss caves, where it is working with the society and with university researchers to laser scan the sites.</p><p>I know that David Torrance supports that recording project and I am also aware that he and other members feel strongly about the physical protection of the caves. The caves have suffered from vandalism, as we have heard, as well as from the presence and long-term effects of mining and from coastal erosion of the sites and paths. Each of those issues requires different approaches for the long-term management of the caves.</p><p>The archaeological heritage of Fife is rich and varied, especially in the coastal areas. The national significance of the Wemyss caves is acknowledged by the scheduled monument status of six of the 12 caves. That designation allows Scottish ministers to provide support and advice to owners and to others who seek to undertake positive works.</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises the strength of local feeling and commitment to the protection of the caves. We also acknowledge that the management problems have been significant and complex, with no practical and necessarily cost-effective solution to date.</p><p>Existing coastal defences, which were funded by central and local government in the 1990s, had some effect but did not by any means present a permanent solution. Members have quite rightly asked about Scottish Government actions and about what assistance we can provide. Accordingly, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, Ms Hyslop, has asked Historic Scotland to set up a working group to review the situation since the 1990s and to look at the management issues and the options moving forward. Ms Hyslop has written to Fife Council to seek its participation in the group and I am glad to note that it has accepted.</p><p>Key to the success of that group, of course, is the participation, support and knowledge of the society, the local community and the owners&#8212;Wemyss estate. I am glad to note that SCAPE will provide its expertise on the group as well. I am told that the group will meet for the first time in the next few weeks, when a suitable date for all has been confirmed. I understand that the cabinet secretary intends to visit the site in late summer to review the group&#8217;s progress.</p><p>The group will look at the erosion effects and mitigation options; the aim is also to review the full range of issues affecting the site such as access, interpretation and visitor amenities. Ultimately, the aim is to provide a framework for future management of the site that is agreed by all parties&#8212;a point well made by Murdo Fraser. I agree that visitor numbers are important for sustainability and a visitor strategy will be part of the discussions of the working group when it meets.</p><p>Quite rightly, there are concerns about archaeological sites being lost through coastal erosion. As we have heard, climate change is having an increasingly negative impact on our environment, including the historic environment, with rising sea levels and increased storm events causing more attrition of archaeological sites each year. Perhaps the work of the working group will serve to benefit not just the Wemyss caves but many sites around our coastal area.</p><p>The key to good management of this resource is the integrated work of all parts of the historic environment sector to allow long-term planning and concerted action at the right time. The Government will continue to support the work of local groups such as the society, public authorities, local communities and research institutions to value and manage our coastal and maritime heritage.</p><p>I thank David Torrance for securing the debate and for raising awareness of the issue. I also thank him for organising the attendance of the society today. I thank the society for its work since 1986. Its input to the working group will be extraordinarily helpful, not just for the Wemyss caves but for many historical sites across Scotland.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:39.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688554", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Save Wemyss Ancient Caves Society"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Torrance on securing the debate and bringing it to the chamber.

Not only do I get to speak in debates that bring the whole Parliament together, but I get to do so twice.</p><p>In that respect, I thank James Kelly for bringing the debate to the Parliament. I enjoyed seeing him over the few days when we celebrated the bicentenary. There have been some fantastic speeches from across the chamber. I echo the many comments thanking and welcoming our guests in the public gallery. Some of them are from the Malawian diaspora, but we also have schoolchildren and representatives of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.</p><p>Here we are, celebrating the bicentenary of Dr David Livingstone, 200 years on from his birth. The values that he represents undoubtedly spell out who we are as a nation. What a joy it is that, 200 years on, the legacy of that great man is being carried on by our children. That was evidenced in the bicentenary celebrations, in which children were involved at every step of the way. I welcome the children in the public gallery from St Blane&#8217;s primary school. The fact that they are still in their school uniform after 3 o&#8217;clock is almost like overtime, so I think that they should get the day off tomorrow for that. Luckily, my colleague the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is not here to hear me say that.</p><p>Children were involved at the heart of every event in the celebration of the bicentenary. We had a great picture of Martha Payne with the President of Malawi. Children were involved when we rightly showed off our civic society links at an event that was organised by the Scotland Malawi Partnership, which must be thanked for its efforts. I had the great pleasure of being at the David Livingstone centre to bury a time capsule with pupils from five schools in James Kelly&#8217;s constituency. On a day when it was snowing and there was a blizzard, they were in fantastic voice. Perhaps I helped them to get in that good voice, because a teacher told me afterwards, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re the type of person that induces hyperactivity in children.&#8221; I took that as a compliment, even though I do not think that she meant it in that way.</p><p>During the civic society event, we were treated to a fantastic chorus of children singing the Malawian national anthem as the President came in. That was continued by a spontaneous choir of ladies from the Malawian diaspora who decided to sing to the President as she left. The bicentenary was a fantastic occasion in all senses of the word.</p><p>The President&#8217;s visit started in the perfect way. She made a speech with the First Minister and we announced some of the 15 projects that we have funded thus far in the current Malawian development round. Her sentiments and the warmth that she and her delegation had for Scotland were tangible. The President&#8217;s first words in her opening remarks on the Sunday when she arrived were that, for her, coming to Scotland was a pilgrimage. She likened it to going to Mecca for the Muslims. I sat next to John Bande, the MP for Blantyre in Malawi, who turned to me and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve come home.&#8221; That is how he felt when he arrived in Blantyre in the thick snow. The warmth was most definitely tangible.</p><p>I am pleased that the Scottish Government chose to support the bicentenary celebrations by contributing &#163;400,000 towards ensuring a sustainable legacy. Bob Doris correctly made the point that the David Livingstone centre is at the hub of that. I hope that the celebrations will go a long way towards continuing to spark interest in David Livingstone and that the centre continues to develop and to be sustainable.</p><p>One of the best projects that we have funded is the David Livingstone bicentenary scholarship programme. The &#163;100,000 for that programme will give young and gifted but underprivileged Malawian students the opportunity to study at a Malawian further or higher education institute. I am pleased about that, because it contributes to the sustainable development legacy that we want to leave in Malawi.</p><p>Many members have spoken about the idea of legacy. We must live by the principles of Dr David Livingstone, whom the first President of Zambia called &#8220;Africa&#8217;s first freedom fighter&#8221;. He stood for abolishing slavery and poverty. Patricia Ferguson made the point well in this debate, and in the previous debate that Bob Doris introduced, that there are still forms of slavery. They might be different from previous forms, but there are still forms of slavery in Africa and even in Malawi. Tied aid, poverty, and gender inequality are all forms of slavery. Having to fight those illnesses that eventually fatally affected David Livingstone and his family is still a form of slavery that we must all speak up about and fight.</p><p>Tavish Scott and Sarah Boyack made a good point about the idea of how we make a sustainable development legacy. The truth is that, during the past half century, more than $1 trillion in development funds has been thrown at the African continent. Some countries have progressed but many have either stagnated or, worse, have regressed. The poverty is even worse than it was previously. How do we use our aid more effectively?</p><p>Tavish Scott made the point very well, as did Sarah Boyack, that we have to look at long-term sustainable economic development. I was therefore delighted that, when the President visited, she brought over trade ministers and the minister for mining, and that, with the help of Ann Gloag, we brought together some of Scotland&#8217;s top entrepreneurs and investors to discuss how we can increase the trade and investment links between Scotland and Malawi.</p><p>On top of that, we discussed how we can strengthen the agricultural sectors. There are definite opportunities in oil and gas, mining and fisheries as well. We will develop those links and have offered the opportunity for a secondee to come from the Malawian Government trade and investment centre to Scottish Development International to see whether we can increase Malawi&#8217;s potential for foreign direct investment.</p><p>We all live in difficult financial times&#8212;we know that&#8212;but we must never give in to the naysayers of doom. We must learn from David Livingstone&#8217;s legacy and, even if it is difficult to speak out in challenging times, we must continue to show compassion because that is who we are and it will be our legacy. In the year of David Livingstone&#8217;s bicentenary, I hope that his legacy will have an effect on us, our children and future generations so that we can continue to fight for those who are the most vulnerable not just at home but across the world.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:07.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I said when I was privileged and honoured to be appointed to my role, I undoubtedly have the best job in Government.

I add my voice and the voice of the Scottish Government to those welcoming the Kurdish community to our and their Parliament.</p><p>Last week, the Parliament reflected on the 10-year anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq. When coalition forces entered Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction, they found mass graves concealing men, women and children, all killed for nothing but their ethnicity. As members have said, last week also marked the 25th anniversary of the Anfal campaign, the last and most well-known phase of persecution against the Iraqi Kurds in 1987-88. It is estimated that 180,000 people perished in a systematic ethnic cleansing programme&#8212;as Hanzala Malik said, there were perhaps many more whom, to this day, we still do not know about. The campaign was instigated by Saddam Hussein and the Baathist regime against the mainly Kurdish population in northern Iraq.</p><p>The atrocities were characterised by the gross violation of human rights and included mass executions and the disappearance of men, women and children; the widespread use of chemical weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin&#8212;the worst incident being, as members have said, in Halabja, where 5,000 civilian inhabitants are thought to have died in a single aerial bombardment using such chemical weapons; the destruction of 2,000 villages as well as dozens of towns and administrative centres; and huge numbers being imprisoned without just cause other than their presumed sympathies for the Kurdish.</p><p>In 1993, the Human Rights Watch report on the Anfal campaign against the Iraqi Kurds concluded:</p><p>&#8220;This crime far transcended legitimate counterinsurgency and includes the murder and disappearance of tens of thousands of non-combatants due to their ethnic-national identity.&#8221;</p><p>There can be no doubt that it was ethnic cleansing.</p><p>The events of 1987-88 are a tragic example of a man&#8217;s inhumanity and act as a reminder that Scotland&#8217;s strong and enduring commitment to human rights cannot be taken for granted. That places a responsibility on us as a nation to ensure that other countries develop and maintain a similar commitment.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s international work reflects Scotland&#8217;s enduring social democratic values. We also use our international engagement as an opportunity to help to increase respect for and understanding of human rights worldwide, not through arrogant lecturing but through mature, even-tempered discourse with our international partners.</p><p>We have on-going dialogue with states at ministerial and official level to raise human rights issues where appropriate in a diplomatic and culturally sensitive fashion. I mention that because, as John Lamont and others said, not everything is rosy. Things are improving in northern Iraq, but not everything is rosy and human rights abuses are still regularly flagged up. Developing relationships with these countries helps further to increase our understanding of shared world values.</p><p>I want to take a moment to reflect as others have done on Scotland and Kurdistan&#8217;s relationship, which Jim Eadie, John Lamont, Hanzala Malik and Bob Doris mentioned; they gave their own personal accounts of how that relationship has been built, whether through visits and inward delegations or through the fact that they have members of the Kurdish community in their constituencies and regions. Scotland and Kurdistan share many commonalities: both have a population of 5 million; oil, water and gas are our main natural resources; and, of course, we are both located north of a more populous neighbour.</p><p>The Scottish Government hosted two interns from the Kurdistan regional Government on a work placement in 2011 to help Kurdistan to develop its understanding of devolved government procedures. Ministers have also met representatives of the Kurdistan regional Government to explore areas in which our two countries can work together and where Scotland can share her expertise, for example in the fields of business, finance, education and engaging with the diaspora. I welcome that role, as others have done.</p><p>I welcome the contribution that the Kurdish diaspora and other populations make to Scottish society. For generations, Scotland has opened its doors to refugees, students, migrant workers and visitors from around the world, all of whom have contributed&#8212;through their ideas, skills and talents&#8212;to building our country&#8217;s future.</p><p>I often say that in Scotland we take the best from our migrant populations&#8212;from those new Scots; and I always say that cuisine is one of the things that benefits the most. From the Italian community we took spaghetti bolognese; from the Pakistani and Indian community we took chicken tikka masala; and it seems that Jim Eadie was perhaps suggesting that we took haggis from our Kurdish population, which might be a controversial thing to say. We take from the best and we have taken much from our Kurdish community.</p><p>Here in Scotland, we do not see ethnic, religious or cultural diversity as anything to be threatened by; rather, we see it as something to embrace as it contributes to making Scotland a safer, stronger and more inclusive society.</p><p>This debate is about remembering those who did no crime but were subjected to the worst punishment. In the modern day and age in which we live, it can be easy to become desensitised to violence and tragedy. However, the stories of the most profound human suffering cannot but affect us all.</p><p>I conclude the debate by assuring members that the Scottish Government recognises the immense suffering of the Kurdish people during that terrible period in history. On the substance of one element of the motion, I say that members will be aware that foreign affairs are, of course, a matter reserved to the UK Government. However, I am pleased that the Scottish Parliament is debating the motion, with consensus from across the parties, to say that it welcomes the 2005 Hague decision that formally recognised the 1988 attacks as genocide. This Parliament joins the UK, Norwegian and Swedish Parliament in doing so.</p><p>In a recent debate in the House of Commons, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister Alistair Burt said that genocide was not a term for the UK Government to decide upon but a legal decision to be taken in international fora. The UK Government&#8217;s current position is not sufficient, and it recognises that itself. I therefore commit the Scottish Government to working with my colleague Bob Doris and with leaders in the Scottish Kurdish community to impress on the UK Government the need to find a route to recognise the Anfal campaign appropriately and internationally, and the need for a more robust response.</p><p>There is no question in my mind and in the minds of decent people around the world but that the people of Iraqi Kurdistan were the victims of the most unspeakable crimes, perpetrated by a vicious and evil regime that had no hesitation in committing crimes against humanity and slaughtering the innocent simply because of their identity and language and their desire for freedom from fear and oppression.</p><p>The Anfal campaign is a stain on our collective conscience, and we must never allow it to happen again.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:40.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687810", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Kurdish Contribution to Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Bob Doris for lodging the motion and securing a debate that will promote greater understanding of the plight of Iraqi Kurds as well as highlighting and commemorating the terrible tragedies of Halabja and the Anfal campaign.

I thank Bob Doris&#8212;it is to his credit that he has brought this important debate to the chamber.</p><p>Members have made some fantastic contributions, which I will touch on. I was delighted to hear about Jim Hume&#8217;s great-great-great grandfather&#8217;s relation to the great man himself, David Livingstone. When I first found that out a couple of weeks ago, I said to Jim Hume that I was not surprised but delighted to hear that he was cut from such noble cloth. He reminded me quite correctly, as did James Kelly, that David Livingstone was the most humble of humble men, which makes his achievements all the more remarkable.</p><p>As we have been made aware through the various speeches, David Livingstone was one of our greatest explorers. As Alex Fergusson mentioned, he embodied a thirst for education, but he also embodied enterprise and a capacity for endurance. Almost every member referred to the fact that he was in Africa as a humanitarian. Alex Fergusson made the point well that he spoke against slavery at a time when it was not fashionable to do so. It is easier for me and other members across the chamber to stand up and speak against slavery but, in those days, doing so was not at all popular. In fact, David Livingstone spoke up decades before Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s emancipation proclamation, so he was a trailblazer of his time.</p><p>David Livingstone made a significant contribution to our understanding of the world. His legacy continues to this day with the strong relationship that we have spoken about between the people of Scotland and Malawi. In fact, the first debate that I had the honour of leading on in the chamber in my role as Minister for External Affairs and International Development, was on Malawi. Nearly every single speech touched on David Livingstone. Christina McKelvie&#8217;s speech today reminded me of her passionate speech in that debate. That passion was a result of her one visit to the David Livingstone centre. It is incredible to think of all the children who have passed through the centre. I hope that they will keep hold of that passion throughout their lives as the member has done.</p><p>On Sunday, we will be welcoming a delegation from the Republic of Malawi to Scotland to celebrate with us the birth of David Livingstone. The bicentenary celebrations are an opportunity to celebrate the many achievements of that great man that members have mentioned.</p><p>The Scottish Government is contributing almost &#163;450,000 towards ensuring a sustainable legacy from the celebrations. We are contributing &#163;150,000 to the National Trust for Scotland to support the David Livingstone centre in co-ordinating the Livingstone celebrations. In doing so, we are refocusing the nation&#8217;s attention on that important centre in Blantyre, which is not only David Livingstone&#8217;s birthplace but a focal point for understanding his legacy at home and abroad.</p><p>As an aside, Patricia Ferguson mentioned the story of David Livingstone being bitten on the arm by a lion. That is how he met Mary Moffat, the woman who nursed him and whom he would later marry. There is a statue of the lion attacking him at the centre. When I was looking at that statue, I remember thinking that there are definitely easier ways to get a woman&#8217;s attention. Nonetheless, endurance is important.</p><p>I recently announced an additional &#163;50,000 to the National Trust for Scotland to develop Livingstone 200 events in the course of 2013. The funding is opening up the bicentenary celebrations to more people, community groups and grass-roots organisations. I hope that it will introduce Dr Livingstone to new audiences and increase awareness of volunteering opportunities. I urge every member to pass on information about that fund to local groups in their constituencies. They can get that information by looking at the davidlivingstone200.org website.</p><p>We have also provided other pockets of money, including more than &#163;140,000 for National Museums Scotland to work with National Museums Malawi to provide content for the &#8220;Dr Livingstone, I presume?&#8221; exhibition, which I have had the pleasure of seeing. The funding will also assist in raising the profile and professional quality of museums services in Malawi by developing and implementing targeted skills development. That is important, because we want to try not just to help Malawi through our international development fund and through traditional aid but to increase tourism and increase the skills and knowledge sectors of Malawi.</p><p>In addition to those projects, the Scottish Government has provided &#163;100,000 towards a David Livingstone bicentenary scholarship. As Alex Fergusson quite rightly mentioned, David Livingstone was an educated man who understood that education was a route out of poverty. I am delighted that this scholarship programme will give young, gifted, underprivileged Malawian students&#8212;women in particular&#8212;the opportunity to study at a Malawian further or higher education institution in a range of subjects. It will be a life-changing opportunity for young people in Malawi, where educational attainment is among the lowest in the developing world.</p><p>Everybody has talked about David Livingstone&#8217;s legacy and it is important to continue that legacy. Patricia Ferguson made that point very well and very poignantly with regard to the diseases that affected David Livingstone and, unfortunately, also killed Mary Moffat. Those diseases are unfortunately still very much alive and prevalent today and, as Patricia Ferguson said, the best legacy is to try to eradicate them. That is absolutely right and that is a challenge that all of us need to face up to.</p><p>It is great to see that, 200 years on from the birth of this fantastic Scot, his legacy is being continued by none other than a young girl&#8212;I believe that she is 10 years old now&#8212;Martha Payne, who is using modern-day technology to capture the imagination of people and continue that legacy for the people of Malawi.</p><p>The Government looks forward to the programme of events during the visit of the Malawian delegation to celebrate the bicentenary of Dr David Livingstone&#8217;s birth, which has been put together by representatives of Scottish civic society. I thank them all for their efforts.</p><p>It is a testament to David Livingstone that his legacy retains such a power to motivate. I look forward to the celebrations ahead, as I think many of us do, and I wish those who are visiting Malawi on behalf of this Parliament every success. I hope that they take the best wishes of the Government with them as well as the best wishes of the Scottish Parliament. I thank Bob Doris for securing the debate and I wish the celebrations every success.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:53.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686494", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to make some closing remarks.

Like other members, I am grateful to Sarah Boyack for raising the issue. I recognise her commitment to international development, which, from reading her biography, I see extends outwith this chamber, as she had a passion for the subject even before she was elected to the Scottish Parliament. I am pleased that we are debating this issue.</p><p>Contributions across the chamber have been excellent. Jamie Hepburn, Alison Johnstone, Alex Fergusson, Alison McInnes, John Mason and John Scott all did the subject justice. I have only a short time in which to speak, so I might have to give some weighty issues a relatively cursory response, but I will try to address as many as possible of the issues that members raised.</p><p>I will start by reiterating the support of others in the chamber for the objectives of the if campaign and its focus on investment, land tax and transparency in support of development. The if campaign manifesto requests that a number of actions be undertaken by Scotland, and the Scottish Government will consider them with care. Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting some of the key spokespeople in the if campaign to discuss the manifesto, and I hope that we will make progress on those matters. Members will appreciate that it has been only a month since the launch of the manifesto. The discussions will be on-going, and we will keep members updated. However, I can give members an outline of what I see as the general direction of the response to the calls of the if campaign.</p><p>The launch last year of the climate justice fund&#8212;mentioned by a number of members, including Sarah Boyack, Alison McInnes and John Scott&#8212;by the First Minister and Mary Robinson, with a &#163;3 million contribution, was a significant innovation. The first of the projects associated with it was announced recently. I note the if campaign&#8217;s request for additional investment from the Scottish Government in the climate justice fund so that it matches the international development fund by 2016. That is a reassuring sign of the success of the climate justice fund. In the short term, we have announced our intention to host a major international climate justice conference in Scotland in October this year. Campaigners can rest assured that we are consistently thinking about how we can improve that internationally recognised, innovative fund.</p><p>On development education, members will know that enabling young people to develop into responsible global citizens is an integral part of the curriculum for excellence. That was mentioned by Jamie Hepburn in particular. I am more than happy to visit the school that he mentioned, should that invitation come. I am only sorry that he did not give us a rendition of the if campaign song.</p><p>We want our young people to have an understanding of Scotland&#8217;s place in the world and our ability to make informed ethical choices on matters that will affect them now and in the future. We recognise and value the contributions that are made to global learning by Scotland&#8217;s development education centres, be they in Alison McInnes&#8217;s region or any other part of Scotland. Therefore, we are pleased to have announced the co-financing arrangement, which followed the successful application to the European Commission. The funding will support valuable projects that raise awareness of issues, including poverty and its effects. More importantly, as Alison McInnes said, those projects will sow the seeds of humanity and compassion in our children.</p><p>It was clear, throughout a number of the speeches, that the forthcoming procurement bill is of great interest. It will play a central role in the if Scotland protects element of the campaign. As we know, existing public procurement legislation permits the exclusion of bidders who have been convicted of offences relating to bribery, corruption, fraud or non-payment of taxes.</p><p>The procurement bill will establish a legislative framework for substantial public procurement that supports Scotland&#8217;s economic growth. Among the areas that the bill will look at are public procurement processes that are transparent, streamlined and proportionate; taking account of social and environmental sustainability; and dealing with inappropriate conduct and poor-performing suppliers.</p><p>Meetings have already taken place on the specifics of the bill involving Scottish Government ministers, non-governmental organisations and officials. I know that, as the bill is developed, the issues will come to the fore. Guidance will be developed over the coming year to help public bodies comply with the requirements of the forthcoming bill. I am sure that members of the if campaign will take a keen interest in that.</p><p>My colleague John Swinney has said clearly that a planned consultation document on a future tax management bill will consider the issue of tax avoidance further and that the Scottish Government is committed to establishing a fair and transparent corporate tax system to attract genuine economic activity and retain it in Scotland, which will adopt rigorous institutional accounting.</p><p>A number of colleagues referred to the fact that this debate takes place during Fairtrade fortnight and a few days after Scotland achieved fair-trade nation status. However, as Alison Johnstone quite rightly said, this is not the end by any stretch of the imagination; it is simply the beginning.</p><p>The request that the Scottish Government monitor and improve its impact on global hunger and poverty is an important one. The Swedish approach to civil society reporting on Government will be discussed at a forthcoming NIDOS conference that I will attend, so I will be interested to hear about that.</p><p>The suggestion that Scotland use its history to inform current global debates on land tenure is innovative. I will attend an Oxfam event in Helmsdale on Monday, and I look forward to hearing more there about that element of the campaign. We recognise the crucial role that land reform plays in a country&#8217;s success by improving or preserving the relationship between land and people.</p><p>Looking at the wider national if campaign, a number of its asks are currently outwith the gift of the Scottish Government. I will refer quickly to just some points in that regard. The if campaign has requested that the UK Government meet its commitment to the 0.7 per cent gross national income target. I welcome the UK Government&#8217;s insistence that it will meet that target. It will be the first G8 country to do so, an achievement which is extraordinarily overdue. As we have said, should we have control over international development powers in the future, the Scottish Government would commit to the 0.7 per cent target and look towards achieving 1 per cent.</p><p>What is more important is that Scotland would look to develop clear policy coherence for development across Government, building on international best practice, and to ensure that our other policies do not harm the international development policy. With that in mind, I was particularly concerned by the Prime Minister&#8217;s recent proposal to use aid money on defence. I hope that he will reflect on that further and abandon the proposal.</p><p>By giving the issues that the if campaign highlights as much attention as possible and getting the Parliament to speak with a unified voice on them, we can do the issues a great service. I commend Sarah Boyack for bringing forward the debate. I will continue to keep members up to date about our progress on the if campaign manifesto, and I am pleased to close the debate on behalf of the Government.</p><p>13:18 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>On resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Enough Food for Everyone If Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a good debate.

The Scottish Government welcomes the Commission&#8217;s work programme for 2013 and its focus on helping to build a Europe that is based on sustainability, sustainable growth, responsibility, solidarity and&#8212;of course&#8212;stability. I echo members&#8217; thanks to the clerks and the rapporteurs of the various committees for their hard work and endeavours in putting together the priorities.</p><p>We support our European partners in their efforts, while we focus on the EU proposals that are of greatest importance to Scotland. The debate has highlighted the vast range of the EU&#8217;s work and, in the short time that they had, members did their committees justice as they went through various elements. Given its focus on energy and climate change, research and creativity, the marine environment and justice, the Scottish Government must ensure that its resources and influence are best deployed in those policy areas in order to promote Scottish interests and ensure that we get the best deal for Scotland from the EU&#8217;s policies and programmes.</p><p>The Scottish Government supports key European dossiers including proposals for reforming state aid, particularly environmental aid, and the crucial EU climate and energy framework. In what I thought was a very good and measured speech, David Stewart made the point very well in relation not just to the Highlands and Islands but nationwide, that the current economic crisis really underlines the need for strong state aid that contributes to economic growth. Aid measures must be well designed and demonstrate an incentive effect, and there is a strong case for interventions that incentivise the private sector to help to promote growth.</p><p>With regard to research and development and innovation, the Scottish Government very much agrees that guidelines should support the EU 2020 objectives in key areas. We are actively discussing those and other initiatives with stakeholders at home and partners in Brussels.</p><p>In her opening remarks, the cabinet secretary made it clear that the Scottish Government understands the case for reforming the EU as, in fact, do many of the committees that have reported. We are already contributing to the process of amending the CFP, would like more ambitious carbon emissions targets, and are supportive of more streamlined decision making and increased transparency. However, we believe that such reforms will best be achieved through dialogue with member states and, of course, within the EU itself.</p><p>That position stands in sharp contrast to that of some of our counterparts on these islands. We are clear that Scotland benefits from our relationship with and membership of the EU. Historically, Scotland has always grasped the importance of internationalism; after all, we have been sharing sovereignty in one form or another for quite some time now.</p><p>As I have said, we heard some excellent speeches, so I want to touch on one or two points that members raised. Mary Fee made an excellent speech about equality for the Roma community and the plight that it is facing across Europe. As she quite rightly pointed out, we are not without our challenges in Scotland, but I think that, having faced those difficult challenges, we have a good story to tell and some best practice to employ. However, Europe cannot choose simply to ignore this issue or to bury its head in the sand about it and I think that the Equal Opportunities Committee has been very brave&#8212;and very right&#8212;to highlight the issue as a priority for the EU.</p><p>The same issue was highlighted by Patricia Ferguson, who also mentioned development work and alluded to the ability to work with the European Development Commission to help certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa. I have met the Development Commission twice in Brussels to discuss how we can help Malawi, and I am happy to keep the member up to date about our work in that respect.</p><p>A common theme&#8212;highlighted by Aileen McLeod and Jamie McGrigor among others&#8212;has been that Scotland has a lot to give as well as a lot to learn from EU partners, particularly in health. We can point not only to the smoking ban and other smoking-cessation initiatives that we have put in place to deal with the impact of smoking on our nation&#8217;s health, but&#8212;I hope&#8212;to minimum alcohol unit pricing. Those points were very well made by colleagues and members.</p><p>The Scottish Government pursues Scotland&#8217;s interests in Brussels. We work closely with the UK Government to secure early engagement on key dossiers, to shape initiatives and to secure the best possible outcomes for Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684898", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Union Priorities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a very good and measured debate.

As Jim Eadie and John Finnie so eloquently pointed out, tragic events are happening in Palestine, Syria and even Egypt as the new Arab spring democracies face fundamental challenges in coming to grips with democracy. However, they make us realise that Scotland&#8217;s strong and enduring commitment to human rights cannot be taken for granted and places a responsibility on us as a nation to ensure that other countries develop and maintain a similar commitment.</p><p>I am pleased that we will accept the Labour amendment to the motion. Jenny Marra has quite rightly been vociferous&#8212;I might even say tenacious&#8212;on the issue of human trafficking, as Christina McKelvie and others from across the chamber have been. I look forward to the middle of the year when we will receive the report back and recommendations from the summit, to which one of my colleagues will no doubt respond on behalf of the Government.</p><p>There is worldwide recognition of Scotland&#8217;s commitment to democracy, the rule of law and fundamental human rights. Scotland uses its international engagement as an opportunity to help to increase respect for, and understanding of, human rights worldwide. We do that not through arrogant lecturing or condescension but through mature, even-tempered discourse with our international partners on how we can support their progress towards becoming states that respect and progressively realise human rights.</p><p>On that issue, Murdo Fraser asked me to address a couple of points. In our discussions with China, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs has personally mentioned Tibet to Chinese ministers. That is a sensitive issue, but it was handled sensitively. After discussions with Amnesty International and the Scottish Human Rights Commission, the First Minister has raised issues that are creeping up the global agenda, such as climate justice. In the recently drafted China plan&#8212;I do not know whether Murdo Fraser has a copy of it&#8212;one of the four guiding principles is respect for human rights and the rule of law. We are unashamed in our promotion of human rights where and when we can.</p><p>Murdo Fraser also said that Qatar, which the First Minister has visited, supports the Muslim Brotherhood and denies women&#8217;s rights and so on. I do not disagree that those are important issues, but does the member not know that the UK Government has signed an agreement with Qatar to make this a year of culture between the UK and Qatar? If his point is that we should not engage with unsavoury characters, has he no shame about the fact that a UK Prime Minister is selling arms to some of the world&#8217;s worst human rights abusers?</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683467", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Rights"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Earlier the minister Roseanna Cunningham quoted Eleanor Roosevelt; I will open my closing speech by quoting someone closer to home&#8212;Robert Burns, who once wrote: &#8220;Man&#8217;s inhumanity to Man Makes countless thousands mourn!&#8221; In 2013, man&#8217;s inhumanity can be witnessed every day all over the world.

On a practical level, that allows others to utilise our practical experience&#8212;whether that be effective policing, good civic governance, low-carbon economic development or better healthcare&#8212;to improve the lives of people overseas.</p><p>We are equally happy to open ourselves to international scrutiny, which I think we must do. In May, as part of the UK, Scotland was assessed positively by the UN on our realisation of international human rights standards. Indeed, the Scottish Human Rights Commission, which as we heard is accredited by the UN as an &#8220;A&#8221; status national human rights institution, spoke at that meeting. The commission, which was created by this Parliament, is hugely respected at an international level&#8212;a respect that was shown and shared by many members in the debate today.</p><p>Coincidentally, I note that members will vote later today on Professor Alan Miller&#8217;s renomination as chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission. I am not sure which way Professor Miller wants that vote to go, but we shall see the result soon enough.</p><p>The Scottish Human Rights Commission&#8217;s international stature certainly puts paid to the notion that Scotland is too small to make a difference. On the contrary, it is our duty to be good global citizens by joining the debates on such issues. David Stewart&#8217;s speech in particular made that point incredibly well.</p><p>At the international level, key actors seem increasingly to be drawing a distinction between the progressive, mature debate that is happening here in Scotland and the reaction that we often witness whenever human rights are discussed down south. As Annabel Goldie rightly pointed out, we need to do something to win the public over. Perhaps that will feed into the discourse on our action plan.</p><p>We want to have a different conversation here. Scotland has a good story to tell, whether that be about our history through the weavers&#8212;to which Margo MacDonald referred&#8212;or about modern-day times. We have much to learn from others, but we have much to teach as well. We will continue to urge states all over the world fully to realise international human rights law and to open themselves up to international scrutiny in the same way.</p><p>Just as we have sought to sought to engage in a positive fashion on international human rights issues, so the Scottish Government continues to try to make a direct practical difference on the ground to the lives of those in the most materially deprived communities in the world.</p><p>As members will know, we support projects in eight countries, including Malawi and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as countries in south Asia. Those projects make a real difference to the lives of some of the world&#8217;s most vulnerable people. For generations, Scots have reached out across the world to build economic, educational and cultural links with countries such as Malawi.</p><p>Today, human rights are increasingly focused on environmental issues, as climate change remains at the top of the international agenda. The Scottish Government has actively championed the cause of climate change, as Stewart Stevenson mentioned in a good speech. The issue would not be so high up in the Government&#8217;s programme if it was not for his efforts. As well as inventing the computer, the internet and everything else in the world, he can rightly lay claim to bringing the agenda to Scotland and the Scottish Parliament. It is early days, but we hope that that work will bear fruit and will contribute to improving some of the poorest communities internationally.</p><p>In Scotland and overseas, the Scottish people do things differently, not because we are elitist or exclusionist, but because we are trying to embed some of the international human rights obligations that are on us. We do that not merely because we can, but because we want to. We are a modern and responsible nation that is preparing to join the global community of nations as an equal member. The Scottish Government is committed to creating a Scotland that realises human rights and to ensuring that Scotland can play its part in creating a world where the human rights of all are protected, respected and realised.

All the members who spoke&#8212;Bruce Crawford, Anne McTaggart, Kenneth Gibson and Nanette Milne&#8212;made good speeches. The fundamental core that ran through their speeches is that leprosy is not a disease of the past, but is very much a 21st century problem that we must continue to tackle.</p><p>I congratulate Bruce Crawford on getting parliamentary time to debate this important issue. I reiterate his welcome to the Parliament to the staff of the Leprosy Mission Scotland, and I thank them for their incredibly hard work. I am, of course, very happy to support the motion on the work of the Leprosy Mission Scotland and to recognise the importance of world leprosy day in raising awareness of the condition.</p><p>At the invitation of the Leprosy Mission Scotland and Bruce Crawford, I had the great pleasure of visiting the Scotland versus poverty exhibition that the organisation hosted in Stirling. In the first few months of my new-ish ministerial role&#8212;I do not know whether I am allowed to say that it is new any more, because I have been in it for coming up to six months&#8212;I had the pleasure of meeting Linda Todd a number of times. She and her team are to be commended for the passion and determination that they display in helping some of the world&#8217;s poorest and most vulnerable people. I hope that she does not mind my saying that she is tenacious in taking the issue forward and ferocious in her determination to do her best for the Leprosy Mission Scotland.</p><p>Bruce Crawford referred to the Leprosy Mission Scotland project that is being funded by the Scottish Government. The generating income project in Chittagong has helped to improve the socioeconomic status of marginalised communities, especially those that have been affected by leprosy or disability. The project has created self-help groups and provided loans and training on income-generating activities. It has also raised awareness of leprosy in sessions targeted at local communities, their leaders and relevant members of the Government.</p><p>The project has had incredibly significant achievements. To date, it has formed 75 self-help groups involving 603 members, provided income-generating activity for more than 500 group members and training in agricultural methods, and promoted environmentally sustainable practices. The project has also granted small loans to 251 people, built 15 new houses in partnership with the community and held meetings with more than 4,000 participants to raise awareness of disability and human rights issues. Those are huge achievements. It is important to remember that behind those statistics are real people whose lives have been changed for the better by the project.</p><p>Projects of that size may not be able to single-handedly solve an enormous problem such as leprosy, but they have the ability to make a significant improvement for individuals and entire communities. We also have the opportunity to share the learning from such projects and to ensure that they are aligned to broader global efforts to eradicate leprosy. In that sense, the Leprosy Mission Scotland is well placed to influence international efforts in the field as it is part of the global development organisation, the Leprosy Mission.</p><p>The Leprosy Mission&#8217;s noteworthy holistic approach is worth looking at. By recognising that leprosy is a disease that stigmatises&#8212;that word was used by all the speakers in the debate&#8212;marginalises and impoverishes, the Leprosy Mission considers that the leprosy patient&#8217;s needs are holistic in the round, not only in relation to their medical needs, but in relation to support for vocational training, rehabilitation and counselling. Such measures help return dignity to a person who is suffering from leprosy. It is important to highlight the important role that non-governmental organisations play in civil society in relation to international development and that that holistic approach would not be adopted by anyone else if they were not there.</p><p>Organisations such as the Leprosy Mission Scotland pay a critical role in the fight for global justice. Such NGOs and civil society development agencies are important in a number of ways. Of course, NGOs can be a lot more fleet of foot than Government. Government can often find quick responses difficult, whereas NGOs can be quick to respond to the needs of citizens in partner countries. They often play a role as mediator or facilitator between excluded citizens and their states but, by helping specific individuals or communities, NGOs create bonds of trust and networks of co-operation that often transcend national boundaries.</p><p>When I visited the Scotland versus poverty exhibition in Stirling, I saw a number of people from the Leprosy Mission across the world who had come to Scotland&#8212;they were very brave to have done so, given that it was towards the end of the year. The fact that they came showed that the network of co-operation truly transcends national boundaries. I believe that it is critical that we support and bolster such links through our approach to international development, rather than try to work around them.</p><p>Civil society organisations and NGOs are important in other ways. Those who are motivated by compassion for others&#8212;who, of course, include people of faith&#8212;are often moved to consider why things are as they are. As has been mentioned in the debate, people ask why tropical diseases such as leprosy persist when they are curable and manageable. People&#8217;s motivation to search for the causes of such inequality leads to a lifetime of engagement in development issues and the fight against global injustice. I always say that once someone gets involved in such work, which is about helping others, they find that it is quite an infectious bug&#8212;it is extremely difficult to let go. The dedicated team at the Leprosy Mission Scotland have that quality in abundance.</p><p>I know that it has been said that there is still much work to be done, but there is cause for optimism, as leprosy can be cured and eradicated. Over the past 10 years, levels of prevalence have fallen by 75 per cent, thanks to the work of many organisations, including the Leprosy Mission. With ultimate success in sight, now is the time to redouble our efforts.</p><p>NGOs have a vital role to play, because they tell the world what kind of nation we aspire to be and what kind of country we are. The Leprosy Mission Scotland tells the world that Scotland is a compassionate and caring nation, and one that is ready to help the world&#8217;s most vulnerable people. I wish the organisation well in its endeavours, and I again thank Bruce Crawford for lodging the motion. The Scottish Government stands behind the continuing global efforts to eradicate leprosy, and we look forward to the day when we can consign world leprosy day to the past.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:37.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682419", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Leprosy Mission Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have the opportunity to close the debate.

It is an exciting time for the city and for Scotland more widely. In Glasgow&#8217;s east end, the Clyde Gateway urban regeneration company is using the games as a catalyst to attract new private investment. To date, it is estimated that &#163;24 million has been invested in remediating derelict land, creating industrial space and developing state-of-the-art offices, and there is a promise of much more to come.</p><p>In addition, the games are giving a direct boost to the economy. Businesses across Scotland continue to win games-related contracts&#8212;75 per cent of the contracts that have been awarded have been awarded to Scottish companies. The games are providing a legacy of tangible and sustainable benefits. Members across the chamber have mentioned the importance of the legacy to young people. Supporting jobs and providing pathways to employment for those who need them most are key legacy aspirations. The first element of our &#163;5 million legacy 2014 young persons fund is up and running and helping the next generation to secure employment.</p><p>I will rifle through some of the specific points that have been made during the debate. In a very good contribution&#8212;her tone was understanding and welcoming&#8212;Patricia Ferguson asked about enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of the budget. Nanette Milne, Alison Johnstone and James Kelly, among others, raised the same point. The current structure of parliamentary scrutiny works. The Public Audit Committee has looked at the security budget, but if the Parliament decides that it wishes to carry out further scrutiny, it has the ability to do so. Shona Robison wrote to the three relevant parliamentary committees and I am sure that they would be happy to discuss further how parliamentary scrutiny could be further enhanced, but that would be a matter for Parliament to decide.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson asked about the preparation of our athletes. That is an important issue. The extra &#163;1 million that has been put into preparing our elite athletes is vital, because the Olympics set the bar high. At a recent reception, I met individuals who are involved in Commonwealth Games Scotland. It is fair to say that they feel the pressure to bring medals home. The investment is extremely important.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson also asked whether the Commonwealth Games Federation has commented on the arrangements for the games. It has not done so yet, but the co-ordination commission identified security as a particular risk. We hope that the CGF will welcome the strengthened arrangements that have been announced today. If anyone of relevance is listening in the gallery, I can confirm that Patricia Ferguson is, as she said, a very friendly person. I thought that it was strange that straight after Patricia Ferguson announced that she wanted to be a volunteer, John Mason told us that he had a spare floor for any volunteer who needed somewhere to kip. It is great that there is cross-party working on that front.</p><p>John Mason&#8217;s speech was fantastic. He made some great points about the legacy of the games; the point that the legacy can start before the games have begun was a good one. I loved his three-point observation on the games village&#8212;it was almost like an episode of &#8220;Through the Keyhole&#8221;. On a serious note, what he said about energy saving and the extent to which that is being incorporated into the games infrastructure was something that I noticed when I went to the velodrome.</p><p>I applaud Jenny Marra&#8217;s rigorous and justified pursual of the issue of human trafficking; her role in doing so ever since she entered Parliament is recognised. It is important to note that intelligence on human trafficking forms part of the strategy to combat crime related to the games. There will be proactive policing, with our UK partners. The information from the London Olympics is important. Human trafficking was a potential issue for the London Olympics, but it has been reported that there was no significant increase in human trafficking during the games, although I recognise that there was a 35 per cent increase in referrals, as Jenny Marra said. We must take that into account. I will ensure that Jenny Marra is written to with an update on anti-human-trafficking awareness training for ambulance workers and firefighters.</p><p>Hanzala Malik made some great points on equality. In the meetings that I have had with Glasgow 2014, it has been very aware of the issues that he mentioned, such as halal food. On the potential for Ramadan to conflict with the games, I think that we might just miss it. Glasgow 2014 is very aware of the diversity issues that Bob Doris touched on, too.</p><p>Mr Malik often likes to embarrass outside of the Parliament by telling people that he has known me since I was in my nappies. I have known him as someone who fights doggedly and ferociously on Glasgow&#8217;s behalf. I salute his indefatigability in that respect. More generally, it is fair to say to him that the Scottish Government had a small role to play in bringing the games to Glasgow and Scotland.</p><p>Willie Coffey&#8217;s speech was fantastic and thoughtful. He was slightly misty eyed when he was recalling some of the previous games, which perhaps gives away his age, but his speech was an embodiment of how the games can leave a lasting memory in the nation&#8217;s heart.</p><p>Graeme Dey made a good point about local people being involved in the Queen&#8217;s baton rally as it makes its way across Scotland, which we should reflect on; Shona Robison will feed back on that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "From the excellent contributions that we have had from across the chamber, it is evident that there remains enormous good will and commitment to delivering in 2014 a fantastic spectacle that has a lasting and meaningful legacy.

She also made a good&#8212;and fair&#8212;point about the craft and other fairs that are taking place that could perhaps happen elsewhere in the local area. The minister met the convener of Edinburgh Leisure and it agreed to speak to sportscotland about how Edinburgh can capitalise and make a better sports strategy. Her points should be reflected on further.</p><p>In relation to Alison Johnstone&#8217;s point on sustainable travel, on 4 October 2012, the Minister for Transport and Veterans announced an additional &#163;6 million investment in cycling over two years, &#163;2.5 million of which will be invested in Glasgow as part of the Commonwealth games legacy for active travel. That will be matched by Glasgow City Council.</p><p>A substantial point mentioned by James Kelly and others was where the &#163;37.7 million of new funding will come from. It is important to stress that that will be from unallocated resources that are built into the 2014-15 budget. The point is that the budget&#8212;it is important to reiterate this&#8212;is unallocated. That will be subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament&#8212;of that there is no doubt. Opposition members, such as James Kelly, will have the right to scrutinise that, too.</p><p>Margo MacDonald and Stewart Stevenson were combined in their passion for orienteering. Orienteering is one of the activities that are delivered through active schools, which is creating almost 5 million opportunities for young people to be active, so there is opportunity there.</p><p>I will finish by talking about the cultural programme. Partners are working together to deliver a magnificent programme of cultural activity for Glasgow 2014. London set the bar high with its opening and closing ceremonies. At this stage, I cannot confirm or deny whether or not Her Majesty the Queen has been approached to hurl herself out of a helicopter with a parachute; nonetheless, there will be some twists and turns in the opening and closing ceremonies.</p><p>I have enjoyed the debate thoroughly and hearing members&#8217; passions for the games. We have made some real progress in 2012; we are in a good place. I recognise that today&#8217;s announcement on increasing the security budget will, of course, generate some concerns, but we have spelled out exactly why that is necessary.

I thank Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland for raising the issue consistently. Yesterday it was tweeting about the debate early doors and it was rightly excited in its anticipation.</p><p>Today we are drawing attention to the rights of migrant workers and their families and raising awareness of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1990. It is right that we should recognise this day, and I want to be clear that the fundamental rights of migrants and their families are incredibly important, not only to migrants themselves but to us all in Parliament. Marginalisation and exclusion from participation in society, and the denial of basic human rights to a family, can only have negative results. Helen Eadie made that point very well in her contribution.</p><p>If we put in place the right policies that reflect our country&#8217;s values and aspirations, and which are welcoming, fair, forward-looking and progressive, immigration can be a tremendously positive force as opposed to the somewhat negative, dirty word that it has become. Mark McDonald and others made that point very well during their contributions. Immigration can inject vibrancy and new ideas into our economy and culture, and it can encourage those who have come here to live and work to play a full and productive part in the society in which we all live.</p><p>Mark McDonald also made the point that immigration is about more than giving us an economic boost, important though that is. We gain so much culturally from immigration.</p><p>I am from Glasgow and many members here are from Edinburgh. Both cities have melas, which show the great fusion of the different cultures. We also have the cuisine. I have often commented that Scotland&#8217;s favourite dishes are chicken tikka masala and spaghetti bolognese, which come from two of the biggest immigrant communities that have come to Scotland during recent decades.</p><p>I am proud to be the son of immigrants to Scotland. My father was an economic migrant from Pakistan and my mother&#8217;s family had to flee Kenya after the uprising that made life very difficult for Asians in that part of the world. I am therefore very aware of the difficulties that migrant families can face, as well as the real opportunities that draw hard-working people to Scotland to live and work.</p><p>Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland plays an important part in ensuring that people know their rights by supporting migrant community organisations to work effectively and to support people whose lives are fundamentally affected when their rights are abused or ignored.</p><p>Some members of Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland are in the public gallery, including its director, Pat Elsmie. She has been a vocal champion for migrants&#8217; rights for years and&#8212;if she does not mind me saying this&#8212;although she is somewhat petite in stature, she does not pack a small punch at all when it comes to this issue. She often says what needs to be said, even if it is controversial.</p><p>I look forward to going to the reception later on and speaking at it. I commend Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland for the work that it does.</p><p>Sandra White made some really important points about the demographics of our population. Annabel Goldie reflected those points. At 5,295,000, our population is now the highest ever recorded. It has increased partly because there were more births than deaths but mainly because more people moved to Scotland than left.</p><p>Those statistics not only represent the fastest growth rate between two census years over the past century but demonstrate that hard work to grow Scotland&#8217;s population to support economic growth is paying off. However, Scotland still faces many challenges. In common with almost every mature economy, we have an ageing population, as other members mentioned. We have a large, established migrant community, and we welcome the contribution that new Scots make to our economy and society.</p><p>Our universities and colleges also benefit greatly from the thousands of foreign students who come here to study every year. Many of them will want to stay on and work in skilled professions when they graduate; some will have met their life partners here and want to get married; many more will return to their original countries with an impression of Scotland that will remain with them for the rest of their lives. I want that impression to be one of a forward-thinking country that is open to new ideas, is open to technology and embraces new people for the contributions that they can make to many aspects of society.</p><p>As members all know, immigration is reserved to Westminster and dealt with by the Home Office. The Scottish ministers want an immigration policy that reflects our Scottish values of openness, equality and fairness, which are at the core of the Government&#8217;s vision.</p><p>Sandra White asked what discussions we have with the UK Government. We have frequent discussions with it and I am happy to ensure that she is written to so that she can be updated on the latest of them. However, it must be said that we have incredibly little flexibility.</p><p>Annabel Goldie&#8217;s speech was good, but it had a glaring omission on UK policy. That was unfortunate, because UK policy does not take Scotland&#8217;s economic or social needs into consideration. It offers no flexibility or ability to reflect regional variation, such as in salaries, despite the Scottish Government&#8217;s pressing for those flexibilities. Regardless of where members sit on the constitutional debate, there has to be an understanding that Scotland needs flexibility.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680273", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Migrants&#8217; Rights Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christina McKelvie for proposing the motion on international migrants&#8217; rights day and, like the other members, I wish her a speedy recovery.

Like Mark McDonald, that brings me to the political point&#8212;although we are politicians so I suppose it should not be unexpected that we make such points. For me, that situation is why we need control over immigration, whether that be through independence or through the other means that some members may propose. However, such powers are not an end in themselves but a means to achieve our vision of a fair and inclusive nation that values the contribution that migrants can make and that gives them and their families the basic human right to family life, which Drew Smith alluded to.</p><p>I believe that independence will give Scotland the opportunity to make different decisions, to implement policies that are designed for our own needs, to speak with our own voice, to raise our own resources and to take responsibility for our own future. That future is currently up for debate and, by engaging with those who will be affected by our policies, we hope to develop new policies that are relevant, informed by evidence and true to our principles.

The debate has been a sobering one, in which we have had to face up to the reality&#8212;the reality that people will not find on the pages of the press or in tonight&#8217;s Edinburgh Evening News&#8212;that some of our asylum seekers, who are the most vulnerable people in Scotland, have to live through daily.</p><p>Patrick Harvie, Sandra White, Christina McKelvie, Linda Fabiani, Mary Fee and Jamie McGrigor all made excellent and powerful contributions about what destitution means for certain groups of people.</p><p>Scotland has always been a welcoming country, with a long and proud history of sheltering asylum seekers and refugees who flee persecution to find safety. I am very proud to be the son of immigrants. My father was an economic migrant; my mother, whose family had to flee Kenya for safety reasons after the African uprising that made, at that time, life for Asians in the region difficult, chose to come to Scotland.</p><p>Migrants have been coming to Scotland for centuries. It saddens me to hear, as I am sure it saddens all members in the chamber, the heartbreaking details of the situations&#8212;whether those of Mrs B, Adar or the individual to whom both Sandra White and Linda Fabiani referred&#8212;that some asylum seekers find themselves in, in modern 21st century Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Government continues to be appalled that in this day and age there are people who face destitution in our country. The Scotland that we aspire to live in would not force vulnerable individuals into hardship and deprivation. Scottish Governments&#8212;this Scottish Government in particular&#8212;have always been clear that asylum seekers should be welcomed, supported and integrated into our communities from day 1, and that they should have access to health and education services.</p><p>Communities across Scotland provide essential support and extend compassion to asylum seekers who face incredibly hard times. Those actions can often make a world of difference. In that vein, I want to record my thanks to the Scottish Refugee Council, Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland, the Refugee Survival Trust, Shakti Women&#8217;s Aid and all the other organisations that do an outstanding job in providing not just the basics that people need to live on, but a safe space for our country&#8217;s asylum seekers and refugees to thrive in and to become active members in many communities. It is amazing how asylum seekers can go into a community or school and energise it&#8212;people see the effect of that among members of such communities.</p><p>The Scottish Government would have liked to go further in our help for asylum seekers. For example, we are on record as noting our ambition that asylum seekers be able to work while awaiting decisions on their applications. It is ludicrous that people who come to this country after fleeing persecution cannot contribute. When we read the pages of certain right-wing newspapers that express outrage that asylum seekers are claiming X, Y or Z, those stories are not usually mired in truth. Such people want to contribute, but the UK Government denies them the opportunity to do that. Unfortunately, the present constitutional settlement does not allow us to take action on those issues.</p><p>Sandra White mentioned a couple of issues in particular. I undertake to send ministerial correspondence once again to the UKBA and ministers in the UK Government to highlight the issue that has irked many members in relation to representing their constituents to the UKBA. Time and again, this and previous Scottish Governments have hit their heads off the proverbial brick wall while attempting to reason with the UK Government and the UKBA on how they treat asylum seekers.</p><p>As a progressive global state, an independent Scotland would have the opportunity to give asylum seekers a place of safety, and would have the power to implement fair, sensible and humane policies on immigration.</p><p>Linda Fabiani mentioned the &#8220;Glasgow Girls&#8221; production. I had the pleasure of seeing the performance on the same day as her. I did not know that she would be there, but I ended up sitting right next to her. They let anybody into the theatre nowadays, I must say. It was a moving production, and I recommend that every member take the chance to see it. It was moving to hear the tribute that was paid to the work that she undertook, along with other members&#8212;some of whom are no longer members, including Bill Butler&#8212;to fight child detention, and to hear the words that she spoke in the chamber in 2005, which are still relevant to the debate. I agree with her whole-heartedly that, although the matter is reserved to Westminster, human dignity and fair treatment are not.</p><p>Mary Fee&#8217;s speech was powerful and relevant. We are aware of some of the unique barriers that prevent women who seek asylum&#8212;and who also suffer domestic abuse or other violent behaviour&#8212;from accessing support. They can include living in and adapting to a new culture, a lack of language skills, the rights that they have in the UK and the fear of hindering their asylum claim or, even, losing their children. Those obstacles are real, and Mary Fee gave a powerful account of them.</p><p>We are aware that asylum-seeking women are not explicitly referred to in the Scottish Government&#8217;s &#8220;Safer Lives: Changed Lives: A Shared Approach to Tackling Violence Against Women in Scotland&#8221; strategy. We will ensure that the needs of all women, including asylum-seeking women, are expressed in our strategic approach to tackling violence against women. We will also consider those issues as part of a review of the refugee integration strategy.</p><p>Patrick Harvie&#8217;s whole speech was excellent, but I will pick up on the point about the Azure card&#8212;the support that is given under section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999&#8212;which is one of the most dehumanising aspects of the system. Some asylum-seeker families cannot even use the card to buy children&#8217;s clothes because the products that they can buy are restricted. In 2011, my colleague Keith Brown, who was then the Minister for Housing and Transport, wrote to the Home Office asking how it could extend the scope of section 4 support. Unfortunately, he was rebuffed. We will keep pursuing that issue; we will keep doing the best that we possibly can.</p><p>I thank the organisations that passionately and tirelessly pursue the case for asylum seekers and refugees in Scotland. The services that they provide consist of more than simply a roof over asylum seekers&#8217; heads; they also offer protection and much-needed advice.</p><p>Regardless of what side of the constitutional debate members sit on, we are almost unanimously agreed that this Parliament would implement a more humane policy on asylum seekers and refugees. However, the fact that those powers do not rest with us does not mean that we do not take responsibility. If an asylum seeker is living on the streets of Scotland, that automatically becomes the responsibility of every councillor, MSP, MP and minister in Scotland. Even if all we can do is shout, we have a duty to ensure that we shout our very loudest.</p><p>However, many of us are tired of shouting. Scotland will soon have the chance to do things differently. I want to live in a Scotland where troops of officers can no longer hammer down doors at the peak of dawn and drag women and children out of their beds. I want to live in a country whose families are not locked up like criminals in detention centres, even if the Government tells us that those detention centres are &#8220;family friendly&#8221;. I want to live in a Scotland where the underlying principle of asylum is not suspicion, but compassion. That is why I hope that many others in Scotland will vote to take those powers and bring them to this Parliament in 2014.</p><p>13:15 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers (Destitution)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Linda Fabiani for raising this important issue.

The reason why Mr Harvie has not yet heard me respond to a debate is because this is my first response to a debate in a ministerial capacity. I hope that I will not disappoint him too much.</p><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, which quite rightly commends the work by Christian Aid and Church Action on Poverty on their tax justice campaign. I am sorry that I, too, missed the opportunity to go on to the tax justice bus as it toured around Scotland. As the popular phraseology goes, if we miss one bus, another three will come by. I therefore look forward to future visits by the tax justice bus to Scotland.</p><p>During last week&#8217;s debate on Scotland&#8217;s relationship with Malawi, which was my first debate in the chamber in my ministerial capacity, we heard about the importance of development projects to the world&#8217;s poorest countries. I am pleased that the Scottish Government has funded a number of Christian Aid projects in recent years, such as the empowerment for health and livelihoods project in Malawi and the inclusive economic development project in south Asia. However, the tax justice campaign clearly recognises that development is about more than just aid&#8212;Jim Eadie eloquently made this point in his contribution&#8212;and is about the rules of the financial system and the loopholes in them. Christian Aid and Church Action on Poverty should be commended for highlighting those issues and pursuing them over a number of years.</p><p>Colm Regan is the editor of &#8220;80:20 Development in an Unequal World&#8221;, which as soon as I got my ministerial position I was told I had to read. I must say that those who read the book find it a real eye-opener. In it, Colm Regan looks beyond tax avoidance to consider financial flows between the developed and the developing world in the round, pointing out the problems in the current rules of the game.</p><p>The United Nations secretary-general produced a report in July 2010 that revealed that, in 2009, developing countries provided net financial resources to the developed world of $513 billion. That figure included interest payments on third world debt, the cost of trade barriers, the cost of the brain drain and the cost of corruption and capital flight, to which we can add tax avoidance. However, the figure does not include the environmental costs associated with climate change. We know that climate change is caused by the actions of the developed countries, but it is those in the developing world who suffer the most from it.</p><p>It is easy to think simply about giving aid to the developing world and to ignore the money that flows straight back to the developed world in the form of debt repayments. We should therefore try to change the way in which we think about development work and frame it not as charity but as a contribution to global economic justice. We need to make a weighty contribution in that regard, because taxation is at the heart of global economic justice.</p><p>We have heard in this debate about the $160 billion&#8212;&#163;120 billion&#8212;that Christian Aid calculates is lost to developing countries through tax avoidance, which is one and a half times what is delivered in international aid. That calculation has been accepted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As Dave Thompson rightly said, imagine what developing countries could do with that $160 billion&#8212;imagine the progress that they could make towards the millennium development goals in health, education, energy and sanitation.</p><p>Christian Aid also highlights the other negative impacts of tax avoidance. We are seeing an increasing number of transactions by multinational companies taking place across borders, which makes tax avoidance easier for such companies than it is for a small or medium-sized enterprise in Malawi, for example. That leads to a situation where a tax-avoiding multinational has an advantage over a local company.</p><p>I am pleased that a survey that Christian Aid conducted found that people support action to reduce tax avoidance. Consumers should take a look at the tax habits in developing countries of the companies from which we buy goods and services.</p><p>The Scottish Government supports the Scottish Fair Trade Forum and fair trade products, as members will be aware.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676952", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Christian Aid Tax Justice Bus"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Neil Findlay on bringing this debate to the chamber.

The creation of my role as Minister for External Affairs and International Development confirms our determination to see that as a key priority for this Government and our determination to drive progress.</p><p>We know that it is the poorest people who are hit hardest at times of economic difficulties such as we face today. It is therefore more important than ever that we demonstrate our commitment to helping the world&#8217;s most vulnerable people. Unfortunately, there are from some quarters calls to roll back on our international aid obligations because of our economic circumstances. However, this Government believes that it is precisely in such times that we should continue to give to the world&#8217;s poorest&#8212;not abandon them at the first hint of difficulty. I am therefore pleased that the Scottish Government&#8212;I believe with the support of the whole Parliament&#8212;has not only resisted such calls but has increased our capacity in that important area.</p><p>We have demonstrated our commitment to development work and have secured a tripling of the baseline budget from &#163;3&#160;million in 2007-08 to &#163;9&#160;million in 2010-11. Despite budgetary pressures, we are committed to maintaining the fund at &#163;9&#160;million for the duration of the current spending review period. We made a commitment to spend at least &#163;3&#160;million per annum in Malawi. This year, more than &#163;5&#160;million has been allocated to Malawi, and that figure includes neither the soon to be announced climate justice fund projects in Malawi, nor the culture and heritage focused David Livingstone projects.</p><p>Among the most heartening aspects of our relationship with Malawi are the thousands of individual links that have been developed between ordinary Scots and the people in Malawi through churches, schools, hospitals and local authorities. I will talk about those links later on. I am amazed not only by how many people from all those sectors are involved, but at how far and wide the relationship stretches across the country. A couple of weeks into my new role, I had the great pleasure of meeting a delegation from the presbytery and schools in Thyolo, who have a link with the community of Westray in Orkney. The meeting was arranged by Liam McArthur MSP. I felt for the two young Malawian children, Pilirani and Alice, who probably thought that they were going to have a holiday in Scotland for a couple of weeks and would spend their time relaxing and seeing the sights. Instead, they spent much of their time in Westray school in Orkney. It is a lovely school, I am sure, but their visit was perhaps different from the holiday that they expected.</p><p>I am also taken aback by how many different types of people are involved in this great friendship with Malawi. Doctors, nurses, teachers and others throughout Scotland give of their time, money and expertise to work with the people of Malawi. I pay tribute to the role that is played by those individuals. Their work often goes unreported and unrecognised, but does a huge amount to build relationships between the peoples of our two nations.</p><p>The Scotland Malawi Partnership plays a vital role in helping to foster and develop those links, and I thank those who are involved in it for their hard work and dedication. Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment, which the Government is minded to accept, appropriately recognises that hard work. We recently gave our support for the Scotland Malawi Partnership&#8217;s sister organisation in Malawi, the Malawi Scotland Partnership, which will play a similar galvanising role in Malawian society, and marks the establishment of a more equal and balanced partnership between our two countries at the level of civic society, to match that which exists at the level of our Governments.</p><p>I recently announced the opening in 2013 of a small grants scheme. That scheme is intended to support exactly such long-term partnerships and relationships. I am also pleased to announce that, through Scottish Government funding, a substantial grant from the European Commission to raise in Scottish schools awareness of global issues will soon be awarded. That funding will support young people&#8217;s understanding&#8212;as part of the curriculum for excellence&#8212;of issues including poverty and the effects of climate change on the developing world.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s relationship with Malawi is different from any other partnership of its kind. It is not just about Government-to-Government engagement or about simply working through established non-governmental organisations&#8212;although we recognise the power of fantastic work that they do. The relationship is about people and communities. It is about the schools in our constituencies, the churches that&#8212;I hope&#8212;we go to every Sunday and many more people working together at grass-roots level to further develop the strong civic bond that exists between our two countries. We have developed a unique model that works to foster and enhance civic society&#8217;s links, and which recognises those links as being a key and unique strength that is to be built on.</p><p>Politicians often have a bad habit of taking all the credit for achievements for themselves. However, let that never be said of ministers in the Scottish Government. It is only right to record our thanks to the previous Scottish Administrations and to those who paved the way for our historic co-operation agreement with the Government of Malawi in 2005. In particular, it is important to record our thanks to Lord McConnell for his vision in forging the partnership with the Malawian Government. This Administration has built on the work of Lord McConnell and we are now collectively taking the relationship to the next stage.</p><p>Today, our partnership with the Malawian Government is stronger than ever. The Scottish Government&#8217;s Malawi development programme builds on the strengths of our unique relationship and provides a focused contribution in the areas that are set out in the co-operation agreement: health, education, sustainable economic development and civic society development and governance. Our approach remains one of supporting communities and organisations through an open and transparent process. We currently support in Malawi more than 40 projects that make a real difference to the lives of people in that country. I am pleased to announce that, today, I have opened the next Malawi programme funding round. I look forward to receiving applications for what will undoubtedly be some fantastically innovative projects.</p><p>The Malawi development programme is just one element of our engagement with Malawi. For example, we also recognise the new challenges in Malawi as a result of climate change. The injustice of climate change is, of course, that those who have done least to cause the problem are hardest hit by its impacts while, perversely, those who have done and contribute most will feel the effects least. The &#163;3&#160;million climate justice fund, which was launched earlier this year by the First Minister and Mary Robinson, is part of our commitment to taking responsibility and providing funding to help to mitigate the impact of climate change.</p><p>As members may be aware, Ban Ki-moon recently wrote to the First Minister seeking information on how Scotland could use its expertise in renewable energy to support the sustainable energy for all agenda. One way in which we are already doing that is through support of the University of Strathclyde&#8217;s Malawi renewable energy acceleration programme&#8212;MREAP&#8212;to the tune of &#163;1.7&#160;million.</p><p>At a meeting that was hosted by the MREAP team in Malawi last week, the Government of Malawi agreed that it will take the lead in development of a comprehensive renewable energy strategy for Malawi. That was welcomed by large donors around the table, including the UK Department for International Development, the United Nations development programme and Norwegian and Japanese development agencies. That is a tremendous step forward, and our work acted as a catalyst and was absolutely central to that progress.</p><p>Water is another area in which Scottish expertise can play a useful role in development work. Last week, the Government of Malawi indicated that it is keen to discuss Scottish Water and what support it might offer, particularly in training and mentoring of managers and in appropriate policy development on the future structure and form of regulation in Malawi, to achieve the best outcomes. That is an example of how the hydro nation concept can respond to the needs of our partners. The development of such institutional links is important and, along with civic society links, is perhaps where Scotland can add genuine value through long-term partnerships for institutional development.</p><p>2013 is a special year for our relationship with Malawi, as we mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Dr David Livingstone. From humble beginnings working in the cotton mills of Lanarkshire, he rose to become Scotland&#8217;s most famous explorer, missionary and humanitarian. His medical knowledge helped to save the lives of many people in Malawi, and he played a pivotal role in bringing an end to the east African slave trade. Today he is held in high regard, both in Malawi and in Scotland, and continues to be an example of the impact and change that one individual can make.</p><p>Plans are under way for next year&#8217;s celebrations. We have funded the National Trust for Scotland to co-ordinate much of that activity, which is focussed on the David Livingstone centre in Blantyre. We have funded National Museums of Scotland to work with its partner the Museums of Malawi, to develop the &#8220;Dr Livingstone, I presume&#8221; exhibition which will open in Scotland shortly, and in Malawi thereafter. We have also provided resource for Historic Scotland to carry out an initial visit and a scoping study for work to support the preservation of Malawi&#8217;s important built heritage, some of which is a shared Scottish and Malawian heritage.</p><p>I am very pleased to announce that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning presented Her Excellency President Banda with an invitation from the First Minister to join us in Scotland for the bicentenary celebrations. We look forward to her response and we hope to welcome her to Scotland.</p><p>It is an incredible testament to David Livingstone&#8217;s work that today, almost 200 years after his birth, his legacy is being continued by none other than a young nine-year-old girl, Martha Payne. If ever we were worried about the future of the historic friendship between our two countries, then let us cast aside those anxieties. The example of Martha gives us all assurances that the relationship is in very safe hands indeed.</p><p>We are all aware of the constitutional debate in which Scotland is engaged. At its core is the discussion about the kind of Scotland that we want in the future. My vision of Scotland is encapsulated in our international development work in Malawi. The relationship is born of our joint history&#8212;200 years old next year&#8212;but that legacy will be continued by our children. With a relatively modest budget, we are pushing ahead with some of the most ground-breaking sustainable energy projects that the international development community has seen, which continues the thread of innovation that has run throughout the history of our nation.</p><p>It fills me with great excitement to think about the change that we could make in alleviating poverty across the world if, in the future, we have an international development budget not of millions, but of hundreds of millions of pounds.</p><p>Since I took up my post, I have been asked by many people how I find the new role; I always say that it is an incredible honour to serve one&#8217;s country at the highest political level. I can imagine only that it is akin to the feeling that a footballer has when he is asked to play for his national team. Those who have seen my footballing prowess, or lack thereof&#8212;Mr McArthur is one of them&#8212;will know that this is the closest I will ever get to experiencing such a feeling. To be able to represent the Scottish Government and to serve in a post in which the potential to do so much good and to push forward Scotland&#8217;s agenda as a contributor to a fairer and more just world only makes me feel even luckier to be where I am today.</p><p>I hope that I have demonstrated that our partnership with Malawi is growing ever stronger at the level of civic society and Government, and that real prospects exist for further institutional links. The day after the US presidential election, it is only appropriate to quote one of that country&#8217;s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.&#8221;</p><p>Therefore, it is the duty of every one of us to be outraged that 75 per cent of Malawi&#8217;s population live on less than $1.25 a day. We also have a duty to be outraged that 40 per cent of the population live below the national poverty line; that maternal mortality remains high, with 10 women in Malawi dying in childbirth every day; and that 3&#160;million people have no access to clean drinking water.</p><p>In that vein, I look forward very much to working with everyone in Parliament as we progress the agenda and continue to strengthen the historic relationship that we have with our friends in Malawi.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that, as a good global citizen, Scotland is demonstrating its commitment to international development through the maintenance of the International Development Fund; notes that the Scottish Government&#8217;s international development policy and its engagement with Malawi draws on Scottish expertise, historically in relation to health and education, as well as in response to new challenges, notably climate change and renewable energy; recognises and welcomes the role of individuals and organisations across Scotland in supporting and developing Scotland&#8217;s special relationship with Malawi and the opportunity that the Livingstone bicentenary provides to celebrate that partnership, and further welcomes the next funding round for Malawi.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Relationship with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That was the second-easiest applause I have ever had in this chamber.

I welcome and say Sat Sri Akal to our delegation of activists from the Sikh community, who are&#8212;colourfully&#8212;in the public gallery.</p><p>Along with John Mason, John Finnie, Sandra White and Bill Kidd, I had the pleasure of addressing more than 200 members of the Sikh community who recently came to the Parliament to protest against India&#8217;s use of the death penalty. We promised to highlight the issue in the Parliament, and I thank John Mason for helping us to keep our word.</p><p>The fundamental issue is what kind of society and, ultimately, what kind of world we want to live in. I do not blame the victims or the families of victims of heinous crimes who wish to see the perpetrator face the harshest of punishment and, often, direct retribution for ending a life. I thank God that I have never found myself in such a situation, but I imagine that I, too, would struggle to feel anything other than the thirst for revenge if anything was ever done to a loved one of mine. However, our humanity is most often put to the test in difficult circumstances. At times it is easier to react with anger and emotion than it is to take a step back and think rationally about the wider implications of our actions.</p><p>India is the world&#8217;s largest democracy and its third largest economy; it is an emerging world superpower. It is therefore troubling that it is resorting to the use of the death penalty. I echo John Mason&#8217;s point that we in the west have no particular moral high ground. Many perceive double standards from countries such as the UK when we continually lecture eastern countries on human rights and the use of the death penalty in particular, but our leaders remain silent on that when they travel to the United States, where 33 states still have the death penalty and which is the only country in the G8 to have it.</p><p>I will make a couple of points about why the death penalty should be abolished in India. Wherever capital punishment is practised in the world, it is used disproportionately against the poorest in society and against minorities. In Pakistan, Christians are mostly on the receiving end; in Saudi Arabia, the market trader is infinitely more likely to face the death penalty than is one of the hundreds of Saudi princes for committing the same crime. The disproportionality in the use of the death penalty is stark.</p><p>The death penalty cannot be undone. By most accounts, the UK&#8217;s legal system is robust, but we often have miscarriages of justice&#8212;just think of the Guildford four or the Birmingham six. At worst, we restrict somebody&#8217;s liberty wrongly, which is of course still unacceptable. If a court overturns a decision, we can restore an individual&#8217;s freedom. However, we cannot bring people back from the dead. That is why the death penalty is such a dangerous punishment mechanism.</p><p>In March, Amnesty International published its annual report on the death penalty, which showed that only 21 of the 198 countries in the world carry out executions. That figure has dropped by more than a third in the past decade. If India&#8212;an emerging world superpower&#8212;abandoned its use of this cruel and inhumane punishment, that would send out an incredibly powerful message. India could then use economic leverage to softly persuade countries that rely on it for support to reconsider their positions on capital punishment.</p><p>I stand shoulder to shoulder with those who pursue human rights as vigorously and passionately as our Sikh community and our gurdwaras do in Glasgow. Perhaps Mahatma Gandhi put it best when he said that an eye for an eye will make the whole world go blind. I sincerely hope that the Indian Government sees with clear vision and makes the brave decision to abandon the death penalty.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669062", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Death Penalty in India"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank John Mason for securing the debate.

We need only hear the phrases &#8220;Oslo accord&#8221; or &#8220;Geneva convention&#8221; to realise how much of an impression we could make. Unfortunately, in the current union, Scotland is forced to carry the baggage of the United Kingdom, rather than become the beacon of peace that we aspire for her to be. If we go to the middle east, we see what deep scars Iraq has left us with. In the subcontinent, the mere mention of Afghanistan evokes a vitriolic response. We are also hardly flavour of the month in Europe, with a Prime Minister who is hell-bent on bowing to the pressure of a Eurosceptic back bench just to keep Boris away from number 10 for another few years. In contrast, Scotland is respected across the world. I look forward to the day when, as an independent country with the full range of foreign affairs powers, Scotland stands proudly with the eyes of the world upon us as world leader after world leader takes their turn to sign the Glasgow treaty or the Edinburgh accord to secure a safer and more stable future for generations to come.</p><p>The debate about Scotland&#8217;s future is also about the values that we wish to espouse as a nation. Scotland has always had an egalitarian thread interwoven with entrepreneurialism, innovation and enterprise as part of her fabric. The story of Ali Ahmed Aslam, who came to this country in the 1950s as an economic migrant from Pakistan, invented chicken tikka masala&#8212;our nation&#8217;s favourite dish&#8212;by adding a tin of Campbell&#8217;s tomato soup to a dry curry and then, because of that success, went on to become the proprietor of one of Glasgow&#8217;s most successful restaurants probably sums up all those values in one go.</p><p>Scotland has been on an incredible journey, particularly over the past 10 years, in which we have been treading a vastly different path from the rest of the UK. Whether with the previous Lib-Lab coalition&#8217;s introduction of free nursing and personal care or the current Scottish Government&#8217;s introduction of free education and action to keep the NHS public, we have managed to entrench social welfare and egalitarianism with the powers that we have. That is in complete contrast to the political landscape of the UK, where a two-tier NHS is being created, financial barriers to education are being erected, a social welfare system is being created that is leaving the disabled community living in fear, and our civil liberties are being steadily eroded.</p><p>The evident truth is that we do things differently here in Scotland. Think what we could achieve if we had control over our own economy, tax and welfare. Imagine how we could unleash in full that entrepreneurial thirst and egalitarian spirit. That is not to say that we are better than our neighbours.

That said, in the office block in Glasgow where my office is, the office of Action on Hearing Loss is a few floors above and the National Deaf Children&#8217;s Society&#8217;s office is on the floor below, so I have the feeling that if I had not spoken in the debate, I might&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;have had a few disgruntled knocks on my door.</p><p>In her motion, Jenny Marra commends those hard-working organisations for supporting Scotland&#8217;s deaf and hearing-impaired community. One of the first video blogs that I did for my website was with the director of Action on Hearing Loss, Delia Henry, who I think is in the gallery. I did it during the festive period at the end of last year, in the midst of the centenary celebrations that Fiona McLeod mentioned. I did a bit better than Fiona McLeod did in that I sampled no fewer than four centenary celebration cakes. It is a tough job.</p><p>The point that Delia Henry made is that isolation is one of the biggest problems that members of our deaf communities suffer. What must it feel like to go to a Christmas party, a house-warming or a work night out, and see everyone engaged in copious amounts of banter and yet be simply unable to take part because of the background noise? The idea of having to spend a night in a corner of the room nursing a drink by themselves will put off many deaf people from going out with friends, family and colleagues. We all know too well the dangers that isolation can bring, but sometimes we overcomplicate matters. Not everything requires a strategy or a grand master plan as a solution. Sometimes just taking the time to talk to someone in that situation can do the world of good.</p><p>Jenny Marra&#8217;s motion also touches on some of the many barriers that our deaf community faces, but we need only scratch the surface to imagine how many additional barriers many deaf and hearing-impaired people from our black and minority ethnic communities face. However, it is heartening that more and more organisations are tackling that issue. I first had the pleasure of visiting NDCS&#8217;s BME families project back in 2007. Right from the offset, it amazed me what a difference it made to people just to have the opportunity to sit with other families who were going through a similar experience over a samosa and a cup of tea.</p><p>The isolation that is experienced by many BME deaf community members involves not only external factors and the lack of access to services, but a lot of internal cultural factors. Going to the mosque, the gurdwara or the Hindu temple plays a big part in the lives of Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus across the country. It is a matter of great shame that so many of those institutions are so ill-equipped to meet the religious and spiritual needs of their deaf members, so that is something that I want to do a lot more work on.</p><p>There is a lot that politicians can do to ensure that we are including people in the deaf community in the political process. I have had the pleasure of holding advice surgeries specifically for the deaf community. They have been well received; I imagine that many members have held similar events. However, I wonder whether political parties do enough in that respect? How many of us went out of our way to reach out to the deaf and the hard of hearing to find potential candidates for the recent local government elections? When we devise party broadcasts, do we make them in a format that is accessible to the deaf community? What about the upcoming referendum campaign, which is quite rightly being described as an incredibly historic moment? We have to ensure that all communities have their voices heard, on all sides of the debate.</p><p>There is much food for thought. Once again, I thank Jenny Marra for securing the debate. I hope that organisations such as Action on Hearing Loss have another hundred years of success.

I appreciate that the next member to speak might well disturb that consensus, but the fact is that, as we have heard, reform of Scotland&#8217;s police and fire service is necessary to allow the Government to keep its commitment to maintaining front-line services and to remove much of the duplication that exists across the eight services.</p><p>The committee has benefited greatly from the expert knowledge and excellent contributions of two former police officers, John Finnie and Graeme Pearson. Much to the disappointment of some committee members, we still have to recruit a former fireman to the committee but perhaps that situation will change in time.</p><p>Members: You mean firefighter!</p><p>Indeed. It is the 21st century and, as members have reminded me, I mean &#8220;firefighter&#8221; not &#8220;fireman&#8221;.</p><p>A number of issues have been highlighted that need to be discussed in relation to such a big change in one of our front-line services. The issue of timescales came up often. Although most witnesses said that the 1 April deadline might be challenging, the vast majority stressed the importance of appointing the chief constable and chief fire officer sooner rather than later. That will no doubt help the considerable changes to take root by providing clear leadership. However, the Government has a challenge in making the appointment when the police authority has not yet been created. I am keen to hear from the cabinet secretary or the minister how they intend to do that. In the meantime, I welcome the Government&#8217;s confirmation that it will bring forward the recruitment process.</p><p>My colleagues have talked about the importance of the single police force being accountable and transparent to the public, so I will not spend too much time on the topic. However, I will touch on the evidence to the Justice Committee of Sir Hugh Orde, a former chief constable of the PSNI, who spoke about how the police board in Northern Ireland held him to account publicly at at least 10 meetings a year. Those meetings were televised and Sir Hugh was available for interview afterwards. That transparency proved successful, so it is important that we consider including that element in Scotland.</p><p>As has been said, the bill gives the Parliament the opportunity to have a formal role in scrutinising the police and fire services. In written evidence to the committee, the Auditor General for Scotland said:</p><p>&#8220;it is ... essential that the legislation establishes a formal mechanism to give the Scottish Parliament, as the democratic forum covering the whole of Scotland, a major role in ensuring there is open, participative and transparent oversight of policing in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>I agree that the Scottish Parliament is the ideal body to provide such scrutiny. The democratically elected representatives of the public have the mandate to ensure that there continues to be policing by consent, which is a tradition and a fundamental value that must be maintained in relation to our police service.</p><p>The committee has had somewhat tentative discussions on how that parliamentary scrutiny should take shape, which we mention in the stage 1 report. Should there be a stand-alone committee or a commission, or should the role be part of the Justice Committee&#8217;s remit? I imagine that that theme will play a central role in the discussions as we move towards the next stages of the bill. It is fair to say that members of the committee are split on the issue, although most of us are open-minded. Graeme Pearson articulated well the case for a parliamentary commission. Although I am keen to explore that further, my first instinct is that it might involve further bureaucracy and resource at a time when we can ill afford either.

I thought that the report itself was very constructive and contained some very practical suggestions on how we might move forward and ensure that all our local authorities achieve the 100 per cent target. Of course, the problem with being the last member to speak in the open debate is that all my best lines have been stolen. Nevertheless, I want to focus on what I think are the most vulnerable groups to be threatened with homelessness in our society.</p><p>On Saturday, I attended a demonstration to oppose the real threat of homelessness that is faced by up to 100 asylum seekers in Glasgow. Although those people&#8217;s appeals for asylum have been rejected, the UK Government is unable to send them back to their countries of origin because they have been deemed unsafe conflict zones. Under that policy, individuals who have had their application rejected lose their right to accommodation and any other support after 21 days, and those asylum seekers now face the very real threat of homelessness and destitution. However, such an option is still preferable to returning to their home countries, where they might face persecution or conflict.</p><p>Ypeople, the current accommodation provider for asylum seekers in Glasgow, has allowed these individuals to stay in their properties for longer than the prescribed 21 days; however, it recently lost its contract to a private company and, as I have said, the asylum seekers are now facing real destitution. Some of them have even been served with notice of eviction. As many of them come from oppressive regimes such as Iran, Iraq, Somalia and Eritrea, it would be a complete injustice to return them to those unsettled conflict zones. With no recourse to public funds&#8212;a horrible phrase that is straight out of a Dickens novel&#8212;and no ability to return to their home countries, they are caught in complete limbo and undoubtedly face homelessness. It makes a mockery of any target that we have put in place. Instead of punishing such individuals, we should be providing help and support to protect those who are most at risk of homelessness and real poverty.</p><p>Continuing the theme of those who are most at risk of homelessness, I recently met in Glasgow representatives of the Wise Group&#8212;an organisation known to many in the chamber&#8212;who told me about its routes out of prison project with ex-offenders. We need to remember that ex-offenders might have done the crime, but they have also done the time and should be treated no differently from anyone else who is looking for a roof over their head. I was told that these individuals are often released on a Friday and therefore cannot secure a bed in a hostel; they are forced on to the streets for three nights over the weekend; and those who get into the habit of sleeping rough do not find any settled accommodation thereafter.</p><p>I heard real-life case studies of housing associations that did not have the capacity to offer accommodation to ex-offenders advising them to go to a police station and ask for a cell to sleep in. It is quite unbelievable. One man even stole a carpet from a police station entrance so that he could be arrested and spend the night off the streets. Unfortunately such stories are all too common. The homelessness of ex-offenders is very much a matter of concern, because it traps people further in the cycle of reoffending and does nothing at all for our society.</p><p>One motto familiar to all of us&#8212;it has been mentioned many times in the chamber&#8212;is that a nation&#8217;s greatness is measured not by its military might or by its economic strength, but by how it chooses to treat the most vulnerable in our society. The test for us all and for Scotland is to strive to be the greatest nation that we can be. We are making significant steps in the right direction, but much more can and must be done.</p><p>That said, I thought that the report was excellent and very constructive and I thank the committee members and the clerks for producing it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665539", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, echo the committee&#8217;s praise of the progress that Scotland&#8217;s local authorities are making towards meeting the 2012 commitment.

However, luckily, my wife studied law, which was very helpful to me. I have sympathy for Alison McInnes and for Colin Keir&#8212;who has disappeared from the chamber&#8212;who do not have such backgrounds either, but displayed a good grasp of the issues at hand. Perhaps they, too, chose their respective partners very well. I notice that there is no intervention, so I will assume that that is correct.</p><p>As we have heard, the bill has two main parts, each of which covers a different aspect of criminal case law. I will speak mainly about part 2, but will briefly touch on part 1, if I may.</p><p>People want and need confidence in our justice system. If that confidence is to be maintained, people&#8212;the victims of crime in particular&#8212;must understand at least the rationale behind offenders&#8217; sentences. There is a much wider issue to be discussed to do with automatic early release, which the Scottish Government is committed to ending&#8212;alas, Mr McLetchie has had his moment.</p><p>It has been mentioned that it is extremely important that there is consistency in sentencing and that it is understood not only by the legal profession, but by the victims of crime. Part 1 was introduced to fix the anomaly that was highlighted by the Petch and Foye case. The majority of those who gave evidence commented on how complicated the legislation is, but it was also acknowledged that sentencing as a whole is a pretty complex business. The difficulty of understanding the task should not be a big enough factor alone to deter us from fixing an inconsistency in the system; after all, that is part of the job that we are mandated to do.</p><p>I accept that there is a difficult balance to strike. We must ensure that people understand sentencing procedure, but sentencing is inherently difficult. It is not a matter of simply having a prescriptive list of sentences to match specific crimes. As the Justice Committee report acknowledges, we must also look at putting in place measures to ensure that victims and witnesses fully understand the sentences that are handed down by the courts and how they apply in practice. Mr Pearson&#8217;s idea of an aide-m&#233;moire is worthy of further consideration.</p><p>I turn to part 2. Although the bill was introduced specifically in response to the case of al-Megrahi and his abandoned appeal, it can be applied to similar cases that might arise, as John Finnie said. Therefore, it is not completely without purpose, but to pretend that it was not fundamentally driven by the unusual circumstances surrounding that particular case would, of course, be foolish. Many members are much better versed in the intricacies and complexities of that case, but it is abundantly clear to all that serious questions remain over that tragedy. Primarily, we owe answers to the families of the victims who were killed in the Lockerbie tragedy, but the reputation of the Scottish legal system has a question mark&#8212;some may even say a stain&#8212;on it that will not be washed away until some serious questions are answered.</p><p>It seems to me that the Scottish Government is doing what it can to be as transparent as possible and to move the process forward. Now that the statement of reasons is in the public domain&#8212;I cannot confess to having read all 821 pages of it&#8212;we must ask: what now? Many of us wonder whether the truth will ever fully be revealed. Surely the only way to bring further clarity would be through an appeal. It was reassuring to hear the cabinet secretary say recently that the appropriate measures are in place for the family of al-Megrahi to pursue an appeal posthumously. It will, of course, be for them to determine whether to do so, but I hope that that opportunity is taken for the sake of the victims&#8217; families if nothing else.</p><p>The whole tragic event has been mired in controversy and secrets, deals in the desert, and kissing dictators in Bedouin tents.

The sacrifice of Tunisia&#8217;s Mohammed Bouazizi will never be forgotten and the price of freedom is a permanent debt that will be owed to that brave man by generations to come.</p><p>Although Tunisia has moved on in leaps and bounds since the protests began, the violence in Syria has been going on for more than a year, as Jim Eadie mentioned, and the UN estimates that more than 9,000 people have been killed by Assad&#8217;s forces. In particular, the bombardment of Homs, about which I expect we will hear a lot more during the debate, was a massacre of men, women and children in the full glare of the media spotlight. With such audacious brutality, it is clear that there cannot be a peaceful transition to democracy while Assad and his regime remain in charge. He should do the honourable thing&#8212;I have called for this many times&#8212;and step aside instead of continuing to inflict violence on his own people.</p><p>I would like to concentrate on what we can do in Scotland to play our part in helping those who are suffering as a result of the brutal regime&#8217;s actions. Although we are limited in relation to foreign affairs, we must do what we can as a Parliament and as a Government and use the powers that we have to help those innocent civilians who are caught up in such a hellish situation.</p><p>Scotland has always been quick to show her compassion and her willingness to help those who have been affected by disasters, be they man made or otherwise. Scottish hospitals recently provided individuals who were injured in the Libyan conflict with new prosthetic limbs, which demonstrates how our medical expertise can help citizens of other countries. Previously, we opened our hospitals to help those who were injured in the Israeli assault of Gaza in 2009. In the case of Syria, the refugee camps in neighbouring countries are overflowing and the Assad regime is making outside access difficult, but if there is any possibility of opening up our hospitals and using our medical expertise to help to treat the injured, I hope that that will be done.</p><p>At home, I have met a number of Syrian students who are registered at Scottish universities and heard at first hand the difficulties that they have faced since the outbreak of the violence in their home country. Some students have been deregistered from university and confronted with a somewhat unsympathetic stance by academic staff. Others are struggling because the Syrian Government has stopped their scholarship funding, throwing their educational future into uncertainty. I urge the Scottish Government to look into how best it can support those students, as it did previously with students from Libya.</p><p>What we see unfolding in Syria is the result of a geopolitical power struggle, largely between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which seem intent on carving up the middle east for their own self-interests. As the violence continues in Syria, we have to ask ourselves where the Arab League is in all of this. The peace road map that it proposed in November was treated with disdain by Assad and his regime. The Arab League has been relegated to the sidelines and ridiculed for its inability to get to the heart of the conflict. The Arab League countries, many of which have escaped almost unscathed from the recession, have accumulated gross domestic products that run into a surplus of hundreds of billions, yet their inability to act is making them look more and more impotent as the days go by.</p><p>I welcome the announcement yesterday that the Syrian Government has agreed to accept the peace plan that has been put forward. However, as was mentioned, implementation is key, so we await it with bated breath. An end to the violence and bloodshed in Syria can truly come about only through regime change.

A key theme of that meeting centred on the famous saying that a nation&#8217;s greatness is measured not by the strength of its economy or military might but by how it treats the most vulnerable in its society. All members will sign up to such a sentiment and many of us will agree that children with disabilities or learning difficulties certainly fall into that category.</p><p>Gadburn school is located in the north-east of Glasgow. It does an excellent job of educating some of the most vulnerable young people in our city. However, the parents and&#8212;more important&#8212;the children of Gadburn now face an uncertain future due to a process that has, largely, treated them as an afterthought.</p><p>I thank members from across the Parliament for their support for the motion. The fact that it has received support from members of the Labour Party, whose colleagues in Glasgow City Council took the decision to close Gadburn school, shows that there is a common desire to secure the best outcome for the children of Gadburn and to meet their educational needs. For that, I give them thanks.</p><p>From the outset, it is important to note that the parents of children at Gadburn are not opposed to integration or mainstreaming as such, but they believe that the children must be placed at the centre of any such decision. The fear that is continually expressed by the parents is that Glasgow City Council&#8217;s decision to relocate Gadburn has been taken for financial reasons and is not in the best educational interests of the children.</p><p>A survey of the parents of children at Gadburn showed some very worrying statistics. It found that more than a third of the children reported having being bullied&#8212;that included being spat or urinated on&#8212;more than 45 per cent of them had been removed from mainstream school because the system could not cope, and almost 10 per cent had been assaulted, some physically and some sexually. The additional support and educational facilities that Gadburn provides are essential for those young people. Parents of Gadburn pupils say that the education that is provided at the school is working and is producing positive results for their children, and they are undoubtedly best placed to understand their children&#8217;s educational needs.</p><p>The process of consultation and the way in which the council has dealt with Gadburn school have been mired in controversy and full of sleights of hand and rushed agenda items that have suddenly appeared on or disappeared off committee minutes. It is for that reason that I join local councillors in asking the cabinet secretary, unequivocally, to call in the council&#8217;s decision and save Gadburn school.</p><p>It is a telling sign that, months before what will be a hotly contested local election in Scotland&#8217;s largest authority, local councillors of all parties, led by the Scottish National Party&#8217;s Grant Thoms, have joined together to oppose the ruling administration&#8217;s decision to shut Gadburn school.</p><p>The executive committee of Glasgow City Council first considered the closure of Gadburn school at its meeting on 9 December 2010. That triggered a statutory consultation on the closure of the school in January 2011, which ended on 4 March of last year. In the intervening period, parents of pupils at Gadburn, along with parents of pupils at Barmulloch primary&#8212;where the council hoped to relocate the special needs pupils&#8212;local councillors and council officials had a number of discussions on the way ahead.</p><p>The original plan was that the consultation responses and the recommendation to close Gadburn were to be presented to the executive committee on 23 June, but the agenda item was removed at short notice&#8212;no explanation was given, even to elected members.</p><p>From October to late November, local councillors gained the confidence of the Gadburn parent council on agreeing a compromise solution to prevent the closure of Gadburn school and, instead, to relocate it within Barmulloch primary as a stand-alone school. The intention was to work towards the integration of the two schools over a longer period&#8212;three to four years, say. In addition, parents were told time and again by council officials that there was no rush to make a decision on Gadburn.</p><p>Therefore, it came as a shock to everyone when a report recommending the closure of Gadburn was presented at the council&#8217;s executive committee in December last year. The administration rejected calls for local councillors to be able to complete discussions and reach a consensus whereby Gadburn school could be relocated within the buildings of Barmulloch primary but remain a separate school. At the time, the administration stated that some of the councillors in the ward did not agree with the continuation of discussions, but after consultation with all the councillors for the ward, it was clear that no such indication had been given, and the decision to close Gadburn school was called in to the council.</p><p>When the call-in was heard on 12 January of this year, it was decided that if, and only if, discussions could not resolve the matter, consideration would be given to having Gadburn as a separate school within Barmulloch primary. However, when the executive committee reconsidered the matter a few days later, it inexplicably reaffirmed its decision to close Gadburn school. Even now, the parents of pupils at Gadburn do not know where their children will be&#8212;whether in a separate classroom, a Portakabin or elsewhere&#8212;when the new term starts. So much uncertainty is clearly the last thing that they need.</p><p>I put on record my admiration for the parents of children at Gadburn school for their tireless campaign. It has been a tough and constant slog having to fight against the machinery of Glasgow City Council&#8212;at times, getting answers from the Kremlin would be more likely.</p><p>I would not want to get on the wrong side of two of the parents, Isabel Kelly and Sandra Martin&#8212;I am told that she is no relation of Paul Martin MSP. They have been passionate and driven&#8212;as any parent would be&#8212;in trying to secure the best future for their children.</p><p>Members who are in the chamber agree that the process has been flawed. It seems that parents and children have been an afterthought in Glasgow City Council&#8217;s rush to cut the finances and balance the books. I urge the cabinet secretary to call in the decision and give hope to those who are fighting for the most vulnerable in our community.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662535", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gadburn School"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to hold my first members&#8217; business debate since being elected to the Scottish Parliament on such an important issue.

To my surprise, there was barely a fag paper between us, as the saying goes.</p><p>All of us would, of course, express our concern should any of the stations that are mentioned in the fact sheet that accompanies the rail 2014 consultation close but, from the outset, the minister has been robust and unequivocal about the fact that there are no plans to close any stations in Glasgow or anywhere else in Scotland. I do not fault colleagues for asking the Scottish Government for reassurances about rail stations or local amenities that they fear for&#8212;that is part of the job that we are elected to do. However, as Alex Johnstone said, with an elected position comes a responsibility not to peddle fear and not to scare communities into believing that there is a threat to local services when one does not exist.</p><p>All of us in the chamber&#8212;including Opposition members&#8212;know fine well that no station in Glasgow is truly under threat. We know that the stations that were mentioned were simply on the fact sheet in response to a stakeholder question, whose context James Dornan laid out.</p><p>Although they are dwindling in number, some former ministers remain on the Labour benches, and they must remember&#8212;although perhaps they choose to forget&#8212;how consultations work. Are they seriously suggesting that they would not have bothered to answer the question had it come before them?</p><p>As they have offered such vociferous and robust debate, I am sure that all the Labour MSPs who have spoken today have made submissions to the rail 2014 consultation. It will be interesting to read whether they present a vision for Scotland&#8217;s rail network. My own submission to the consultation stated that it is vital for our local communities to be connected to public transport hubs and railway stations&#8212;especially as increasing numbers of people rely on public transport. The Scottish Government&#8217;s transport policies have helped to shift people from their cars on to our railways. Of course more can and should be done, but we are heading in the right direction.</p><p>The consultation is an opportunity to develop a vision of the kind of rail network that we want for our communities. Like John Mason, I have suggested that additional stations could be built in areas where housing developments are expanding. I will continue to work with local councillors, other MSPs and the Scottish Government to help to push the case for a new rail station in the Robroyston area in the north-east of Glasgow, and anywhere else where provision might be needed.</p><p>As James Dornan highlighted perfectly, none of us is oblivious to the context within which the debate is raging: we are less than 10 weeks away from local elections. All eyes are on Glasgow. The Labour Party&#8217;s domination of the city is being challenged, its iron grip is being loosened, and it is trying every tactic in the handbook to hold on desperately to its last bastion of power.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, a councillor&#8212;a friend of many of those on the Labour benches&#8212;was in tears, claiming that her son&#8217;s apprenticeship had been threatened for a vote for the ruling Labour administration. Serious allegations have been made. That is no way to run a city.</p><p>The people of Glasgow are entitled to an honest debate over the next 10 weeks about local issues, including railway stations. They are entitled to an honest debate&#8212;not bluff, not bluster, not smoke and mirrors, and not being scaremongered into a vote.

His work with the Jewish community, in particular, throughout his time in the Scottish Parliament, does him great credit.</p><p>History teaches us many lessons and it is our duty not only to learn them but to promise never again to make those mistakes. Something that is perhaps lost on us when we reflect on the Holocaust is that it was not just a horrific moment in our history, an overnight occurrence or even something that built up over just a few years but the culmination of centuries of anti-Semitism and hatred throughout Europe. Jews were accused of crimes that they did not commit. Lies and myths were spread about their practices and rituals. They suffered systemic discrimination and abuse, and the end result of all that was the massacre of an entire people.</p><p>We can see that an increasingly worrying wave of Islamophobia is spreading across Europe when we consider the banning of headscarves in France, the prohibition on minarets in Switzerland and the continual peddling of the myth of the Islamisation of Europe. We recently saw the danger of propagating such myths; we need only cast our minds back to the terrifying actions of Norway&#8217;s Anders Breivik.</p><p>If the tragedy of the Holocaust has taught us anything, it is that we must remain alert to injustice against our minorities. As Dr Martin Luther King famously said,</p><p>&#8220;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&#8221;</p><p>Like other members, I commend the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust for all the work that it does. Many of us have been moved to tears when we have heard the tragic stories of the women, children, elderly and disabled people who suffered a fate that was worth than death.</p><p>Among the stories of tragedy are also stories of great human endeavour. There are stories of not just the bravery of survivors but the incredible courage and compassion of the people who sheltered potential victims of the gas chambers.</p><p>The on-going conflict in the middle east between Israel and Palestine often makes people think that the relationship between the Muslim and Jewish communities is a difficult one and one of animosity. However, that is simply not true. People of those faiths share a long-lasting friendship that can be traced back through history. In fact, the Holocaust provides us with one of the greatest examples of that. I recently read the story of Abdol Hossein Sardari, a Muslim Iranian diplomat who gave up his diplomatic immunity and luxurious lifestyle to save as many Jews as possible from the terror of the gas chamber. With considerable danger to his personal safety, he issued blank Iranian passports to whole families, so providing safe passage through Nazi-occupied Europe for 2,000 to 3,000 Jews.</p><p>As well as congratulating Stewart Maxwell, I congratulate Glasgow Caledonian University on its gathering the voices project, which has collected and recorded oral histories of Holocaust survivors with a specific focus on their lives in Scotland and the positive contribution that they have made to our nation. By recording the stories of those who came to our country seeking refuge from atrocities, we are reminded of our social contract with the rest of humanity. Today, we have jostled over the referendum, talked about independence and made our cases to and fro about the Scotland that we want. However, regardless of where we sit in that debate, we all agree that Scotland has a duty to be a beacon of peace and humanity for those who seek sanctuary from injustice, regardless of where they come from. We owe it not to the victims of the Holocaust or of any other genocide but to ourselves and future generations never to repeat the horrific mistakes of our predecessors.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659544", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holocaust Memorial Day 2012"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Stewart Maxwell for securing this members&#8217; business debate.

I do not know whether I am still allowed to call myself a newbie but I certainly still feel that way. Although I have enjoyed my time thus far and&#8212;I hope&#8212;have made some kind of impact, there is no doubt that the learning curve is a steep one. Unlike many of my esteemed Justice Committee colleagues, including Christine Grahame, David McLetchie and Roderick Campbell, I do not come from a background in or around the Scottish legal system. I hope that that has not been too evident in committee meetings, although I fear that it probably has been.</p><p>As a result, every time I read a commission&#8217;s review or report on our legal system&#8212;be it Lord Gill&#8217;s review or Lord Carloway&#8217;s review&#8212;my mind boggles at some of the anomalies that have been woven into it. Legal reform is moving at an incredibly fast pace but much of this change is not before time and, whatever reforms are proposed and eventually acted on, our legal system must have at its core the human rights and civil liberties of the individual and our society. Those are not conflicting but complementary ideals.</p><p>The essence of human rights is given away by the very name: they are the rights of every single human being. As unpopular as it may be with some, that includes the rights of the suspect, who is of course innocent until proven guilty, and even the rights of the convicted and incarcerated. In fact, it is in addressing such tough scenarios and having to deal with our society&#8217;s most awful and heinous individuals that our mettle and conviction with regard to the rights of others are most tested.</p><p>Given all that, I will touch on a number of issues in connection with Lord Carloway&#8217;s very informative, thorough and weighty review. As I said, some anomalies in our legal system defy logic, and it is surprising that many of them have not been challenged previously. As several members have said, Lord Carloway recommends that children under the age of 16 should not be able to waive their right to access legal representation. To my legally untrained eye, it is simply unbelievable that, in our progressive country, although those under 16 cannot vote, get married or consent to sexual activity, they can somehow make a decision on whether they require legal assistance with something as complex as a police interrogation. To me, that is truly baffling. I hope that the Scottish Government gives that recommendation from Lord Carloway the most urgent attention and addresses what I believe is a serious inadequacy in our system.</p><p>Debates in the chamber often become vexed, heated and robust&#8212;and that is often just the one member. [Laughter.] It would be unwise to name any names. There is of course a time and a place for such exchanges, although less of it in here would probably help to get things done more quickly. I welcome the measured tone of the debate because, when discussing corroboration and other contentious matters, calm heads are required. Corroboration is not a black-and-white issue. There is no definitive science or equation to which we can turn to know for certain whether removing the requirement for corroboration will result in more charges and convictions or more miscarriages of justice, as has been touched on.</p><p>The legal profession has, whether rightly or wrongly, a reputation for being somewhat resistant to change. The fact that corroboration has been a cornerstone of our legal system, as the cabinet secretary mentioned, is not in itself a good enough reason to maintain it. Our legal system should be and is evolving to keep up with human rights standards and with modern technology, conventions and norms. Therefore, nothing in Lord Carloway&#8217;s review should be outwith the realms of serious consideration.</p><p>There is a danger that we paint the debate surrounding corroboration as being between two sides. We have already seen a bit of that. It could be painted as being between some in the legal profession who are resistant to change versus those who simply see corroboration as an obstacle to the successful conviction of rape or sexual assault cases. To demonstrate that it is not as simple as that, we need only read the comments of a number of organisations who support victims of sexual assault. It would be fair to say that they have given the prospect of the removal of corroboration a cautious welcome. Sandy Brindley, the national co-ordinator of Rape Crisis Scotland, said:</p><p>&#8220;We need to be clear that removing the requirement to corroboration does not mean there will be a flood of cases with very little evidence making it to court, or an unacceptable risk of miscarriages of justice.&#8221;</p><p>She continued:</p><p>&#8220;Rape is a crime which can be devastating to experience. Equally devastating can be the experience of being let down by the justice system you believed was there to protect you.&#8221;</p><p>Eminent Queen&#8217;s counsel and pipe smoker Donald Findlay said in relation to the removal of corroboration:</p><p>&#8220;the evidence of a single, duplicitous, lying, skilful witness would be sufficient to put a person in prison for the rest of his life.&#8221;</p><p>Of course, that could apply to two duplicitous, lying and skilful witnesses. With such logic, we should question why only two witnesses are necessary and not three, four or five. To me, the figure of two seems an arbitrary one that has been plucked from thin air. It is important that any change that the Government attempts to make on corroboration should, as James Kelly said, be grounded in the principle of quality over quantity.</p><p>There is much to consider and to give thought to on the back of Lord Carloway&#8217;s thorough review. As the cabinet secretary mentioned, many fear that the Scottish legal system would lose its unique identity were its idiosyncrasies to be removed. The truth is that identity, whether in human beings or legal systems, is always evolving. My hope is that, through the review and planned reform, our legal system evolves to become a beacon of justice with human rights enshrined at its very core.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656451", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Law and Practice (Carloway Review)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I mean no disrespect but seven months in this Parliament can sometimes feel like seven years.

There can be few issues more important than the potential closure of a hospital. When John Swinney spoke to members in the chamber last week, there was the usual, predictable huffing and puffing from Opposition members about the spending review&#8212;I am sure that we probably did the same when the shoe was on the other foot; that is the nature of politics at times. However, as the dust has settled and the analysis continues, no one in the chamber, as George Adam said, is under any illusion that we are living in anything but the most difficult circumstances for at least a generation. No member here doubts that difficult decisions have to be made by the Scottish Government and by every layer of government, including at a local level.</p><p>One thing that I am pleased is no longer a strain&#8212;although the effects are still very much felt&#8212;is the use of expensive private finance initiative contracts to build hospitals and schools. Just this week, the UK Government announced that 60 hospitals are under threat of closure in England due to expensive PFI deals that were negotiated by the previous Government. The burden of that debt will outlive us and transfer on to the shoulders of future generations. It is worth mentioning that this Government has an outstanding record of keeping hospitals open. As has been said, one of its first acts, of course, was to keep open the accident and emergency wards at the Monklands and Vale of Leven hospitals.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652418", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lightburn Hospital"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Paul Martin for securing this important members&#8217; business debate.

As I told my committee colleagues earlier today, I have what my wife calls a serious bout of man flu.</p><p>I commend Bill Kidd for securing this important debate. His commitment to the cause of international peace, and particularly the work that he has done on promoting a nuclear-free world, starting right here in Scotland, is well known and well respected. Not many members of this Parliament can claim to have met United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. I hope that, should Mr Kidd ever find himself unable to make a meeting with Ban Ki-Moon, he remembers the kind words that I have said about him.</p><p>Politics is often characterised by competing ideologies&#8212;those on the left and those on the right; those who believe in one constitutional course for our country and those who support another. However, I hope that we would all agree that there are topics that are above the often mundane mediocrity of these discussions and around which the chamber can unite, such as the wish for Scotland to be a broker of international peace.</p><p>I am often asked about the point at which I knew that the SNP was the party that I wanted to be a part of, or when it became clear to me that independence was the right course of action for our country. For me, it was simple. Any niggling doubts that I had were immediately wiped out when the decision was taken to send our young men and women into a disastrous war in Iraq&#8212;a war that the majority of the Scottish population opposed. We should not forget that this Parliament opposed a unilateral decision to go to war without UN backing, yet we had no choice about whether to participate in that illegal conflict.</p><p>Many of the smaller nations of the world right here in Europe play a huge role in international peace. Just look at Norway&#8217;s Oslo accords: the first face-to-face agreement between the Israeli Government and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Although peace can seem a very long way off in that region of the world, the Oslo accords are very much seen as the foundation blocks for any future peace negotiations. In addition, we are all familiar with the Geneva convention, which is there to protect, in particular, persons who are not participating in hostilities and civilians who are taken captive in military conflict. It is a standard bearer for human rights in modern conflict and a cast-iron protection against state torture&#8212;and it comes from one of the smallest nations in Europe.</p><p>Regardless of where we stand on the constitution or the independence question, we are surely in agreement that we would like to see Scotland play a similar role in brokering international peace. I look forward to the day in the future when the global peace movement takes a huge step forward as a result of measures contained in what our future generations will call the Glasgow charter or the Edinburgh convention. However, the truth is that while we are part of a United Kingdom structure that carries with it a lot of heavy baggage&#8212;the UK is often seen as the yes man of US foreign policy&#8212;Scotland as a nation cannot effectively fulfil such a role.</p><p>As Scots we are internationally respected, whether as innovators and inventors of the modern world or in academia. Even our football team&#8217;s supporters&#8212;the ever-loyal tartan army&#8212;are much respected and loved, although that may well be more out of sympathy than anything else. As a nation we have within us an ethos of egalitarianism; fairness is in the very fabric of our society.</p><p>When I had the pleasure of working for the late, great Bashir Ahmad MSP, we hosted Scotland&#8217;s for peace, which brought to Parliament its peace book, which many members in the chamber will have signed. The message was a simple one, but one that surely resonates to the very core of what we all believe. It said:</p><p>&#8220;We desire that Scotland be known for its contribution to international peace and justice rather than for waging war.&#8221;</p><p>As Scotland is undoubtedly undergoing an evolution in its constitutional arrangements and structure, it is imperative that we hold on to that message and make it a self-evident truth. Whether I wake up the day after an independence referendum euphorically elated or bitterly disappointed at the result, the one reassurance that will comfort me is that the people of Scotland will never waver on their commitment to international peace and justice.

I would prefer it if it were not necessary in the 21st century to be discussing the same issue that has been plaguing our communities for hundreds of years.</p><p>Sectarianism is a cancer in our society. As a football fan and a semi-regular attendee at matches in Glasgow, I know only too well how sectarian chanting can impact on the atmosphere and enjoyment of a good match. However, the impact of sectarianism extends far beyond the football terraces. It is a catalyst for the drunken violence that can too often be the aftermath of an old firm match. It corrupts the innocence of young people, who grow up with an inherent hatred of the other, without knowing why that hatred exists.</p><p>Although sectarianism is a centuries-old problem, it has very much reached the 21st century&#8212;the purveyors of hatred have moved online, with dire consequences. Internet sites such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs are actively being used as outlets by bigots, and legislation to stamp that out must be brought forward quickly.</p><p>I whole-heartedly support freedom of speech. I always have. I even believe in the freedom to offend&#8212;I do not think that it is particularly constructive, but I believe that people have that right. However, we cannot and must not allow people to hide behind the shield of freedom of speech and the anonymity of the internet to incite racial and religious hatred.</p><p>Scotland is a diverse country, and we should be proud of that multicultural tartan. I always say that even our cuisine reflects that diversity&#8212;our nation&#8217;s top two favourite dishes are chicken tikka masala and spaghetti bolognaise. Anyone who walks into any west of Scotland takeaway will spot cheese, chips and curry sauce on the menu, mixing in perfect harmony&#8212;perhaps a metaphor for how far we have come as a cohesive society.</p><p>Every immigrant group has made a valuable contribution to Scotland, enhancing our rich culture and boosting our economy&#8212;none more so than our Irish and Scots-Irish communities. I had the pleasure of attending the Donegal live show in Glasgow&#8217;s merchant city during the recent election campaign. It was an incredible celebration of all things Donegal and of the deep and historical connection between Glasgow and that city.</p><p>However, we must not kid ourselves that the journey has always been rosy for our Scots-Irish community. We know that it has not been. It was not too long ago that Irish families were changing their surnames from Sweeney to Swann and from O&#8217;Donnell to McDonald. No one is interested in petty finger-pointing and playing the blame game, but we must be careful that we do not allow our perceptions of balance to be skewed and therefore do not correctly identify the real problems and issues that exist. Anti-Irish racism exists in Scotland, just as many other forms of racism unfortunately still blight our streets. Our challenge is not to let the fight against anti-Irish racism be lost in the battle against sectarianism. Yes, there is an element of overlap, but to confuse the two would be harmful and dangerous.</p><p>Irish culture has been enriching our country for centuries and we are a better nation for it. Let us agree to work together to preserve that rich heritage. Only by stamping out racism, bigotry and sectarianism can we truly let our nation flourish.</p><p>I again congratulate Bob Doris on bringing the motion before Parliament and I whole-heartedly support it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648581", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sectarianism and Anti-Irish Racism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin, like those before me, by putting on record my thanks and congratulations to Bob Doris for securing this members&#8217; business debate.

Nobody embodied that spirit of opportunity more than the late Bashir Ahmad, who, during his lifetime, went from being a humble bus driver to being a humble politician. His contribution to and love for Scotland and for Glasgow can never be fully articulated, but it is understood and appreciated by those who knew him well. I personally owe him a debt of gratitude for engaging me in the political process from a young age. I will leave it to other members to judge whether or not that was a wise decision on his behalf.</p><p>I put on record my appreciation for the enormous hard work done by Anne McLaughlin in the previous session of this Parliament. I have no doubt that, whatever role she pursues next in life, she will continue to fight for justice and compassion with the same vigour that she displayed day in, day out during her time as an MSP.</p><p>I turn my focus to the 2014 Commonwealth games. A consensus has formed that if we do not build a fruitful and lasting legacy we will have failed to gain the true benefits of hosting a major sporting event, regardless of the economic advantages that the games will bring. Credit must go to all the partnership organisations that are working so closely together to create that meaningful legacy&#8212;in particular Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government.</p><p>There may well come times in the next 12 months in particular when Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government do not necessarily see eye to eye. However, I have no doubt that their collective commitment to delivering a world-class Commonwealth games for Glasgow and Scotland is unshakeable.</p><p>Members have mentioned the obvious health benefits that come with playing sport, but I will take some time to touch on the other benefits&#8212;the social benefits&#8212;that are perhaps not so widely discussed.</p><p>One of the many successes of the previous Government was the cashback for communities programme. More than &#163;40 million was seized from criminals and used to benefit more than 500,000 young people across Scotland, and Glasgow has been a huge beneficiary.</p><p>The main purpose of the midnight football or late night basketball was not necessarily to encourage local youths to shed a few pounds. Initiatives such as cashback for communities play a vital role not just as diversionary tools, but in bringing together groups that might previously have been hostile to one another. Far too often&#8212;we have been guilty of this recently&#8212;we focus on the minority who use sport as an excuse for their own narrow-minded prejudices and hatred but, more often than not, sport is a social activity. It is a tool that should be used to break down barriers between groups that often have very little in common. People may come from different cultures or speak different languages, but everyone understands that the ball hitting the back of the net is cause for unadulterated joy or, as is the case for most of us members of the tartan army, the thud of dismal reality that our team is behind again.</p><p>In addition to providing the social benefits that I have mentioned, the Commonwealth games promise to be a national celebration with an almost carnival-like atmosphere, as 71 nations of the world descend on Glasgow. We are already a diverse nation of immigrants and emigrants. It was the famous Scots author Willie McIlvaney who said that Scotland truly is a mongrel nation. Just a casual glance around the chamber when it is full reflects how diverse our tartan has become and how far we have come as a nation: Italian Scots such as Marco Biagi and Linda Fabiani and Irish Scots such as Michael and Siobhan McMahon are, of course, joined by me and my good friend Hanzala Malik, who are very proud to be&#8212;if I can speak for both of us&#8212;Pakistani Weegie Scots.</p><p>The participation in the games of 6,500 athletes and officials from across the world will only enrich our heritage, add to our cultural diversity and reinforce Glasgow&#8217;s image as a cosmopolitan city that is equipped to compete with any of the world&#8217;s major cities.</p><p>With the world artistic gymnastic championships coming to Glasgow in 2015 and the Ryder cup and the Commonwealth games coming Scotland&#8217;s way in 2014, the contribution of sport to Scotland&#8217;s economy will be significant and will amount to hundreds, if not billions, of pounds. Although that will be vital for our economic recovery, what excites me more is the self-belief that is evidently being instilled in Scots across the country. As we approach those historic sporting events, a wave of optimism is building and an understanding or a belief is forming that although we may be a small country in geographical terms, our ambition is vast and limitless.</p><p>However, if we are to realise our ambitions fully, we must embrace a new style of politics. In his first speech of the session, Patrick Harvie said that the Opposition would have to be positive and constructive and that the Government would have to be willing to listen. He very eloquently said that if that were to happen, the Parliament as a whole</p><p>&#8220;may be greater than the sum of its parts, and our achievements together may be more lasting.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 26 May 2011; c 29.]</p><p>I could not agree more, and I believe that there is a lesson there for us all. Regardless of where we sit in the chamber, let us agree to cast aside the tribalism that has so often held us back and the bickering that turns people further away from our democratic process.</p><p>Surely there can be no better place to start than by ensuring that we work towards a successful games and a legacy that is inclusive and which can be accessed by all&#8212;in particular, by the most vulnerable in our society, including the 660,000 carers in Scotland and the thousands who live in relative poverty&#8212;and not just by the most privileged in our society.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a matter of great pride and honour to be standing here as a representative of the great city of Glasgow, the city that I was born and grew up in and where I received my education.
