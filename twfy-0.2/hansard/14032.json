The bill gives us a chance to choose a future of which the boundaries, aspirations and achievements of Scots will be determined by the Scots themselves, with no excuse with which to blame anybody else.</p><p>Some Scots feel that the future is somehow a barter, and that if we stay a region of the United Kingdom, there will be a safety net&#8212;but safety nets can fail, too. If you fall into the safety net at the circus, you are not as big a draw as you are if you try without the safety net. I am for going without a safety net, because we have everything that we need to do that.</p><p>Other Scots see Scotland not alone, but certainly alongside and the equal legally of any other country in the world. Independence is important for our self-image because we will change from regionalists and those who are always a wee bit behind the fashion and the times, to being leaders, as other small countries are. That applies not only to the normal small countries that we always cite; members should think also about Singapore and what it has achieved. We may not like how they did it, but members should think about what it did with the numbers and its positioning. There are lots of examples that we can draw from.</p><p>I know that I will never regret voting yes. It will be my legacy to my grandchildren&#8212;there are 10 of them. We will be expecting them to pick up from where we leave off. We will have given them the opportunity to go for the highest standards of achievement and humanity&#8212;just the best. That is what they will aim for, if I vote yes, and that is why I will never regret voting yes.</p><p>I wonder how the people whom we call unionists&#8212;of course, most of them are not unionist; they just happen to be on the opposite side of the chamber&#8212;feel about their legacy? We know what their legacy is: 17 more years of fuel prices pitched higher than inflation and heaven knows how many more years of austerity. It is a crippling of ambition and it is a squeezing down of what we in Scotland might aspire to. That is the legacy that we take with the union. If they do not want to accept that, let us hear what the alternatives are, because there have been precious few alternatives voiced in the debate so far.</p><p>I ask those who are trying to be imaginative about what would happen post independence&#8212;the new relationships and partnerships that would be struck&#8212;to have a sense of context and timing. It will not all happen at once. Some things can happen the week after and others will take 10 years. They must be sensitive to that because first, they will lack credibility if they do not get it right and, secondly, they will frighten the horses&#8212;I mean, the opponents.</p><p>People ask whether they should vote for independence or union with their hearts or their heads. Like all Scots, their hearts are in the right place, so their heads will probably dictate that they should not vote themselves into poverty, fuel poverty&#8212;which I have talked about&#8212;and minority. If people think about it, their heads&#8212;not their hearts, which know that they are Scottish and need nothing else to think about&#8212;will tell them that.

It may well be that there was an argument at one point for the total community of the United Kingdom having one economy, but not now. There is too much of a difference, particularly between the south-east of England and the rest of us.

I do not think that anybody wants us to be, but neither does it hold much attraction to stick with Britain and therefore fall into the category used by President Putin&#8217;s adviser, who described the country formerly known as Great Britain as an unimportant little offshore island that nobody bothers about. His assessment of the United Kingdom fair takes the sting out of the argument that we are better defended. Are we better defended with one submarine when the United States can put the fifth and sixth fleets into the same conflagration in the world? Are we better defended when we send boys and men out to Iraq and Afghanistan with the wrong boots and without proper armoured carriers?

If either side wants it, money can be fed in in kind, in all sorts of ways. I have been there and I have seen it happen.

Thank you so much, Presiding Officer. Where will I start?</p><p>First, let me put a few people right on a few things. Johann Lamont should remember that it was not because Labour got gubbed and had to find a way of coming back to some prominence and some usefulness in Scotland that we started with devolution. Some of us have wanted devolution and then transfer of power to Scotland for 40 years. Along the way, we have managed to join in and help with the UCS campaign, the housing campaigns and any number of other campaigns that I could mention.</p><p>I have the battle scars from those campaigns too, because for me they are indivisible from the means that we are trying to find to best govern ourselves. We have to look at the totality. There must be an awful lot of members in the chamber with fairies living at the bottom of their garden if they thought that they could get through this year and completely separate the Government&#8217;s programme from the principle that we have to decide. That is why I would not have done it the way that Alex Salmond did it&#8212;I told him that a while ago, but we are where we are.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s programme looks thin in places, but it shows potential in other places. Folk such as those on the front benches, who have come up with some pretty good ideas during today&#8217;s debate, could use that potential to ensure that those ideas get into the legislative programme. The Government should be magnanimous enough to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea.&#8221;</p><p>I thought that the no campaign figured far too large in much of what has been said by members on the other side of the chamber. From what I have heard, some members just seem to parrot what Scotland could not do. They say that we need broad shoulders so that we can make the same mistakes as have been made by London&#8212;no, we could do that with shoulders like sauce bottles. James Kelly complained about civil servants working for the Scottish Government to produce ideas for the white paper. What does he say about half of Whitehall being tied up finding things for the other side?</p><p>Before I come on to what I wanted to talk about, I want to say how much I agreed with the Tories on the issue of corroboration. I think that we need to hold on to the requirement for corroboration, which is one of the jewels of the Scottish system. Perhaps we should also consider whether, instead of &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;not guilty&#8221;, the verdict should be &#8220;proved&#8221; or &#8220;not proved&#8221;. That would also take care of the third verdict.</p><p>My colleague Alison Johnstone, who talked about the lack of attention to physical activity in the Government&#8217;s programme, spoke the truth. She, too, could do a great deal, because she has loads of good ideas on how to get communities involved in promoting physical activity.</p><p>I make no apologies for saying that the white paper will be the most important paper ever to come before this Parliament. Therefore, I think that we are entitled to look at it in a somewhat different light. For that reason, the Government must understand that, although white papers usually signal a Government&#8217;s intention as regards implementing its policies, this white paper must be better than that. The white paper will need to hold out the various options that the Scots might choose in several different policy areas.</p><p>For example, the First Minister has said&#8212;I have often heard him say it&#8212;that we will be a monarchy, but I think, &#8220;Mebbes aye and mebbes no.&#8221; That is a decision that should be taken by the Scots individually. What sort of head of state do they want? Do they want a monarchy? Do they want the monarchy that they have got? Do they want a president? Do they want a senate? Do they want to choose someone from the senate? Do they want a head of state at all? Those are options&#8212;all of them legitimate&#8212;and I think that the white paper should encompass them.</p><p>I have talked about the monarchy, so let me now talk about the difficult things. We will need to control our borders. We will need to determine who comes into and out of Scotland, and we should be quite blunt about that. We are very stupid if we say otherwise, because south of our border there is going to be a huge debate about how population is controlled. Any country has the right to say who comes to live within its boundaries, how many people should be able to come in any one year and so on. We can do that without being racist and without being exclusive. We should be honest about it, but everyone is beginning to duck out in case they are labelled extremist and racist.</p><p>Those are a couple of the things that we might look at and consider how they should be presented in the white paper. The white paper should be not merely about the Government&#8217;s position. The Government can say which option it prefers or advises, but it should also say what the choices are. People have been asking for information&#8212;that is what folk on the other side of the chamber do not seem to realise. A look at any opinion poll shows that the majority of folk are saying, &#8220;I do not know enough about this.&#8221; Well, the way to find out about it is to look at the normal business of government and to hold that up against the options for change that are being suggested.</p><p>The Labour Party says that it is suggesting options for change, too. Labour should not be a stick in the mud about it: let us see them and let us hear them. Labour could roll out a white paper as well. The Labour Party is supposed to want maximalist devolution&#8212;fine, let us see that in a paper. I am not in any way afraid of that, because I think that the Scots will realise that, if they vote no, on the day after that, the whole place will realise what a wound it has inflicted on the body of Scotland. They will not do that. We have come too far for us to stall or turn back. That is why I think that, at the end of the day, the Scots will vote yes. They will be full of doubts and complaints and there will be terrific jokes against ourselves, because that is us, but I think that we will vote to move on, because if we vote to stick in the same place, we will be a laughing stock. In the Parliament in London, they will say that we are all mouth and no kilts.</p><p>Those of us who lived through the 1979 referendum can visualise that. That referendum had a much smaller goal, but people realised what they had done to themselves in the time immediately following it. It took us a wee while to lift up politics in Scotland&#8212;that did not happen until the UCS came along and that sort of heart came back into Scotland. We cannot afford to do that.</p><p>Right now, extra revenue is available to any Scottish treasury and we should use that money productively. I do not care that people say that we could not possibly have enough money coming in to fund the things that we want. Who is kidding who? Why are they trying to hold on to us?</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Six minutes!

I certainly was not at all sure what it was until I was diagnosed, and then I found out that it was not actually as bad as I had thought; I found out that I could just get on with my life.

I hope that I will find out quite soon.</p><p>We must not imagine that underemployment is a new thing that is attributable to either Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair. I was first elected 40 years ago in Govan, and Govan was de-industrialising then. That was the big problem. Much of the problem was that people were underemployed or unemployed, although they were mainly underemployed at that stage. Then, 20 years ago, Ravenscraig shut, signalling the end of the Scottish steel industry. There was underemployment, unemployment and mismatched employment in Motherwell and Lanarkshire at that time.</p><p>We have had this problem in Scotland for a very long time, since we lost the integration of much of our heavy industry. We used to have an integrated steel industry in which all the skills were needed and used, but when the steel industry was nationalised&#8212;what followed was called rationalisation&#8212;all the good jobs went south of the border. Research and development went south of the border, too. There was underemployment: people in Scotland were doing some work but could, and would, have been doing much more if we had still had an integrated industry in Scotland.</p><p>Let us not kid ourselves that the current situation is anything new; it is just that we have managed to get by and so have not paid it the attention that we should have done. Now that it is having an effect on our society, our behaviour to each other and the quality of the services that we can afford to provide, we are looking at it much more seriously.</p><p>Having said all that, I am with Duncan McNeil and completely understand where he is coming from. If a person has no job at all, they will take any job, including selling from catalogues on doorsteps. My mother did that when she was a nurse. She sold stuff round the doorsteps and it was a dreadful job. In those days, there were a lot more tenements than there are now, and she had to go up and down stairs with a big, heavy case. It was dreadful work and dreadful money at the end of the week. She was not sure how much money was going to come in, so how could she plan for anything? Lots of people lived like that. Having said that, I am still with Duncan McNeil. Any job is better than no job, because having no job eats into the soul.</p><p>Duncan McNeil wants an end to the contracts that pay the workers who work in this building rubbish money. So do I, but if we manage to put two or three firms out of work we will put other people out of work and into unemployment. We have talked about complexity, but it is that simple. Unless we get it right, we will create more unemployment.</p><p>What do Duncan McNeil and the others who have pinpointed the problems want John Swinney to do? What should he cut from his budget to ensure that those workers are not being paid rubbish wages and that we do not underpay people who provide services? That question must be answered, and everyone here knows it. Unfortunately, we have an event happening next year that is dividing us when we do not need to be divided on this issue.

I could have easily become addicted, and I realised how many other people must fall victim to such an addiction.</p><p>If I had the time, I would pursue two or three of the issues that Stewart Stevenson raised because the quality and types of pain are all important. I ask the minister to bear it in mind that not all pain is the same. That means that there will be postcode lotteries because some folk will live nearer to a centre of excellence, which might also be their drop-in centre.</p><p>Talking of drop-in centres, I commend to the minister the health flat arrangement that he and I once visited where local people provide complementary services, such as aromatherapy, massage and so on. Such services can be a great help to pain suffers because they do not suffer pain on their own, and it is often the case that a group of people suffering from the same symptoms can be helped together. All those alternatives&#8212;the full breadth of treatments&#8212;should be considered, as should travelling abroad to England, if people need to do so. As far as I am concerned, people from England are also welcome to come here if they need to do so.</p><p>Some members talked about their own experience of chronic pain. Stewart Stevenson reminded us that chronic pain can be a near-death experience. One of the most awful things for someone is for their life to end in pain, suffering and distress. I will not commend my end-of-life assistance bill to members, but they will see where there is a crossover.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I thank you for giving me this extra time at the end of the debate.

I was told that by Irish politicians who, at the time, managed to hold on to their teensy-weensy Irish industry, because they were in Europe and we were not. Even then, the consequence of not being independent was showing through.</p><p>It is wrong to pick up the housing issue simplistically. Although I was up to my neck, I could see why Mrs Thatcher wanted to do what she did. She wanted to make people feel more responsible, adventurous and so on. Had she allowed councils to use their receipts to rebuild what they needed to rebuild, we would all have been applauding her today. However, she was short-sighted, and she was like a mule when she could not see something herself.</p><p>On the mining communities, the minute that Arthur Scargill was elected president of the NUM, it was &#8220;Ta-ta&#8221; to mining. He was a dreadful leader: he took the miners out on strike when the coal stocks were high and the summer was coming in. Had Mick McGahey not been diddled out of the presidency when Joe Gormley stayed on for a few more weeks, which meant that Mick was age barred, I am sure that there would not have been the strike that there was and that it would have been an entirely different story.</p><p>There are a lot of myths about Mrs Thatcher.

Although I do not have the unalloyed hope of the previous speaker, I hope that what she said might be more true and that we would start off from the higher premise of understanding international law and what is meant when we say that regime change should not be an excuse for war. The Labour Government of the day did not understand those things and the Bush Administration ignored them. That is why I relodged my motion, which asks that Tony Blair be arraigned as an international war criminal. I believe that he, and George Bush, fought an illegal war and many of those members on the other side of the chamber agree with me. This time, I ask them to take advantage of the cover offered by the amendments but not to fool themselves.</p><p>The final remarks of Johann Lamont&#8217;s speech were the most telling. How do bigger and stronger nations help weaker, poorer nations? At what point does it become intrusive? It is worth talking about that because there is a third way, and the United Nations probably has to be at the pointy end of implementing it. We have to talk about it and do so honestly among ourselves. In that way, Johann Lamont added something to the debate but many of her other remarks, which impugned the motivation of Willie Rennie, myself and, had he spoken in the debate, Patrick Harvie in supporting the idea of revisiting the issue 10 years on, did her no good. I see that she is shaking her head in disagreement and I look forward to seeing it noted that I officially disagreed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq Invasion (10th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for small mercies, Presiding Officer.

During the miners&#8217; strike, I was a reporter and I saw a lot of families give up a great deal that they did not want, but were forced, to give up. I was supposed to be neutral because I was broadcasting but, as one Bob Young will testify, I helped to conduct the forum for the miners that gave out news about what was happening where and when.</p><p>At that time, I saw a great deal of humanity in the mining community. I also saw a difference&#8212;Malcolm Chisholm will know what I mean&#8212;between the leadership of the miners on the two sides of the border, which perhaps gave rise to the difference in attitude that existed. As far as I could work out, south of the border there was a 50:50 social split, more or less. In Scotland, you had to move much further to the right before you came to the split. I think that that had a great deal to do with the leadership of the miners in Scotland. Mick McGahey knew what he was doing; frankly, I do not think that Arthur Scargill did&#8212;he took the miners into a strike that they could not win at a time of year when the stocks were high and summer was blazing.</p><p>However, that is in the past now. Why has it remained in the past for so long? That is because we do not find out about Cabinet secrets and do not get to know about secrets such as what happened in such an important social and industrial event as the miners&#8217; strike until about 20 years afterwards, when memories have faded just a bit and events can be tackled more objectively. That is why we are right to say that we should have an inquiry now. It is possible to get justice now without hurting people unintentionally.</p><p>I will give an example of how people were hurt unintentionally. It might sound daft, but this happened; I hope that Jackie Aitchison does not mind me taking his name in vain. The police wanted to have a line to keep the miners back, so someone got a bit of chalk and drew a line on the road. Jackie Aitchison&#8212;for devilment, I think&#8212;stepped over it and back again, and he was lifted. That was stupid&#8212;it was futile to try to have a line that would be respected by the miners. There was a wee bit of a breakdown between the miners and the police in Scotland, but it was nothing like what took place in Yorkshire. We must be grateful for that and acknowledge that it was the case.</p><p>However, that is not to say that there are not genuine grievances that should come out in an inquiry and should be explained to people.

I find it awful sad that, because of the politics that we have in the Parliament just now, Annabel Goldie feels that she has to be British on the day for celebrating Scottishness.</p><p>After that expression of togetherness, I wonder whether I might offer just a little bit of constructive criticism. We are in danger of becoming very divided. We are not having a civil war. We are having a civil referendum. We are in danger of dividing ourselves, and we can gain nothing from it. Unless we run a good referendum, Scots will be much less inclined to celebrate St Andrew&#8217;s day following the referendum.</p><p>By a good referendum, I mean that people must feel that they own it&#8212;that it is theirs and not the province of any party. It must belong to the Scots&#8212;to each and every one of us&#8212;and none of us is any more important than the others in how we interpret it. However, the basis of that is information. Every other member will know that too, because people are saying to us, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know where the information is. I don&#8217;t know the answer to this, that and the next thing. I want to know about defence, the currency and Europe.&#8221; We have time to provide that information in a neutral and balanced way, and not in a party-political way. There are, of course, choices to be made on all the big questions that we will put to Scots, and they will answer them in their own way, but they can do that only if the information is there.</p><p>To be perfectly honest, I am really disappointed with the Government for not having the gumption to realise that that comes before all the party-political nonsense that will divide us, I think to no good effect.</p><p>Taxi drivers in Edinburgh have told me that they want to be able to discuss what is happening with visitors who come into their cabs. Foreigners who come to Scotland just now know that something is happening and they want to know what it is. The taxi drivers have told me that they would like to be able to discuss it, but they need information with which to do that. I therefore suggest, as another idea that jumps off from St Andrew&#8217;s day, that we provide that information for people who want it, because all Scots can be ambassadors for Scotland. That would be much more likely to stimulate interest in and knowledge of the real Scotland.</p><p>Although Margaret McDougall gave a very funny speech about one-legged haggises or something, there is a real, deep Scotland about which many of our fellow Scots know little. One thing that we could do is stimulate interest in that. We will not do it if, in some way, we apologise for being Scottish and say that it has to be diluted by saying that we are British. I can feel just as British as anybody else, believe it or not, because I have a great deal in common with all the other folk on this island, but I have a friend in Barbados&#8212;she is perhaps my best friend&#8212;and I feel something in common with her as well. I do not think that there is any great merit in saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m Scottish and British,&#8221; compared with saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m Scottish and I feel all sorts of other identities too.&#8221; Those identities might be from all over the world, with different causes. Maybe we should start to think outwardly properly, instead of stopping our internationalism at Dover, because that is a gey limited way to celebrate the fact that, as we say, we come from the country that Rabbie Burns described as offering a brotherhood of man throughout the world.</p><p>I realise that we do not celebrate Burns until January&#8212;although I celebrate him every month, to be honest. However, if we can celebrate St Andrew, his influence in the world and his influence on us just as Scots, that will be much more satisfactory than somehow making it into a half-baked British apology. I appeal to Annabel Goldie, whom I know is as Scots as I am and is just tainted at the moment because we have the possible divisiveness of a referendum, to get up, have a good shoogle around and be as Scottish as I know she is. She does not have to apologise to anybody for it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew&#8217;s Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not find it repugnant.

I am glad that he is submitting the information that he referred to to the consultation and I hope that the Government will listen to it because it sounded full of good sense, rather than long windy words.</p><p>What did Margaret McDougall do? She put the cat among the pigeons when she asked for the definition of a community. If members were to listen to some of the other fine words and sentiments that were expressed, it would seem that we are going to embrace all communities in Scotland. However, if a community pops up that people do not like to have in their area, will it be looked upon with such kindness? I say that with some bitter experience&#8212;it was many years ago, admittedly&#8212;from trying to establish a halfway house in a leafier part of Edinburgh. The attempt was not particularly successful and, although it is an easier thing to do now, there are still lots of places that would shy away from communities of people who had difficulties in life and who were trying to get back on board again. What exactly is a community? What are we talking about when we talk about communities of interest, and how do they stack up alongside geographical or social communities? That is something to think about.</p><p>Let us turn to the groups that call on our community assets or community good resources, as mentioned by Margaret Mitchell and Sandra White. We must look at how the new-found power of control over assets will be used. Alison Johnstone mentioned that the Government should think about transferring the powers to trusts&#8212;that is a sensible, down-to-earth suggestion that is not airy-fairy and must be looked at in every circumstance to see whether it works and suits the particular local community that it is rooted in.</p><p>I had a part to play in the establishment of an excellent community empowerment project&#8212;community flats&#8212;in south Edinburgh, which has now been rolled out in another couple of examples. The need was for basic living and lifestyle skills. I know that sounds a bit hame knittit, but nobody could make a pot of soup among the young lassies who were given homes in the tower blocks. There were all sorts of basic things that people did not know how to do and that only needed basic home skills. There were a lot of elderly women there, many of them widows, who did not have much to do, and men, who could do stuff around the place. The council and the health board co-operated with the project and a nurse was seconded to it. We were given the use of a flat for a community flat, which became absolutely stowed out. We offered services which the council could not provide, including anger management classes next door to the soup-making classes. A cup of tea was always available when needed. It was a place where the community was able to mix and mingle and it acted as a catalyst for further ideas that were put into effect.</p><p>I am not going to give the minister all the evidence from the project, because he knows enough about it, and it is all on the record at the council if he wants to find out more. However, what I have described is the kind of empowerment that is needed for our poorest communities.</p><p>I very much support what Bob Doris wants for his area, and I like the sound of what is happening in Paisley with regard to sports facilities. Local sports facilities that are run and used by local people and their children are a form of empowerment for a community. However, in many cases the enthusiasts become involved rather than the whole community. I may be proved wrong in the view that I am about to give&#8212;there is, for instance, the swimming pool in Stonehaven that was taken over as a locally managed venture and is very diverse in what it does and in the groups that it appeals to&#8212;but it is not as simple as saying that if we have a facility, the community will be empowered and things will get better for people. We need to be flexible about the structure and we must be organised about training the volunteers, and do so without patronising folk, so that they are willing to step up to the plate, because people who live in a depressed area can be that bit more scared about taking on debt.</p><p>I take the opportunity to say to the minister that I am looking for some support for a project in Edinburgh which will empower the community&#8212;the velodrome to which Alison Johnstone referred. There are heaven knows how many young cyclists in Edinburgh who do not have a proper velodrome. We are not looking for the bells and whistles of the velodrome in Glasgow; what is needed is a good working model where kids can learn and train. A bit of money is needed&#8212;it is not much.

We should not kid ourselves that people have a clear notion of where the demarcation lines lie between devolution and independence or sovereignty. They are not sure about these things and we need to explain them, and it is not fair to take up the time that should be spent attacking the problems of poverty that folk are experiencing now.</p><p>We know it is impossible to do all that work on our own. Johann Lamont is far too honest a woman to try to make out that everything to tackle poverty can be done in this chamber. She said yesterday that she was concerned that we are not doing as much as we could do with the limited powers we have.

That is the record of the union as far the people living in her constituency are concerned, and she cannot on her own, using the powers of this place, reverse that. She wants to tackle poverty, and I want to help her because it is my fight as much as hers. We have failed to stand up for these people through the British system.</p><p>That is why I was very sarcastic about the better together and the better Britain campaigns and so on. There is a case to be proved. If the SNP is being asked to prove the case for independence, the people who support the union must prove the case for the union being a better option. We have the present record to judge it by and it does not come out looking very well. Jackson Carlaw knows that perfectly well.

If not, why not?</p><p>If the unionists and their fellow travellers do not seek equality of status, that is, I presume, because they believe that, after the referendum, they will somehow be able to wipe out the wastelands and wasted lives in districts of Glasgow and the west of Scotland that have been identified as having extreme levels of poverty and deprivation, which proclaim the ever more impoverished state of the UK, as well as its inherent unfairness.</p><p>Are we stronger together when young soldiers are sent to war without proper boots and with guns that do not fire and then have to travel in ineffective motorcades? Not at all. Are we stronger together in that we punch above our weight because the UK sits on the United Nations Security Council as a permanent member, while neglected old people live out their lives to sad, miserable ends in dreadfully miserable homes? We can do it and we know fine that we can do it. The question is, why do we not want to do it?</p><p>The people who cry that the UK is rich and that we cannot afford to leave it should remember that the UK spends &#163;126&#160;billion a year more than it earns.

It could operate in tandem with a fiscal union, governed by a central political entity with the power to redistribute wealth from the rich parts, such as Germany, to the poorer parts, such as Greece. It would be what we might think of in the present circumstances as perhaps a debt union rather than a monetary union.</p><p>David Cameron is correct to say that we either reduce the national sovereignty of states in such a union or we end it, with countries returning to their own currencies.

There is money that could be invested in those states if we were serious about it. Rob Gibson might be able to help me with this, but I think that we have identified that &#163;700 million is piled up in the banks. There is therefore money for private investment.

In fact, why wait on fate? The Scottish Government could ask for an opinion from the European Court of Justice on Scotland&#8217;s right to continuing membership of the EU on our attainment of independent sovereignty. If the answer is a fudge&#8212;I would lay a fair bet on that&#8212;the logical place for Scotland to go is EFTA, with no loss of sovereignty and continued access to the EU&#8217;s markets. Of course, we would have to bring our regulations into line with European regulations, but that would only be fair.

I hoped that we would hear many such speeches in the Scottish Parliament. I do not mean to be patronising, but we have heard a few more this afternoon than we heard the last time that we debated the issue.</p><p>Mary Fee said that she would have thought more of the Scottish National Party if it had signed the original claim of right. Oh no she wouldn&#8217;t. [Laughter.] We are bedevilled by party politics when we come to talk about the national question. I will come to that later.</p><p>We can set one or two things straight this afternoon. It is only hours since the announcement on the consultation and already the misinformation, the lies, the hints, the nudges, the wink winks and the devious skills of spin doctors have been all over the airwaves and in the newspapers. Let us agree among ourselves to admit to a few basic truths.</p><p>Let us talk about the party politics for example. David McLetchie is a Tory. It is not his fault&#8212;I think he was born like that&#8212;but we should evaluate much of what he says about the Scottish constitutional question in light of that. This afternoon, he presented rather a questionable thesis when he discussed constitutionality. Jim Eadie referred to the United Nations charter, and we know perfectly well that the Scots can say that they want to be independent. No one can gainsay that, provided it is a fair test of opinion that brings about that result.</p><p>However, what the Scots cannot say while in partnership with other parts of the United Kingdom is, &#8220;We want to change this, that and the next thing,&#8221; without agreeing it first with its partners. That is what I was referring to when I suggested to the First Minister&#8212;a suggestion that I hope he took kindly&#8212;that he should ditch the second question idea because he can deliver on the first question if he carries the argument, but he cannot deliver on the second without the agreement of people over whom we have no influence whatever, if they do not want us to have influence. That is where I take issue with Jim Eadie. The intention of trying to include the people of these islands in our march forward is the correct one, but I fear that it cannot be done on the one ballot paper.</p><p>An aspect of politics in Scotland that confuses the pure debate on our constitutional future is the issue of identity. We are still at it. I am a patriotic Scot but I am not a nationalist. I wonder whether a man from Mars could tell the difference. I went to Puerto Rico once. There were three groups in Puerto Rican politics: the people who were for commonwealth, which is what we would equate to devolution; the full-state lobby, which wanted to be another state of the union; and the people who were for independence. Do you know something? I could not tell the difference and nor could anyone else. They all backed Puerto Rico, but party politics was screwing things up for them.</p><p>I remember that sort of thing when I hear Neil Findlay speak, because he knows, as I know, that it is no use having the ideals of alleviating poverty and creating a fair society if we do not have the delivery mechanism to do that. If we had that delivery mechanism we would not even need to pretend that the United Kingdom is perfect in what it has achieved&#8212;that is what is on offer as an alternative to the sovereignty that the SNP proposes in its document. If the UK had got the delivery mechanism right, Johann Lamont&#8217;s constituency would not have the social indices that it has, which are probably the worst set in the whole of the UK. If that is partnership, I want none of it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659946", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Claim of Right"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am proud to follow such a speech.

We should give and receive explanations and further examine the topic under discussion. I am sorry if that comment makes me sound like old granny grump.</p><p>I accept&#8212;I think that everybody who has criticised the bill does so&#8212;that, in introducing the bill, the Government meant well. All of us, if we are honest, know that there are still threads of sectarianism in Scotland, but as we have heard clearly this afternoon the definition of sectarianism has not been pinned down in the bill. We must do that first. That was why I tried to correct Hugh Henry, because I thought that it was important. I did not say that Rangers and Celtic were necessarily sectarian in their behaviour or that their fans were&#8212;I said that they had a problem. I refuse to take seriously the idea that sectarian abuse is hurled by the Rangers fans at the Celtic fans when most of the guys coming out of the tunnel for quite a while were good Sicilian boys who crossed themselves before the start of the match. I am not making light of it; I am just trying to say that that is how it seems from this football fan&#8217;s point of view.</p><p>I support neither Rangers nor Celtic&#8212;I hope that they always get beat. I know that such behaviour and attitudes can leech into other clubs, but other clubs do not have big problems. The big problems lie with those clubs and that is why I support the sensible suggestion that, if we move on with this legislation, the clubs should bear the burden of disciplining their supporters. We should take points from them: that costs them their place in the league, it costs them money and it means that they have to sell their best players. The people who know about football are nodding their heads. They know that that is the most effective method to use against displays of bad behaviour, hooliganism or whatever we want to call it&#8212;by which I mean the chants that are offensive to most people.</p><p>As I have suggested, we also have to pin down the question of how we will judge what behaviour is offensive and what is not. Some folk grow up in houses where people swear all the time, so they are not particularly offended when they go to a football match and the guy sitting next to them knows only one adjective.</p><p>I know that the convener of the Justice Committee was upset that not enough attention had been paid to the communications provisions in the second part of the bill. As Patrick Harvie said, once again, it had good intentions. We have had one debate, but we need more and we need it to be about the second part of the bill. That is where we can be effective. We can change behaviour by tackling such means of communication more effectively than by going to a football match and thinking that we might influence behaviour. At matches, people are hyped up and are not completely themselves. They cannot take drink into the grounds, but some of them have a good bucket beforehand and they do not behave how they would behave in other circumstances or other company.</p><p>In short, I hope that the Government accepts that it made a brave effort. Nobody wishes its intentions or aims any ill. Many people were cited as supporting the bill, but they did not support it&#8212;they supported its aims. Perhaps the bill has not come up to scratch in achieving those aims and the Government will not lose face if it admits that. We can then all get back to thinking about how we can tackle sectarianism properly and over a much longer period of time than that in which we might expect one bill to make a change.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill (Stage 2 Report)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the chamber for doing what we should do more often, which is to adhere to the normal rules of debating.

I am sorry that he has chosen to leave the chamber at this moment; he should hear what I am going to say.</p><p>I also appreciated what Michael McMahon and Jackie Baillie had to say. They attempted to analyse and offer alternatives from their particular perspectives and portfolios, which is what the debate was meant to be about.</p><p>Having said that, I should say that my first impression of the minister&#8217;s statement was of an honest attempt to squeeze the maximum out of the system, considering the circumstances, which I hope we can all agree to change during the current parliamentary session. Party loyalties aside, is there anyone who still believes that we benefit unconditionally from being the fag end of the United Kingdom economy? Only yesterday, the IMF reminded us that the British economy is teetering on the edge. If we look at the resources that we would be able to tap into, there is no way that such a verdict would have been given on us if we were a self-standing economy that co-operates with the other parts of the British Isles.</p><p>However, Mr Swinney has the duty to make the best of a bad job and there are many things in his statement that I commend. There are others that I do not. The gap in his exposition about how we will fund further and higher education must be attended to because it is the future. More time could have been spent on that, but I think that I understand the reasons why it was not. I also share some of the reservations about the commitment to freeze council tax for as long as promised.</p><p>I cannot criticise the realisation of the importance of preventative spending, particularly in light of the comments that the IMF made yesterday. We were reminded that there is to be a decade of austerity. The situation will not get better quickly. It therefore seems that preventative spending is essential in the first instance to reduce the harsh effects of the current spending cuts and, in the longer term, to perhaps recalibrate the expectations of our fellow citizens about how much the country can do for them and what they can do for their country and community.</p><p>For example, I think that it was Mr Hepburn who spoke about substituting exercise for pills as a preventative spending measure. I have been urging the Government for quite some time to follow up the proposal that exercise should be on prescription. It should have been worked on much more than it has been; some people have tried, but there has not been an all-out effort to make it normal for a doctor to prescribe exercise.</p><p>There appears to be an omission in the package on preventative spending in the Government statement. There was no direct reference to helping people who fall into debt. That is the most debilitating factor in any family&#8217;s or individual&#8217;s life.</p><p>I have written to the cabinet secretary, asking whether he will consider setting up a very modest fund to kick-start the expansion of credit unions. After speaking to credit unions in West Lothian and elsewhere, Neil Findlay and I have started work on this project and we hope that we will find support from members in all sections of the Parliament, regardless of party. After all, this really has nothing to do with parties.</p><p>As the chamber might know, I had hoped to introduce a bill to outlaw excessive interest rates for loans; however, I have been assured that such a proposal is ultra vires. Once again, this is something that we cannot do in Scotland. It is another source of frustration. I hate to say it but, being smaller and more manoeuvrable, we could have tackled the issue quicker. It needs to be tackled quickly, given that we are facing 10 years of austerity. Like, I hope, other members, I will do what I can to support Stella Creasy&#8217;s bill in the House of Commons, but I do not give much for her chances of getting it through. I have gone with Neil Findlay to the other side of the equation and will try to prevent people from falling into debt.</p><p>I am sorry that we have not been able to give the cabinet secretary more notice of this, but it has happened just in the past week. We believe that a modest start-up fund to enable the expansion of credit unions would be excellent. I have spoken&#8212;informally at the moment&#8212;to Pat Watters and have suggested that he encourage local authorities to make available to credit unions property that is lying empty. If they could get into town centres, they would do much better. We have a number of plans and will be delighted to discuss them with the cabinet secretary if he wants to hear them.</p><p>We should also recognise the work that is being done to help those who are already in debt. We might focus on the grand scale, but the people who have lost their jobs or are working fewer hours will have thinner pay packets and an awful lot of people are falling into debt. In 2008, citizens advice bureaux in Scotland were able to help almost 20,000 people more than they would have had they not received a small grant from the Scottish Government.

The legacy is what we should understand, which is why I am so glad that Jimmy Reid&#8217;s speech is going to be circulated to schoolchildren. It is part of our history, as we were saying in the chamber last week&#8212;a part of our history that all of us can take pride in. The speech should be disseminated throughout the schools so that young Scots realise that this came from Scotland. It was a remarkable achievement.</p><p>As I say, I was a bit worried that I would be the only one old enough to have marched. I am certainly the only one who has sat and heard Lech Walesa express his thanks to the people of Scotland and to the men of the Clyde for having given inspiration to shipworkers in Gdansk&#8212;and we all know what an important part in the story that played. He knew about Jimmy Reid&#8212;much more so than many young Scots do today. So, once again, thanks for getting the book publicised.</p><p>My part in the UCS campaign was to speak on the draughtiest town-centre corners in central Scotland. The boilermakers&#8217; man Joe Black and I were usually lumped together. I am not sure why, but we both shouted a lot; we certainly attracted attention and we collected a lot of money in buckets. We also made a lot of friends who understood, for the first time, that we were all in it together and that, if the Clyde yards went down, an awful lot went down with them. I was very grateful for that learning and growing experience.</p><p>Another experience I had as part of the campaign was with Billy Wolfe, who was then the chairman of the Scottish National Party. We had to go for a meeting with some of the stewards to discuss how the Scottish National Party could support UCS. We met the stewards but we ended up in the back room of a pub&#8212;closed&#8212;with Jimmy Reid himself. We sat and we talked, and I remember seeing the sun come through the windows and thinking that this was really quite lyrical. What the man was saying was pure gold. When we came away&#8212;and this tells us more about Billy Wolfe than it does about Jimmy Reid&#8212;Billy said to me:</p><p>&#8220;What a man. If only that man could be leading the national movement in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>However, he is still leading. His legacy is leading. He gave the notion of self-respect for the workers, and of the mutual respect needed for there to be good industrial relations.

If that is all that we can use to try to help business, we cannot move the pieces around the chess board and, for example, do anything about regional grants. I urge members to look at his speech because it contained the essence of what I think the Government should be doing: comparing and contrasting what is possible with the full range of powers and what they will do with the limited powers that they have.</p><p>The constitutional question will run throughout this session of Parliament: it is absolutely unavoidable. We now know and have witnessed on television the changes that have taken place in English society and communities over the last generation and generation and a half. We are a bit different. The difference is one of degree&#8212;I do not say that it is an absolute difference&#8212;but the degree is enough to call for a different management and a perhaps more sensitive range of policies than is possible if we use the one leverage from Westminster.</p><p>I should make a point while I am talking about Westminster. The Government was urged to come clean and say how it would make Scotland better. I think that Westminster should be asked to come clean and say how it means to make Scotland better. It is not a Scottish Government that produced the health statistics that we saw last week and which showed that Scots live shorter lives. It was not this Government or the previous Governments in the lifetime of the Scottish Parliament that provided the baseline for the health statistics that we should all be ashamed of.</p><p>As well as calling ourselves to account, saying what we might do and admitting that there are limitations, we should not hesitate in calling Westminster to account and asking it how it will come up with a better idea. One or two speakers on the Labour benches said that we could expect more from Westminster. Is that from this coalition Government or the next one to come? I do not think that we should be too shy in saying that sort of thing, either.</p><p>There was a tendency in the debate about the police to skip over the alternatives. I look forward to the statement from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice tomorrow, because I think that the alternatives are not simply one police force or eight; there is any number of variations in between. There are various ways in which operational tasks can be shared among the forces. I am utterly opposed to having only one police force, but that is because of the implications for civil liberties more than anything. Of course, we need to save money in all the services, but can we afford to compromise on civil liberties? We should remember that the forces are the only coercive power in our public services and they can make people do something.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I urge members to read John Mason&#8217;s speech.

That is a very good idea. We have a skewed identity, in many respects, and measure ourselves against our much bigger, very different southern neighbour in a way that another country that I know well and love&#8212;Portugal&#8212;fails to measure itself against Spain. It is the same situation: two countries side by side, one very big and one very small, both with proud and different histories. A man from Mars who visited the Iberian peninsula would not really know the difference between the two; however, if he lived there, he would come to appreciate the nuances that make for a much richer society. That is the sort of thing that we can learn through Scottish studies.

She knows that I did a fair amount of earbashing, and I should tell the minister that the cross-party group on sport&#8212;which reconvened this afternoon&#8212;also sends her its best wishes. The group will be looking for lots of things from her.</p><p>Before I go on, I want to explain why I will be supporting the Conservative amendment this afternoon. The minister&#8217;s motion is a blank canvas; the Conservative amendment fills in some of the detail and, by now, we should be getting down to detail. But before I do, I must remark on George Adam&#8217;s fantastic speech. He talked about the time&#8212;I think that it was 1959&#8212;when St Mirren won the cup. Jim Rodger, who I think scored the winning goal, was my maths teacher.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson&#8212;to whom I pay tribute for the work that she did in the role that the present minister now occupies&#8212;said that physical activity is embedded in our culture. We wish. Deep-fried Mars bars are more likely to be embedded in our culture. However, attempts are being made all round the chamber to change that.</p><p>A point that I made during an earlier intervention could be taken on board by the minister. We know that we cannot achieve&#8212;for all sorts of different reasons&#8212;the two hours of physical education in different schools in different parts of the country. However, in order to embed the idea of physical activity and sport eventually, it would be good to consider having a period every day for every schoolchild during which they get their sports kit on and perhaps sweat a wee bit. Zumba dancing and all sorts of other things can be done in a small space with the help of teachers who may not have the confidence to tackle other kinds of PE.</p><p>I want to commend the minister on the schools national award scheme; I am anxious to hear much more about it, and I hope that she can tell us something when she sums up. That is the sort of direction towards which I think we should be heading.</p><p>I make a plea about the football legislation that the Government is considering just now: do not rush into it. The issue is much more complex than simply saying that Rangers and Celtic are to blame for sectarianism, and it is much more complex than simply saying that all we have to do is fix the issue with refereeing. There is no need to rush into this. Things have been as they are for a long time and I think that a bit of thoughtfulness now would improve the legislation that will come out at the other end.</p><p>When they go into schools, footballers could be much better role models than they are at the moment on a Saturday afternoon. Of course, I exclude Hibs from that comment&#8212;I say that only because I hold a season ticket. However, we could use the current crop of footballers much more: they could go into schools and explain to young people why they should not behave towards referees in the way that the players behave on a Saturday.</p><p>There was a mention made of golf. It may be that there are some terrific golf courses and golf clubs in Scotland, but most golf clubs are suffering. They are finding that, instead of having waiting lists for memberships, they are having to cleek people in the door. We should look at golf before it goes beyond us, because that is where sport integrates with our economy. Golf is a very important sport for us.</p><p>I wonder whether, when we talk about sport, it is borne in mind that we do not get elite athletes unless we have wide community participation in sport. The way into that is definitely through the PE teacher. Far too many PE teachers have qualified but have no chance of getting a job given the cutbacks over the next few years. I ask the minister to consider putting it to her education colleagues that we should have a moratorium for two or three years on churning out even more PE teachers. If they cannot get work, they will drift away from the profession, and all the investment and expertise are lost.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You are more generous than your predecessor&#8212;thank you.

That was also why I liked Alex Salmond&#8217;s speech. They both aimed high&#8212;they were thinking big and beyond the Parliament&#8217;s day-to-day work. We should all do that now.</p><p>The one thing in Patrick Harvie&#8217;s speech with which I disagreed was the implication that we could somehow buck the trend that is set from Westminster. Westminster has decided on a strategy that means curtailing expenditure&#8212;people there hope to shrink the deficit. Patrick Harvie and I might disagree on how that should be done, but Westminster is the sovereign power.</p><p>We should not start by saying that we will not try to make the best of a bad job; we should explain&#8212;as Alex Salmond attempted to today&#8212;what more could be done and what could be done better with sovereign powers in this Parliament to cope with the economy and to secure the employment expansion that we hope to have. I was glad that Alex Salmond concentrated on that, because notions such as improving employment prospects and expanding the workforce are not divided from political independence. Everything that we have heard today underlines the fact that, if we do not have the independence of action to customise strategy and policy to suit our condition, we will not achieve the optimum.</p><p>I loved Iain Gray&#8217;s speech, too&#8212;it was thoughtful, obviously considered and humane. When he spoke, I thought that it was marvellous that we were on the same track and were beginning to think of the optimum that we can do for Scotland and not of doing a little more or a little better. Then he went and spoiled it. He talked about a single police force&#8212;no way, as long as I am here. We cannot think of having a single police force, because of the civil liberties implications. We could have two or perhaps three forces; I would settle for more than one. That is not said in a spirit of anything other than my hope for a consensual opportunity.</p><p>The other comment by Iain Gray that disappointed me was the implication that the United Kingdom was okay. If the United Kingdom is okay, why is one in four children born to fail? Why is that endemic? That situation did not arise under the previous SNP Administration and it would be wrong of Ms Dugdale to suggest that it did. I am old enough to remember the production in the west of Scotland of a publication called &#8220;Born to Fail?&#8221; Previously, one in 10 Scots children was born to fail; the figure is now one in four or five.

Why do we continue to lag behind even the rest of the United Kingdom, never mind similar communities or nations? The legacy of the union relates to growth and the opportunities for young people. The one issue on which I really agreed with Iain Gray was that people who believe in the union will have to prove that it is the best that we can do before we opt for it, just as the SNP will have to flesh out much more the difference between sovereign power&#8212;and what can be achieved by and through it&#8212;and devolved power from Westminster.</p><p>Annabel Goldie disappointed me, because she said that her unionism was an emotional thing.

In later speeches, though, I realised that there was something more to what Labour had to say.</p><p>In an echo of something that Wendy Alexander alluded to, we could start by calling the budget by its correct name. It is not a budget, so why do we not settle for a name that does not flatter to deceive? How about the Scottish Government&#8217;s spending programme or cap-in-hand day? I would even suggest kidology day, because that is what just about every member has been doing, with the honourable exception of Patrick Harvie.</p><p>However, the minister is to be congratulated on his sense of fairness in doling out the local authority share of his spending money, especially following the unprecedented weather that has probably left every council in Scotland with a bigger roads repair bill than it might have anticipated. One of my personal tests of Mr Swinney&#8217;s performance was how he met a genuine dilemma on how best to use whatever amount of the block grant he allocates to Scotland&#8217;s cities. It is almost impossible to calculate a share of the money that is available to the minister that everyone would agree is fair, when our local authorities have such different locations, needs and other factors.</p><p>The cabinet secretary knows the case that I have made for an enhancement of the capital city supplement, given the extra effort that is required to address the damage to the capital city&#8217;s appearance and infrastructure that has been caused by the severe winter weather. I thank him for the extra money that he has levered in via the capital city supplement. There are quite a few weeks left, so he might find that there is a bit more left in the kitty. I am willing to share with Margaret Smith, who made an excellent case for the city partnership. I know that other members from the Lothians region agree.</p><p>However, I am mindful of the fact that members have a duty to contribute to policies that impact on areas outwith their constituencies and regions. It was a happy coincidence that Dalry baths was there to provide an excellent case study for Campbell Christie&#8217;s commission&#8217;s consideration of ways in which we might better deliver public services and keep services in the public sector. I thank the cabinet secretary, because he smoothed the way towards my having a meeting with the commission last week, and we are well on the way to using Dalry baths as a template.</p><p>On the subject of the responsibility of members to contribute to wider interests, I have asked the minister to instigate a review of private finance initiative and PPP contracts. I am extremely serious about the issue, and I am certain that people outwith Parliament think that it is ridiculous that some companies are making profits while other people&#8217;s contracts&#8212;whether commercial or personal employment contracts&#8212;are having to be renegotiated.

Two hands tied behind our backs punching at each other? I am also with Mike Rumbles when he says that Government must compromise and the other parties must compromise, too. The Government could, for example, compromise on the matter that Malcolm Chisholm raised but, as yet, I do not know in what way or in what area the Liberal Democrats are willing to compromise. I asked about that and tried to find out what their feeling is on the provision of universal services. Would they target them? Do they see that as a way of saving money? The Tories have indicated some areas in which they would save money, so they are halfway towards a compromise.</p><p>I am well aware that we are asking the nigh-on impossible of the cabinet secretary. There is just not enough money to do what we would all like to be done. However, I ask the cabinet secretary to look again at the real cut of &#163;1.7 million for the poorest students in higher and further education. Ignorant people never ever set in train a programme for growth&#8212;educated people do that. I also ask him to take a leaf out of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government&#8217;s book and perhaps create an alternative source of revenue by clawing back money from contracts, the terms of which have been overtaken by economic recession. HM Government is currently renegotiating the terms of contracts that were struck with its major suppliers of goods and services. Could the Scottish Government take the same action in relation to the companies whose PPP contracts now appear to be ridiculous in their generosity? Those contracts are generous with public money that is being drawn away from education services and other services that directly impact on Scotland&#8217;s ability to withstand a double-dip recession.</p><p>By the way, I remind everybody that the recession is not driven from Edinburgh, but is instead a result of London-made policy. Could we agree that London has not exactly provided a shining example of economic management?</p><p>Is it right that a market has been created in PPP contracts? Companies bundle them up, which greatly enhances the value of their interest in the projects through economies of scale. The PPP contracts are not sacrosanct. They are commercial contracts that are open to renegotiation. If we are all in it together, why do we exclude them? That is a scandal and I urge the minister to see how much could be recouped from that source. This year&#8217;s budget alone shows the cost of PFI/PPP payments to be &#163;800 million, some of which goes towards contractual agreements that were struck well before the economic slump. For example, there is a hospital that is costing the health board and the Scottish Government three times its estimated value.</p><p>I am not a latecomer to the issue. My election leaflet of 1999, under the heading &#8220;RIE ... RIP OFF&#8221;, said that I would</p><p>&#8220;demand that the Scottish Parliament investigate the terms of the PFI deal which hands control of, and profits from, the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh to private companies.&#8221;</p><p>We have waited 10 years and those companies have had a fair shot at it. Why do we not take the bull by the horns? I urge the cabinet secretary to do that.</p><p>I should, however, thank the cabinet secretary for being understanding of the special pleas that I made on some constituency interests, such as the ski slope in Midlothian. I know that members would be disappointed if I did not mention that. Another issue is the wonderfully imaginative and ambitious project for watersports in Leith docks. I will tell the cabinet secretary much more about that if he gives me hope this afternoon that there will be some money left in the kitty&#8212;it does not need a lot of money at all.</p><p>To be fair to the cabinet secretary, he has tried to make the best of a bad job.

I remind him that the &#8220;Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland&#8221; report concluded that in the financial year 2008-09 Scotland had a surplus of &#163;1.3 billion, or 0.9 per cent of GDP, which included a share of oil revenues and of UK support for the banking collapse.

The Parliament must address that issue. I agree with Patrick Harvie that there are services that must be protected, but there are some that we must look at again. Someone must bite the bullet on the issue. I urge the Government to take the lead and Labour members to be honest, because they know that perfectly well. Can we leave the matter to Campbell Christie&#8217;s commission? Perhaps, but we must give him some feeling of confidence that the Parliament will make a realistic assessment of how national and universal services can be delivered in a new way.

I said that I was proud that the Parliament was dealing with the issue and have had no reason to change my opinion, although obviously differences of opinion and morality have been expressed. I sincerely hope that the Parliament can encompass all of those. I thank the people who have made an effort to be here, because some of them have made an almost superhuman effort to bear witness to our proceedings.</p><p>As I said at the start, we are not alone in our deliberations. In a Radio Europe broadcast last week, the presenter informed me that assisted death, among other end of life issues, is being discussed across Europe. Interestingly, he also told me that our poll figure of 77 per cent in favour of assisted death was consistent with similar polls that have been conducted elsewhere in Europe. I understand why members have argued that we should not be influenced too much by opinion polls, but the polls that have been conducted on <place-holder colnum=\"31084\"/> the issue have been consistent&#8212;so consistent that they are guiding the deliberations of the people who are considering the matter in England.</p><p>I am glad that at the end of the debate there will be a free vote, as it signifies that each MSP is free to use his or her judgment on whether the bill would enhance or harm the whole community. In a free vote, MSPs must also balance their own conscience with the need to reflect their constituents' wishes.</p><p>Most, if not all, MSPs who adhere faithfully to the teachings of their church, mosque, synagogue, temple or meeting place will find themselves fundamentally opposed to the bill because, according to their beliefs, it usurps the place of God, whom they believe to be the only giver and taker of life. In short, they find the bill morally repugnant and ethically unacceptable. MSPs who find the bill as I have described can never vote for assisted death without setting aside their conscience. I hope that Mr Rumbles will take note when I say that none of us has the right to expect them to do so. The correct action for them is to explain to their constituents why they could not vote for a measure with such a proven level of support among the general public.</p><p>Many MSPs are probably not opposed to the bill in principle but have been inundated with communications from faith-based organisations. My advice to any colleagues who are in that position is to vote for the bill to proceed to intensive scrutiny, during which they and I will be able to amend provisions that need to be sharpened or explained better. I am grateful to Anne McLaughlin for making that point.</p><p>Whereas colleagues whose opinions and beliefs derive from their religion will continue to oppose the bill regardless of any amendment, others whose beliefs are not based on a particular religion are free to respond to their constituents' suggestions and ideas. That latter group of MSPs, their constituents and I know that, if they oppose the bill and neither their conscience nor their firm belief that the bill is so bad that it cannot be improved by amendment stands as a barrier to the public's desire for the Parliament to support and act on the bill's principles, they have opted out of offering the leadership that the electors have a right to expect of their elected representatives.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21113884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had a good debate today.

We, the Parliament that represents the wishes, beliefs, hopes and determination of our fellow countrymen and women, are doing something today that Parliaments are meant to do: we are trying to find an honourable, fair and equitable solution to a problem. Put another way, as an institution, we are meeting a challenging situation head on and doing so in a manner that reflects well on the inherent democracy that exemplifies Scotland and which underpins our parliamentary processes.</p><p>The idea of assisting someone to achieve a peaceful death within the law, in what that person considers to be a dignified fashion, is alive and well and is being discussed in countries all over the world. In this part of the world, the Isle of Man is in the initial stages of a bill and in England work is being done to prepare a bill for the House of Lords, but the Scottish Parliament is leading the debate.</p><p>One or two opponents of the bill say that the law of Scotland is quite clear on assisted suicide and that the bill is not needed. That is to assume that the law sits well with contemporary attitudes and beliefs about the circumstances of our own deaths. Interest in the cases in England in which people might wish assistance to end their own lives before nature decrees and seek assurance that those who help them will not be prosecuted is just as strong in Scotland. Although the law is different on either side of the border, opinion polls consistently show the same level of support for the idea on both.</p><p>In case I forget later, I acknowledge the professional commitment of David Cullum's non-Executive bills unit and thank its staff for getting the bill to this stage. As ever, I am indebted to my colleagues Peter Warren and Mary Blackford. I am also, recently, indebted to our intern, Kush Govani, and our work experience student, Joe Somerville. We have all enjoyed the support of the Humanist Society of Scotland, Friends at the End and <place-holder colnum=\"31043\"/> hundreds of individual Scots&#8212;medical and nursing professionals, clergymen and women, lawyers and people with a personal or family interest in the bill's intentions. My pride in the Scottish Parliament's approach to the issue derives not only from the time and effort that some MSPs and their staff have put into consulting their constituents; Parliament staff have also contributed. I especially acknowledge the unique contribution that was made by Jeremy Purvis when he started the ball rolling with a bill proposal that failed but, nevertheless, was the platform from which my bill was launched.</p><p>In the same vein of getting my retaliation in first, I cut to the chase and condemn as unworthy and cheap the contribution from the publishers and authors of the catalogue of linguistic contortions I have here, headed \"Care Not Killing\". The postcard that I am holding up was distributed in churches, and it caused alarm among frail elderly and disabled people. One lady, Frances Robson, from Edinburgh, got in touch with my office to say that she had done a latter-day Jenny Geddes in her church. Someone had preached from the pulpit using the card as his text. She stood up and challenged what he was saying, which she said was political and not what a church is for. She was one of many good, churchgoing people who contacted my office to say that they could incorporate the idea that I propose today within their belief system.</p><p>The organisers of the campaign were no doubt delighted to unload 10,000 filled-in postcards into the arms of MSPs who oppose the bill. However, as most, if not all, of those concerned are churchgoers, I confess to being puzzled about how they squared their conscience with the statements in the card. Care Not Killing says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Bill will\"&#8212;</p><p>not maybe, might or could&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"put large numbers of sick or disabled Scottish people at risk.\"</p><p>From whom? The penalties will remain unchanged for smothering someone, even when asked to do so by the person wishing to end their life, or for helping them to drink a lethal dose of opiates.</p><p>Even qualified and registered medical professionals, doctors and consultant nurses will require to follow the procedures laid down or they, too, will be breaking the law and will face prosecution. This tacky little card dismisses those safeguards as \"illusory\". According to Care Not Killing, the need for witnesses to the requesting patient's application to a doctor for assistance and the requirement for psychiatric assessment before the person concerned makes a second request are merely \"so-called safeguards\".<place-holder colnum=\"31044\"/></p><p>The first claim on the card must be dismissed as heartless scaremongering. If even one MSP in the debate can prove a logical, inevitable link between people who are defined in the bill as having the legal right to seek help to end their life prematurely&#8212;provided that the safeguarding features of the bill are observed&#8212;and sick or disabled people who do not wish to comply with the bill's procedures, whether or not they are terminally ill or suffering from a degenerative condition, I look forward to hearing their justification of the statements on the card.</p><p>If the tightly prescribed legal rights of the bill could reasonably be expected to pose such a risk to vulnerable groups, presumably a similar pattern of behaviour would exist in places where assisted suicide is legal. None of the witnesses questioned by the committee gave house room to that claim by Care Not Killing.</p><p>Care not Killing also states unequivocally that vulnerable and depressed people will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"be put at risk of self-harm.\"</p><p>Who says? Where are the studies or statistics to prove that the bill, which rests on the legal right of a requesting patient to seek professional help to bring life to an end, will have any effect on the behaviour of people who do not seek help? Do the opponents of this limited, defined measure claim that more people will attempt to take their own life than at present? Why? Would they be outside medical and social-work support programmes, as many people who attempt suicide are at present? How would the bill change their circumstances?</p><p>Another claim that is made as a statement of proven fact in the leaflet is that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"(assisted suicide) will come to be seen as an easy, low-cost alternative to good care.\"</p><p>Who will see it in that way? According to Care Not Killing, elderly people in care will feel that it their duty to die. Some elderly people stuck in below-standard care homes do wish for an early death, but the bill's provisions do not cover them. I hope that we do not hear a litany of sanctimonious remarks about improving care provision. We have had more than enough time to do that.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21113884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank everyone who had considerable difficulty in getting here today.

If we are to believe Care Not Killing, however, doctors are without morals, feelings or sentiment.</p><p>Perhaps Care Not Killing was referring to the powers that be&#8212;perhaps it meant that the state, or even just doctors, nurses and hard-up health boards, will view assisted dying as an easy low-cost alternative to good care. Is Care Not Killing claiming that even hale and hearty old people, or people who are living fulfilling lives in wheelchairs, will be snuffed out even as they do their best to hang on to life for as long as is possible for them?</p><p>Perhaps Care Not Killing had in mind the caricature of greedy, heartless family members, who it is sure will change character and depart from the normal behaviour of caring relatives who do not want to let a loved one go. Doctors and nurses who have dealt with people who are in the very last stages of their life have told me that the family want the person to stay.</p><p>For the opponents of the bill's principles to have any credibility, they will require to back up the assertions in the card with facts and numbers, and explanations of the processes that they claim will be set in motion if the bill becomes law.</p><p>Supporters of the bill can cite the evidence that the committee has heard from witnesses. For the predictions of the bill's opponents to be credible, Oregon, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland must be heartless and inhumane societies.</p><p>The card concludes with a hypocritical assertion that assisted dying is contrary to good medical practice. Members and their constituents know that, for generations, and perhaps centuries, terminally ill people have been assisted to die through the administration of a double-effect dose of&#8212;usually&#8212;opiates to relieve suffering, in the knowledge that life is likely to be curtailed too. Quite apart from the proof that doctors took that decision as an act of care, it is plain from what we have heard throughout the whole debate that the British Medical Association does not speak for all doctors when it declares itself to be against the principle of assisted dying. I refer members to the evidence that was given to the committee by medical witnesses.</p><p>Opinion among clinicians and other registered medical professionals differs on assisted dying, as it does among the general population&#8212;and why should it not? Their ethics, religiosity, beliefs and <place-holder colnum=\"31046\"/> creeds will be as varied as those of the rest of society. Indeed, there is evidence that, when asked for their opinion on assisted dying, the liberal democracies in our part of the world&#8212;some Roman Catholic, some Lutheran and some Calvinist&#8212;show a remarkable similarity of attitude.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21113884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will come to my views on the committee's report at the end of my speech; Tricia Marwick might wish that she had not asked for that.

If he and others care to look back at the previous debate on sport, they will be gratified to find that the sort of thing that Ross Finnie described has come on a bomb. It used just to be about what medals we would win at the games and how we would get on in the Ryder cup, but tonight we have heard about sport and the people who take part in it.</p><p>I thank Hugh Henry for his kind and flattering remarks about the cross-party group on sport. I also thank Michael Matheson for saying that it is <place-holder colnum=\"29537\"/> about fun. Many folk who are not in the best of health still take part in bowls. There are all sorts of sports in which people can take part even if they are a bit impaired in their physical movements&#8212;I should know. It is important to put on record that sport is not all about beating health targets&#8212;we must ensure that people enjoy it. That is what I told Christine Grahame when she said that she was put off the idea of sport when she had to run around a cold hockey field with her big blue knickers on. Now she does not need to do that&#8212;she can buy a nice wee skirt.</p><p>The cross-party group on sport has been able to influence some members; in part, that is what cross-party groups are about. We had the biggest turnout when the biggest hunky rugby players came to a meeting with the Calcutta cup; I think you were there, Presiding Officer. There was not a seat to be had. However, there was also a big turnout when Rangers came to talk not about its glorious history but about what it is doing in the community and the fact that it is reaching educationally the parts that many of our education authorities have not managed to reach. There is a growing programme to knit the affection for and ties to the sports clubs that exist in local communities into ways of coping with many of the social challenges that people face.</p><p>We had some cracking meetings when we discussed community sport. I confess that that is where my interest lies. I am of course glad about the people from Scotland who win Olympic medals and I am glad for some of the wee countries that go to the Commonwealth games with two or three athletes. That is great for them and it is good that there is room for them, but my real interest is in community sport and in getting everybody to join in.</p><p>I would like the benchmark for success under our sporting policy to be a wee country such as New Zealand. I do not know whether New Zealand has ever hosted a tournament like the Ryder cup&#8212;probably not. I do not know whether it has ever hosted the world rugby championships either&#8212;probably not. However, just about everybody in New Zealand gets out and plays some sort of sport. The same is true of Finland and Norway. Whoops&#8212;I nearly said \"arc of prosperity\". It just shows that we do not need money to enjoy sport; countries can still develop a decent sporting policy anyway.</p><p>Jim Hume spoke about the importance of the governing bodies. That is where our priority for investment should lie. Sportscotland, the Scottish sports alliance and the people at the Scottish Sports Association can help to professionalise the management and administration of sport at community level. That is what gets kids in&#8212;if they can go along to a well-run local facility where there <place-holder colnum=\"29538\"/> is good coaching and some local connection that they can identify with, and if it is not too rarefied for them. I was glad that Jim Hume mentioned the governing bodies, and I am glad that we have talked about that at the cross-party group on sport.</p><p>I am not meaning to criticise anybody, but spending money on extravagant opening ceremonies sits ill in countries that can hardly afford that sort of thing, where the organisers feel that they have to put on a show at the big sporting occasions. We will have to market Scotland to the world during Glasgow's games, but we should use imagination more than cash if we do not want to run foul of the people who depend on us to make their lives a bit better&#8212;we should ensure that the legacy fits in with their needs.</p><p>The more people run, jump, throw and kick, the more people will become good at it and the more medal winners we will get. We do not need to work at it all that much, provided that we are all in it together, to coin a phrase. All I ask all members at this debate to do is ensure that our other colleagues sign the pledge for sport.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21007025", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I put on record my thanks to James Kelly for bringing this debate to the chamber.

It is unfortunate that the Government did not go into greater detail about specifics but I <place-holder colnum=\"28305\"/> guess that it knew perfectly well that we were into the pre-election period.</p><p>The reason I am spending so much time on this issue is because everyone is talking about manifesto commitments. We all know that this Parliament is unlikely to produce a Government with a sufficiently large majority to see through such commitments. Before Jackson Laidlaw&#8212;Jackson Carlaw, rather&#8212;gets upset&#8212;[<em>Interruption</em>.] I am really doing it today; I was not thinking of him. Anyway, before he gets upset, I should say that I did not produce a manifesto; instead, I had a list of things to do and explained to folk in Edinburgh and the Lothians that these were my priorities and that I would, if possible, try to do them or would certainly support anyone else trying to do so. That was as much as I could honestly promise; indeed, I think that that is as much as any of the parties can honestly promise. We have missed an opportunity today to begin to investigate an important issue.</p><p>However, the SNP had a manifesto commitment to have a referendum on independence and everyone seemed to think that it was a good idea. I have to say, though, that I never agreed. That is why the SNP got fed up with me. The Deputy First Minister will remember the conversation&#8212;it was, I recall, conducted at a very high decibel level&#8212;during which I explained that a referendum was neither a policy nor a strategy but a tactic. I have maintained that position and I bet the SNP now wishes that it had listened to me.</p><p>In any case, the SNP said that it was going to have a referendum and it should do so. I am very much in favour of that. In fact, I am thinking of lodging a motion that there should be a referendum and all the members of the other parties who want one can sign it. The SNP should be campaigning for independence and the only way it can do so is by explaining it in the terms that Des McNulty outlined&#8212;that it is a policy of interest to people all over Scotland&#8212;and by telling people what they can aspire to. Yesterday's front page story in <em>The Herald</em> shows what people have at the moment; according to that article, 21 out of 24 schoolchildren in a primary 7 class in Glasgow have been committed to failure, abject frustration, danger, shortened lives, brutishness and unemployment. That is the union's legacy and the legacy that the unionists in the Parliament will have to defend. If that is the Opposition, why is the SNP not prepared to fight for independence? I do not understand the SNP's tactics and think that it is selling itself and Scotland short by failing to introduce the bill now.</p><p>No one can be bothered with constitutional things if they are just put in a box and if folk do not know whether they are going to be in a job next week or whether they can afford to stay in their <place-holder colnum=\"28306\"/> house. If the SNP cannot explain why we need the constitutional powers to ensure that the exchange rate, for example, really suits our economy, it will never be able to get people to understand the link between the mechanism for delivering decent policies and the decent policies themselves.</p><p>We were told, \"Ah well, we were getting close to thinking that maybe we should have greater powers,\" but, the minute the banks failed, the unionists said, \"We knew we couldn't do it as Scotland.\" What would have happened if we had been independent when the banks collapsed? What would we take as the date of independence? Would we take it as two days before the banks went down or, say, when the Parliament was set up in 1999? What would the state of the Scottish reserves have been if we had been independent since 1999? What ability would we have had to cut our financial coat according to our financial cloth? What ability would there have been to regulate, given that the consensus in this Parliament is a bit more left of centre than that in the Westminster Parliament? I do not think that we would have had a lack of regulation; I think we would have followed the Swedish model. The Swedes knew what they were doing and, as a result, their economy is doing well. The Norwegian economy was in a different situation and adopted different policies.</p><p>That is the whole point. There is such a difference between the Scottish economy and the British economy as a whole, or even the English economy, that we should have different policies. That does not mean that we will separate or be antagonistic or have gun towers at the border; it just means having policies that are suited to our condition. That is what the SNP should argue through its referendum bill. That is what the other parties have to deny and, right now, the other parties have never been in a worse position.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20976559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise&#8212;I did not see the member.

Because it might be a little better for this Parliament to take more responsibility for our decisions on health, education and social policies. But why not full responsibility? Why not responsibility for pensions and benefits?

It needed to be previously, although I take on board what Chris Harvie said.</p><p>I speak poor-quality Portuguese and even worse French, and I can also have a shot at some of the other Mediterranean languages because I was lucky enough to be taught Latin alongside English, which is an idea that I have commended to previous education ministers. Nevertheless, I still think that other things should take precedence in the budget for Scottish education. The main point, which we have heard about today although it was skipped over, is whether the quality of our teacher training in colleges is what it used to be&#8212;not what it should be, which is probably better than what it used to be. According to many an old teacher, in attempting to cover too wide an area we have diluted the quality of our teacher training. I suggest that, if Finland is the benchmark, we should see how it and other countries are training their teachers.</p><p>I am grateful for the time to speak, but I will finish on this point. I mentioned America because, as far as I know, in most comparative tables of attainment America does not do all that well. However, there are specific areas in which the American education system excels. We should find out in what we need to excel.

I hope that Mr Rumbles will explain why that recommendation was not accepted.</p><p>Members should not infer from my amendment that I think that the Health and Sport Committee is the only committee capable of investigating the bill. However, I think that it is the best prepared to do so because of its experience of working in a collegiate fashion over a wide range of health-related issues and, as a group, being prepared to agree to disagree over detail A while showing, when necessary, complete unity of purpose in facing down the Government over detail B. The <place-holder colnum=\"23700\"/> committee's credibility is enhanced not only by the membership of two general practitioners but by the bonus of one of them having specialist psychiatric experience. I also believe it to be a bonus that, although she does not know where she comes down on the bill, the convener thinks that there should be a public debate because of the public interest in the matter.</p><p>That I believe that the balance of opinion is probably against the bill is of no import, but it is very important that the committee's composition should result in balanced scrutiny. That is relevant because, with such a bill, on which members will have a free vote that they will cast according to conscience, the expected outcome is not a report signed off in the committee's name that has the support of the majority of members but an in-depth summary of the information that the committee's investigation has uncovered, which will be presented to MSPs as a neutral document, not as a recommendation.</p><p>I also presume that the Health and Sport Committee will be considering the forthcoming bill on palliative care.</p><p>Perhaps the strongest reason for MSPs to support the amendment is that, if they do not, the impression will be transmitted to the public in Scotland and beyond of the Parliament as a latter-day Tammany hall, when we could instead demonstrate our ability to deal with sensitive legislation in an efficient and intellectually and morally robust manner. The Parliament is quite capable of doing that, thereby recovering some of the respect and hope that our political and public institutions have lost during the past few years. We will lose that opportunity and create the impression that we are out of our depth when we are dealing with anything other than the mediocre, mundane and unimaginative, which could be the charge that is levelled at us if we vote to demote the Parliament's trust in its Health and Sport Committee's professionalism and probity.

My first suggestion is that everyone should read the financial pages because the reticence of the UK party leaders cannot hide the deficit: &#163;178 billion this year alone, with total Government debt heading for more than &#163;1 trillion. Anyone who thinks that cuts can be avoided this year probably thinks that things can only get better and that Tony Blair told the truth at the Chilcot inquiry.</p><p>If there are cuts, they will bear heavily on local government. Councils already face cuts of &#163;270 million and job losses that are forecast to mount into the many thousands. I propose an area of expenditure that should be considered for cuts by the cabinet secretary but which, to date, has been ignored&#8212;the enormous sum our councils and health boards dish out to the PFI owners of what look like but are not public assets: schools and hospitals, to start with. We have to realise that the Parliament is not spending taxpayers' money; we are spending their debt. Every penny that we have spent in our &#163;30 billion-plus budget is borrowed <place-holder colnum=\"23397\"/> money. If we were a commercial organisation facing that situation, we would seek to renegotiate contracts in order to shrink our debt. I propose the same principle, given that the people we represent now face deep cuts in their public services. If we are all in this together, no organisations can be excluded.</p><p>We are in the ridiculous situation that the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland&#8212;which are Government owned on our behalf&#8212;extract money from local authorities and other public bodies while causing misery for thousands. In the meantime, we keep the banks alive with borrowed money that, eventually, the taxpayer will have to pay, on top of what is paid on PFI. Is that freakonomics or crazy economics? Members can take their pick. From 2010 to 2012, Midlothian Council will pay &#163;21.3 million through PFI, West Lothian Council will pay &#163;25.3 million and the City of Edinburgh Council will pay &#163;85.6 million. Those councils could be forced into sacking people whose taxes saved the banks and the financial system in the first place.</p><p>PFI contracts were negotiated when money was rolling in and prudence was the order of the day, but the world has changed.

If it does not do so, the UK's credit rating, along with the pound, will go through the floor. We know the story. Some of us&#8212;Mr Chisholm and I&#8212;are old enough to have been here before.</p><p>Given that we are shackled to the British economy&#8212;the strong economy of Great Britain&#8212;Mr Swinney can do little to soften the blow without our having the sovereign powers that are needed to allow us to customise a recovery programme that is suited to our needs, as other economies have done. Despite being smaller and less generously resourced than Scotland, some of those countries are now out of the recession in which we will remain mired for anything between five and 10 years, so it ill behoves any member of this Parliament to be nasty about little Iceland and the Icelanders, and to say that the First Minister is wrong to compare the success that Ireland enjoyed with the success that we in Scotland might enjoy if we could customise our own policies.</p><p>I am old enough to remember Ireland being used by the Labour Party to suggest that we should not have independence, because if we did so, we would end up as poor as the Irish. It is inevitable that we look to countries around us, whose people look very much like us and who have the same dreams and aspirations that we have, to find out how they managed to achieve more than we did. As Mr McLetchie admitted, we in Scotland must always anticipate there being an achievement gap between the Scottish economy and the economy of the rest of the UK.</p><p>I am not prepared to hide from the realities that are resulting in unemployment for the constituents whom Shirley-Anne Somerville and I represent, increasing numbers of whom are having to cope with the cuts in public spending. A very high percentage of the population of Edinburgh and its travel-to-work area in the Lothians and Fife are employed in the public sector. That fact alone makes a nonsense of the think tank report that was published a few days ago that claimed to have research data that showed that Edinburgh&#8212;the only Scottish city in the group of cities that was identified&#8212;would lead the UK out of recession. That is absolute bunkum. We do not know how high unemployment in Edinburgh will be until the cuts are made in public spending. The result will be unemployment, underemployment and part-time employment, which means part-time wages.</p><p>What ails the Scottish economy, and the part that is played in its stimulation by our capital city, <place-holder colnum=\"22908\"/> cannot be cured by optimism alone, even if it comes wrapped in Mr McLetchie's union flag. However, at this juncture in our pre-sovereign state, a number of low-cost initiatives might help to mitigate unemployment and add value to our human and built resources and our skills base. To that end, I urge the cabinet secretary to read carefully Wendy Alexander's speech in the <em>Official Report</em>, because she made some excellent points that resonated right across the chamber.</p><p>I hope that in my pre-budget discussions with the cabinet secretary I have persuaded him to set aside a modest sum for a pilot project that will draw on the experience of a scheme administered by Historic Scotland that has instigated a small number of stonemasonry apprenticeships for young people. The skills entailed in working with stone are in danger of being lost. None of Scotland's cities, historic burghs or monuments can endure without those skills being on hand to maintain our built heritage. Apprenticeships in the stonework crafts should lead to jobs for life and the preservation of the distinctiveness of our towns and cities. Spending money on a pilot scheme in the capital and Lothian region would be a sound investment at this time.</p><p>Like many local authorities, the City of Edinburgh Council is concerned that its capital budget will be knocked sideways because of a number of factors. Mr McLetchie referred to our meeting with councillors earlier this week. The damage that has been done to our roads by the current severe weather comes to mind.</p><p>One capital spend project that must, of necessity, come in on time is the refurbishment of the royal Commonwealth pool, which is a Commonwealth games venue in 2014 and is currently closed for a complete refurbishment. The diving pool must be brought up to the required international standard, and that costs money. I appreciate that some &#163;5 million has already been spent, but observing the standards and specifications that are dictated by the building's listed status costs a bit more, and I think that the costs will continue to rise as the project goes on. The cabinet secretary knows that the council, the capital's council tax payers and I hope that he will accept such special-case pleading for a modest financial contribution from him for exceptional one-off expenditure on a Commonwealth games venue. I apologise if that sounds a wee bit like pork-barrel politics, but it is just a little of what I might be able to do.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20511867", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 4) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You write to me often, but I do not think of myself as being an agony aunt.

I was attracted to the SBCC because it is not just a shake-your-can voluntary organisation; it tries to shake the establishment and shake up the policies that affect breast cancer services. Partly because of its questionnaire 2000, which was a record that the SBCC compiled of the treatment and experience of every woman in Scotland who had been diagnosed with breast cancer over the previous two years, we were able to contribute to the improvement of services. However, as Christine Grahame pointed out, the letter still takes far too long to get to the women concerned&#8212;the letter that every woman dreads.

The SBCC is particularly interested in endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are found in plastics, cosmetics, body care products and cleaning products.

Karen Gillon, who is not here, could attest to that. She did a huge amount of work to try to make PE serious and worthy of the respect that other classroom subjects get.</p><p>I am happy that the committee did not pull its punches in its report. There was mention of lukewarm headteachers. The best lessons in that regard can be learned from East Renfrewshire Council, which must have worked out how to timetable PE along with all the examinable subjects and still produce good academic results.</p><p>There are lukewarm councils. Members have said that no one takes responsibility for the delivery of the programme. Long ago, when dinosaurs still gambolled about the earth, we had PE organisers in councils who delivered the programme for the council and the Government. Perhaps that idea could be revisited.</p><p>There are lukewarm inspectors, too. HMIE betrayed the snobbery about the status of PE in the school curriculum that I described. The status of PE is improving, but we still have a long way to go and HMIE might be the last to get on that train as it pulls out of the station.</p><p>Christine Grahame said that if people are keen, PE will happen. I am glad that many members said that being keen is not enough. Many teachers <place-holder colnum=\"19620\"/> are as keen as mustard but cannot teach for toffee. We need good, well-trained teachers.</p><p>The report emphasised the importance of getting them young. Physical literacy was mentioned in the context of pre-school education&#8212;that is the context in which I understand the concept. I have 10 grandchildren, all of whom were subjected to time with their grandma out in the garage in the middle of winter, learning how to throw, catch, pass a ball and so on, with cut-down clubs, bats, rackets and all the rest of it. That is what physical literacy is about. However, some children are more literate than others, which is why I have difficulty working out how we could have a system of examination of physical literacy and PE attainment that would equate to our approach to examining other subjects.</p><p>The report also mentions the legacy from the Olympic games in London and the Commonwealth games in Scotland. If \"legacy\" means physical structures or the motivation to take part in sport or physical activity that we pass on to the people who come after us, it is already in place. The legacy should include kick-starting the active schools programme and links between what happens in schools and community sport and clubs. The committee's recommendation that there should be a conference to consider the matter is a good one, but the end result of the conference must be agreed in advance. We do not want another conference at which everyone starts by saying who they are and where they are from&#8212;there are far too many conferences like that. We know what we want to do; we need to work out how to deliver it.</p><p>There is less mention in the report than I would have wanted there to be of the type of PE that is provided in PE teacher-training programmes. I have a query about the courses that are currently taught. The report welcomes the one-year course, but there are one-year courses and one-year courses. I caution members that people who go into the one-year course after having done an academic degree are often good at one particular sport&#8212;they are specialists&#8212;and inspirational in it, but they are not necessarily qualified to teach physical education.</p><p>I would like the Government to assess the various courses that are on offer and to consider whether they are becoming far too academic. Is the PE certificate in schools also far too academic? Among PE teachers, there are too many stories of students coming out who cannot deliver any shots in netball and do not know about football and rugby because all that they did was class work.</p><p>I will finish on the reality of sport in the community and quote the experience of Hutchison Vale Football Club, which is a marvellous <place-holder colnum=\"19621\"/> organisation. It has been going for 70 years and coaches hundreds of kids every week. Some of its graduates are Allan McGregor and Steven Whittaker of Rangers Football Club, Gary Caldwell of Celtic Football Club, Ian Murray of Hibernian Football Club, Gary Naysmith, Andy Driver, Darren Fletcher, Kevin Thomson, John Collins, Kenny Miller and Derek Riordan, who is very good.</p><p>Hutchie Vale knows what it is like, in difficult areas, to take children on board, take them through and make them enthusiasts. In 1993, it introduced the measured steps system for six to 11-year-olds. In 1998, the programme had 130 kids, 45 per cent of whom had addresses in Broomhouse&#8212;not the most salubrious of areas&#8212;and the club charged them 50p a week. In 2001, it had to move to a new public-private partnership school and charge the kids &#163;3 a week; only 7 per cent of them had addresses in Broomhouse. That is the reality for far too many clubs when they have to deal with new facilities.</p><p>Paragraph 277 of the report says it all:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"On the basis of the evidence, the conclusion that the Committee draws is that nobody has taken responsibility for delivering on the policy.\"</p><p>If we have helped to clear that up this afternoon and inspire someone to take that responsibility, we will have done a good job.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pathways into Sport and Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I had no intention of referring to the member's big blue knickers.

I have figured out that &#163;3.3 million is going spare, which suits me fine for the capital city grant. I thought I would get that in quickly.</p><p>Why on earth is the Government persisting in bringing forward a referendum bill? It knows that it cannot get the thing through. It does not really have to stand on the dignity of its manifesto commitment; these days, people outside the Parliament like politicians who are able to say, \"Whoops&#8212;I got that one wrong, and I'd like to change it.\" Why does the Government not do that? It did so with the local income tax, and, as far as I am aware, its rating has not gone down in the opinion polls.</p><p>Unfortunately, the SNP has tactically boxed itself into a corner. It confused&#8212;as the Deputy First Minister and I once discussed&#8212;a tactic with a policy or strategy. It is a tactic that one would only use to pursue a campaign, and the Government will not manage to deploy it properly, so it should forget it. The time is not right, as umpteen members in the chamber have said. People are not concerned with that just now; it is not their priority.</p><p>The Government has not done enough to inform people in Scotland of what independence feels like, what it actually is and how it applies to them in their small corner of the world. Not nearly enough work is being done to get the Parliament to start thinking constitutionally. I do not see why the SNP feels that it has to shoulder the whole burden now, because there are members on all sides of the chamber who agree that the present set-up is not satisfactory. We need to explore together how we can advance the Parliament.</p><p>I would like there to be sovereign powers, because I am certain that that is the best delivery mechanism for the policies of any of the parties in the Parliament that might be elected to Government. There is much more common ground among current members of the Parliament than they allow themselves to express, but the constitutional question has become so enmeshed with party politics that members cannot concede that their party opponent might have a good idea. The aspirations that the First Minister outlined this morning were noble: the sort of standards that we should set ourselves and the targets for which we should aim. I do not believe that any member in the chamber disagreed with those aspirations, but they could not say, \"Oh, I agree with that,\" because they were in the wrong party. I would like the SNP to drop the whole idea of forcing people <place-holder colnum=\"19236\"/> into a position that their experience of being an MSP has possibly taken them out of, if ever they were in it.</p><p>We waste time in party politicking when the world is marching ahead. The world is setting up all sorts of new institutions and forms of co-operation, and methods of delivering services for people. We should be thinking about that, but we cannot do so properly if we are too busy playing ducks and drakes in the chamber over a constitutional question that is still very academic for most people outside the Parliament. They do not view it as the delivery mechanism for policies, and I sometimes think that the SNP does not either.</p><p>We heard from Annabel Goldie, who thinks that it will all happen when David Cameron gets into power. That will be another false dawn. I have nothing against the man, but he is operating in a system that has been failing us for a very long time now. It has kept us relatively successful, but I do not want to be relatively successful compared to some regions in the United Kingdom. I want us to be optimally successful: as successful as we possibly can be.</p><p>We know that the Westminster model does not deliver that, so I cannot see why Alex Johnstone persists&#8212;och well, perhaps I can. Perhaps he will relax a bit in the next session of Parliament when he, along with Annabel Goldie, realises that David Cameron does not have all the answers.</p><p>Des McNulty made an excellent speech in which he pointed out some of the things that we could and should be doing.

In the interests of accuracy, I wonder whether I might take issue with her opening remarks. She said that had Scotland been independent, there is no doubt that&#8212;if members will excuse the metaphor&#8212;we would have been all at sea when the tsunami hit us. Had Scotland been independent, we might have had a Labour Government and we might have repatriated Gordon Brown to run the economy in Scotland. We cannot choose our hypotheses without looking at the corollaries. The corollaries would have been that we would have had the same sort of oil fund as Norway has. We might well have had a leftish Government and the sort of regulations on the financial centre that there <place-holder colnum=\"18296\"/> should have been. I urge Helen Eadie to take that into account when she says what it might have been like had we been independent.</p><p>In the interests of historical accuracy, I correct my friend James Kelly. It was not the SNP that brought down the Thatcher Government; it was a man called Frank Maguire, who represented Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and who abstained in the vote of confidence. He is the man to blame if we are handing out blame.</p><p>I apologise to Dave Whitton for reminding him that the miners' strike was a bit more complex than he presented it. I pay tribute to men such as Davey Hamilton&#8212;a present member of the House of Commons&#8212;for his efforts in the miners' strike, but that does not take away anything from my criticism of the Government. I am sure that there are Labour members in this chamber who are a wee bit embarrassed by some of the things that the present Labour Government in London has done.</p><p>Do we need a general election to give Labour a chance to stay in government or to hand over to&#8212;I forget his name&#8212;the nice Tory man? No, we do not need a general election for that reason; we need a general election to get rid of the stench of corruption and the disgust that people feel with the democratic process, and for the very practical reasons that were advanced by Derek Brownlee. We are walking a tightrope as far as the finances of not just Scotland but the United Kingdom are concerned, and we had better get off the tightrope and start being honest about the choices that we have to make on spending cuts. As I have said before in the chamber, it will not matter who is elected in London.</p><p>David McLetchie mentioned that we should debate the constitution and I could not agree more.

It would have meant that we spent the time between now and the inevitable general election, which will come not sooner but later, informing people in Scotland of the constitutional choices. Then, depending on the outcome of the election, we could use that as the basis for renegotiation either of advanced devolution or, as I hope, the transfer of sovereignty to this Parliament.

It might be a good idea for the people in here to trust the people out there and consult them on how they want to determine priorities during a time of spending cuts and contraction of services. We cannot service our debt without making cuts or&#8212;more likely&#8212;having a mixture of tax increases and cuts. I find some agreement with that analysis from Ross Finnie. We know that cuts will happen, so why do we not consult our communities? The STUC could do that by working in conjunction with representatives from the Parliament. That would ensure that people were properly informed and allow them to make the priority choices that suit them and not us. If we are serious about cleaning up politics, that is how we can start. We could do that between now and the general election.</p><p>There will be a general election, so people should just put up with it. We should try to ensure that we get something better for Scotland from the election. That is not selfish; it just makes sense.

I love Willie Nelson, Alan Jackson, Dwight Yoakam, Reba McEntire and all of the country scene, but I am not blind to the fact that we have an unequal relationship with the USA when it comes to nuclear weapons and things like that.

It would also be good to get hold of Dermot McQuarrie, whose father, Albert, was a Conservative MP and who is a vice-president of the Fox Broadcasting Company.</p><p>We have never exploited those avenues because we have not thought clearly about the priorities of Scotland week. Is the priority to promote the profile of Scotland and make ourselves better known as a community or to build up business links? I am not at all sure, but I think that the Irish know what their priorities are. First, they built on the notion of Ireland. Their television adverts promote the island of Ireland&#8212;I point out to Ted Brocklebank that they are not in the least hung up about reminding folk that the north of Ireland is still British; they simply market Ireland as an identity. We should do exactly the same thing: we should market ourselves not as part of the United Kingdom but as Scotland, distinct and unique.</p><p>If the priority is business, presumably it makes good business sense to target our effort either sectionally, geographically or both. Charlie Gordon got that right in his speech. I thought that I heard hints that that is happening already, and I hope to <place-holder colnum=\"17547\"/> hear more about that when the minister sums up. We heard that there have been three visits to Maryland. Profile or business? I would like to know what the priority is. It is not good enough to say that they like us, so we go back to see them. There must be more focus.</p><p>I urge the minister to separate those two strands. He should think big with regard to identity and image and think in a focused way with regard to business. I am sure that I am trying to teach my grandfather to suck eggs, of course. Rob Gibson pointed to big thinking in terms of business when he talked about tidal technology. That is the kind of thing on which we can go international&#8212;we are as good as anybody in the world in that regard.</p><p>I have enjoyed the debate.

The motion also reminds members of the particular relevance of the decision to support the merger, which a more analytical observer might describe as a takeover. It refers to the inevitable and quantifiable increase in the number of people who are likely to become unemployed in the financial sectors in Edinburgh, the Lothians and the capital's travel-to-work area, and the less easily measurable but nonetheless adverse impact on the city's self-confidence and reputation as a secure and well-managed financial centre, which has implications not only for the people who live in this area but for all of Scotland, in terms of the economic generation that has been ramping up in the city over the past decade.</p><p>But it is a done deal, is it not? Why bother to rake over cold embers, even if the commonly held view among people who work in the sector is that the merger was not such a get-out-of-jail move as was assumed last September, when Gordon Brown and his chancellor sprang their news that <place-holder colnum=\"17401\"/> there would be no investigation into the so-called merger? At the time, I and others said, \"Oh, they probably really didn't have any choice.\" In fact, probably everybody said that. However, by the middle of October, the situation in other banks was not much different from that in HBOS and Lloyds TSB. The merger was therefore seen in a quite different context. We had thought that the proposed merger was a stand-alone crisis that left the Government with no choice other than to wave it through before the banks' depositors left one or other or both of the banks high and dry. By October, it was obvious that the same flawed lending policies had been pursued by other banks, and that a strategic policy, rather than an emergency reaction, was required.</p><p>Months before shareholders voted on the merger proposal, other options should have been explored to address what was known to be a systemic weakness, so why did that not happen? Why did Gordon Brown, whose reputation was built on his being a prudent chancellor, fail to take advantage of the time bonus that was bestowed on him by other banks here and abroad being in the same pickle? The suspicion is that this most political of Prime Ministers stuck to his initial decision for political reasons, in spite of having been given time to let the normal practices on mergers come into play, and in defiance of the widespread and growing opinion among banking professionals that the size of the merged bank would break European Union and United Kingdom rules.</p><p>We should not forget, when we are trying to work out why Gordon Brown in particular did not take advantage of the time that he had been given, the initial approval of the decisive action that he took. That approval got him out from under the weight of accusations that followed his cop-out from calling an election&#8212;accusations that he was an indecisive ditherer. Almost overnight, his reputation changed. There has to be some reason, other than the business case for a merger, to explain why Gordon Brown threw so much weight behind the merger in the period leading up to the shareholders' meetings and votes.</p><p>It may be significant that Lord Mandelson, having succeeded John Hutton as Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on 3 October, made plain from the outset his opinion that recapitalisation of the two banks would be dependent on the merger going ahead. Some members may recall that he seemed to jump in before he had had time to think the thing through.</p><p>Although the Prime Minister said that he did not see the reports from the Financial Services Authority&#8212;reports that pulled together information that the banks supplied on their financial health&#8212;it <place-holder colnum=\"17402\"/> seems most unlikely, given his known propensity to micromanage other departments' policies when he was chancellor, that he did not glance at the more independent reports produced jointly by the Bank of England, the Treasury and the FSA. He cannot have been unaware of their concerns about anti-competitiveness, or of the concerns expressed by the Office of Fair Trading relating to personal accounts and banking services for small and medium-sized enterprises in Scotland, or of concerns expressed about the impact on the mortgage market.</p><p>I accept that the suspicions that I have outlined&#8212;and they are only suspicions&#8212;as to the reasons for the failure to test the efficacy of the proposed merger against the normal standards cannot be proved without a complete record of the interdepartmental information exchange in the period from 18 September 2008, when the merger was first announced, and the decision of Lord Mandelson to proceed with the merger in spite of the OFT reporting on 24 October that, since the onset of its investigation, market conditions had \"changed considerably\".</p><p>The OFT report advised caution. It emphasised the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"enormous importance of the mortgage business to the UK economy.\"</p><p>It also warned, given the market conditions, that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the combination of the largest and third largest mortgage provider is significant enough to cause concern.\"</p><p>The report concluded that the proposed merger would result in a \"substantial lessening of competition.\" Frankly, the redactions applied \"in the public interest\" to my request for the papers that might explain why the original plan was unaltered, even when the market conditions had changed hugely, have compromised the transparency of this whole episode. The question has to be why. If it is a done deal, why can we not understand it better?</p><p>The point at which my suspicions tipped over into certainty that there should be a public inquiry into the merger came with the reported refusal of Lord Mandelson's department to hand over a document considered in camera at the appeal by the anti-merger group. The group was told that the document had been destroyed. Even if that is true, it strengthens the case for an inquiry into the merger decision-making process that led to shareholders voting when they may not have been in possession of the full facts about the soundness of HBOS, the effect on the mortgage market and the competitiveness of the merger. If it is not true, an inquiry is essential to discover what had to be hidden in the public interest.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14977903", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: HBOS-Lloyds TSB Merger"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I realise that, in a members' business debate, one does not seek votes, but I am looking for all men and women of good will to give me their support in my efforts to establish that there should be more investigation into the business of the HBOS-Lloyds TSB merger.

Among sports people and those who are interested in sport, it is not heresy to say that the important thing is not for more people to win gold medals but for more people to play sport. Over the years, I have made that point in this chamber and said that, if we do not have a big pool to draw from, we will not get the elite athletes.</p><p>I agree with Frank McAveety's conclusion, which was&#8212;and I paraphrase&#8212;that the legacy of the Glasgow games should be about people living better. Whether that is defined in the cerebral sense or in people living more healthily or in better houses, the legacy should be about an improvement for everyone who is associated with the games.</p><p>We must not do what I think Bill Aitken suggested and place too many expectations on the games. They will never deliver everything for Scotland that we want them to deliver. For example, our football clubs are already tackling the challenge of getting young people into sport and a healthier lifestyle. A recent meeting of the cross-party group on sport heard from the Rangers Football Club's community development team. Some wonderful work is being done by the Hibernian Football Club by way of its youth programme. Last Sunday, I had the delight of watching some of the youngsters who had come through the programme, but that is another story. That work is being done, and we should not downplay it.</p><p>We should not expect the games to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. If it was possible to do that, the current interest that many kids in Scotland have in the progress of English football teams in the European cup would mean that many more people got out there and played football. That is not happening and, instead, the phenomenon is ensuring that more people stay in to watch football games on television.</p><p>As Frank McAveety rightly said, for the legacy that we hope to inherit from the games, we have to turn to physical education and activity. It will come from people who understand the relevance and importance of sport. Physical education starts in <place-holder colnum=\"16773\"/> schools or pre-schools, and I am glad that Frank McAveety now says that it has to at the centre of the school timetable. In the past, among other Scottish classroom teachers, he was guilty at times of an intellectual snobbery towards PE. He thought that it was a frill; it is not a frill. I will not quote any Latin tags, but I remind the chamber of the \"healthy mind, healthy body\" philosophy. That has always been true&#8212;indeed, it has never been truer than it is today.</p><p>Reference has been made to the joining together of sportscotland and the former Scottish Institute of Sport. The cross-party group on sport recently visited the Stirling centre of excellence, and I was very impressed by its focus. I reassure the minister that, although I disagreed with&#8212;and still do not really agree with&#8212;the fusion of the two bodies, it seems to be working well. Sportscotland seems to have worked how to keep both the elite and the community strand of its activities going.</p><p>When we were in Stirling, we were assured that a good range of programmes were in place to prepare elite athletes for the Commonwealth games. We will certainly do well, although performance will be patchy across different sports. That will be down not to the Commonwealth games organisation but to whether sports and sports governing bodies are organised well enough to promote their best athletes through the ranks. I wish that the Gladiator Programme to which Margaret Curran referred was available in all sports and all parts of Scotland, but it is not. We should seek to develop that template throughout sport in Scotland.</p><p>No automatic benefit for our national health and wellbeing will come from the Commonwealth games. I was glad to hear the minister say that everyone must examine what part they will play in the process of improving health standards, participation and activity in Scotland. As Frank McAveety and others have said, PE is the key. If the minister has anything to do with the education department, she had better see it about getting PE teachers into schools. They are being trained and are waiting to be employed; if we mean what we say about the legacy from the games, they should be employed.</p><p>On funding, I appreciate that there is some argument between those members who are interested in whether we are owed money from London. Let us forget that for the moment and accept that there will be cuts in public expenditure. The games are not directly funded by Government, but local authorities, which are essential for doing the things that I have described, such as employing the teachers who are needed to engender much greater sporting activity, will suffer more cuts. No one should bother denying that; instead, we should try to work <place-holder colnum=\"16774\"/> out how we will offset such cuts. If the Glasgow games are to have wider economic benefits, they must look good, classy, professional and big; if we do not have the money to spend on them, they will not. We had better admit now that the local authorities, voluntary organisations and clubs that will feed into the process will experience difficulties.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor referred to the lottery funding that has been taken from Glasgow, and we should certainly pursue that issue. The member's nose was tweaked a bit by Michael Matheson when he spoke about funding, but I know that, across the chamber, members who are interested in sport have a common approach&#8212;this debate has shown that. The minister must take what has been said not as criticism but as constructive comment and ideas. I wish her all the best.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14940684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow 2014 Legacy Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with most of what Ian McKee said.

The referendum was proposed about a decade ago, when the SNP was not cutting too much mustard. It was a bad idea then to try to short-circuit an honest campaign of information about the merits of independence and it is an even worse idea now, given current global political and economic affairs.</p><p>Had my amendment been selected, I would also have tried to appeal to my friends and opponents in the Opposition parties in the Parliament. I would have asked them to admit that the political landscape has changed dramatically since they first pounced on the SNP's ill-thought-out tactic&#8212;the referendum is a tactic, not a policy or a strategy&#8212;as a convenient stick with which to beat it. The Opposition parties also owe it to Scots to probe fundamentally many of the assumptions that marked the previous demarcation line between nationalists and unionists.</p><p>Ever since the Parliament was established, the certainty felt by many&#8212;perhaps most&#8212;members in the pro-union parties that Westminster was Scotland's best shield against comparative poverty, aggressive attack and anonymity on the world stage must have been shaken, if not shattered, by the proof of Westminster's inability to shelter us from economic storms now or in the future.</p><p>Let us have a national catch-up campaign to work out where stands Scotland in what might be a brave, and is certainly a new world order, instead of the tired old reprise of the old arguments and politicians singing the same old songs at each other.</p><p>I have always believed that we can achieve the optimum benefit for all the people who live in Scotland only if we stretch ourselves to the limit, exercise full sovereign powers, rely on our determination and imagination and accept responsibility for the effect of our actions on people outwith our borders. That is how we will grow as a community and a nation. That is what I have always wanted for Scotland, and since I have been in this Parliament that belief has grown.</p><p>How we express our unique contribution to the global economy and to internationalism must change with the times. To pick up on what Mr Rumbles said, this Parliament requires the sovereignty, or independence, to order its own priorities, whether in defence, foreign relations or <place-holder colnum=\"15470\"/> social policies. The dominance of London, which was the centre of perhaps the greatest empire that the world has ever seen, lives on in folk memory and in its assumptions about how it relates to the rest of the country. We must establish equality in the union.</p><p>In the other union of which we are a part, times are a changing&#8212;perhaps we should think about changing, too. Following enlargement, countries in the European Union with a common interest are forming groups such as the Mediterranean group and the Baltic group. That is probably inevitable. Should not the offshore grouping of islands presently encompassed in the British-Irish Council respond to EU and global realpolitik by developing co-operation in policies and operations and a social union among the peoples of these islands?</p><p>If we establish sovereignty for Scotland and Wales, if that is what the Welsh want, what is to hinder the formation of a new union among the nations and regions of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland&#8212;or a united Ireland, if that is what the communities there want&#8212;the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands? Perhaps there can even be a new style of autonomy for our island groups in the north, if that is what they want. I suggested that such co-operation could be referred to as a new union, but it would be a union of the spirit, not of the institutions and fixed furniture of Government. The latter can be overtaken by events, as we have just seen.

The need for affordable housing is growing probably at a faster rate than in other local authorities, with 145 people chasing every council or housing <place-holder colnum=\"14437\"/> association house that comes up for rent. Because of the Edinburgh region's reliance on financial services, economists are now confirming the fears that I have voiced to Mr Swinney both in this chamber and elsewhere when I have bumped into him. The shortage of affordable rented accommodation could produce a housing and homelessness crisis because of the high percentage of people made redundant by the banks, who could find that their mortgage repayments are now impossible to meet.</p><p>While I welcome the recent moves by the Government to direct money into housing associations to buy up property that the private sector is unable to sell&#8212;an idea that I floated with house builders in Edinburgh before the summer break because it will make more social housing available&#8212;unfortunately the number of houses announced yesterday by the other cabinet secretary, Ms Sturgeon, will not be enough.</p><p>I am aware of the limitations of the money available to the finance minister. There are statutory obligations that must be met, and certain essentials that the Parliament committed him to, such as care for the elderly and free bus passes. Those and other spending items severely restrict the amount of free spending room he has. However, I and other MSPs who represent Edinburgh and Lothians must not allow our sympathies for his predicament to blind us to the fact that, if the prognosis of serious economists is correct, we face an avalanche of job losses and repossessions, with all that that implies, such as broken families and a substantial rise in the number of people who need social housing.

However, if that is not the case, the Government will have to respond to what will be a social tragedy for many families, which will create a demand for more social housing as a matter of priority. I hope that the finance minister can assure me that he will respond with an adequate financial package, taken from contingency or adjustment within the discretion built into the budget, for example a share of the moneys earmarked for housing that currently are not allocated to Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14643592", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 2) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Unfortunately, although I supported the cities growth fund, the fund did not prove adequate to Edinburgh's needs because the city's population growth was much greater than anyone had anticipated.

intentions.</p><p>Before I discuss my plea to the cabinet secretary on measures to mitigate the effect of economic recession on Scotland's capital, I repeat a plea that I made privately to the First Minister last week. My plea was that he build a consensus with the other party leaders in the Parliament to seek from Her Majesty's Government an immediate amendment to the Scotland Act 1998 to endow the Parliament with the borrowing powers that are required to manage and balance, to best effect, our responsibilities to develop Scotland, with sensible economic and financial management practices.</p><p>Today, as always, the Opposition has repeated at every opportunity the mantra that the &#163;33 billion that the finance secretary has to spend is more&#8212;much more&#8212;than his predecessors had. Let us be <place-holder colnum=\"13969\"/> a bit more honest with ourselves and with the Scots who are trying to work out to whom they should look for leadership in what Will Hutton of the Work Foundation described last night as Iceland on Thames and in Edinburgh. After we fulfil the commitments that, in effect, are decided by our statutory obligations, John Swinney can only move money around at the margins. That is why we need borrowing powers and an unemotional, unsentimental examination of how well the much-vaunted but busted UK economy is likely to provide the customised policies that would allow Scots to maximise their economic potential in the different circumstances that will follow what might be a decade of very low growth.</p><p>The finance secretary must do what he can to stimulate Scotland's economy with imagination and by making full use of our existing structures. He must protect the parts of our economy that are likely to provide the recovery and growth points. Edinburgh is one of those. On average, Edinburgh has contributed 13 per cent of Scotland's GDP, and much more than that in specific sectors. A recent study by Oxford Economics entitled \"Which parts of Great Britain are vulnerable to the credit crunch?\"&#8212;this answers some of Frank McAveety's points&#8212;shows the City of Edinburgh Council as the only Scottish local authority that is vulnerable. Edinburgh is ranked 14 out of 50 in the index of local authorities that are vulnerable to high numbers of job losses. Edinburgh's score in the vulnerability index is not much below that of greater London.</p><p>When the finance secretary and I met to discuss my suggestions about Edinburgh, I freely acknowledged that he has neither the statutory powers nor the resources to pull the sort of rabbit out of a hat that Lord Mandelson has demonstrated in providing &#163;20 billion in support for small businesses. However, I indicated that my support could rest on the finance secretary's willingness to show flexibility on Edinburgh's financial position if the effects of the recession produce a situation of disproportionate unemployment&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14589364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 2) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Frank McAveety for his good intentions.

I remind Frank McAveety that the criticism of the poll tax was that the duke would pay the same as the dustman. His speech contained just a hint of Orwellian doublespeak.</p><p>I have always doubted whether a local income tax could be bolted on to a comprehensive and cohesive tax system such as the one that we have in the United Kingdom. The Government's consultation paper on LIT asks who should collect the tax and whether it should be collected at source, by payment&#8212;by the taxpayer, I presume&#8212;or by a combination of the two. That is the Achilles' heel of LIT in the devolution setting. In an independent country that had its own central tax-collecting authority, there would be an <place-holder colnum=\"13072\"/> instrument to instruct on LIT collection, but that is not the case in a devolved Scotland.</p><p>Paragraph 29 of the consultation paper states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will work with the UK Government to ensure that processes are thoroughly tested before implementation.\"</p><p>That clearly implies that HM Revenue and Customs, with the agreement of the UK Government, will be the LIT collection instrument, and that the UK Government will be asked to legislate to ensure that employers, who represent the first tax collection point, are required to calculate and deduct the tax and then to send it to HMRC for onward transmission to the Scottish Government. It is difficult to see how any body other than HMRC could be the collection instrument, because if the Scottish Government set up its own equivalent, that would eat deeply into the block grant that we get from Westminster.</p><p>What puzzles me is why, despite the number of times that the First Minister has reaffirmed his determination to go ahead with LIT, we have not heard anything substantial about the Government's discussions with HMRC and the UK Government.</p><p>A constituent of mine who does voluntary research, a Mr Sillars&#8212;[<em>Laughter.</em>]&#8212;made a freedom of information request to HMRC dated 3 October. He asked for copies of correspondence&#8212;including memos and notes&#8212;between the Scottish Government and HMRC since the 2007 election on HMRC becoming involved in the collection of the SNP Government's local income tax and for any similar material from previous parliamentary sessions. He received this reply:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am writing to inform you that following a search of our paper and electronic records, I have established that HMRC does not hold the information you have requested.\"</p><p>Before any bill is published, we need to know the position regarding collection by HMRC: whether it will do it, what the cost will be, and whether we believe that it will be able to do it accurately, given that department's poor record on tax credits. If HMRC is not the chosen instrument of collection, what will be chosen, how will it be established, at what cost, and what confidence can we have that it will do the job properly?</p><p>All that I have said is, of course, predicated on the Scottish Government's proposal for a national LIT&#8212;if that is not a contradiction in terms. When it comes to 32 variable taxes, it is all the more imperative that the bill spells out the detail, complexity and cost.

I think that we could do something in relation to Edinburgh.</p><p>I commend to the cabinet secretary the City of Edinburgh Council's \"Economic Resilience Action Plan\". He could act on some of its recommendations. For example, point 4.0 of the action plan outlines measures for tackling the lack <place-holder colnum=\"12273\"/> of credit availability. Point 3.2 outlines measures to stimulate the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises. The reason why I referred earlier to the capital city supplement is that those action points, which have been identified by the City of Edinburgh Council, were not around when the Government first started to talk about the capital city supplement and decided the decent level of funding that was required to maintain the city as a contributor to the Scottish economy and as the Scottish capital.</p><p>I appeal to the cabinet secretary to take on board the extra work that Edinburgh will have to undertake because of the global economic crisis. I also ask Parliament to be open minded regarding the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. It is not a merger; it is the merger of Jonah and the whale. I say that not because of any sentimental attachment to the Bank of Scotland&#8212;something to which David McLetchie referred&#8212;but because of the corporate functions that emanate from the Mound. I would much rather that the Bank of China established its European headquarters in Edinburgh than that the city became home to the regional headquarters of a much smaller bank that would also have its annual general meeting here&#8212;maybe during the festival.</p><p>I ask members to keep an open mind on what is possible, as much has been said to drive away one very good bid that should have been on the table. It would have been on the table, had it not been for the timing of the Glenrothes by-election&#8212;that is why we did not hear of it. There should be no more talking ourselves down and talking the possible prospects down. We should let the shareholders decide, when they have a choice to make; let us not try to empty the field for any partisan reasons. I regret to say that I think that there have been Pavlovian responses from the parties. Those of us who have tried very hard to look at the employment prospects for Edinburgh and the contribution of the corporate functions of HBOS to the Edinburgh economy have tried not to be partisan. If Edinburgh is downgraded because of the loss of that headquarters, all Scotland will suffer.

I think that it was dropped for political reasons, although perhaps not.</p><p>All afternoon, we have rather tended to claim the Good Friday agreement, and the ending of hostilities in the north of Ireland, for British politicians. I think that David McLetchie was the only person who paid tribute to the work that was done by the politicians in the north of Ireland. A huge amount of work was done there, and we should all recognise that. While terrible things were going on in the north, and each community was doing damage to the other, Ian Paisley and John Hume could be spotted in wee corners of Brussels or Strasbourg, talking about what they could do together, covertly, to try to improve things. We also know from diaries that Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness were talking through back channels all through the troubles. We must not claim too much for the council of the isles as far as the ending of hostilities in the north is concerned.</p><p>I want to look ahead&#8212;and I think that it was Keith Brown who said that we should be looking ahead rather than looking back. It was good to hear the interpretations of history from different vantage points, but there are other ways of looking at things. If we look ahead, we will look to see what the council of the isles&#8212;as I will continue to call it&#8212;might lead to. David Whitton talked about the oneness of the isles and about how we had a real commonality when dealing with the real problems that beset the people in all parts of the islands. He talked about social inclusion, and I <place-holder colnum=\"11813\"/> could not agree with him more. Those are the kinds of issues that we can agree on.</p><p>Not until Keith Brown&#8212;who has form on such matters&#8212;mentioned the EU and the Committee of the Regions did anyone even think about talking about the EU. What David Whitton proved in his speech was the sense of seeing ourselves as an offshore group of islands in Europe that have much more in common with one another than we have with the rest of Europe&#8212;especially now that Europe stretches as far east as it does. We are a smaller and more homogeneous group, and I urge anyone who is thinking about how we can tackle the problems of poverty and of migration to bear that in mind. We have a common sea border, and that is the way in which we should approach the problems of mass migration, which will not go away. We are more likely to achieve a satisfactory agreement and a common policy by working through the islands than by working through the EU.</p><p>It was stated that we should work together to fix our issues. I absolutely agree. Once again, that came from David Whitton's speech. As I have just suggested, on issues such as social inclusion and migration, we can work together much more easily among ourselves. I am not suggesting being isolationist, but working among ourselves would allow us to reach policy agreements a lot quicker than would ever be possible through the EU.</p><p>The one thing on which I agree with David McLetchie is his implied cry for new relationships to be built. However, those new relationships have to be built on new institutions, which will be built on a new respect for our distinctiveness and equality as communities. We are not equal in size, but we are equal as far as our identities are concerned. We must drop the politics from the council of the isles&#8212;or the British-Irish Council, if we must call it that&#8212;and concentrate on meeting people who have the same interests as we have. We will not win Scottish independence through the British-Irish Council. I hope that we will take an independent part in the council in the future, but we will not win independence through it.

Quite right, too. However, underlying any policy on broadcasting is its importance in educating, communicating, promoting and helping to evolve a sense of community identity. That is why every distinctive national community has established a broadcasting system alongside the other requirements of a sovereign power. We should not be too polite about it; of course that is what happens, as Chris Harvie pointed out. Iain Gray quickly clocked the point as well, and went on to emphasise that it was recommended that the broadcasting system be a UK broadcasting system. However, that does not mean that it would have to be part of the UK state.</p><p>In practical terms, the days of revolutionaries capturing the local radio and TV stations are all but gone. Satellite is the new game in town and the web is where it is at, if you want to run a revolution. However, I am going to concentrate on broadcasting, and I suggest that everyone else here should do likewise. I direct members to the lesson of what happened in Qatar in 1995, when the old emir was deposed by the young emir. The first places that the young emir's people went were the local radio and television stations, but the old emir managed to hold them off for a year because he had the chequebook.</p><p>If a viewer's preference is for a quiet life watching TV for entertainment, sport or keeping up <place-holder colnum=\"11591\"/> with affairs in far-flung corners as well as the latest developments in public affairs in Scotland or over the border, it is a fair bet that they are not overly concerned about the relationship that the channels of their choice enjoy with government. Nowadays, because of American television standards, viewers and listeners want and expect broadcasting to be of a high standard. They want their programmes to be interesting and/or enjoyable, and nothing like the rubbish that was shown on Channel 4 this week about lap dancing&#8212;but that is another story.</p><p>If the programmes are to be shown outside Scotland, viewers in Scotland&#8212;that is, taxpayers and citizens&#8212;want them to be a credit to our national creativity, the quality of our life, our social priorities and, of course, the beauty of our country. That is the perspective that the report quite correctly adopts, but not for the reason of buttressing the unionist side in the ever-present constitutional tug-of-war in the chamber. Let us forget our politics for the moment and consider quality broadcasting from the viewer's perspective. As I said, the days of government's ability to propagandise without competition from alternative programming and broadcasting outlets are gone anyway&#8212;we cannot do all that much to influence people's political opinions through the multiplicity of broadcasting outlets that we have.</p><p>When, in the process of establishing Scottish sovereignty and new relationships based on equal legal status between Westminster and Holyrood, we come to negotiate the share-out of assets and liabilities, the BBC, which is presently London-centric and a reserved responsibility, might well become a joint operation that is funded by and answerable&#8212;at arms' length&#8212;to both Governments through a joint board or trust. That is what I want to happen, because I want to hold on to the broadcasting tradition that has been established in the United Kingdom, although I would want to bring it into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. However, details on how that would be organised are for the future&#8212;the report concerns action to be taken now, and I heartily support the commission's recommendation that there should be a Scottish network.</p><p>I was a bit concerned about some comments that one of the reasons for having a Scottish network is to retain technical and creative expertise in Scotland, and that that is linked entirely to the training that is offered by colleges and universities. Those of us who have worked in TV and in radio know that there is no better thing in that respect than in-house and on-the-job training. That is one of the things that we do not talk about&#8212;if we are talking about the public responsibilities of broadcasters, we must talk about the training that they should offer, because it has been allowed to fall away.<place-holder colnum=\"11592\"/></p><p>It is obvious that there should be extra commissioning of programmes from Scotland. I agree with what Ted Brocklebank said about the share of the commissioning cake, and we should be getting that much sooner than is proposed. However, there is one thing that we should clarify. I think that it was Christine Grahame who referred to London and the share that it got&#8212;I think that she said 6.3 per cent as compared to our three-point-whatever. London has twice our population. Are we going to look at this in terms of the share that we should have because of our distinctive national identity, or because of the number of people who are paying for a television licence? We had better sort that out. Iain Smith talked about the need for more money. I wonder what he thinks the likely political response to that will be, at a time when \"subsidised Scots\" is the common phraseology that trips off the tongues of folk in London.</p><p>I hope that BBC Alba is put on Freeview, because that will help to allay some of the fears about the parochial nature of the content that a Scottish network might show.

He mentioned that in conjunction with a somewhat truncated form of PE teacher training. However, we can talk about that at another time.</p><p>As usual, I agreed with almost everything that was said by the shadow minister, the former minister Frank McAveety&#8212;yes I did&#8212;and I was encouraged to hear about the investment that Glasgow City Council and North Lanarkshire Council have put into areas that need the sort of community and personal development that can be achieved through sport or, as some members called it, physical activity. There is a difference between physical activity, recreation and sport, which I have not time to go into. However, I am glad that Christine Grahame got that one right. She did not get some other things right, but I will mark her contribution later.</p><p>We should not deprecate the fact that it is often the usual faces who turn up to volunteer. Manchester created a cadre of 5,000 volunteers, many of whom used the experience, and the skills that they acquired, to move into employment. It is a good idea to have volunteers. Having said all that, I whole-heartedly accept Frank McAveety's amendment.</p><p>Other members picked up on Jamie McGrigor's initial comments on the importance of investment in schools and on the indivisible and unbreakable links that there should be between sport and physical activity and exercise in schools&#8212;properly taught by properly qualified physical education teachers&#8212;which carries over into community clubs. I was very pleased that Jamie McGrigor saw that link; to me, it is at the very nub of the debate.</p><p>Ross Finnie spoke about the importance of coaches and facilities. Of course, that is where the money comes in. We cannot offer people the opportunity to become coaches if we do not offer a bit of support where it is needed. I gave the example of a person from Dingwall, or the far north of Scotland, having to come to the central belt to achieve their sports qualifications. The <place-holder colnum=\"11205\"/> people whom we would want to get involved in personal development and community development are the very people who would need that support. That point came out clearly in what Ross Finnie said.</p><p>At this stage, I should apologise to members who made excellent speeches that I may not have time to refer to.</p><p>Bill Kidd correctly identified the potential for community development. However, I share some of the reservations, voiced from other parts of the chamber, about the tone that is sometimes adopted. I took Bill Kidd's words at face value, and his analysis was correct. However, if we are to negotiate with Westminster, and I think that we will have to, we should perhaps remember that we can catch more flies with sugar than with vinegar.</p><p>I agree entirely with what Jackie Baillie said about the sense of excitement that already exists about the Glasgow games. However, I do not believe that the only important developments that come via sport are the ones that come via elite athletics events. That is not true. However, expectation has been created&#8212;perhaps because of the spectacular Beijing Olympics.</p><p>I confess that, before the Beijing Olympics burst on to our television screens, I was for the first time ever more interested in the politics of the games. However, I was absolutely knocked over by the quality of the sport and its presentation. I am sure that I was not alone in that. I am sure that the Olympics have had an impact on the sense of anticipation in Scotland about the Glasgow games. We should not talk them down.</p><p>Despite what I have just said, I agreed entirely with Ian McKee when he talked about big events and proportionality. We should not forget that sport is supposed to be about athletes and about personal development and the expression of excellence. It is not supposed to be about tables showing how many medals America got, and so on. We used to have an ersatz cold war every four years over the medals tables; I thought that we had at least got away from that, but no, we have put another one in its place. I greatly regret that.</p><p>The one thing on which I did not quite agree with Ian McKee was his questioning of the link to health.

I tried to find a topic and a motion that would attract support from all parts of the chamber&#8212;we will see whether I have been successful at decision time.</p><p>On Monday evening, I attended a reception for our Paralympians in the national museum of Scotland. The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon, did the honours&#8212;very graciously, I might add&#8212;but there was one teensy-weensy bit in her speech that did not quite ring true with me, although it made us all feel pretty good, particularly the parents, coaches and other volunteers among the athletes and their supporters. Nicola Sturgeon said that sport was in our psyche in Scotland. If only. The Government and its predecessors have made genuine efforts to encourage people to take up sport and exercise&#8212;I pay tribute to them&#8212;and they have supported elite athletes to an unprecedented extent. Stewart Maxwell's predecessors as sports ministers, one of whom I am glad to see is present this morning, have all brushed up on their sprinting techniques as they have dealt with my lobbying, my complaining and&#8212;yes, I will admit it, on the provision of adequate numbers of fully trained physical education teachers&#8212;my nagging.</p><p>On-going campaigns on television and elsewhere have successfully raised public awareness of the benefits of and enjoyment to be had from sport, and the performance of Scots <place-holder colnum=\"11156\"/> athletes in Commonwealth and Olympic games and world and European championships have thrilled and inspired all age groups. However, some studies suggest that, although standards are rising among sports participants, fewer of us are taking part. Although there are improvements in the statistics on, for example, heart and lung disease, our waist measurements are growing inexorably bigger and our children vie for top spot in the obesity league.</p><p>It is because it is urgent that we make history of that last fact about our national fitness, and because of the opportunity to inspire people that is afforded by the Commonwealth games, that my motion urges the Parliament to support the return, as soon as possible, of a substantial part of the lottery funding already earmarked for Scottish activities but diverted to help pay for the London Olympics. Subventions from the lottery could start in three years' time, but I hope that, after hearing the case studies that I have prepared for the debate, members will agree to pursue an earlier start to the resource being injected into the development of community sport and the support of young athletes, for whom it might make the difference between attaining a personal best and a Commonwealth games qualifying standard in six years' time.</p><p>I know that some people in the voluntary sector have concerns that the third sector will be the losers in any rescheduling of the supply of lottery resources. I hope that I have been able to reassure them on that. I have simply made a case for the urgency of speeding up the delivery of a resource that has already been scheduled and I have concentrated on the resources that will be earmarked for sport. Other members may concentrate on aspects of volunteering, for example, other than the support activities undertaken by the parents whom I met at the receptions for both groups of Olympic athletes.</p><p>My first case study is Ross County athletics club in Dingwall. Last Tuesday, 53 young athletes aged between nine and 17 turned up for coaching by scottishathletics-qualified coach Alasdair MacDonald&#8212;no relation. The previous week, 63 young athletes turned up, no doubt inspired by the Olympics and Paralympics. Those numbers are up on last year's average of 30-plus members, but unfortunately nothing else has improved in the past three to four years.</p><p>During that time, the Ross County club members have tried to raise their standards on a muddy field. It is sloping and holed, and it is used for shinty and football. Injuries are common. It is very easy to go over on an ankle in such conditions, which is something of a discouragement to athletes and their parents, who would prefer them <place-holder colnum=\"11157\"/> not to go hirpling to school or to be laid up at home with a cast on.</p><p>There are also no showers or other indoor facilities. In fact, if Alasdair MacDonald wants to take his young athletes for intensive indoor coaching, the nearest facility is Grangemouth. If that were not enough of a disincentive, the cost of transporting even a minibus-load of athletes is almost prohibitive. If overnight accommodation is required, the indoor facility is just a dream.</p><p>Inverness has a good track and what local athletes describe as reasonable facilities, but other communities across the Highlands and Islands are much more likely to experience the same muddy fields as Ross County club does in Dingwall. In spite of that, among the regulars, James MacPhail has won the under-17 400m Scottish hurdles championship. He is ranked sixth in the United Kingdom, but if he is to improve on that, he has no option other than to transfer from Ross County to Inverness, just as Ian Coghill did as the Scottish under-13 high jump champion&#8212;high jumping on a sloping field can also injure one's health.</p><p>The schoolchildren, part of whose school playground it is, are forbidden to play on that so-called sports facility when it rains because it is so dangerous. Alasdair MacDonald negotiated for a half-tartan track when the new public-private partnership Dingwall academy was being built. Everyone thought that it was a great idea but said that there was no money to provide it.</p><p>Far from current and past Government good intentions getting youngsters into sport, the lack of facilities and money to support sports club activities results in the old story of fewer and fewer young athletes continuing to compete in adulthood. I have described the prohibitive cost of a visit to indoor facilities for Ross County AC, but Wester Ross athletics club folded because of the prohibitive cost of travel. The MacDonald league of athletics clubs, which sustained regular sports meetings for clubs the length and breadth of Scotland, is now almost exclusively contained in the central belt because of travel costs.</p><p>The Highlands and Islands clubs have regrouped in a Highland league, and it is grand that coaches such as Alasdair MacDonald and athletes from the deprived sporting areas are still motivated to the extent that they are, but in narrowing the geographical base of their league, they narrow their competitive opportunities and therefore their potential.</p><p>Ross County AC represents exactly the sort of community sport that I would like lottery money to be spent on. Alasdair MacDonald could be joined by other local volunteer coaches if the expense of gaining coaching qualifications at Grangemouth, Meadowbank and Scotstoun, for example, was not <place-holder colnum=\"11158\"/> so off-putting and if there was help with travel and overnight accommodation.</p><p>The two young men who have already proved themselves at Scottish championship level would not have to leave their local area if decent facilities were available, and one of our granddaughters, who shows promise as a pentathlete, could be properly coached in hurdles&#8212;yet another event precluded by a sloping, muddy field. That is the reality that can be addressed only by resources being invested in facilities and coaches. The sooner we start, the more athletes and coaches will be motivated to gain places at the Glasgow Commonwealth games. We would then be talking realistically about a genuine legacy.</p><p>My second case study concerns Leith judo club. This week, as every week, 250 young athletes will attend judo teaching and coaching sessions overseen by the UK's leading judo coach, Billy Cusack, in a church hall in Leith. There are no showers or changing facilities there, either. The players are youngsters from all over the Edinburgh area, but mainly from the sometimes less-than-salubrious areas in the north of the city. There are approximately 20 players of top-flight international standard out of the 50 seniors in the club.</p><p>At the Commonwealth games in Manchester, 10 medals were won by club members&#8212;one club provided 10 medals for Scotland&#8212;and Billy Cusack admits that he and his athletes were disappointed that, at the Beijing games, only one medal was won by the Leith club&#8212;by Sam Ingram. However, he is nevertheless confident of getting closer to Leith's usual medals total at the 2014 games in Glasgow.</p><p>He hopes that, long before then, his athletes will have a practice area that is light years away from the one that they are presently forced to use, which he fears will cause serious injury due to the floor crumbling away with dry rot. He also hopes that the club's new premises will have changing rooms and showers, and a general-purpose strengthening and conditioning room would be nice too. He is currently in negotiation with the City of Edinburgh Council with a view to renting an unused industrial unit. He hopes that the facility will be temporary and that it will cost the club less than the &#163;12,000 to &#163;16,000 that he presently has to pay each year.</p><p>However, there is always an alternative open to a coach such as Billy: the British Judo Association would love him to relocate to a centre of excellence south of the border. The athletes who have come north to be coached by him would be likely to return south of the border if he did so, but Billy wants to encourage them, build on what he has created in Leith and keep Sam Ingram, who is one of the English athletes who have come north to have the excellence of training that is provided <place-holder colnum=\"11159\"/> here. He wants to inspire and encourage the 200-plus youngsters who attend the club and maintain the high standards of performance that encourage kids from Leith to be all that they can be.</p><p>I will now dive in at the deep end, which is still possible for a diver from Edinburgh. However, Sally Wood and Robyn Matthews, two young women who learned to dive here and have been coached to a standard that makes them realistic possibilities for the Commonwealth games, will have to find other facilities if they want to pursue their goals, because the Royal Commonwealth pool&#8212;known as the Commie pool to locals&#8212;is due to close next year for refurbishment and upgrading. It is estimated that that will take about two years so, if their family circumstances allow, Sally and Robyn will be off south to the most suitable facilities and coaching. Members should remember that they are still studying and that it will cost their parents a lot of money, but they will have to go south for the most suitable facilities and coaching.</p><p>Even with that disruption to their lives and studies, those two young women are probably envied by the two talented divers who have had to pack in their sport because of the closure of Bon Accord baths in Aberdeen. When the baths closed, it was inevitable that, without divers to work with, the diving coach would be forced to seek out venues with 5m and 10m fixed boards and 1m and 3m springboards. Once again, a dedicated and professional coach has been lost to those of Scotland's youngsters who are ready to have a shot at diving after being inspired by young Tom Daley's performance in Beijing&#8212;it is the time to take it up&#8212;and to the remaining diver in Aberdeen, who is a Commonwealth games prospect provided that she can move to another diving venue.</p><p>Those are three case studies of the reality of sport in our communities and the difficulties that our best&#8212;and potentially even better&#8212;sportsmen and women experience. We are now in an economic slow-down at best or a recession at worst for the next two, or possibly three, years. Local resources are already stretched so, if we are serious about the various programmes and initiatives that are designed to encourage people into sport, we dare not put them off until the economy recovers.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament, in view of the reduction in lottery funding for the development of community sport in Scotland, supports calls for a substantial sum of National Lottery funding to be released as soon as possible, without prejudice to the outcome of ongoing consultations on aspects of the wider remits of lottery funding, thus ensuring both support for ongoing coaching programmes and a legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow that benefit the population of Glasgow and all of Scotland, <place-holder colnum=\"11160\"/> and believes that such funding is capable of enhancing the Glasgow games so that, in addition to supporting a spectacular event, the investment would lay the foundations for health and sporting improvements across the entire population of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035940", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Funding Community Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I also thank the members who have come to this morning's debate.

Mrs Thatcher said, \"You can't buck the markets.\" Might I therefore suggest to HBOS shareholders, the employees of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, and people of good will who have the best interests of the Edinburgh, Glasgow and Scottish economies at heart, that it would be prudent to get their retaliation in first to the proposed takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB?</p><p>The chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland, Simon Thompson, whom other members have mentioned, practised what I am preaching when he said last night that banks were discredited rather than in credit. He urged not just regulation but education to help to rebuild confidence in the banking system.</p><p>Bankers must be honourable because their decisions directly affect the lives of every one of us. In Scotland, bankers enjoy a reputation for probity but, as the past few days have rollercoastered onwards, that priceless asset has been damaged by what many people consider to have been the unseemly haste with which the <place-holder colnum=\"11120\"/> terms of takeover were agreed by HBOS and Lloyds TSB.</p><p>Only a week ago, on the basis of the bald evidence that the collapse in the share price of HBOS had been stopped by news of the proposed takeover, in common with most MSPs, I thought that Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling had had no choice other than to fast-track the takeover and skip over some of the usual processes surrounding mergers and takeovers, such as giving the stock exchange early warning so that share dealing might be suspended in order to protect the value of shares against speculators and the seedy elements that attach themselves like limpets to the money markets.</p><p>Most of us did not know all that much about the processes that were in play during the takeover, but we ken noo. It is just possible that the Prime Minister and the chancellor really had no choice, but after the chairmen of the two banks admitted that for years they had desired to merge them but had been unable to do so because of competition law, a suspicion no bigger than a man's hand came into sight, as people marvelled at how the ill wind of sub-prime mortgage lending coming in from the other side of the Atlantic had done such good for the chairmen's hitherto forbidden dreams of merger. Should we ignore Sir George Mathewson when he says that some people were trying to do down the banks?</p><p>After hearing highly credible figures in financial services praise the business management of HBOS, other people began to ask whether another response might have been adopted to the run on share prices. Even now, shareholders in both banks, who still have to endorse the deal, will no doubt have seen Carla Antunes da Silva's comments casting doubts on how good the agreement is for HBOS and Lloyds TSB shareholders alike. Although that particular market analyst, who works for JPMorgan, says that now is precisely the wrong time to create the size of bank that is proposed, its size has been stressed by proponents of the merger as one of the strongest points in its favour. The possible loss to customers as a result of the loss of competition in the sector has been skimmed over.</p><p>In Scotland, we were assured of the sensitivity to, and knowledge of, the Scottish situation. The whole Scottish economy has blossomed as a result of the critical mass of financial services that has been established in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Given that Edinburgh is arguably the driver of the Scottish economy, Lloyds TSB has stressed how the proposed merger will pan out. Annual general meetings will be held here, as Ross Finnie said. As I suggested yesterday, maybe Lloyds TSB people will come up for the festival and give <place-holder colnum=\"11121\"/> everyone some free tickets so that we can make a real show of things.</p><p>What a transfer! The Mound will still be home to the new bank's Scottish HQ, but no one has yet told me what level of corporate function will be practised from there. I hope that when the minister sums up, he will say whether the Government has established a baseline for the services that it wants to be operated from that location. Such high-quality jobs inside the sector, and the highly skilled and well-paid jobs that link into financial services&#8212;to say nothing of the hairdressers, the taxi drivers and the leisure and entertainment industry staff&#8212;will also be gone from Edinburgh if we do not get this right.</p><p>We are told by the Prime Minister, the chancellor and the men who made the deal that these are problems of the global economy. The Prime Minister&#8212;of course, it could have been his wife&#8212;said yesterday that there had to be a global solution. I do not disagree, but, if HBOS is to be taken over, would it not be a better solution for the Scottish economy if, rather than rebuilding from within, with the Bank of Scotland reverting to a more traditional role, as outlined by Donald MacKay today, we went really big? A big global bank could take us over and we could be the European headquarters of such an outfit. That sounds a good job for anyone working on the Mound. That way, the integrity of the corporate functions would stay here.</p><p>However, as people in top jobs relocate and other Edinburgh people see their businesses grow smaller or their jobs outside the financial centre disappear, the market value of houses will fall, and many of the people whom I represent could find themselves in the same position as American home owners who took on mortgages that left them with no financial security and who have been hit by unemployment and are now homeless. I do not want to talk down the possibility of a good deal being made but neither do I want to flatter people who think that they will give only what they have got on offer at present.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035851", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hbos"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If Harold Wilson was right when he defined a week as a long time in politics, I wonder how he would have characterised the past 10 days in the money markets&#8212;as a millennium, perhaps.

I make no apology for making a special case for Scotland, but members will be pleased to hear that I will not make too much of a special case for Edinburgh on this occasion.</p><p>It is important that there should be community access to the facilities that are provided. I have news for Jamie Stone. At the weekend, my husband attended an athletics meeting in Dingwall to watch one of our granddaughters take part. The minister should look at those outlying areas, as they are deprived of the sort of facilities that we are beginning to see in and around the central belt. Having said that, I must criticise a bit the facilities that are attached to the new schools and that double as community facilities. They are often of a minimum standard. That is not raising the bar. We must be a bit more ambitious than that.</p><p>Jack McConnell talked about the requirement for volunteering, which is the second big requirement that we have in moving towards the year of sport. We need properly qualified coaches, who, by and large, will come from the ranks of volunteers. We must make it a bit easier for them to gain qualifications in their sports. We tend to forget that it costs money to get qualifications. We might encourage more people to take part in sport, but we will not raise the standards unless we have very good coaching. Therefore, the minister should seek out the best ways in which to quickly increase the number of coaches that we have. It is not good enough to look only to PE teachers; parents, grandparents and so on must be drawn <place-holder colnum=\"10915\"/> upon.

It is an utter nonsense to continue to talk of the aim of having two hours of good-quality PE in schools.

The issue is about poverty and inequality; it is not just about some folk being fat and some being thin. We must change social attitudes and the division of the good things in society&#8212;I do not just mean cream cakes.</p><p>I suggested to the minister years ago&#8212;I think in the first session of Parliament; she looked at me askance when I made the suggestion&#8212;that if we were serious about the issue, we would think about taxing salt, sugar and fat content in foods when it went above recommended guidelines.

Why on earth are vending machines like that still in schools? They are not in all schools and not in all local authorities, but they are in some public buildings such as swimming baths and leisure centres. The vending machines have lethal food in them that is very easy for someone to reach for as soon as they have finished terrific physical activity.<place-holder colnum=\"10557\"/></p><p>We should not beat ourselves up about it. We should instead measure how successful the penetration of companies such as McDonald's and the sweet makers has been. When Rebecca Adlington won her second fantastic gold medal and smashed the world record, she was asked what she was going to do and she said, \"I am going for a McDonald's.\" All these folk say that we want athletes to be beacons of hope and the best examples to young people so that they will not eat such food, but that is what she thought was the biggest treat she could possibly get after pulling off such a fantastic feat.</p><p>Another issue is cookery classes in schools. In a previous session of Parliament I asked questions about that and told the education minister that we should try to teach the healthy lifestyle in respect of physical education and nutrition in a collegiate way, and that physical education should not just be about physical jerks. Physical education is also about what we eat and how our bodies process what we eat. People have to know about cooking and there have to be what used to be called home economics teachers&#8212;I do not know what they are now called in schools, but I know that there are not enough of them. When I checked how many are in training, I discovered that in the year prior to the one in which I made my inquiries 11 had graduated in Scotland. The subject has fallen out of the curriculum.</p><p>Ross Finnie said that physical activity should replace some topics in the curriculum. It will be hard to persuade parents that that should happen, but if we are serious, it has to happen. We will also have to start teaching pupils about nutrition and cooking in schools, because there is now a generational gap. It is no longer someone's grannie who can tell them how to make a pot of soup or a pot of mince; they have to go to their great-grannie to find someone who did that, because their grannie was probably out working all the hours that God sent to take part in the new economy and so did not have time to cook like that.</p><p>When Mary Scanlon talked about regaining skills and informing people about good eating, I instanced the community health flats that have been established in Edinburgh.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development confirms that the UK economy is in recession, so it might seem strange&#8212;perhaps even frivolous&#8212;that I should urge the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth to honour the promise made by the First Minister about the provision of facilities to ensure that the young, upcoming cyclists who are being coached in Edinburgh realise their potential in time to compete in the Glasgow Commonwealth games and the 2020 Olympics.</p><p>It takes eight years to produce a world-class cyclist. Currently, there are 50 riders aged between seven and 16 in training, of whom three are already British champions. If Chris Hoy and Alan Edgar are to be joined on the podium in Glasgow, the facilities must be in place as soon as possible. That means that a new velodrome must be started ASAP. The City of Edinburgh Council is investigating the cost of a covered velodrome, and I believe that its officials think that about &#163;3 million might produce a satisfactory feeder facility to complement the new facility being built in Glasgow. Experienced cyclists and coaches have told me that the figure could be nearer &#163;4 million. However, the space in the centre of the track would be completely suitable for judo and gymnastics&#8212;I have checked&#8212;both of which sports are looking for suitable venues for their elite competitors and community participants alike. For <place-holder colnum=\"10389\"/> a modest outlay, the Government could make good its intentions to support and help to develop Scottish sport and produce a fitter Scotland.</p><p>My reason for associating the Government with the required spend on facilities such as those that I have briefly outlined is the inference I drew from the First Minister's remarks after Chris Hoy's triumph. The First Minister obviously understood that the standard of facility required to make Scotland a centre of excellence for cycling is much higher than the replacement local practice track originally envisaged by the City of Edinburgh Council. The costs I refer to would provide a Scottish national facility. They represent very good value for money, but it is money that is not now available to Edinburgh because of the economic downturn, which has resulted in a drastic downward revision of the projected income from the sale of part of the Meadowbank site.</p><p>While discussing how the City of Edinburgh Council would juggle its resources to maximise the possibilities afforded by modern, standardised cycling facilities, I discovered that there may be a suitable piece of land available in the Leith docks to provide a world-class white-water course for canoeing, kayaking and rafting. The site would also provide a centre for community use and outdoor education for schools. If the new velodrome and an artificial white-water facility were located side by side, economies of scale would be possible in shared facilities. The resulting centre of coaching expertise could prove very attractive to coaches and competitors alike. Without such a centre, people will continue to work and train outside Scotland.</p><p>At present, even though we lack facilities of international standard, cycling, water sports and judo are three sports in which Scotland can realistically claim to be right at the top of the world class. Or, to be more accurate, they are three sports in which Scotland can claim to produce world-class athletes who have to leave Scotland to access the best coaching and facilities. Everyone now knows that our cyclists live and train in Manchester.</p><p>Make no mistake: in the world of top-class sport, there are centres of excellence for all sports. The Jamaican sprinters, so much admired by our own dear Minister for Communities and Sport, are produced from an excellent system of competitive school sport, and follow the same path as Liz McColgan did in living and being coached to world-beating standard in the American college system.</p><p>Some top athletes will probably always seek outside Scotland for the top coaches in their sport. However, we currently have dozens of water sports athletes who could well beat a path to the white-water facility that is being built in Cardiff <place-holder colnum=\"10390\"/> docks, even though the regeneration of Leith docks is on-going and Scottish canoeists have identified suitable locations and have supplied me with a basic outline proposal that is based on the Cardiff facility and costed at &#163;5 million.</p><p>I hope that the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth will agree to consider the imaginative idea of investing in a conjoined sports centre. As we speak, Forth Ports is being supplied with the relevant information, as is the City of Edinburgh Council. The Government must be involved. Such a facility would be not only for elite athletes; it would be suitable for every standard of participant and could greatly enhance the provision of facilities for the type of outdoor education advocated by Elizabeth Smith. I commend the idea to the cabinet secretary as the sort of investment that is entirely compatible with his Government's objectives and is entirely suitable as a proactive method of breaking out of the current depressive economic mood.</p><p>It is always a good idea to aim high when the economy is going through a low-performance phase. Until sovereign economic powers are available to the cabinet secretary, he cannot do everything that might be done to buttress the Scottish economy against the effects of global economic difficulties. However, for a very modest outlay, he could provide a sports facility that would enhance our national fitness, health, sporting prowess and ability to host top-flight international competition.</p><p>The cabinet secretary and the First Minister have implied in all their comments on the economy that we should not lose confidence in Scotland's ability to weather the storm. Investment in a world-class sports centre, such as the one that I have suggested, would help us not to lose confidence.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This morning, the First Minister said that we need a reflationary programme.

As Christine Grahame said in her excellent speech, we do not know the size of the problem that we are dealing with, which means that we do not know how to deal with it or what resources must be committed to it.</p><p>I suggest that the first step must involve prevention, if at all possible. Therefore, any resources that are to be devoted to the fight against trafficking should be spent in the countries from which people are trafficked. I would like there to be an imaginative information and warning programme in Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, the Baltic states and throughout the countries of eastern Europe from which people have come&#8212;some legitimately and others because they have been trafficked.</p><p>I mention legitimate means because&#8212;some people will not want to hear this&#8212;not all those <place-holder colnum=\"7301\"/> involved are the victims that Trish Godman and Gil Paterson mentioned. Sex workers, who are already employed in selling sexual services, are also migrating here from eastern Europe. How are they to be treated and evaluated if they are picked up in a brothel? Are they to be treated in exactly the same way as underage girls who have been trafficked against their will and told that they would get a job as a nanny? As a result of our abhorrence of trafficking, we overlook some of the harsh realities that anyone making a policy must deal with. I go back to prevention being better than cure, certainly in the first instance until we have a much better idea of the size and definition of the problem that we are dealing with.</p><p>Members have mentioned the TARA project. I am delighted to know that there is such a project, but we require better information about outcomes from that project than we have received from, for example, Routes Out of Prostitution. I pay tribute to Pauline McNeill's work in that organisation, but we do not have the information that we should have after the years for which it has operated. I hope that we have learned the lesson and will apply it to the TARA project.</p><p>It is all very well to talk about the support that people deserve if they find themselves in the position of being a trafficked prostitute, but are we willing to commit resources to the issue? We have not been willing to commit the resources to prostitutes who were not trafficked but have ended up on the streets in this country because of drugs, family breakdown and the litany of disasters of which members are well aware.

When he first presented his budget, John Swinney, in promising to implement such an idea in 2009-10, after consultation with the City of Edinburgh Council, made me an offer that could prove difficult to refuse. Members will note that he repeated that offer today. Yesterday evening, I mulled over my options, because I have tried to use the opportunities that are provided by the Parliament's composition to obtain other benefits for the people of Lothian. I take on board Patrick Harvie's comments about the need to fine tune our process for handling the budget.</p><p>I await with interest Mr Swinney's response to my letter requesting that the shortfall in the financial settlement received by NHS Lothian under the Arbuthnott formula&#8212;&#163;11 million, in case he forgets&#8212;be made good immediately, given the pressures on health services in Lothian, particularly in maternity and accident and emergency units. That, of course, comes under the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, but the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth is the man who decides strategic spending priorities. I therefore presume that he works very closely with the big spenders, hence my wish that he spend a little time with my request.</p><p>Just as I was reaching a conclusion after mulling things over, there he was on television&#8212;the First Minister. He appeared to make me an offer that I definitely could not refuse: if I did not vote for him, he would go. However, the First Minister has form with that sort of decision, so I am inclined to stick with what I consider to be a good budget that will benefit most people.</p><p>I approve of returning decision making to local councils, I approve of ending prescription charges and I approve of the freeze in council tax until a fairer taxation method is found. However, I record my doubts that local income tax can be introduced properly while we are simply devolved and lack the cohesive and comprehensive range of powers that are available to sovereign Parliaments.</p><p>As is my custom when dealing with minority Governments, I will continue to peruse my options until I hear the final thoughts of all the parties in the wind-up speeches. Sometimes, last-gasp verbal commitments are offered and received.</p><p>Labour's amendment offends nobody. It would not bust Mr Swinney's spending plans and it appears no different in essence from the Government's ideas. In short, it is a textbook example of a motherhood-and-humble-pie amendment.

Had she not come to Scotland with the first of the young Poles after her country became a European Union member, she would have been studying for her third-year exams in law. That made me quite interested in Monika, and I got to know her. Her English was not great and my Polish is on a par with my command of Urdu or Gaelic, but she had a bureaucratic problem that my office was able to resolve for her. Since then, we have kept in touch and have worked out a couple of other wee difficulties&#8212;concerning housing, as I recall&#8212;and, through her, I have gained an insight into the community that we are all aware of but which we cannot quantify. We do not know what size the community is or what the average age of people in the community is, even though the overwhelming majority of Scots have&#8212;I am happy to say&#8212;welcomed these hard-working migrants from eastern Europe and their skills.</p><p>I will concentrate on the Polish community because&#8212;although we do not know for sure&#8212;there appears to be a greater concentration of Poles in and around Edinburgh than of other people from eastern Europe, and it is certainly the group that I know a bit about.</p><p>The welcome that the Poles have received is not just because of the delicious treats to be found in the new Polish delis, or even because of the universal appeal of Polish plumbers, but because they have filled a gap in Scotland's aging, shrinking population. Last year was the first year in <place-holder colnum=\"5637\"/> quite a while in which our population grew. However, there are no figures showing how many of those welcome children were born to migrant mothers or how many are likely to stay long enough to pull on the dark blue jerseys of Scotland's sporting teams.</p><p>The motion asks for a better way of incorporating all the positive aspects of this new pattern of migration into Scotland, both for those who stay here to become new Scots and those who live and work among us for some months or a few years.</p><p>The Irish, in particular, are philosophical about the people who go to Ireland for a few months or years and then go back to their country of origin. The Irish want them to have as good an experience of Ireland as possible, so that, when it comes to doing business or organising school or university exchanges and so on, those people have the best possible opinion and experience of Ireland. That is another good idea that we can copy.</p><p>With the fresh talent initiative, the previous Executive, under Jack McConnell, set the tone of the relationship between migrants and indigenous Scots. He is to be congratulated on and thanked for his foresight. We should cheer him for his persistence in the face of the lack of interest and even hostility that was displayed by Whitehall and Westminster. However, now that the Scottish advantage that was established by the fresh talent initiative has been eroded by Westminster's adoption of the same procedure for keeping overseas students around for longer after graduation, we need to refresh fresh talent. That is the spirit in which I would approach any strategic overview in relation to the people who have come from eastern Europe.</p><p>Basically, we need to make migrants' experience in Scotland so satisfying that, first, a greater proportion put down roots and stay with their energy, talent and families, and secondly, as I said earlier, those who return to their native countries carry with them a positive picture of a country that made them welcome and with which they are happy to do business.</p><p>I do not want to seem to be suggesting that nothing has been happening in building relationships and so on. There are networking groups around the country, particularly for the Poles, and they do a pretty good job, drawing on their own resources, of providing personal support, advice and information for their countrymen and women. I visited such a club, which runs on Monday afternoons and evenings in Fort primary school in Leith, and I was struck by the almost palpable energy and vitality. Malcolm Chisholm, the constituency MSP, may have visited that club, too. If he has not, I advise him to go because it is <place-holder colnum=\"5638\"/> uplifting to see so many dynamic young people thinking that Scotland and Leith are great places&#8212;but then, Leith is a great place.</p><p>Are we doing all that we could be doing to help the migrants progress? From work undertaken for Scottish Enterprise, we know that many of the migrants come to Scotland to enhance their skills and qualifications. It is in our interest that they should do so, which takes us back to my comments about encouraging more people to stay.</p><p>Is there a strategic overview of the next 10 years that encompasses information on how migrants might help us to meet the demand for high-end skills, whether they have the skills to move from production to service jobs&#8212;we know that that is where the growth is going to be&#8212;whether a sufficient number of migrants will reverse the decline in Scotland's working-age population, and whether Poles and other eastern Europeans will continue to come here, either temporarily or permanently, as our economy slows and theirs expands? Poland's economy, for example, is growing at 5 per cent per annum. We are in competition with Germany and the other countries that have lifted the barriers to people moving there.</p><p>It seems daft to say that this is one area in which we must be competitive, but I believe that to be the case. We must consider the people who are coming to Scotland. We must quantify the numbers, and we must know who they are and what interventions are sensitive to the fact that they have done a great deal for themselves and that they are not used to state or official agency intervention that is as benign and liberal as ours.</p><p>The suggestion in the motion is simply that there should be a pilot welcome desk scheme, which could be operated in conjunction with, for example, the company that runs the excellent portal on the web for Poles. That would identify the people coming in and give us some idea of how many there were, where they aimed to go to and, roughly, the information that we need. Booklets and a telephone line could be provided&#8212;I do not need to spell out the scheme for members as I am sure that they can work it out for themselves.</p><p>The idea behind the motion is not to provide a whole answer but simply to make people aware of the additional work that we must do to ensure that the people who are coming to Scotland and the people who are receiving them get the best of everything for both groups.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397157", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Migrants"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The genesis of this debate lies in a spell that I had in hospital about three years ago, when I made the acquaintance of Monika, who had recently arrived from Poland and was putting in 12-hour shifts cleaning mainly toilets and bathrooms in the infirmary.

I hope that that reassures Bill Aitken, who was a bit of a narrow nationalist, the way I interpreted his remarks on the subject.</p><p>It should not seem that I am asking for a perk for living in what is arguably the most attractive city in northern Europe. Instead, a capital city supplement is the means whereby Scotland will be able to build on Edinburgh's success in generating nearly 13 per cent of Scotland's GDP from only 9 per cent of the nation's population. Edinburgh brings jobs and investment that would not otherwise come to Scotland; it is the main engine for economic growth and wealth creation. The capital generates 33 per cent of spend by overseas tourists in Scotland and is the UK's second most visited city. It acts as the gateway to Scotland, with tourists spending two days elsewhere in the country in addition to three days in the capital.</p><p>The role that Edinburgh's festivals play in stimulating interest in Scotland is well known. Perhaps less well known is the fact that they benefit Scotland to the tune of &#163;184 million per annum.

However, I hope that it makes the comparisons that we would want to be made, because I have a horrible fear that education in its widest application is greatly influenced by a creeping Americanisation of all cultures&#8212;not only the United Kingdom, but Europe&#8212;and that, in the satellite technology that is now to hand, what we would have considered to be the essential building blocks of any civilised culture are short-changed. I say that to start off with, but I will not be too philosophical.</p><p>Robin Harper talked about the purpose of education and got right to the core of it. The OECD report refers a great deal to examinations but, as he asked, what do we have exams for? It is to test what we have learned. Why are we learning? It is to cultivate&#8212;we hope&#8212;a civilised, compassionate and humane society and the civilised, educated and humane man. If we do not do that, or if we think that we are cultivating people who do not reach those standards, is our education system what we would want it to be?</p><p>Peter Peacock asked the OECD to undertake the research. In passing, I pay tribute to his excellent speech, which I thoroughly enjoyed&#8212;more please! However, the OECD did not go into the reasons for education or consider how it is measured. For example, the report talks about the teaching profession in Scotland and, although it does not say that teachers' morale is high, everything implies that it is. Morale in the teaching profession in Scotland is not particularly high, but that has nothing to with what the OECD examined and everything to do with the behaviour of the young putative citizens in the teachers' care. The report does not refer to the lack of discipline in schools and greatly undermines what many excellent teachers and headteachers are trying to do.</p><p>The report does not compare the timetable that we have now with the one that we had when I was at school&#8212;although it does not look it, that was quite a while ago. The timetable is grossly overcrowded now and, as a result, we have overstressed and overstretched teachers. We would do well to greatly reduce the number of formal teaching blocks per subject in the timetable. Some subjects that are taught in schools are imaginative&#8212;not necessary informative, but certainly imaginative.

We were not impressed. Contrary to the sentiments in the mission statement, the emphasis in 2003 was on improving the performance of elite athletes. There was little understanding or sympathy for the people sitting up the back, who provide the underpinning for the production of elite medal winners and keep the structure of sport in Scotland in place&#8212;the coaches, the club officials, the family members and other volunteers. When Peter and I left the AGM, we were surrounded by the representatives of smaller sporting organisations and clubs for sports such as badminton, boxing and water sports. They were concerned about the thread that had run through the AGM, which was the relevance of the so-called minority sports and local clubs in plans for greater sporting glory in track and field and in the biggest team sports, which of course are rugby and football.</p><p>The skewed emphasis on the elite athletes has now gone, and sportscotland is fulfilling its function, as outlined in the mission statement. That is not just what it says; it is what it does. I have a lot of sympathy with Michael Matheson&#8212;he and I usually agree on such matters&#8212;but he must accept that sportscotland has mended its ways. We talk about sinners who repent&#8212;I am sure that, as a good Christian gentleman, he would agree.</p><p>Sportscotland has done things at local level. For example, in Stevenson, a lottery grant went to the Evolution skate park. Sportscotland helped to get the club organised and to develop a supervision and activity programme. Active membership grew to 1,500, and 250 women go each week&#8212;previously it was five. In Kinross, sportscotland was approached by a community group that wanted a swimming pool. Sportscotland did the research and advised the group about moveable floors, which mean that handicapped swimmers can take part.</p><p>Sportscotland is doing the practical business for which it was put in place. It is linking extremely well with the Scottish Institute of Sport, and we are beginning to see the results, including improved performance by elite athletes. I doubt that we could devise a better way to improve our national health indices and to widen and deepen the pool of potential champions than by persuading by example and providing facilities such as those that <place-holder colnum=\"4383\"/> I have mentioned, by joining up the schools and club sport, and by expanding the number of qualified coaches. Those are the activities that win medals&#8212;the medals come only when enough people are taking part. Sportscotland has switched its emphasis to that. Although there is money involved and the Government will want to consult more about how that money is dispensed, I urge the Government to support sportscotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport (Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to Ross Finnie for failing to be here for the start of his speech.

A very understanding Portuguese gentleman and I were watching the Portuguese Prime Minister being interviewed on television in a way that Gordon Brown has not been interviewed on television here. The Portuguese Prime Minister was having to answer some very hard questions.</p><p>Portugal is a country that, like Ireland, embraced the European Union but has found, since the EU's expansion, that it is perhaps not all a bed of roses for the country's economic development. Many of the factories that took advantage of Portuguese membership of the EU have now gone to the newer members of the EU, and there is very bad unemployment in Portugal.</p><p>The Portuguese gentleman, of short acquaintance, explained to me that there would be <place-holder colnum=\"3273\"/> plenty work in the new European Union \"para S&#243;crates\"&#8212;for the Prime Minister and his like; for the grandes senhores&#8212;because plenty more bureaucrats would be needed in Europe. His comment made me think about what is in it for us. That is why I was interested to hear what Liam McArthur said about energy.</p><p>I have been concerned that control over energy policy will move to Brussels and away from London&#8212;further away from us. I can see strategic reasons for that. We know that Russia is prepared to use oil as an economic and political weapon. We can see the temptation for Europe to ensure that it has the same level of control over the supply of energy and the concentration of investment in different forms of energy. I would like Scotland to be represented in the international forum that takes that decision.</p><p>We have spoken a great deal about fishing, and I will not even attempt to talk about fish&#8212;I like mine with black pepper and a twist of lemon. We have not got down to the level at which most folk understand fish and fishing. I will say no more about it, however, other than that I am glad that the SNP has&#8212;I think&#8212;now widened its reasons to be a little more critically analytical of the new treaty when it is finally published. There is more in the treaty that we should be concerned about than fishing.</p><p>We should be concerned about what Michael Connarty said, having examined the claims that were made by Gordon Brown, about the possibility of rubbing out the red lines that have been drawn in fields such as legal affairs through application to the European Court of Justice. I am also concerned about what Chris Harvie said: he told us that there is a future for us in Europe, and he mentioned all sorts of academic co-operation. I am reminded that, without the sort of status that independent representation would give us, that is a bit like the discussion at Yalta after the war, when Stalin asked, \"And how many battalions does the Pope have?\" People thought that the Pope and the Catholic Church would be influential in the post-war settlement, but in fact they did not have power; rather, they had influence.

Can we have a straight answer to that when the minister sums up?<place-holder colnum=\"2284\"/></p><p>The minister also said that the EARL project is not safe. If he was referring to its financial management, I can understand that, although&#8212;as other members have said&#8212;the Government was charged with ensuring that the project was robust and safe. Is it quite impossible for the Government to have done that in the time in hand? If so, the Government should have asked for more time, which I am sure Parliament would have provided. If the project is not safe in an engineering sense, why is it that other people have managed to construct tunnels under other airports? Shirley-Anne Somerville said that no other city has tunnelled under its airport, but I think that Texas and Shanghai, for example, have done exactly that. Of course, I may be wrong about that.</p><p>As Mary Mulligan mentioned, we are also supposed to be considering another tunnel, which would be under the Forth. That is supposed to be out to consultation. Is that a big kid-on? Have we already made the decision? We have heard it said in the chamber that we have neither the engineering ability and skill nor the ability to organise the governance for a project that would allow for such risk. There is risk in any big project, but there is definitely risk in giving the outside world the impression that we are just too wee and too scared to take anything on. I am happy to note that George Foulkes is becoming as nationalist as I am. In his analysis, if they can do it, so can we, and if it is good enough for them, it is good enough for us. I would hate to give the impression that we are backing away from EARL because of the risk.</p><p>My friend Christine Grahame and I agree on many things, but we disagree on EARL. She kept on referring to the limited budget. Usually, like me, she is a woman who does not recognise barriers. If the price of oil is approaching $200 a barrel, why on earth should the Parliament be concerned about a limited budget for something that is integral to the development of the Scottish economy?</p><p>When Charlie Gordon and I debated the matter previously, we agreed that windfall taxation had been extracted from companies that operate in the North Sea. Why did we not put in a bid for some of that money, saying, \"We will invest it in this project.\" That is what we do with windfall taxation&#8212;we invest it in something that we need and something that we really want.

I could not agree more. I therefore urge the Government to depart from the rigid formula for funding local government, accepting that Edinburgh has a unique role that the Government should recognise by introducing a capital city funding stream. That could be done through the strategic spending review. Such an initiative should attract the Labour party's support, given the fact that, during the past week, the city's need to provide affordable family housing to ensure that Edinburgh is a good place to grow up and go to school has been highlighted.</p><p>The occupancy rate of schools in Edinburgh is inextricably linked to the fact that many young families cannot afford to live in the city and are living outwith its boundaries. The Government must consider planning, housing and education in the one way. If it does that, it will recognise the need to fund the city for providing those services to the degree that is expected of it while it also carries the burden of promoting and marketing Scotland more than any other single area. Edinburgh is also, perhaps, the main driver for the Scottish economy.</p><p>While we are talking about the Scottish economy and money, I should say that I voted for the trams, which are linked to the housing development on the waterfront and the new development that is being planned for Leith, and that I am concerned that the money for phases 2 and 3, which make complete sense of the trams project, might not be found. I urge the Government, now that it is committed to supporting the trams project, to look at the full picture and the funding for phases 2 and 3.</p><p>Colleagues in the Labour Party mentioned council housing. I noticed that no one in the Labour Party or in the SNP said that they are willing to go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is an Edinburgh MP, and the Prime Minister to emphasise how Edinburgh tenants have been given a raw deal. They voted against stock transfer and there should be advocacy on their behalf so that they are treated equally with the tenants who voted for it.

When the Conservatives introduced the right to buy, we warned them that, 25 or 30 years down the road, we would have a housing crisis in Scotland. It gives me no pleasure to say that we were right. The Conservatives, perhaps more than most, have a duty to help the Government put things right.</p><p>The right to buy should be suspended in areas such as Edinburgh where it is perfectly obvious that the loss of housing stock cannot be made up in the required time. We should consider that suspension not as a national measure, but a local one, because the situation in other areas is different. However, I speak for Edinburgh and it would be a good idea to suspend the right to buy there for some time. As Malcolm Chisholm said, people cannot afford to live in Edinburgh&#8212;the sort of people we need if the city is to remain vibrant and feasible. They are not poor people&#8212;they are holding down well-paid jobs&#8212;but they cannot afford to buy houses, given that the average house price in Edinburgh is &#163;220,000, which is eight times the average annual salary.</p><p>Of the 10,400 new homes built in the city since 2001, only 18 were affordable homes. We need 12,000 affordable homes to be built over 10 years if we are to keep the people I referred to living in the city.</p><p>The tenants in Edinburgh, who are the sort of people I am concerned about, used their democratic right to vote against the stock transfer. I will not go into the reasons, but simply acknowledge that they did so as intelligent people who considered what had happened with stock transfer elsewhere and made their decision. The debt should be written off for them, as it was written off for the people in other local authorities who voted for stock transfer. I appreciate that the issue concerns lots of other housing authorities too, but the minister should make representations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8212;whoever that is after next week&#8212;that we should be fair and even-handed in our treatment of tenants.</p><p>I will finish with another plea for capital city funding. Edinburgh gets much less money from the Executive for public investment in affordable <place-holder colnum=\"1071\"/> houses and other things than does any other place in Scotland. If we want a capital city that will showcase the country and if we acknowledge the part that Edinburgh plays in the economy of the country, we need capital city funding.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385846", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Willie Coffey on his maiden speech; I think that he will fit in very well here.

The choice that I face today is whether to <place-holder colnum=\"976\"/> vote for a local income tax that is not local, or for a reformed council tax that is not a reform.</p><p>I have not come to this question late in the day. I wrote to Alex Salmond during the election campaign and asked him about the Scottish National Party's policy on the replacement of the council tax, but he has not phoned and he has not written. I will, therefore, put my questions to John Swinney.</p><p>The SNP's proposed 3p tax rate would be set nationally and, according to the SNP's March statement, it would be collected through HM Revenue and Customs at Westminster. Does Mr Swinney have Westminster agreement on that? That is a straightforward question.</p><p>If money is to be allocated to a council according to the income that is raised from income tax payers in the council's area, what would be the financial position of those Scottish councils that have a low income-tax base because of the level of poverty in their areas? How would that problem be tackled? Can John Swinney provide examples of the expected tax yield from Edinburgh, for example, compared with the Western Isles or the Vale of Leven? That would give us a parameter for comparing benefits for different taxpayers.</p><p>How would a dispute be resolved between a council and HM Revenue and Customs about the accuracy of the figure for the amount of local income tax to be raised in a local authority area, given that employers hold the information on the place of abode of the LIT payers?</p><p>I foresee a great number of practical problems in what John Swinney is attempting to do, because he is attempting to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Without having at his disposal the full panoply of fiscal measures that could be applied by any Government in Scotland, he cannot successfully bolt on this brave attempt to bring in a fairer system of paying for council services.</p><p>It is important that we have straight answers to straight questions. Will Mr Swinney expect employers, particularly small business employers, to carry the additional administration costs for the proposed local income tax? Employers, not HM Revenue and Customs, are the actual gatherers of PAYE tax. That is another of the questions that I asked of Alex Salmond and which I now put to John Swinney and his team.</p><p>I regret that I cannot enthusiastically support the introduction of a local income tax, because, as I said, I do not believe that the proposed scheme is a local income tax. My vote will depend on whether I believe the putative payer of the local income tax will benefit. Has an estimate been made of the expected revenue? How would that revenue be redistributed? I think that that is the clincher.<place-holder colnum=\"977\"/></p><p>The promise is that the council tax will be frozen for two years. What would happen if HM Revenue and Customs took longer than two years to work out a system for the proposed local income tax? The period of two years seems rather prescriptive given the history of HM Revenue and Customs, for example its handling of the tax credit system.</p><p>I apologise, Presiding Officer, for only asking questions, but time is short.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Council Tax"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I shall endeavour to be brief, Presiding Officer.

A number of members have said that the Government is right to aim for a maximum of 18 pupils in primary 1 classes, but that elsewhere we need a much more sophisticated and subtle solution. I believe that the solution should also be more localised.</p><p>I am disappointed that the cabinet secretary did not mention children with special needs; a number of other members talked about it, so I will not. I will, however, mention the fact that there was not a single reference to specialist physical education teachers. In this chamber, we have heard ad nauseam that we will not have a smarter Scotland unless we have a healthier and stronger Scotland. We therefore need PE specialists, who also ensure better academic performance.</p><p>I will repeat a wee story to the members who believe that simply reducing class sizes will produce a better academic performance. In China, it is not unknown for classes of 100 to sit and learn maths, because China has a different attitude and different discipline. It is wrong to imagine that there is a panacea and that by reducing class sizes we will pass China in the OECD attainment levels in mathematics.</p><p>I also refer the cabinet secretary to the four-year and one-year courses for teachers that were mentioned, and the situation of PE teachers especially. There has come to my notice some of the disquiet that is felt in staffrooms up and down the country because of the disparity in content between PE courses for graduates and the full four-year PE courses.

We have just come through a bruising, sometimes bitter and constantly divisive election campaign. Of course, that is how it is in democratic politics: groups of people held together by shared ideologies&#8212;or more limited <place-holder colnum=\"160\"/> objectives&#8212;personal loyalties, self-interest, history and comradeship all compete for the right to govern their fellow citizens.</p><p>However, in Scotland our political contests contain an additional element that can overshadow and poison debate on the policies and issues that quite properly distinguish one political party from another. The national question&#8212;or what is known as the constitutional or independence question&#8212;bedevils every election fought in Scotland. At a time of great change in the global economy, in security, in the environment and in the balance of power, that unresolved question can divert our energies and focus from those 21<sup>st</sup> century facts of life that we can deal with only if our society is united.</p><p>How do we in this Parliament resolve that question&#8212;or, if I can put it more accurately, how do we enable our fellow citizens to do so? It will not go away, because it is too deeply embedded in our politics and attitudes, nor will a resolution be arrived at unless the issue ceases to be the prerogative of one party and all Scots are empowered to decide the issue by knowledge rather than mythology and by opinion formulated by facts rather than bile or vested interest.</p><p>What part should be played by this Parliament&#8212;the forum of the nation? Cannot this institution take responsibility for however Scots wish its powers to be developed? The parties elected here have a duty to govern according to law and to scrutinise the policies and actions of Government. This Parliament has the function of providing the means for that to take place.</p><p>To bring about as good as possible a programme of governance, would we not be assisted by having the national question addressed by a special committee or unit of the Parliament charged with investigating, analysing and then publicising for public information the powers and relationships of this Parliament, drawing on the experience of the last two sessions and this third one? We all know of the confusion among our constituents on the powers of, and therefore the responsibilities of and possible outcome of actions undertaken by, the Parliament and its Governments.</p><p>Opinion polls usually show a clear majority of those polled to be in favour of more powers being vested in this Parliament. Even among MSPs on the other side of the constitutional divide from myself, there is acknowledgement of the need to enhance some powers, acquire some others and re-examine the terms of the memorandum on co-operation and understanding that we have with Westminster. It is fair to say that it has fallen into disrepair, and we are not exploiting the potential.<place-holder colnum=\"161\"/></p><p>Had parties other than the Scottish National Party become the Government, it might have proved easier for all opinions represented here to act on those democratic and opportunity deficits. The hitherto expected response to initiatives such as I suggest, were they to be proposed by the SNP, would have been outright rejection by the unionists on the grounds that the intention would be to break up the UK and that voters do not want that, but voters in general have only a sketchy knowledge of the respective implications of the Parliament exercising sovereign or devolved powers. However, it is no longer the function of the SNP, now that it is in government, to concentrate on a campaign of information and persuasion on the merits of sovereignty. Would that it had done so consistently over the past decade, instead of confusing the issue by substituting a tactic&#8212;a referendum&#8212;for a policy: the establishment of sovereignty.</p><p>However, we are where we are, and we must devise a way of focusing on what Annabel Goldie called bread-and-butter issues. We must separate them from consideration of how our present powers are used, whether they help or hinder Scottish Governments to meet the expectations of Scots, what powers if any might be transferred from Westminster, whether our representation in the European Union is satisfactory&#8212;particularly with the onset of a new constitution&#8212;and whether our relationships with countries outwith the UK and the EU allow us appropriate participation in international activities.</p><p>Because of the Government's very narrow advantage over the main Opposition party, the Parliament will find it difficult to agree and to agree to differ on specific policies, never mind to agree on how best to develop the effectiveness of Parliament's powers, yet that is what we must do to keep faith with our electors.</p><p>I propose that an ad-hoc research and development, non-policy-making unit of the Parliament be established to provide researched information on the powers and operation of the Parliament. That might lead to another constitutional convention, or it might not, but it is certainly preferable to having our every exchange of views in this chamber permeated and undermined by attacks on and defence of a referendum that is highly unlikely ever to take place on constitutional choices that are unresearched, underpublicised and misunderstood by many&#8212;perhaps most&#8212;of our fellow citizens.

However, after the parties have done their best to defend their corners, perhaps creating bitterness and division among themselves in doing so, the members elected to the new session of <place-holder colnum=\"33711\"/> Parliament must quickly find a collegiate way of working, for the sake of Scotland.</p><p>The fault line of the constitutional question is already dominating debate, but we must take heed of our fellow Scots' perceptions of what the election is about. If we, as professional politicians, and, in the main, members of political parties, judge that Scots' priorities are different from ours, we must be big enough to admit that and act on the mandates that electors give us, rather than claim to have won the argument on the basis of the votes of fewer than 40 per cent of the people who voted.</p><p>I think that members will find that there is a general desire on the part of people in Scotland for the Scottish Parliament to be proactive in improving and governing aspects of life in Scotland over which we have no control, such as broadcasting, or over which we have limited decision-making powers, such as drugs policy or the representation of our interests in the European Union. The details are not all that important at this stage; what is important is how we go about meeting the hopes and expectations of Scots, who, according to opinion polls, look to the Parliament for leadership and the strategies and policies that will make Scotland prosper.</p><p>That is my plea to the members who will return in the next session. I ask them to work on building on the common ground that is occupied by the electorate. This institution is the means by which we can advance the governance of Scotland, enhancing our statutory powers and ensuring stable administration and government while we do so&#8212;as our fellow countrymen and women would prefer.</p><p>There are any number of ways in which we could structure and operate a constitutional unit or convention. The important factor is the open-mindedness of those who take part and their appreciation of the need to reflect the wish among Scots that the Parliament should be the voice of the people, not the voice of any one political party.</p><p>During the next session of Parliament attempts will be made to introduce a new constitution for the EU, and this morning we learned about fundamental changes that are planned for the Home Office. Such issues will be for the Parliament to resolve and I think that the parties represented here will have much in common, rather than great differences between them.</p><p>Members know of my commitment to the Scottish Parliament assuming sovereign powers. However, for more than 30 years I have also advocated a new intergovernmental relationship between all the countries and regions of the UK and Ireland. I think that I first wrote about the social union of the UK as the union that would <place-holder colnum=\"33712\"/> survive the modernisation of the machinery of government in 1974. I see no reason to change that analysis. The ties that bind us are emotional. The Scottish Parliament offers a way of marrying the refinement of our powers with the maintenance of the social union. Whether Annabel Goldie is right or I am right in interpreting the wishes of Scots, this Parliament&#8212;rather than one party&#8212;is the institution that must determine the future of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383120", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Future of Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank you, Presiding Officer, and Ms Robison.

I also notice that Donald Gorrie may well have delivered his last speech to the chamber and that Susan Deacon is about to make her final contribution. I would not want to allow things to pass without expressing my gratitude to Donald Gorrie for the help and support that he has given me and for the patience that he has shown with my impatience. I wish Susan Deacon all the best. I can tell her that it is my experience that, when people take a while out to see and learn a bit more, they are better when they come back. I have probably known James Douglas-Hamilton longer than any other member&#8212;we met at a murder trial, but I will not go into that&#8212;and I am certain that he will continue to adorn the House of Lords in a way that many of the newer arrivistes might not. To protect the innocent, I will say no more than that.<place-holder colnum=\"33567\"/></p><p>I almost decided to vote for James Douglas-Hamilton's amendment&#8212;not just on sentimental grounds, but because it is well expressed&#8212;but I have doubts about the extent of autonomy that we should grant to head teachers. I am not at all certain about where the limit should be set if our local authorities are to provide an organised and orderly system of education.</p><p>I agree that the Executive deserves perhaps a bronze star. I would not give it a gold star or a silver star&#8212;out of principle&#8212;but it has done much to improve education. The Executive has tried to identify many areas that should have been priorities. That said, the Executive should not ignore the points that Dave Petrie made. As I have mentioned in the chamber on previous occasions, our universities need to run catch-up classes on basic literacy. That should not be ignored when we are congratulating ourselves on some of the good things that have emanated from the Parliament.</p><p>An indeterminate thing that has emanated from the Parliament is the emphasis on class sizes. I urge ministers not to get hung up on class sizes any more than they should get hung up on waiting lists. We are dealing with people, and people do not fit lists. In China, maths classes may have 100 children but, because there are 100 motivated sets of parents behind those children, the teacher does not have to cope with the ill-discipline that our teachers face. As I tried to suggest when I asked Fiona Hyslop for more information during her speech, in the more affluent areas, where parents are self-confident and work with teachers, larger classes could easily be accommodated even in subjects for which the teacher must do a lot of preparation and jotter work the night before, but in areas that are under stress it will be true to say that the smaller the class, the better it will be. In those areas, the more direct one-on-one communication pupils have, the better.</p><p>I have noticed that we have begun to slip into the bad habit of looking at class sizes as we looked at waiting lists for hospital treatment&#8212;and look at the mess that got everybody into. Furthermore, can we please admit that subject setting in schools is a sensible way to teach? Comprehensive education was meant to be a socialising policy; it was not meant to be about trying to teach children of all abilities in the same way in the same class at the same time. Subject setting according to ability is better for the child and will improve their confidence and attainment levels&#8212;and make life a little more bearable for teachers.</p><p>As the minister will know, I have a particular interest in PE. Much has been done in that area&#8212;I appreciate that a target of each pupil having two hours of physical education a week has been set&#8212;but much remains to be done. For example, <place-holder colnum=\"33568\"/> we talked at lunch time in the cross-party group for sport about the difficulty of meeting that two-hour target in two-stream schools that have only one hall that serves as the dining hall, the assembly hall, the gym hall and so on. There are particular difficulties, and if the minister and I are back in the next session I will let him know about them.</p><p>There is also the question of the PE content in the teacher-training modules that are undergone by general classroom teachers. It is not good enough and must improve. A new goal should be set&#8212;for primary schools at this stage. It should not be about having two hours of physical activity a week, but about having some form of physical activity every day. That would require a more imaginative use of facilities and could involve other forms of physical activity that are perhaps neglected and which could be undertaken off the school premises. Again, if the minister and I come back, we will talk about that.</p><p>I commend to the minister what Donald Gorrie said about the socialisation that goes on in sport. I also commend to him the sensible remark passed by Ken Macintosh's child, who knew fine that she had come in first in a race. It does not matter how we try to fool kids, they know&#8212;so we should allow them to learn how to win and lose gracefully. While we are doing that, because we cannot do it all through schools, we must go to really good football clubs, such as the winners of the CIS cup last Saturday, and ask them how they manage to imbue their young players with a standard of behaviour on the pitch that acts as a standard for young followers. Poor behaviour by young people is one of the things that teachers should not be blamed for. We must look more widely than schools for encouragement of socialisation and good behaviour through sport.</p><p>I will not vote for the SNP amendment because, although I share the SNP's attitude to PPP, I doubt its methodology on this one. I am not quite sure that it has worked out all the wrinkles. I have decided, however, that I really cannot vote with a party that tells me about education with syntax as atrocious as is found in its amendment.

This would enhance Highlands and Islands connectivity, offering opportunities for straightforward links to and from new and existing destinations.

The Executive admits that the bill in front of us is radically different from the one bearing the same name, introduced last year and based on the report <place-holder colnum=\"32538\"/> produced by the expert group convened by Sandra Hood. The group produced a balanced, sensible approach to the management of street prostitution. It was even-handed in exercising a duty of care towards vulnerable sex workers and towards the general community, particularly those people whose privacy or sense of well-being and security is adversely affected by the behaviour of either the buyers or the sellers of sex. I put that on record because that was the original intention&#8212;certainly, my original intention&#8212;but as I have only two minutes, I must answer some of the points that have been made.</p><p>The Hood group report also advised that the Executive should require councils to produce a local plan to ensure that support and services were accessible for street sex workers, including advice and help to exit prostitution. That would have allowed the councils in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, in partnership with the police, health authorities, voluntary organisations representing sex workers, drugs services and residents to produce a local plan to manage prostitution according to the different situations in our four big cities.</p><p>David McLetchie said that that would simply institutionalise prostitution. I think not. We had a tolerance zone, as it was called, in Edinburgh for almost 20 years and it did not institutionalise prostitution. We can point to statistics that show that the number of prostitutes working on the streets in Edinburgh fell during the period of the tolerance zone. The same cannot be done in Glasgow, where Routes Out is quoted as providing instances of best practice. Yesterday, my office tried to obtain up-to-date statistics from Routes Out on how many women had exited prostitution using the money that had already been made available by a previous minister. As always, we were given no figures at all.</p><p>Therefore, although I welcome the proposed funding, I am concerned about how the money that is going to be spent on helping vulnerable women will be apportioned and how the services will be delivered. I ask the minister to take into account what Ewan Aitken, the leader of the City of Edinburgh Council, said this week. He said that it is better to manage prostitution in a humane and sensible way, trying to moderate the harm that is done by it, than to adopt the sort of measures that are proposed in the bill.</p><p>I am convinced that we will put the safety of the women in jeopardy by driving prostitution underground. The examples in England show that violence has risen in areas where strict kerb-crawling measures have been introduced. It is not that I oppose measures against kerb crawling, but the bill does not meet the needs as regards how kerb crawling is affected by changes such as <place-holder colnum=\"32539\"/> those that are proposed.

There is such a boom in the city's economy, and house prices and land prices have gone so high, that we risk driving out all the people with the skills that we must have for a balanced community. By and large, those people will want to rent. Nobody who has spoken has defined affordability. Although homestake is a good idea for home buyers, a great number of the people whom we want to have in the city cannot afford to buy due to the current state of the private market. That is why I asked about the Edinburgh tenants who voted against stock transfer. Their wishes must be respected.</p><p>Edinburgh will come under dreadful pressure because it will have a gap of eight years between the demolition of some houses, which must be demolished, and the provision of other affordable <place-holder colnum=\"32470\"/> or social rented housing. The Executive should be much more active in asking the Chancellor of the Exchequer to create a level playing field for councils and housing associations.</p><p>I commend to the minister the attitude of Midlothian Council. It is an honourable exception to the councils mentioned by Sylvia Jackson, which have perhaps not done all the homework that they should have done. Midlothian Council has 3,500 people on its waiting list, so it is building 1,000 houses and is going into partnership with other housing associations to provide 800 more. Conditions will be attached to the right to buy the houses that Midlothian Council builds and a higher minimum price will be asked for them. That council went ahead to identify the need and then acted; it did not sit around worrying about what was the correct thing to do.</p><p>The Treasury has a large part to play in addressing the problem. The Auditor General said that there is no difference between writing off the debt that local authorities have incurred if tenants agree to stock transfer and not writing off the debt if tenants say that they prefer to stay with the local authority.

She then stopped eating and drinking because the mouth ulcers had become so bad and was finally admitted to hospital, where I had to almost beg a Consultant to give her the coeliac blood test.

We know that an inexpensive and highly effective blood test is produced by Adastra Medical. I do not wish to promote one company at the expense of others, but it demonstrated its product this morning and I believe that it has a 97 per cent accuracy rate. That product or products like it could be commended to GPs. It is perhaps even more important for GPs to be made aware of the fact that many of the people who present with the symptoms of coeliac disease will not be suffering from some other complaint and will certainly not be imagining their symptoms.</p><p>It might be possible to provide smart card access to suitable food products.

There is no doubt about it: he has done the right thing at the right time. It is big of the Executive to have taken his proposals on board.</p><p>I wonder why the minister started by referring to the debate about tartan. Ken Macintosh's speech, and even Kenny MacAskill's speech, gave us the answer: they dismissed the thought of Harry Lauder. We can all get embarrassed about Harry Lauder if we like but, abroad, in all those places where people know about Scotland, they might just know about Scotland through Harry Lauder. The late Jimmy Logan explained to me how, in theatre terms, Harry Lauder was quite an icon. We must look less to the confusing images of the past and more to what we agree is the way to use such icons, even if we are a bit embarrassed about <place-holder colnum=\"31826\"/> them, to promote Scotland. There is a difficulty with promoting tartan while we are diluting Scots identity and its promotion.</p><p>I will draw a parallel: I ask the gentlemen in the chamber to think of lederhosen for just a minute. Where do we associate with lederhosen? I see the minister slapping his thigh&#8212;good on him. Is it Austria, or is it Bavaria? I associate them with Bavaria, because I know the subtleties, but most folk are confused about where lederhosen come from. I put it to members that the same confusion might exist regarding where tartan fits into the panoply of the world's patterns. Where does Paisley pattern come from? That uncertainty exists because we have not promoted the Scottish identity and used tartan unashamedly to do so. That is one of those wee things that we will just have to sort out&#8212;I am sure that we are on the way to doing that.</p><p>The minister said that he would listen to good ideas. I have about six. First, there is the recognition factor. We are kidding ourselves if we think that, everywhere in the globe, people know what Scotland is and can distinguish Scotland from other parts of the United Kingdom. We should not kid ourselves like that.</p><p>Once, when I tried to check my bags through from Atlanta airport to Edinburgh, I had quite a discussion&#8212;it eventually became quite a heated discussion&#8212;with the helpful young woman behind the desk. She asked, \"Edinburgh's in London, isn't it?\" I replied, \"No, it's not in London&#8212;it's in Scotland.\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"but that's in London, isn't it?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, which is a different country.\" Her nametag said that she was called Marie Stuart, but she did not have the faintest idea that she was part of the diaspora. We must not imagine that the opportunity is already there for us. I want lots of television advertisements and film placements. Let us start with Bollywood&#8212;a growing market, I point out to the minister&#8212;and there is Chinese television, too.</p><p>Although Kenny MacAskill waxed lyrical about tartan week, I do not think that it is big enough or focused enough yet. We should be getting in touch with Craig Ferguson, for example, and ensuring that really nice tartan ties and other tartan accoutrements are sent to him, so that he can refer to them when he presents his show, which is one of the biggest coast-to-coast shows in America.</p><p>Why does the Parliament not use tartan? The colours that we have are very fetching, but we could use tartan much more. I am sorry to see that the Presiding Officer is looking at me like that, because I wanted to go on to mention tartan tat. As a representative of this country, I am sometimes concerned when I see the tat on sale <place-holder colnum=\"31827\"/> up and down the High Street. However, I remember what I said at the start of my speech. Ken Macintosh should not get embarrassed about Harry Lauder, and I will not get embarrassed about the fact that some folk have different tastes from mine.

Although elements of the suggested balanced approach to the management and, quite possibly, the minimisation of street prostitution that was the outcome of the work by Sandra Hood's expert group have been retained in the bill and in the proposed guidance to local authorities, the bill fails to achieve the means of exercising duties of care towards sex workers, who have the right not to be beaten and injured, and towards people in the general community, who have every right not to be alarmed or annoyed by the activities that surround prostitution. Instead, the bill simply introduces an anti-kerb-crawling measure to deter purchasers of sexual services. Although supporters of the bill claim that the legislation in England has resulted in more than 800 men being charged, they cannot point to proof that that caused those men to stop buying sex. If that was the case, far fewer women would be selling sex on the streets.</p><p>The bill might give respite to people, such as the residents of Leith Links, who have been caused nuisance because of the proximity of their home or business to a red light zone. I say \"might\", because in English cities the kerb-crawling legislation has meant that red light zones now move about cities, playing hide and seek with police and residents. I think I am correct in saying that Liverpool intends formally to move its red light zones around. To anyone who is mistaken enough to believe that that deterrent to buyers will shrink the market for prostitution, I suggest that assignations will be made by phone or by internet. Members can look up the internet for themselves and they will find Scottishescorts.co.uk. If they look in the reference bible, McCoy's, they will see that sexual services can be found in Stirling or in the kingdom of Fife. I imagine that few members will want to take me up on that offer because they will not want to be seen reading the book. However, I have done my homework, so I know that the market will not shrink as intended by this simple measure.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prostitution (Public Places) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I confess that the bill is a great disappointment to me.

If Elaine Smith has read that book, she will realise that the author advocates a safer zone&#8212;a management zone&#8212;so that violence can be minimised. That is one of my main concerns about the bill and it was one of the twin aims of Sandra Hood's committee. Incidentally, we should thank Sandra Hood for the amount and quality of work that went into producing the report.</p><p>Another aspect of the kerb-crawling legislation as it stands concerns me&#8212;I know that it concerns the minister, too. If the same pattern that exists in English cities is repeated, say in Glasgow, it will be much more difficult for the support services, which help women to exit prostitution when they are ready to do so, to reach the women. We know from experience and from the work that has been undertaken by Neil McKeganey that the support services have to build a relationship with women. Bristow Muldoon suggested that the police could direct the women to services&#8212;that is not enough. The person who arrests someone is not the person to build up a relationship with them that is sufficient to convince them that they could muster the self-confidence to undertake the sort of job training that is offered by SCOT-PEP in Edinburgh to get women out of prostitution. The confines of the kerb-crawling legislation concern me greatly.</p><p>I admit that the problem of intrusive and alarming kerb crawling presents a real difficulty in Glasgow. There was no such problem in Edinburgh during the operation of the original tolerance zone. Kenny MacAskill is right that there were occasions when the zone did not run smoothly, but I am talking about kerb crawling in particular. That is the case in Aberdeen, where the red light or management zone is located in the docks&#8212;which are not part of a residential area&#8212;at night, when business premises are shut.</p><p>I regret that I do not have more time, because I would like to reply to some of the things that have been said and which are wrong. I asked Fergus Ewing whether he would take an intervention because I wanted to find out whether his attitude to legislation applied to all sex workers. I think that it should. Why should it apply to just the women in the street? Mike Rumbles thought that the market might shrink. I have referred to that. If the market had shrunk, we would be seeing fewer prostitutes. We should remember that there are fewer street prostitutes in Edinburgh and that the level is stable in Aberdeen, whereas in Glasgow the number of prostitutes has risen. Bristow Muldoon said that the police would refer the prostitutes to services.</p><p>If we are talking about street prostitution, we are talking about only four cities, and there is no problem in Dundee. In Aberdeen, a potential <place-holder colnum=\"31147\"/> problem for the general community is managed. That arrangement appears to operate reasonably successfully from the Aberdeen citizen's point of view.</p><p>I very much regret having to say that I will not support the bill. I will abstain, because I hope that amendments will be made to bring the bill closer to the principles that were outlined by Sandra Hood and to what I know to be good practice.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prostitution (Public Places) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the first place, tolerance refers to the fact that the law of the land was put on hold inside a geographical area, which was not   satisfactory for anyone.

Even the folk who were locked up during the war and kept in jail love us. We can take it that we are popular. In Kenny MacAskill's excellent speech he suggested that there was some cachet in being associated with Scotland. Once again, people seem to love us. I wonder whether they know what it is that they love.</p><p>That brings me to Sandra White's speech, in <place-holder colnum=\"28486\"/> which she talked about going to the Lebanon. Much as I appreciate and admire the sincerity of people who have been to the Lebanon, it does not prove the case that Scotland stands tall on the international stage when someone in the Lebanon kindly tells the Lebanese that we are Scottish. I have been in a similar situation in the past. I have been introduced to people in other countries as Scottish, to be met by a blank look.</p><p>We have had lots of looking back, so I was happy to hear that the minister is looking forward. That is excellent, because that is what the independent members were hoping to find when we chose \"Scotland International\" as the debate title. However, it worried me when he said that of the students who were asked whether they would recommend Scotland to others as a place in which to study, only 83 per cent said that they would. What about the other 17 per cent? I hate to be puir-moothed about it but, after all, we are being very Scottish this afternoon.</p><p>I am happy to say that not once in the debate have we heard that Scotland punches above its weight because it is part of the United Kingdom. Presumably, that would mean that we have more influence than, say, Merseyside or Tyneside in influencing and determining UK Government policy. Colin Fox's contribution put paid to that. We cannot claim more influence than any of the other regions of the UK, so we do not punch above our weight in that way. With all due respect to Irene Oldfather, who would like to punch it all herself, I do not believe that we punch above our weight in the European Union as far as policies are concerned. Irene is not old enough to remember this as vividly as I do, but I remember the carve-up over whisky. Just before Edward Heath signed up to Europe, the grape producers in Europe brought together an alcohol alliance to ensure that the grain producers&#8212;the Scots producers&#8212;were carved out of the industry.</p><p>I also saw the carve-up in steel, which meant that we had no representation and no special weight to punch in the UK negotiating stance. We lost out in steel and tomatoes and we will soon lose out in energy policy, unless we take full responsibility and do not leave decisions to those who have sold us short in the past.</p><p>Could this punching above our weight mean that we get favours that other regions do not get? We did not get any favours as regards the Poles, Bulgarians and Romanians who have the right to come here. The First Minister is to be congratulated, as are other members of the Cabinet, on trying to ensure that there was a distinctively Scottish response to that movement of people and that a welcome was given. However, it has been hard going and it is arguable just how much of a favour we have been done.<place-holder colnum=\"28487\"/></p><p>What about promoting Scotland abroad? Do we have more influence inside the United Kingdom than we would have as an independent country such as Ireland? I am not at all sure that we do. Phil Gallie talked about how our shipbuilding was greatly admired abroad and people knew about us. The Koreans and the Japanese knew about us, but they just went on and built ships. I do not think that Phil Gallie proved the case that he was trying to prove. He said that Eric Liddell had done great missionary work in China. That he may have done, but I doubt whether we could find three Chinese who could tell us his name now.</p><p>What about coping with global developments? I happen to think that for a country the size of ours it is better to be nippy than weighty. The global economy is moving and changing so fast, and it is much easier to turn a wee tug boat than it is to turn the Queen Mary, if I may use that analogy. We could do rather well for ourselves, nipping in and out in the way that the smaller countries do in the big global movements of industrial and commercial change.</p><p>What is so great about punching above our weight anyway if we are hidden inside the United Kingdom, as I believe that we are? Chris Ballance came up with the only advantage of punching above our weight. He said that Scotland could be the dirty man of Europe, but nobody would know&#8212;thank goodness&#8212;because it is the United Kingdom's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that are measured, not the Scottish ones. That is one advantage; we can hide behind the United Kingdom.</p><p>There is another advantage that we could exploit&#8212;Chris Ballance touched on this in his speech. Some time ago, during the cold war, an organisation called the Edinburgh Conversations was set up, of which I was part. It was a back channel for negotiation on arms reduction, believe it or not, and we could rehearse all the arguments in complete safety. Really top-level people came to the private meetings in Edinburgh or Moscow and we could do so because we were Scottish and could pretend that we were not British. I experienced that and when I have more time I will share some great stories with members. Chris Ballance is right that we could use the futures forum in a similar way. We could somehow pretend that we are not British, so no face would be lost.</p><p>Do small countries like us envy us our political influence? Do the Nordic states long for the chance to be told what to do by America? I do not think so.

I suggest that we should do less, better. That is not an original thought, but I do not know why it was jettisoned along with many of the other promises that were made. One reason why our debates are less than satisfactory to a great number of us on the back benches is that we are so constrained by time. We need time to think, but we do not give ourselves that time. If we are honest with ourselves we will accept that we deliver speeches and afterwards, when we read them in the <em>Official Report</em>&#8212;if we have the nerve&#8212;we wish that we had had more time to think about them, because we would have said this, that and the next thing. I have no doubt that the quality of debate could achieve a tremendous peak of excellence, given how clever we all are.</p><p>There is an element missing from this debate: it is the people outside Parliament, who are supposedly represented by the whisky-bottle shapes on the chamber walls. More than anything, we should worry about how we are perceived outside, rather than how we are perceived among ourselves. I am concerned about that and&#8212;from looking at the press gallery&#8212;I see that our words of wisdom will go unreported yet again. None of the mea culpas that we produce are acknowledged, so they are not relayed to the people who elect us&#8212;or who may not come out to <place-holder colnum=\"28315\"/> elect us to Parliament next time round. As well as examining the parliamentarians' procedures, perhaps the Procedures Committee might seek a rapprochement with the gentlemen of the press. Now that everybody drinks together in the White Heather Club bar, I do not see why we should not discuss how we should fulfil our functions in our democracy, because I do not think that the press are fulfilling theirs properly.

What Donald Gorrie said is absolutely common sense. We do not have to go for every jot and tittle in the committee report just now; we will adapt and amend the proposal, so the fact that there are queries about details such as luggage racks should not rule it out. The debate on the development has also shown the Tory benches to be full of skinflints. They talk the talk on financial autonomy, they think big, but they do not walk the walk. Everything that they said was about the cost of the project; they said nothing about the benefit or the bravery of it. The faint hearts on the SNP benches timidly say that there should be a link, but <place-holder colnum=\"27840\"/> not the one proposed, and that we need a cheaper option because we do not have the money. Sadly, the last point is true. We probably do not have all the money that we need, but the money is there; it is just that we do not have it.</p><p>I address these remarks to colleagues on the Labour benches. Just yesterday, it was announced that the oil and gas sector in the North sea has produced a &#163;20.6 billion turnover&#8212;an increase from &#163;8.7 billion in 1998. Somebody is getting the money, so why should the windfall that is going to the Westminster Treasury not come here? It should represent a windfall for us, for investment capital that is needed for strategic projects such as the Edinburgh airport rail link. If this Parliament&#8212;not a party in it, but the Parliament itself&#8212;demanded even a twentieth of that windfall, we could pay for the Edinburgh airport rail link project and for all the other projects that Fergus Ewing and Mark Ballard mentioned, because we all know that those schemes need attention as well. The money is there and I bet that, if we set out to get it, we would.</p><p>I was surprised that the SNP spokespeople accepted the constraints of devolution. I was not surprised, I suppose, that they thought that we could not manage the project better than the Parliament project was managed, but I think that we could. We have learned a lesson. I echo what Donald Gorrie said about not being able to tunnel, after all the experience that Scottish engineers have had of tunnelling all over the world, so I discount that objection and believe that the tunnelling difficulties could be overcome. As I mentioned, the change from the &#163;1 billion windfall would also pay for all the other projects.</p><p>Bristow Muldoon said that the SNP lacked ambition and that the link could be done&#8212;he is wrong. It's the election, stupid! It has nothing to do with luggage rails, tunnelling or project management and everything to do with where constituency seats might be picked up. I hate saying it, but it is true, so we should just accept it. I look forward to picking up the project again once we have passed that wee hurdle.</p><p>As members know, I am determined that Edinburgh's position as the capital should be recognised by everyone in the Parliament. I came here today in case there was puir-moothed talk about Edinburgh having loads of money and not needing any more. This is not about Edinburgh. What Helen Eadie said is true: this is about Scotland.

That would be laudable if, as a result of our current system of governing and safeguarding Scotland's interests, our fellow citizens enjoyed excellent health, our young people could fulfil their ambitions without having to leave Scotland and our poorer old people were free of the fear of eating or heating beyond the means that the state provides for them. There would be a rationale to wanting more of the same in the future if our present arrangements had not given rise to Carol Craig's brave attempt to help Scots to raise their expectations and develop the <place-holder colnum=\"27172\"/> confidence to pursue higher aspirations in personal achievement, community development and a national sense of well-being.</p><p>If we did not have the pessimism and poverty that were revealed in official statistics that were published today, or malnourished children, or teenagers who are so unfit that they are judged not strong enough to join the armed services until they have undergone intensive training courses to reach an acceptable level of fitness, we might consider it sensible to continue with this system of governance. If we were not angry and frustrated at our own impotence as a national community to prevent our fellow citizens from becoming embroiled in wars that we do not support, and if we were able to develop relationships with other countries that enjoyed support in Scotland, that might constitute a reason for continuing with a political union that was forged to meet the needs of both Scotland and England in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries.</p><p>At its inception, the union was probably a good deal for both countries. England's back door was shut as regards her security, defence and foreign policies and, following the disaster of the Darien scheme, Scots gained access to England's empire, with economic and career development for ambitious Scots at home and abroad. However, although the great political, social and industrial movements of the 20<sup>th</sup> century brought prosperity to some, they also centralised out of Scotland the machinery of public policy making and, therefore, the intrinsic sense of Scotland's national responsibility for the well-being of Scots. Scottish entrepreneurialism was denuded as ambitious risk-takers and innovators followed the headquarters and research and development departments of private sector companies&#8212;often, companies that were previously based in Scotland.</p><p>Figures for emigration from Scotland during the 20<sup>th</sup> century describe better than I can, due to the shortness of time, the imbalance in economic development and personal fulfilment that grew between the populations of Scotland and England. Scots excused themselves and rationalised the lack of opportunity in Scotland by persuading themselves that Scotland was too poor or too small, that it had too much marginal, unproductive land or that it was better off being run from London because we lacked people of ability. As was the case among a surprisingly high percentage of those who were elected by Scots to represent them at Westminster&#8212;whom I met when I was there&#8212;there was a commonly held belief that we Scots benefited from the civilising, liberal influence of the English establishment.</p><p>That last point is probably one of the most urgent reasons for Scotland to place firmly in the <place-holder colnum=\"27173\"/> past those facts and the arguments that have raged over their interpretation. The facts of life in today's and tomorrow's world dictate that we take full responsibility for our own future rather than leave our fate to a pragmatic arrangement that suited our interests 300 years ago. Contemporary and future self-interest and pragmatism demand that we take action to cope with the widening social and demographic differences that exist between England and ourselves. Our needs regarding population growth are diametrically opposed; however, without sovereignty invested in the Scottish Parliament, we will be subject to whatever suits England's needs. The potential to develop in Scotland a less racially divided and more immigrant-friendly society than is currently developing in England will be lost, and that will be a huge loss not only to people in Scotland but to humanity in general.</p><p>The old argument that we have benefited from being on England's economic and trading coat tails no longer applies. The Executive parties have, effectively, conceded that in their laudable attempts to establish direct communication and trading relationships with China, America, Europe and Australia. If proof is needed that a small country can turn around its economy and society although it was on the northern periphery of Europe, had an aging population and a high level of emigration among young people, and although its exports and economy were tied to a bigger neighbour, we should look at Ireland and think back about 20 years ago when one of the arguments that was advanced against Scottish independence was the fact that we did not want to be like Ireland. Times have changed, and it is time that we did.</p><p>We can have the best of both worlds.

As one would expect from business in the independents' allocation of time, this morning's debate will not be used to bash Lewis Macdonald or to allow Lewis Macdonald to bash anybody else. We have had enough bashing without thought in here, so we will be thinking instead about the implications of Professor David Kerr's report for the NHS in Scotland.</p><p>I believe the report to be a good analysis of the principal requirements of the NHS in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. When it was published, some commentators talked down the importance and quality of \"Building a Health Service Fit for the Future\". Some said that we had heard most of the report's observations and recommendations before, which seemed to me to be a case of \"Never mind the quality, feel the width.\" Of course, it is true that we have heard clinicians, academics and health workers in general expounding the need for a particular specialism to be located in one hospital because that is the only way in which the necessary throughput of patients can be achieved to enable surgical teams to develop their expertise to the highest level possible. However, the Kerr report is the first of its kind to remind us implicitly but quite firmly and consistently that there will be trade-offs in the redesign of health services delivery systems.</p><p>To paraphrase Professor Kerr, if patients want to be admitted to hospital as soon as possible after diagnosis, within the timescale intimated to them, and to leave after as short a stay as is compatible with a good recovery, they&#8212;that is us&#8212;will have to take more responsibility for their own health, fitness and sense of well-being. In principle, that seems a fair enough trade-off to me, but such a <place-holder colnum=\"25746\"/> refocused approach will not just swing into place without the appropriate planning procedures or without excellent communication of ideas and objectives to health workers and their potential patients, before policies are signed and sealed. There must also be practical demonstrations from the Executive of how trade-offs can work in the interests of all parts of the Scottish community.</p><p>It is important that the Executive should take the lead in demonstrating that. To give an example of what I mean by the Executive taking the lead in changing our perceptions about how the NHS can best nurture good health, as opposed to cure bad health, I commend Andy Kerr for his attendance at and support for the launch of the Long-Term Conditions Alliance Scotland a couple of days ago. That new charity comprises voluntary organisations that have been campaigning for years on single conditions, representing people who live with diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, post-polio syndrome, lymphoedema, the after-effects of stroke, colitis, Parkinson's disease and many other conditions, some of which are life-threatening and some of which are not but which, nevertheless, are extremely debilitating and, if not managed properly, can easily act as catalysts for the development of other conditions and illnesses, including mental illness, resulting in misery for the sufferer and additional cost to the NHS.</p><p>The minister has wisely pump-primed that new charity because if it is to contribute to the redesign of services as a genuine partner with health boards and social work and housing departments, it will need the money to engage staff who are equal to the task. Thought and energy are required to maximise the return on the resources committed by the Executive and the money raised by the various charities in the umbrella alliance of long-term conditions campaigns. I know, as I am sure other members will, of umpteen campaigning groups and charities that are forced to spend a disproportionate amount of their time and energy on fundraising. Although I am not advancing a case for throwing even more money at organisations such as the Long-Term Conditions Alliance Scotland&#8212;because I am well aware that we are now spending twice what we were spending when the Parliament came into being&#8212;I urge the minister to get together now with the voluntary organisations that might be expected to underpin the collective care in the community of people with the sort of conditions that I have referred to and to deliver much of the information and education that will enable sufferers to manage their conditions and achieve their personal optimum level of good health. It is a waste of the expertise of sufferers, their carers and the volunteers who support them&#8212;to say nothing of the diminished quality of support for sufferers of long-term conditions&#8212;if too much time is spent on <place-holder colnum=\"25747\"/> trying to raise money. There is a balance to be struck and I do not think that we have got it quite right.</p><p>In Edinburgh, there is a prototype of the sort of provision that utilises the energy and imagination of volunteers and appropriate services. The Minister for Health and Community Care has visited the Fala Court health initiative with me. I hope that Lewis Macdonald has heard of it, and he is welcome to visit it too.

In the section of \"Hidden Harm\" on the strategy for tackling drugs, the Executive says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is no single treatment option that works better than others.\"</p><p>I could not agree more and my amendment supports that approach. Indeed, our experience over the past 25 years of having roughly the same mix of policies for dealing with substance abuse has taught us that. We have also learned that the mix of measures falls far short of achieving the objective that is identified in the report of people having</p><p class=\"indent\">\"wherever possible ... a drug-free life.\"</p><p>A week or two ago, the minister spoke about the small reduction in the number of heroin abusers. I doubt whether that can be identified as a trend, however. Even if the decrease is not reversed, I think it is accepted that other drugs have filled the gap. The overall picture is that we continue to have a huge drug-abuse problem.</p><p>As we have heard, tens of thousands of children live with parents who abuse substances. In, \"Hidden Harm\", the Executive says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Across Scotland there are an estimated 40,000-60,000 children affected by parental drug use. An estimated 80,000-100,000 children are affected by parental alcohol misuse.\"</p><p>That is why I always prefer to talk of substance abuse.</p><p>By and large, we understand the use and abuse of alcohol much better than we understand the use and abuse of drugs. Although I would like integrated policies and service delivery for alcohol and drug abuse to be developed, particularly in relation to children who live with substance-abusing parents, I have concentrated on drugs in my amendment today because it is the area where we should have more evaluation of current practices and more investigation of alternatives.</p><p>Because alcohol is legal, policies are easier to change than are those that apply to illegal drugs. We neither control the market in illegal drugs nor attempt to control attitudes&#8212;or, rather, we try to do so, knowing that we cannot. I will therefore concentrate on illegal drugs for the remainder of my contribution, as the issue is more difficult to resolve.<place-holder colnum=\"25585\"/></p><p>I suggest, as I have done before, that one of the things that we must do, if we are to think seriously about how to cope with the huge number of children whose lives are blighted here and now by drugs, is to admit that we do not have the facilities, services or service delivery mechanisms that those children require.</p><p>Perhaps we can think about short circuiting. Could we return to the old system and have a pilot scheme in a suitable area to provide heroin users with legally prescribed heroin? I want such a scheme to be evaluated. No one can argue that the present system is any better than the old one of delivering measured amounts of heroin through a medical route. I wonder whether it can be proved that it is any worse for children to live with heroin-using parents when the heroin is prescribed and delivered by a doctor than it is for them to live with parents whose lives are made chaotic not only by their heroin abuse, but by what they have to do to get their heroin and by the consequences of using heroin that might be cut with heaven knows what.</p><p>Annabel Goldie has spoken movingly in the Parliament about methadone, but I still feel that we have not worked out what methadone is for. Is it a palliative or a short-term treatment? Or, if we take into account the realities to which I referred, such as the shortage of services on the ground and the lack of delivery mechanisms for services, is it really a medicine that people take to keep going when they are desperate? For some people, we should face the unfaceable. At present, we do not offer anything other than methadone, so we must consider how we can make the system just a wee bit better. I agree with Rosemary Byrne that we must intervene and get to the mothers of the children as soon as they leave hospital.</p><p>My amendment mentions kinship carers, whom we often think of as being grandparents, although sometimes they can be other members of the extended family. There are also community carers. Those people must be recompensed. It costs money to do normal activities with children, such as going to the swimming baths or taking them to sports activities. I am glad that Glasgow City Council has acknowledged that, but we do not have a national attitude or policy on recompensing kinship and community carers. I hope that members will support my amendment.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-4370.3, to leave out from \"; recognises\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and to that end guarantees to investigate properly alternative regimes that aim to reduce the harm done by drug abuse and stabilise the lifestyle of persistent drug abusers; acknowledges the important role of kinship carers in helping to safeguard and nurture children who have been affected by substance misuse and recognises this role by financially recompensing them to an agreed national standard, and supports the Executive's commitment to <place-holder colnum=\"25586\"/> further improvements in the way that agencies protect and support children in these circumstances.\"</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361751", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs and Hidden Harm"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I note what you said about the shortage of time, Presiding Officer.

This is the first layer of something important and I hope that there are main party debates on the subject. Karen Whitefield talked about community regeneration and where volunteering fits into that, and in the latter part of his speech Andrew Welsh talked about the importance of village halls. The motion goes right to the heart of the matter when it talks about core funding. I agree with Carolyn Leckie, who spoke about the effects of cuts, some of which may well be occasioned by the amount of money that is being diverted to the London Olympics. I, too, have been concerned that some of the smaller sports clubs and voluntary organisations&#8212;not just in Scotland but particularly here&#8212;might suffer as a result of money having to be found for the Olympic games and changes to lottery funding.</p><p>It is quite ironic that I should appear to be carping about the Olympic games, because I want to speak up for sports club volunteers. The issue is fresh in my mind. At the weekend I was at a swim meet organised by City of Edinburgh Swimming. It was marvellous. About 800 swimmers were there, as were 60 volunteer officials and about 40 volunteer helpers. The event could not have taken place without those volunteers.</p><p>All the young people who were there, and not hanging about aimlessly round street corners and getting up people's noses, were doing the best thing that they could do&#8212;they were getting fit and were channelling their energy into reaching targets and standards. They were absolutely terrific, and the amount of voluntary effort showed what the voluntary sector is all about. The voluntary sector is right at the core of community life.</p><p>However, the scoreboard did not work and the heating was all to pot and could not be controlled. Those problems were to do not purely with voluntary sector funding but with the way in which many services that used to be provided by the leisure and recreation departments of councils are now provided by companies. In Edinburgh, that company is Edinburgh Leisure and it has to operate as a company and attempt to show a profit. Therefore, it cannot look on volunteering <place-holder colnum=\"25214\"/> more kindly than it looks on other, commercial enterprises.</p><p>As a result, people who had come from all over Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland and the Isle of Man, at their own expense, were not treated as Jamie Stone suggested that volunteers should be treated&#8212;with great respect and with genuine community thanks for the way in which they had gone about their volunteering. I am sorry if I sound a little het up but I was very het up when I saw the amount of effort that went into the event and then saw that effort being undervalued.</p><p>I would also like an extension of the idea that the grannies and grandpas whom I saw at that event can be chaperones, coaches and supporters for all the young swimmers. I would like the voluntary sector, or the voluntary sector in combination with a community regeneration drive, to offer training courses for grandparents so that we can get them involved in the supportive volunteering that I associate with swimming clubs, cycle clubs, boxing clubs and all sorts of sports clubs. We sometimes forget that the people who make all that effort often do not really have the money to do it.

However, all have failed to achieve their strategic objective, if we define that objective as being to rid society of the destructive power of drug abuse.<place-holder colnum=\"24772\"/></p><p>Governments, local councils and health boards have been fighting and losing the war against drugs since I chaired the Scottish Drugs Forum in the late 1980s. That is not intended as a criticism of their competence, but much the same mixture of policies has been pursued in other countries, with much the same outcome&#8212;an apparently inexorable rise in drug abuse. At this point, it is worth noting the difference in the statistics for drug abuse between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. I am sure that Stewart Stevenson will agree that there is bound to be a big difference between the statistical use of cannabis in Amsterdam and its use throughout the whole of the Netherlands, because people go to Amsterdam specifically to smoke cannabis.

Ten to 15 years ago, dance drugs were all the rage for the bright young things out on the town or up for a rave. However, there has been a change in social attitudes and culture; although those drugs are still available, alcohol is now the substance of first choice and getting legless is now an accepted part of a good night out.</p><p>Although alcohol abuse statistics show that the situation is worse in the UK than it is elsewhere, this new fashion in substance abuse is becoming common across Europe. Young people are simply ignoring the laws that govern alcohol, cannabis and cocaine and are mixing and matching those substances to the detriment of their health and of national health service budgets. The relevant laws and, indeed, our general approach to substance abuse are not working, which is why front-line police officers in Strathclyde have said loud and clear that a fundamental reassessment of attitude and policy is required. Those officers, who spoke as members of the Scottish Police Federation, have not&#8212;as some sections of the media have reported&#8212;advocated immediate and/or wholesale legalisation of drugs. Moreover, neither I nor my amendment seeks such a move. The policies that have been pursued for more than two decades are failing, so I&#8212;like those officers&#8212;want a wholesale investigation of the reasons for increased abuse of substances including alcohol, and an open-minded <place-holder colnum=\"24773\"/> approach to dealing with the situation in the interests of abusers and for the general good.</p><p>Prohibition of potentially injurious substances does not have a very good track record. Before anyone refers to the very high rate of public compliance with the smoking ban, I point out that it is much too soon to draw conclusions not on how or where people smoke but on how many fewer people are doing so. As the police officers in Strathclyde have suggested, it is time to think the unthinkable and to probe the feasibility of, for example, supplying heroin legally and under medical supervision to registered addicts. After all, that is what happened not so long ago. The benefits to users' health are obvious. The reduction in the level of criminality that is associated with the illegal supply of drugs is a less predictable element, but we can be pretty sure that a reduction would happen.</p><p>There is evidence that the likelihood is higher than was previously thought that heavy cannabis users can suffer permanent damage, but I wonder whether the figures are any worse than the figures for the harm that is done to the health of binge-drinkers and other alcohol abusers, and whether the statistics suggest that the two substances should be approached from the same legal and practical starting point.</p><p>As for methadone, should it be viewed as a short or long-term palliative, as a substitute for heroin or as a cheap way of introducing some order into chaotic lives? Can we ever consider viewing crack cocaine and the newer derivative life-destroyers in the same light as legally controlled and supplied substances? I believe that we should not, but if police officers did not have so much work to do on heroin and cocaine, they might have more time and resources to combat the even more dangerous drugs that can be made in a back bedroom.</p><p>Before anyone is moved to reply that a reclassification of and a fresh approach to drugs will send out confusing signals and encourage more drug abuse, I freely concede that the Home Office made a pig's ear of its new approach to cannabis. Its model is not the one that we should follow.</p><p>Hugh Henry said that the Executive's policy objective was to give people drug-free lives. If that objective does not include alcohol, we will have to do a lot of explaining to the people who now use that substance in much the same way as their parents might have used cannabis. One reason for a fresh examination into attitudes and patterns is that the statistics that have been cited even in this short debate are very confusing, so I urge the Executive to carry out an investigation to clear up the matter. I have posed questions, but I do not <place-holder colnum=\"24774\"/> know all the answers.

One is for subjects not to be merged and the other is for the issue of teacher training to be examined at the same time as the curriculum is being examined.

I ask the minister to take a close and detailed interest in what is happening in governing bodies and local authorities.</p><p>The SNP is absolutely right to describe the provision of facilities as a priority if we are to enhance sporting success in Scotland. Yesterday, I attended a swimming meet in Edinburgh, which was organised by the active sports programme. I go every year and it gets better every year. I congratulate the Executive for that initiative, which has allayed some of my fears that it might be trying to get PE teaching on the cheap. However, I am glad that Karen Gillon alluded to the fact that last year a 17 per cent decrease in the number of PE teachers in primary schools was recorded. Members may share my concern that the Executive will not meet its target for 2008 because the numbers of PE teachers that are required are not in training.</p><p>The Minister for Education and Young People is aware of another initiative, which will be piloted in Edinburgh, I believe, and which will seek to make use of many of the students who are currently doing physical activity courses in our further education colleges. I will leave it to the minister to go into the detail of scheme, but it is another small triumph for team MacDonald.</p><p>I turn to the issue of teams and what we call them. The SNP is right to say that there could be a Scottish team at the Olympics. However, internationalism is a different concept in today's sport. I hate to pour cold water on the SNP's proposal for a Scottish Olympic team, but I would do the same to the proponents of team GB. We should consider how many athletes choose to join another country and compete under its colours. In the winter Olympics, umpteen alpine skiers originate from places other than the Alps. Plenty of swimmers and track and field athletes join the countries that best specialise in their sports because that allows them access to specialised coaching. We are moving into a new era. I appeal to both sides to stop the silly argy-bargy about team GB and team Scotland. If we want to have a team Scotland at the Olympics, we can have one. We could do what New Zealand and Trinidad do and specialise in our strongest sports. We could also remain part of team GB.

He is right: many more members should have been here today. I congratulate the minister. He is on top of his brief and I have found him easy to approach. I will say this for him&#8212;he does listen. The fact that he cannot always deliver as quickly as I would like is the fault not just of the minister but of a great number of things that I do not have time to go into.</p><p>Professor David Kerr's report stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need a health care system with an emphasis on providing continuous preventative care for people with long term conditions to balance our ability to react quickly and safely to medical emergencies ... Long term conditions require ongoing care ... They are common in the Scottish population, more common in people living in deprived circumstances, more common in older people and, because Scotland's population is ageing, they will become even more prevalent in the future.\"</p><p>Having talked to the minister, I know that work is being done to examine the situation in relation to long-term conditions. For example, work is already being done with people who approached the minister through the Public Petitions Committee, who have a condition that not many people know about&#8212;they are post-polio sufferers. I appreciate the fact that the minister took time to pay attention to a condition that has been neglected for a long time. Also, as a number of members said, Audit Scotland is studying the management of people with long-term conditions.</p><p>However, for many people who live with chronic conditions, the reduction in waiting times means little. I do not mean to whine; I am just stating a fact. The report from the NHS Scotland long-term conditions action team states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our challenge is to provide the best quality of care within our finite resources for our citizens who may suffer from long term conditions now and in the future.\"</p><p>Obviously, its aim is to keep people as well as possible for as long as possible. It continues:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our staff will be well trained in patient centred approaches and will be working in strong multidisciplinary teams that span the current divides between primary and secondary care and health and social care.\"</p><p>Members might note the link between that and my intervention on the member who opened for the Liberal Democrats, when I asked about physiotherapy.</p><p>I turn the minister's attention to physiotherapy because it is an example of something that requires more of an emphasis now that he is getting on top of the surgery waiting times. We can <place-holder colnum=\"23549\"/> point to any number of individuals who do not receive on-going care and whose quality of life is much reduced as a result. For them, waiting lists mean little. My experience in Lothian is that, if someone's doctor recommends them for physiotherapy, they get a block of six sessions. Often, that is not enough to cope with their condition, but when they finish the block of six sessions the physiotherapist has no leeway to decide that they need another one or two treatments. The patient has to go back to their doctor and start again.</p><p>Many people who live with chronic conditions have a number of needs that cross several medical disciplines. At present, they have to be referred to each one individually by their GP. That concerns me, particularly in relation to physiotherapy. If we are talking about preventive medicine and about helping people to help themselves, physiotherapy should play a large part in the provision of care. Is the minister aware that, in Scotland, 64 per cent of physiotherapy graduates cannot get posts? That figure is shocking and I do not completely understand it; perhaps it takes us back to the question of finite resources. We also do not compare well with the United Kingdom figure, which is 53 per cent.</p><p>I have many examples to give to the minister later&#8212;I do not have time just now&#8212;to round out that bald figure and to show where paying more attention to physiotherapy and making better provision would help with hospital care and so on. I see that the minister is nodding. As I said, he is very approachable and I am happy to pay tribute to him for that, as long as he promises me that long-term conditions will not fall behind more dramatic illnesses in the priority scale.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356643", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pick up from where Duncan McNeil left off.

Instead, they win educational time, which is the whole point. The children learn how to meet people from outside their own tight community. Linlithgow is a fairly small community; as Fiona Hyslop said, when she looks at the gallery, she is looking at people she knows.

We have all congratulated the pupils, but we should not forget that they could not do what they do without teachers who are willing to go above and beyond the curriculum. Especially in primary schools, the curriculum contains so much that the staff deserve our congratulations on having developed and guided such a project. Every time the teaching of history is discussed in Parliament, we should hold up to Peter Peacock the example of Linlithgow primary school, which shows what we should do with history.

One in five children in Scotland receives the requisite amount of PE as defined by the Executive. That figure is abysmally low. The reasons for that low figure are in some cases complex, but easy to understand in others, particularly in the primary schools. The primary school timetable is cluttered, and it needs to be decluttered if we are serious about having fitter children. We also need to ensure that primary school teachers are either motivated or properly trained to fill in for PE classes, and I have discussed that matter with the Minister for Education and Young People. We should consider emergency measures, such as drafting in PE assistants. I can tell the minister where to get them, because I have been to see them and have talked to their curriculum organisers. It is possible to draft assistants in, and if we are serious about our children's health, we will do that.</p><p>There is also a great need for home economics teachers. Few people are aware that so little home economics is taught. I am not talking about turning the heel in a sock; we do not need to do that. I know that Frances Curran does not turn the heels on her socks. However, we could do with the cookery and nutrition content of what used to be home economics in schools. Home economics should be aimed not just at pupils but at teachers, who, as Frances Curran says, do not have the time themselves to cook and who may actually have to learn to cook. A generation has missed the tradition of mothers passing on how to make a good pot of soup or mince. Is mince politically correct now?</p><p>Emergency measures could also be taken to connect up the voluntary effort that Euan Robson referred to. On Monday, I took the Minister for Health and Community Care to visit Fala Court, which is a community health initiative in the south of Edinburgh. Fala Court invites local grannies to teach young mothers and others how to cook. We have to look at the community roots level to channel people's practical skills.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13355597", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childhood Obesity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Elaine Smith, I start by thanking and congratulating the Executive on its efforts so far.

That is not necessarily to redistribute income; it is to redistribute health. That argument has been made and the effects of that redistribution can be witnessed in action at Bathgate academy and, as Euan Robson said, at Leith primary school, where highly motivated women work in the kitchens. Jamie Oliver recognised that, first of all, he had to get to the people who were preparing and serving school meals. If we inspire them, we will inspire the children. I have seen that for myself&#8212;Bathgate academy is recommended.</p><p>We need to look at private finance initiative schools, because they are being built without proper kitchens. How can such schools do proper cooking? We need to get school kitchens back. That is not just turning the clock back; it is not just nostalgia. We have to ban food and drink that we consider unhealthy. I mean that&#8212;ban it. That means that local authorities will need more money so that schools do not depend on vending machines for some of their spending money. If we are serious about tackling childhood obesity, we cannot dodge hard priority choices that have to be made. Television adverts could be banned&#8212;we have banned them for booze, so why cannot we ban them for bad food as well? That could certainly be done before what used to be called the watershed.</p><p>I have news for all the members who are here. It is not just us who are falling down on the job. In all European countries&#8212;even in Spain, Portugal and Italy, where mamma's home cooking is a daily feature of the culture&#8212;children are overweight. I read that Spanish children are deemed to be fatter than ours. We are talking about an international problem in the developed world. Maybe we have found a use for the European Union&#8212;perhaps it could do something about banning television adverts for the products of the unsavoury side of the food industry.</p><p>I take on board what Frances Curran said.

The SPCB acts in the name of that electorate to preserve and promote the Parliament's good name and the ethos that is enshrined in our mace. The SPCB should be guided by those four principles in managing the Parliament's affairs&#8212;other than Executive business and the opposition to that from our other political parties and representatives&#8212;but it is not, nor should it be, one of the Parliament's party-political forums.</p><p>When I expressed that view to colleagues in all parties and in none yesterday, the vast majority agreed with me&#8212;perhaps some were only being nice&#8212;but some people ventured the opinion that, as in the case of the Subordinate Legislation Committee, an SPCB member who is a willing volunteer will be better than one who is a pressed man or woman. However, a few colleagues thought that the SPCB should be comprised of members of the four biggest parties. I respect those colleagues as politicians and I even like them as people, but I fail to see why only their party's representatives can take decisions of a non-partisan nature on behalf of the whole Parliament.</p><p>Most decisions and votes in the Parliament will be taken along party-political lines. Those will be based sometimes on ideology but more often on manifesto commitments. That is the nature of our parliamentary democracy and I take no issue with it. Business needs to be organised in an orderly manner and the electorate's wishes should be respected.</p><p>However, the Parliament as an institution is not the preserve of whichever party wins the election; it has to be cherished, protected and allowed to evolve and develop in sympathy with the people who send us here and trust us to strive to organise <place-holder colnum=\"22319\"/> our business, unhindered&#8212;as far as possible&#8212;by the different priorities and concerns of competing political parties. We should take some decisions as parliamentarians rather than as MSPs who represent political parties, and this is one such decision.</p><p>The Scotland Act 1998 currently binds us to having only four elected members of the SPCB. That is one of the matters that we might expect to be changed when the act is amended to meet more sensitively the needs of the Parliament. However, I do not consider that a priority because I believe that even within the current statutory framework there are ways open to us through which we could improve the level of ownership of the SPCB by all MSPs.</p><p>The lines of communication between the SPCB and MSPs and, subsequently, the quality of the SPCB's stewardship of parliamentary affairs could be improved. At present, the only formal communication between the corporate body and the back benches occurs in infrequent question-and-answer sessions in the chamber. I propose a more continuous flow of information both ways&#8212;particularly when decisions have to be taken that will reverberate outside the Parliament and for which, theoretically and certainly in the eyes of the public, we are all responsible. The decision on the provision of a smoking facility is one example that springs to mind. If the SPCB had invited MSPs to attend its meetings on an observer or advisory basis, depending on the issues under discussion, perhaps there might have been more accurate and sensitive reporting of Scottish Green Party members' expenses.</p><p>I have a number of other ideas for improving the transparency and communication of the work undertaken in our name by the SPCB.

The expert report on prostitution has as a stated objective</p><p class=\"indent\">\"To influence the attitudes which lead to the abuse of women sexually and physically through prostitution.\"</p><p>I am happy that the Executive has taken that on board. It should be congratulated on adopting a sensible, caring approach to how best it can exert influence. The Deputy Minister for Justice has indicated that he sees no reason to distinguish violence against that group of women from violence against any other group of women and that he will expect local agencies to instigate local awareness-raising initiatives that mirror the Executive's guidance on managing prostitution and exercising a duty of care towards street prostitutes.</p><p>It is proved beyond doubt that streets prostitutes are at greater risk of experiencing violent attack, although the experience of the managed or tolerance zones in Aberdeen and Edinburgh indicates that there is a higher level of protection from violence if women are working in an area that incorporates security measures such as suitable surveillance by police or security cameras and a closely sited drop-in centre. The statistics from Edinburgh appear to bear that out. In the last full year of the managed or tolerance zone, there were 11 reports of violence against prostitutes&#8212;less than one a month. In the first three months without a zone, there were exactly the same number of reports of violence as in the entire previous year. I think that, statistically, the increase in the number of violent attacks on women working as prostitutes in Edinburgh has been more than 1,000 per cent.</p><p>The difference between the levels of violence experienced by indoor and outdoor sex workers shows the advisability of managing the business in order to reduce harm and the violence that people selling sex can experience. A study of indoor and outdoor workers in Leeds, Glasgow and Edinburgh has been carried out. Eighty-one per cent of street sex workers reported violence, as opposed to 48 per cent of indoor sex workers. Fifty per cent of street workers reported violence in the previous six months, as opposed to 26 per cent of indoor <place-holder colnum=\"21505\"/> workers. Forty-four per cent of street women who had experienced violence had reported the crimes, whereas only 18 per cent of indoor workers reported a crime. The case appears to have been made for a duty of care to be exercised towards prostitutes, if we mean to reduce the harm that is done to them while they are prostitutes. I have spoken only about harm reduction, but most people would like prostitutes to exit prostitution. Much of the Executive's plan is geared towards that.</p><p>Attitudes towards violence against women must be changed, as many members have said. Although the Executive, like those who have spoken today, advocates local initiatives through schools and community education to educate people out of the attitude that violence against women is only to be expected, how can that possibly win the battle&#8212;I was going to say for hearts and minds, but I think that that is the wrong expression&#8212;to influence opinion in face of something such as the popular computer game \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", which is sold over the counter and in which prostitutes are killed? I do not want to ban or proscribe anything, but if we can say that we will not sell fireworks to people under a certain age, surely we can say that we will not sell games that make fun out of killing prostitutes.</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13351496", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will confine my remarks to one aspect of violence against women.

I share Rob Gibson's concern that although, according to Professor Devine, teacher training on Scottish literature and associated cultural aspects may have improved, it has not improved enough to make many teachers feel comfortable when teaching those subjects.</p><p>The minister said that more time will be given to subjects such as PE and music, following the curriculum review. He knows that I greatly approve of that, but I wonder which subjects will have to give up time. Page 10 of \"ambitious, excellent schools\" states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we know from the National Debate ... that parents and teachers worry about the volume and nature of assessment and about a cluttered curriculum\".<place-holder colnum=\"21335\"/></p><p>I am a parent and a grandparent, and I worry about a cluttered curriculum, particularly in primary schools. Primary teachers are now asked to teach too many specific topics. I refer to Fiona Hyslop's comments on that&#8212;we have a common cause on that issue, although that is not the case for all her remarks. It is obvious when one talks to secondary teachers that children have to catch up in secondary school. However, it is not only secondary teachers who have to teach the subjects that are somewhat disparagingly referred to as the basics or the three Rs; universities have had to introduce catch-up courses in basic arithmetic for people who have ostensibly passed their highers and gained university entrance. We must consider how we deliver many of the objectives because, as members of all parties have said, some subjects that are now taught in primary school do not need to be taught there.</p><p>Despite the attempts to reintroduce the teaching of grammar in schools, the subject is not given enough time in teacher training and teachers in schools do not have time to teach it. I know that, occasionally, ministers can be misquoted in newspapers, so I will not punch out the minister for this, but he is reputed to have said that we should not teach children subjects that bore them rigid or that they do not like. Of course we should, because they have to learn wisdom and how to cope with boredom. They have to learn how to do things that they do not like, because they will have to do that when they become adults and are in the workplace. That is part of growing up and part of children's wider education. When the Deputy Minister for Children and Young People sums up, I would like to hear what plans there are to improve the teaching of grammar in schools.</p><p>Page 7 of \"ambitious, excellent schools\" discusses values and citizenship, which other members have mentioned. We need to take an almost collegiate approach to producing healthy and responsible citizens. The approach would encompass PE, aspects of home economics such as buying and preparing food and the social responsibility that must be imparted&#8212;I hesitate to say \"morality\", because that word has many interpretations. I know that the minister is considering such an approach. On world AIDS day, it is entirely relevant that we should accept that, as part of the health, physical and citizenship education that children receive almost by osmosis in school, we should include sex education. I do not see anything in the report on that.</p><p>To achieve all the objectives, we need more teachers. Although I respect the Executive's attempts, not enough PE teachers are in training to meet the objectives on PE in a reasonable timeframe. It is not enough to say that we now have oodles of sports co-ordinators, because they can co-ordinate only if the subject has been taught <place-holder colnum=\"21336\"/> and understood. On a recent visit to some primary schools, I observed dangerous practices by teachers who were teaching a subject in which they were not specifically qualified. When I questioned them, they admitted that they were doing it because they felt they had to, not because they felt they could do it properly.</p><p>I have concentrated on primary schools, but I have a quick comment on secondary schools. I am glad that many head teachers are now saying that they will place children according to their ability in specific subjects. We have known that we should stream for a long time; saying that we should not has simply confused the situation.</p><p>Frank McAveety might be right that Scottish teachers are now more confident in teaching Scottish matters than they were in the past, but there are still areas of ignorance and confusion. Kenny MacAskill talked about the history of sectarianism. It is true that there was religious division in churches, but in Lanarkshire and the west of Scotland there was social division, which was imported by colliery owners, some of whom were called Hamilton. It was not only religion but social and economic divisions that set people against each other.

I am referring to the failure to achieve the Executive's stated target of having an additional 400 PE teachers in place by 2008-09.</p><p>In contrast to the sometimes formulaic anger of the Opposition parties when the Executive misses its targets, I want to suggest alternative ways of achieving the desired outcome, which is a healthier and happier school population and not merely an increase in the number of people who teach PE. The Executive has said that it will fill the gap in PE teacher numbers by 2008-09 by training qualified teachers in PE. I caution the minister against trying to make good the shortfall in the number of PE teachers, which is 142, through that approach. PE is a specific discipline and most generalist classroom teachers have neither the aptitude nor the desire to teach PE. That is not just the opinion of an old PE teacher who is protective of the standards of a profession that is coming into its own. Just today, Pat O'Donnell, of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, warned that increasing the number of PE teachers will not be as simple as asking other teachers to take on PE.</p><p>Has the minister a recruitment drive to tempt back into their tracksuits PE teachers who took early-retirement packages? They could be recruited on short, fixed-term contracts and receive good money. They could have two responsibilities: they would not merely teach PE in the classroom but encourage volunteers among <place-holder colnum=\"19230\"/> parents, teachers and community activists who would be willing to do the sort of thing to which Donald Gorrie referred. I feel that a great deal of knowledge, talent and willingness remains untapped.</p><p>To widen the approach to producing healthier children, I also urge the minister to reappraise the role of teachers of home economics, particularly with regard to the teaching of nutrition, in achieving the objective of a healthier school population. I was disappointed to learn that of the 23 secondary schools in Edinburgh, only 11 offer HE at higher level. That situation is mirrored across the country. Only 14 people qualified as HE teachers in 2002-03, which was a reduction of 9 from the previous year's figure. I suggest to the minister therefore that he must boost the number of HE teachers as soon as possible, or much of the work that he is doing to improve PE in schools will be wasted. I believe that we should teach holistically with the aim of having a healthy mind in a healthy body. I am sorry if that sounds hackneyed, but it is another of the good aspects of our traditional approach to education that we have forgotten.</p><p>I recommend to the minister that he visits Bathgate Academy, where there is a superb physical activities co-ordinator, Roslyn Fraser, who, in conjunction with the canteen supervisor, Cathy Henderson, and an HE teacher, Pearl Scott, has contrived a programme that will, I think, outdo anything that comes from the hungry for success healthy eating standards that the minister wants to introduce. They have understood that to promote a healthy lifestyle it is much better to teach physical education, health education and moral education together. My knowledge of that approach was my reason for asking the minister whether there was room left in the curriculum to introduce new concepts.</p><p>I genuinely believe that the Bathgate Academy model is the way to approach physical and health education. There are teachers who are capable of taking on that holistic approach, but as it is different from the traditional approach to teacher training in Scotland, it requires investigation by the Executive. I would welcome an assurance from the minister that he has an open mind about that.</p><p>I will make one last plea. While ensuring that there is an adequate number of PE students in training, can the minister also ensure that they know how to fire a drive, whether that be in hockey, golf or any other sport that needs a stick and a ball, and that they are not all turned into sports scientists who have never hit a shuttlecock in anger?</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13345593", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Teachers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Much as I acknowledge the Executive's good intentions and, indeed, the fact that it has had success in improving the professional status of teachers, I cannot help but think that a little modesty in the motion might have gone a long way towards more accurately reflecting where there is still work to be done.

If the summit was to be held in England, I fear that there would be a great difference in the attitudes of the Whitehall departments that would be responsible for picking up the bills for the extra policing and the extra local authority spending south of the border. Policing would be paid for by the Home Office, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office would foot the bill for expenditure on, for example, extra barriers for crowd control.</p><p>Those two departments have refused requests from the authorities in Scotland for them to underwrite the costs to the City of Edinburgh Council and Lothian and Borders police. The departments say that policing is a matter for the Scottish Executive, but was the G8 summit at Gleneagles a known quantity when the block grant was totalled up according to the Barnett formula? Does the Minister for Finance and Public Service Reform's budget heading for the police include an allowance for the biggest policing operation that Scotland will ever have seen? It is massively unfair that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued the invitations to Gleneagles and will call all the shots yet will leave the bills to be picked up by <place-holder colnum=\"17687\"/> the City of Edinburgh Council's council tax payers and the minister.</p><p>I am aware of Chancellor Gordon Brown's Treasury contribution of &#163;20 million to the kitty for the policing costs, but unfortunately that figure has probably been overtaken by Bob Geldof's enthusiasm. We have yet to hear from the chancellor&#8212;who has apparently supported Bob Geldof's analysis&#8212;whether the Treasury will pay for the increased policing costs that will flow from Sir Bob's invitation for people to stand and be counted in Edinburgh.</p><p>The Parliament should demand that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not leave Edinburgh's council tax payers and the Parliament with a bill of, perhaps, more than &#163;100 million. It adds insult to injury for anyone to say that the city will benefit from the purchasing power of the many people who will descend on it for the make poverty history march or the long walk to justice. I have no doubt that some businesses will benefit, but others will shut. While great uncertainties remain about which businesses and home owners will be given insurance cover for damage or loss of business, we have the right to demand a clearer answer from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p><p>Having checked with bed-and-breakfast establishments in Edinburgh this morning, as far as I know no rise in business is discernible. In fact, some report that they have lost business leading up to the summit. One hotel chain will have more business, which I presume will come from the journalists to whom the Minister for Finance and Public Service Reform referred, but it does not have bookings before that.

I consider myself a citizen of the British isles. I am Scottish and, as such, I have something in common with everyone in the British isles, including those who live in the Republic of Ireland, which is a separate country. When my daughter lived and worked in Ireland, I was no further removed from her than I was from my sister who lives in Yorkshire, who was in the same state as me but in a different country. I believe that all three of us are members of the same social union. There is such a thing as a social union, as distinct from a political union. I would like to see an end of the political union in which we are held and the development of our social union; however, I believe that devolution militates against that.</p><p>The rumblings that we hear from the further reaches of the Tory party&#8212;and, it must be said, the Labour Party in England&#8212;about the embarrassment of the goings on in the Scottish Parliament are a product of devolution and are harming the social union that I happen to hold dear.</p><p>Independence and a sovereign Parliament would be good for us&#8212;just ask the Irish and the <place-holder colnum=\"17637\"/> Norwegians about that&#8212;but we are addressing the Scotland Act 1998 and its result, which is this Parliament. As far as I am concerned, the major structural defect in that act is the fact that the organisation that it created is only a spending organisation. Theoretically, we have the power to levy an additional income tax, but it is unlikely ever to be used because it raises complicated questions about exactly who is a Scottish taxpayer. Never mind the political implications, it would present enormous logistical problems, even for the Inland Revenue's sophisticated computer system.</p><p>The real powers that we do not have are easy to define, as they are listed in schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998. It is a formidable list and it was calculated by its authors in Westminster to put the Parliament firmly inside a cage. We cannot decide on Scotland's constitutional relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom. If, for example, we had to choose the Liberal Democrat position of a federal relationship, we could not implement it even if the Scottish people had voted on it and it was their proven desire. We are also denied a say in the critical economic area of international trade policy although we know how essential such a say is for small nations. Think of the Windward islands and the banana republic there, which has direct access to the World Trade Organisation. We cannot have such access as a devolved Parliament. Incidentally, we cannot have that access without a foreign office of our own, which is where I disagree with John Swinburne again. We must have a foreign office if we are to operate the sort of foreign policy that Scots support and that is suited to our status as a small European country.</p><p>Unfortunately, I do not have time to take fiscal autonomy to bits. Suffice it to say that it is an expression that covers a multitude of sins and I do not want to be associated in any way with sin. However, I agree with Donald Gorrie that the Parliament should set up a committee to examine the powers in schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 and identify which of them could be transferred to the Scottish Parliament in whole or in modified form. The rational way to proceed is through proper consideration with the assistance of experts, a dialogue with Scottish MPs&#8212;whose position in Westminster would obviously be further undermined by any further transfer of powers&#8212;and a discussion with the Government in London to determine how far we can develop devolution and how easily we can transfer to sovereignty.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341691", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliament (Powers)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank John Swinburne for bringing this debate to the chamber and express my regret that every single Labour MSP is either washing their hair or walking their dog.

However, when we consider the formal pitches that have been introduced during a time when the overall number of pitches has diminished, we still have to question whether or not we have struck the right balance between long pitches and short pitches. I am not talking about the length of the pitch, but about the length of the artificial grass. For example, a long length is suitable for football and a short length is suitable for hockey. An important element of the general pitches strategy that is, I believe, required of each authority is that the authority should have a balance between the two sorts of pitches to reflect the balance in sporting activity.</p><p>I am not sure that the City of Edinburgh Council has that balance right. One reason why I say that is that, although an audit of Edinburgh's pitches has been completed, it has not been discussed by the council. That is worrying. One wonders why it was not discussed, but that might be something to do with the great pressures that the council faces. As Mike Watson described, the council faces competing pressures from the requirement for more housing in a burgeoning economy and the requirement to provide space in which people can exercise informally and formally.</p><p>Edinburgh has a mixed record in catering for informal, spontaneous and unorganised recreation and sport, which is another issue that Mike Watson mentioned. For example, although the pitches at Meggetland have been modernised and are supposedly greatly improved, they are also greatly diminished in size, with the opportunity for informal exercise and recreation much diminished. However, the polo fields just further up the road in Colinton are to remain because the council&#8212;in what, as far as I am concerned, was an admirable decision&#8212;passed up the chance to make what one expects might have been a great deal of money in council tax when it insisted that the playing fields were sacrosanct. As the matter is due to come before the minister, I look to him for a result on that appeal, which I do not believe should be upheld. However, I mention that just in passing.</p><p>Another important aspect that interests me is the need for public access to any new pitches that are provided. On that issue, we need to recognise the need to have a parkie who will look after the facility. Local authorities have got out of the habit of employing groundsmen and park-keepers to control and manage their facilities. I am sure that that is what Mike Watson meant when he talked about the need for a system of management. If local authorities are prevented from employing the <place-holder colnum=\"17447\"/> necessary parkies mainly by a shortage of cash, I hope that the Executive will see them all right.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Playing Fields"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with much of Mike Watson's analysis.

That is something to which the Parliament aspires and to which people in Scotland aspire, to judge by the response to the recent tsunami appeal, but, for a long time, perhaps we did not do it as much as we might have done. Jean Turner took our immediate needs and her knowledge and added them to what we might do internationally, so she got the idea as well and I give her three gold stars.</p><p>I wished that I could have got into the open debate on education, because I wanted to talk about the purpose of education and whether we are certificating ourselves out of it. I hope that Robin Harper has given some Executive members ideas about the holistic approach to education that we need.

He has obviously built up knowledge of the subject from listening to people, and he knew exactly how many parents had been on the march.

Just when he needed them, he had the brief and the notes to rebut something that David Davidson had said. I congratulate the minister on rising above the normal hurly-burly of party-political, internecine strife. He showed that he had extracted from the debate some of the ideas and blue-skies thinking, which he has promised he will feed back into the Executive's thinking. That was all that we independents wanted from the debate. We just wanted to provide the opportunity for that to happen, and we thought that now was a good time to do that.</p><p>Nobody mentioned the black hole in the Tories' spending plans and in Labour's spending plans. We have had a full debate and that has not even been mentioned. Perhaps we are all too sensible and know that whoever gets in will raise taxes eventually. A bit of honesty could be read into what was not said in the debate as much as into what was said.</p><p>I regret the fact that the opening speaker for the SNP poured scorn on what we were trying to do, although I congratulate his colleagues on taking advantage of the opportunity that was afforded them. Some members will disagree with me, but I believe that we heard a fine speech from Stewart Maxwell. It seemed entirely relevant that we should talk about independence in the context of talking about the hopes and aspirations of people in Scotland.</p><p>I have good political friends who share much the same philosophical outlook as Labour members although we disagree, for the moment, on the constitutional question. Just as they opened their minds to changing their party's philosophy and policies because they accepted that the world had changed, I ask them to consider changing their view on the constitutional question if it can be proved that we live in a changing world and that our present constitutional arrangement does not <place-holder colnum=\"15897\"/> best serve the needs and aspirations of the people of Scotland. I am asking only for an open mind on the subject.</p><p>It is great to sit on the independent benches, as we are allowed to have open minds and we do not need to have any set responses: we can go with the flow. I sincerely hope that, in providing the opportunity for a debate such as we have had today, we have given members on the other benches the idea that going with the flow is a good thing. Members do not always need to stand on the principle on which they were elected to the Parliament if things have changed around them. It is not so much the principle. We talk about principles, but we do not mean principles: we mean policies. Principles can stand, but policies can change.

If the Parliament does that, it will meet a need in Scotland and will answer the requests that have been made of a number of members to tackle prostitution quickly. I recommend that the Executive put into effect the recommendations of the group of interested people and experts that, under the chairmanship of former assistant chief constable Sandra Hood, it appointed to investigate prostitution in Scotland.</p><p>Members might recall the bill that I introduced in the first session of the Parliament. It was called the Prostitution Tolerance Zones (Scotland) Bill, which was a bit of a misnomer, but we all make mistakes. After that bill fell, it was felt that, in the course of its progress through the parliamentary system, we had uncovered a neglected area. Therefore, the Executive&#8212;to its credit&#8212;set up the expert group, which has taken a year to investigate in depth how prostitution is practised and how it is changing as a result of all sorts of social and economic changes.</p><p>The group impressed me with how it tackled its work, in that it was not content merely to consider the scene in Scotland, but travelled outside Scotland to learn from others. However, the group found that much of the work that is being done to tackle prostitution in cities in England derives from the information and expertise that have been built up in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, because Scotland has been ahead of the field in its local attempts to manage an enduring problem for many citizens who are unconnected with prostitution.</p><p>I commend the group's report, \"Being Outside: Constructing a Response to Street Prostitution\", which recommends that the law on prostitution should be changed. The present law potentially criminalises only the seller of sex&#8212;that is, the woman&#8212;because, although it should not be, our law is gender specific. In the first year of its work, the expert group did not consider male prostitution, which it intends to consider in another tranche of work, so I am referring to women for the moment.</p><p>The group recommended that the buyer and the seller of sex or sexual services should both be viewed in the same light and that, if they offended any member of the public or any group in society or caused such people alarm by their actions, they could be prosecuted for doing so. That is of interest to those in Glasgow who have called for <place-holder colnum=\"15851\"/> the introduction of a law to deter kerb crawlers. If the offence was the creation of nuisance, alarm or annoyance, the kerb crawler would be caught by the same legislation as the prostitute who solicits in a way that causes offence or alarm. That proposal would equalise the law and would be a great improvement on the current law, which criminalises only the woman.</p><p>The expert group recommended that, even before we get to changing the law, a national strategic approach should be taken to this&#8212;not that we should have a huge policy and reams of well-meaning written work, but that the matter should be considered seriously. The group recommended that an overall approach should be taken to achieving the objectives of reducing the number of women who work as prostitutes; helping those who do so to exit that work; minimising the exploitation that&#8212;there is no doubt about it&#8212;goes along with prostitution; and minimising the potential for physical harm that is done to prostitutes. Those are all laudable objectives. The expert group also got it absolutely right in saying that, although the responsibility for drawing up a framework for achieving those objectives should lie with the Parliament, the implementation should be left to the local authorities through a local implementation plan, which would be subject to scrutiny by the Executive minister with responsibility, and so on.</p><p>We are not talking in a vacuum; this is not theory. We are talking about Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow&#8212;not even about Dundee, as there are so few women working as prostitutes in Dundee that we do not need a big policy there. The Dundee authorities say, \"It ain't broke, so we're not going to fix it at the moment.\" They manage prostitution in their area and, although they had a problem with it a year or so ago, they have managed it. However, the City of Edinburgh Council has responded to Hugh Henry by saying that it welcomes the expert group's report, supports the comments of the officers groups and supports the proposed legislative changes, particularly the creation of a new offence that would penalise the purchaser of sexual services. The council executive also notes that the new offence is a replacement for soliciting and that it could help to manage the problem of street prostitution in more effective ways.</p><p>The City of Edinburgh Council also welcomes the recommendation of the establishment of a national strategic framework as well as the proposals for local authorities to formulate local plans. That is important. The pattern of prostitution is different in all the cities that I have mentioned, and the local people know best how to cope with it. That does not preclude delivery of the services that might be recommended under the national strategic plan&#8212;services for counselling, health <place-holder colnum=\"15852\"/> support, and so on&#8212;being delivered via a local agency, such as there is in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Therefore, there might still be a red-light area in which it is known that prostitution will be encountered; however, it will be much better managed.</p><p>I commend to Parliament the recommendations of the expert group and I sincerely ask the minister to put those recommendations into effect as quickly as possible. If the Executive is prepared to introduce a bill, I will willingly withdraw my bill.

Indeed, I got my colours in three different sports&#8212;although I cannot remember now what they were.</p><p>Robert Brown is right to say that sportspeople can be role models. For example, I am absolutely certain that I would not be standing here today or have stayed on the straight path had it not been for Eleanor Gordon, who won a bronze medal for swimming at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. Although I was a very wee girl at the time, I was a member of the same swimming club and have admired what she did all my life. I was a swimmer when I was young and, as swimming has kept me going through physical difficulties in my later life, I most certainly advocate sport for all and activity at a level that suits everyone.</p><p>I must take issue with Mark Ballard. It is not true to say that general activity is just as good as organised sport; they are two different concepts and the same people can take part in a wide range of physical activities. Nonetheless, I will address myself to the motion and not give him a lecture on <place-holder colnum=\"15339\"/> that now, although I am an old PE teacher.</p><p>I have great sympathy with what Robert Brown intends and congratulate him on securing the debate, but I take issue with some of the details of his proposal, just as Mark Ballard did. The motion puts the cart before the horse. Elsewhere, Robert Brown has referred to the fact that the number of PE teachers in Scotland will be increased by 400. I sincerely hope that that will happen, but if he can show me where those teachers are being trained right now I will be a bit more hopeful that his plan could be put into effect before today's schoolchildren are the age that I am now and are looking back fondly on the 2004 Olympics. The Executive has recognised that extra PE teachers are needed, but PE must become central to the curriculum; it must not be a fringe or a frill. The Executive will not achieve its desired levels of health improvement without PE&#8212;encompassing health education&#8212;being at the core of the timetable and infused throughout the school curriculum. Without that happening, the Executive will simply not hit its health targets.</p><p>We cannot glibly say that we will have mini-Olympics because we will have 400 more PE teachers, as we do not know for certain that we will have extra PE teachers. Robert Brown suggested bringing retired PE teachers out of retirement to coach. I advocated that for some time until a lot of them got in touch with me and said, \"Right, you can do it, china.\" PE teachers have often&#8212;certainly in the past 10 years&#8212;been glad to retire because of discipline problems in school, so we cannot glibly accept that bringing them out of retirement is a good idea. It is a good idea, but a lot of work would have to go into working out how it could come about.</p><p>The mini-Olympics would depend on competition, as Mark Ballard pointed out. Competition in schools is patchy, because there is still a generation of teachers who think that competition is bad for the pupils. I happen not to share that belief. Part of school education should be about learning to win and lose with equal grace, but that idea has not been fashionable until very recently. We need a programme to change attitudes among classroom teachers and enable them to learn how to coach and train PE.</p><p>The mini-Olympics proposal could reinvent the wheel. We could use existing local authority structures and have the old type of county sports competition, for example. That is the way that I would start, because a mini-Olympics would create the wrong idea.

On the diminution of poverty, which was the last point to which I referred, we concede that there might be a difference of opinion, but even then that difference would not be about the strategic objective, as everybody wants to diminish poverty as quickly as possible. Any differences of opinion would concern the detailed policies for achieving that shared objective.</p><p>Although Stewart Stevenson's contribution was excellent and extremely well informed and researched, this is not really the debate to concentrate on the details of future operational policy. We cannot today pass on to the G8, the EU, the World Bank, the IMF or the Westminster Government&#8212;which has an active role in the G8&#8212;the considered suggestions or recommendations of the Scottish Parliament on how, for example, international aid should be directed at, and received by, appropriate individuals and organisations in countries in receipt of aid. However, we can agree to stress to all those bodies our unanimous belief that a much-improved monitoring system must accompany all aid packages and that the system&#8212;like the aid-and-trade packages&#8212;must reflect the differing realities of institutional development, for example, in the different countries that receive aid. That point was, I think, referred to by Phil Gallie. Regrettably, however, no single motion or <place-holder colnum=\"13477\"/> amendment emerged that met the criteria that I have outlined. Dennis Canavan's amendment seeks to fulfil the functions of such a motion, as we have tried to draw in the essential elements of the Scottish National Party, Executive and Green expressions of opinion in the <em>Business Bulletin</em>.</p><p>Leaving the mechanics aside, however, I wish to concentrate on the issue of recovery in those Asian countries that were affected by the recent consequences of an earthquake and the poverty that stalks millions of our fellow human beings. The devastation in Asia is primarily a human catastrophe. We have heard of the effects of the tsunami on local economies, but little attention has been paid to the overarching economic consequences. For example, while we were sitting stunned in our living rooms as we saw people swept to their deaths in their thousands, the stock markets of Asia did not sink and the international insurance industry did not cry about its potential losses&#8212;it did not blink.</p><p>The insurance industry reckons that its bill will be far lower than that for the hurricanes in Florida in 2004. The infrastructure outside the coastal areas of those of the affected countries that have a large land mass was not damaged, while most of the people killed were poor and had no insurance, either personal or for their small boats and other businesses. Those areas have been devastated not only by loss of life but by loss of economic structures. Coastal farming is badly affected by the incursion of seawater into what was previously a freshwater irrigation system, so it is essential that any aid is directed at the reconstitution of the economies of the poor in the coastal regions. Enough money may well have been committed, along with debt suspension, to achieve that, provided that the money boasted of by the rich countries is actually paid over.</p><p>I regret that I will have to curtail my words of wisdom because I took an intervention earlier. However, the motion and the amendments refer to the linkage of aid, debt and fair trade, the indivisibility of which cannot be overemphasised. Unfortunately, I have not had time to dwell on the latter two elements of that equation. In the interests of justice and the most effective management of the globe's resources, those elements must be resolved. One factor must be borne in mind: there is no common blueprint that can be applied to every country whose people are suffering the ravages of poverty and the lack of the most basic resources.</p><p>Our amendment, in Dennis Canavan's name, encapsulates the best common elements of the different expressions of opinion on matters affecting international aid.

The issue is that, because we have many older people, who have more complex conditions, beds are used for longer periods of time, which means that we need more beds. That factor was not taken into account in the calculations that were used when the RIE was planned as a seamless whole of services and equipment. I mention the point in the hope that the minister might reflect on it. The need for more beds must be seen in conjunction with the revolving-door syndrome that sees approximately 5 per cent of patients taking up 20 per cent of bed space. Those are the patients who are either chronically sick or who have a number of things wrong with them.</p><p>The introduction of PFI and the way in which resources are allocated in the system together with the recurring feature of the same people requiring more complex care&#8212;albeit that it is more sophisticated treatment&#8212;contributes to the shortage of beds. I hope that when the Executive plans new hospital buildings in future, it does not look simply at the raw data. It should do things differently and not rely on data that seem to show that more effective surgical procedures mean the need for fewer hospital beds.</p><p>General practitioners have told me that when a patient is referred to a particular consultant for, say, a cardiac consultation and the consultant says that the patient is okay, they go out of the system at that point. Instead of that happening, they should be seen by other consultants in other disciplines so that time is not lost and patients do not become more frustrated. The minister could look at the referral system, which needs to be made more sensible. At the moment, staff time is used inefficiently and patients become frustrated because of the long waits between referrals. I am happy to see that the minister is nodding.</p><p>With the objective in mind that if we treat the whole person, not only can all of their ailments be taken into account but a more efficient and effective use can be made of resources, I suggest that the minister looks at the multidisciplinary centre that I discussed with him in our meeting earlier this week. I thank the minister for that meeting, as it was most productive. We discussed <place-holder colnum=\"12929\"/> the case of a patient who has post-polio syndrome. The best way in which to treat that person would be in a multidisciplinary clinic that was specially geared to the needs of such patients. Indeed, a number of different conditions would be best served by that treatment approach.</p><p>Before I conclude, I wonder whether I might be able to answer some of the questions that were posed earlier in the debate. A member on the Labour benches posed the question why the SNP are such ideologues that they object to the use of private medicine. I would have thought that the SNP health spokesperson&#8212;her louche language aside&#8212;might have explained that the SNP has no objection to taxation, if it can be used to further enhance the health service. We will be using health service money to pay into private practice. If patients were given a choice on the subject, the minister might find that taxation for health is not all that unpopular. I see that he is shaking his head at the suggestion&#8212;indeed, I understand why&#8212;but he should reflect on it.</p><p>The Executive document's intentions are excellent.

A holiday on St Andrew's day might well do that for Scotland.

Moreover, does the French economy get extremely ill and the franc have to be rescued on 15 July? We know perfectly well that countries all over the world use their national days to accommodate their nationhood and market their economies. Dennis Canavan's motion gives us the opportunity to start doing that.</p><p>I find it disgraceful that such a far-sighted and well-travelled man as Ted Brocklebank should think that having a national day will have a detrimental effect on Scottish business and the Scottish economy. He should think about the cottage industries that would be built on such a <place-holder colnum=\"12466\"/> day. For example, there would have to be loads of flags for flying or for adorning underpants and other items of clothing. Shop assistants would spend at least a month selling all the artefacts that are now associated with more commercial occasions.

People should be encouraged to go outwards from Scotland, learn from the rest of the world and bring their knowledge back to Scotland to make it a better place. Children should know Scotland, their roots, their future and their potential, in the way that American children learn through taking part in thanksgiving day pageants.

It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament recognises the significant progress made since devolution in increasing participation in sport.\"</p><p>I am sure that the minister has access to the same figures as me, which show that since 1999 there has been a 2 per cent decrease in participation in sport. I do not blame the minister for that, but it would be better to acknowledge reality before we judge whether the policies that have been outlined are meeting the challenges.</p><p>Almost every member this morning has referred to the lack of resources, therefore our amendment <place-holder colnum=\"10531\"/> is relevant, because we propose ways in which resources can be channelled into community sport and elite sport, but particularly into community sport.</p><p>Let us start with local authorities. I return to a familiar theme that members have heard me expound before. Having more physical education teachers in schools is a necessity. While I appreciate that the motion refers to that and that there is a target for more PE teachers to be in place by 2007, I am interested in how that will be achieved. The University of Edinburgh is the only place that trains PE teachers. I know that there is a postgraduate course at the University of Strathclyde, but I will not refer to that at the moment, as I am talking about people who are at school and who want to be PE teachers, who will likely go to Edinburgh in the first instance. The numbers in training at the University of Edinburgh are going to be down&#8212;not by much, but they will still be down&#8212;from 101 or 102 to 99, so the trend does not favour the Executive's good intentions. There is no way round the issue: education authorities must have the resources to employ more teachers.</p><p>Balerno High School has an inspirational head of PE called Jennifer Grassick. The community development of sporting activity in that area has come from the school and is feeding into local sporting clubs. Not only has the school taken responsibility for its pupils, but it is helping them to learn about organising sporting clubs. Whether she has twisted the arms of her fellow teachers or inspired them, Jennifer Grassick has persuaded them to help her to coach sports. Someone referred to the fact that teachers no longer do that on a voluntary basis. I believe that if teachers in the independent sector take sports, they get a 5 or 10 per cent addition to their salaries. I am not proposing that, but I am suggesting that without inspirational PE teachers such as Jennifer Grassick, other teachers will not be roped in.</p><p>Members have referred to the Government target of having two hours of PE a week, but that is not enough. If we seriously want people to think about sporting activity and exercise as part of their lives and as being as essential as taking in food, they have to participate in it every day. Some form of physical exercise has to be built into the school curriculum. My colleague Dennis Canavan referred to the McCrone settlement, which suggested replacing principal PE teachers with faculty heads. That is a backward step that is at variance with the Government's intentions. Could we examine that again?</p><p>The other aspect of having PE teachers in schools is that they carry sport into the community. We have to sort out how sportscotland can help. Until now, sportscotland has prioritised directing <place-holder colnum=\"10532\"/> cash into sports clubs and communities, but I have queried that on more than one occasion, and I was interested to hear one or two members query it as well. Margaret Jamieson aptly mentioned a martial arts club that encourages kids in her area to take part and become active, but which is denied the funding that it needs for expansion and promotion because it does not meet the priorities of sportscotland. There has been much discussion of that in the cross-party group on sport, and I pray that it will continue.</p><p>We must be careful that we do not appear to be narrow nationalists or, on the other hand, super internationalists, saying, \"It's okay, we totally support the London Olympic bid.\" Look at what that will do to funding for the community development of sport. I, too, would like the Olympics to be held in London, but not at the expense of money that should be spent on encouraging mass participation in community sports. The priority should be to get more people into sports, which would give a bigger skills pool and so greater success at elite level.</p><p>While we are talking about elite athletes, I must say that I was not joking when I suggested that Colin Montgomerie should be invited to join us for the Parliament building opening ceremony. He has done more to boost Scottish self-confidence than anyone has recently. We need to get all the role models who have won medals, whether in the Olympics or the paralympics, into schools. After a Scot, Steven Frew, won the rings competition in gymnastics in the Commonwealth games in Manchester, I asked him whether he would be willing to visit Scottish schools. He said, \"Of course. I already visit schools in London,\" but somehow we could not get organised to get him or other medal winners at the Commonwealth games into schools. For goodness' sake, we need to ensure that we get successful Olympians, including disabled Olympians, into schools now, because they are the sort of role models that we need.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13323548", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sporting Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion is full of warm words and great intentions, so I will certainly vote for it&#8212;I am part of the independent group so I cannot speak for everybody else&#8212;but I take issue with it all the same.

The team set standards of productivity and commitment to the job that should serve as a benchmark for any such future inquiries.</p><p>Fortunately, the Fraser inquiry will probably be unique. We are most unlikely to build another Parliament building, but should any successor Parliament require to do so, the results of Fraser and our deliberations here today should provide our successors with a template of what not to do, as well as make some positive suggestions.</p><p>Following the evidence that was given to the inquiry, it is now irrefutable that the Holyrood project got off to what proved to be a disastrous start when Donald Dewar made fundamental decisions about when to start and where to site our new Parliament. I do not believe that he did so for vainglorious reasons&#8212;if he was guilty of anything, it was of paternalism, as suggested by Sam Galbraith's evidence to the inquiry. The late First Minister would probably have escaped all criticism had he left the matter to the elected members of Parliament. That he misjudged the best way to proceed should be admitted; his reputation is big enough to withstand the charge <place-holder colnum=\"10405\"/> that&#8212;perhaps for admirable motives&#8212;he made the wrong decision.</p><p>It should also be noted that his was not the only misjudgment. As John Campbell's questioning made clear, civil servants Muir Russell, Robert Gordon, John Gibbons, Barbara Doig and Paul Grice made mistakes of omission and commission. Evidence to the inquiry also exposes the gaps in communication, project planning and management among contractors and consultants during the lifetime of the project.</p><p>It is quite wrong to believe that the only important mistakes were made by Donald Dewar. A sizeable group of people had some responsibility for building this Parliament and, unfortunately, amateurism and lack of managerial rigour characterise much of the decision making. For example, following the death of Enric Miralles, mistakes were made by the politicians who were supposedly in charge of the project on our behalf. David Steel failed to examine the terms of the design contract after the chief architect died and when I wrote to him to suggest that he do so, he discussed my request with the big brains of the Holyrood progress group and then wrote to tell me that I was an insensitive harpy and that they were not going to answer any of the questions that I had put to them about how they had handled the loss of the chief designer before the completion of stage D in the planning process. As members will recall, Parliament was assured that stage D had been reached but, as the Fraser inquiry uncovered, it had not.</p><p>Instead of&#8212;even without going into detail that might have upset the Miralles family, which I can appreciate&#8212;admitting that Senor Miralles' death had consequences for the project, the project team's spin doctors, together with David Steel, the HPG and some MSPs spun the line that Senor Miralles would have been taking a back seat by that time anyway. We are talking about the chief designer taking a back seat before we reached stage D.</p><p>Who told MSPs that, and what was the process that resulted in Parliament's being misinformed about the possibilities that were open to it after Enric Miralles died? At that stage, the constrictions of the site and the difficulties of incorporating Queensberry House were inescapable, yet there was still time to walk away without losing money. Indeed, it is now acknowledged by independent assessors that a modest profit might have accrued to Parliament. Apart from the first floor of the MSP office block, nothing had been built above ground; let us not forget that.</p><p>However, as old embers are being raked over and the building is now a reality, it is tempting for us to say what the SPCB's motion urges, which is: \"Well, we're here now, so let's forget what might <place-holder colnum=\"10406\"/> have been\". The purpose of my amendment is not to dwell on the past; rather, it is to learn from the short history of the decision-making processes that have damaged Parliament's standing, so that the long-term future might be characterised by better governance arising from improvements to the ways in which politicians, civil servants, parliamentary officials and other public servants, such as the Auditor General, discharge their duties.</p><p>For example, do we need to revisit the guidelines and practices that govern how, and how much, information is imparted to ministers by civil servants such as the former project sponsor, parliamentary officials and public appointees such as the Auditor General? As a Parliament, do we think that it is right for a doubtless dedicated&#8212;but nonetheless generalist&#8212;middle-ranking civil servant to edit out specific advice that was obtained from an expert consultant on the finances of an Administration or Parliament project, thus depriving ministers of information that they needed to make valued judgments, the consequence of which was that they misled Parliament? Might we establish a general principle about when expert advice might be taken before ministers or committees reach conclusions, and about how adequate in meeting Parliament's transparency and accountability criteria is our present rule of thumb that governs which expert advice passes into the public domain?</p><p>There is general agreement in the chamber about the need to learn from experience in order that we can enhance the good governance of Scotland and enhance how we go about our business in the chamber. If colleagues will bear with me for a moment, I will try to put some flesh on the bare bones of that statement of good intentions.</p><p>My example is drawn from the Auditor General's first report to the Audit Committee. To help compile his report, which was published in September 2000, he commissioned an expert report from international project and cost management consultants Gardiner &amp; Theobald. Their report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It appears the over-riding influence of one Scottish Office member based on the comfort factor of a previous working relationship ... has over ridden the attempt, albeit flawed, to procure the best construction management candidate for the project\".</p><p>The Gardiner &amp; Theobald report adds that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The failure of Scottish Office personnel to adhere in any way to standard procedures, treasury guidance or EU provisions raises questions on procedure.\"</p><p>The Auditor General appears to have ignored those conclusions in his report to MSPs. I asked him to publish them, but he refused and told me:<place-holder colnum=\"10407\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will publish only material that reflects our considered conclusions on any matter.\"</p><p>MSPs might feel that such filtering of information deprives them of the ability to exercise the judgment that they were elected to exercise on behalf of the people who pay our wages and in whose name we serve.</p><p>To expand the point, Gardiner &amp; Theobald, consultants who were contracted for their specialist expertise by the generalist Auditor General, reported to him:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are advantages through the proper use of a risk management process, unfortunately a full risk management has not been completed ... this is a serious and fundamental omission which must have contributed to the cost escalation.\"</p><p>However, the distillation of that expert opinion as reported by the Auditor General to MSPs was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In some areas project management processes such as risk analysis and cost reporting did not fully match established good practice for major contracts.\"</p><p>Gardiner &amp; Theobald also report that unsuccessful candidates for the construction management contract might have a legal case against the Scottish Executive. However, the Auditor General's report stated to the Audit Committee of Parliament, which was taking important decisions based on the Auditor General's report, that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In general terms the appointment of consultants was properly undertaken.\"</p><p>When we consider how to prevent the withholding of information from politicians by civil servants, we must also consider whether the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 is effective in relation to the Auditor General's objectivity and transparency.</p><p>Politicians also screened out information that should have been available to MSPs; the SPCB even produced two sets of minutes of its decisions on Holyrood. David Steel was as guilty as the Auditor General of filtering out information about the project&#8212;just as officials were and as the progress group was. It has yet to explain to MSPs why Alan Ezzi was shown the door after only seven months as project manager.</p><p>I have referred to changes that might be required to the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000, but such a committee as I propose in my amendment might also conclude that the Scotland Act 1998 requires amendment to allow the corporate body legally to delegate powers so that future groups&#8212;like the Holyrood progress group&#8212;can be properly held to account by Parliament. A committee such as I propose might also conclude that our standing orders assist that process of information filtration and that they require some amendment.<place-holder colnum=\"10408\"/></p><p>My amendment seeks to maximise the good that might yet come from a bad job: I urge MSPs to support it.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-1727.2, to leave out from \"invites\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"calls on the political parties and groups represented on the Parliamentary Bureau to nominate one person from each of their respective political parties or groups, other than those members who served on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body or were members of the Scottish Executive at the time covered by the report, to form a special committee of the Parliament to consider the report and make recommendations as to the future conduct of the civil service, the Corporate Body, the Chief Executive of the Parliament and the Executive in discharging their public duties.\"</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13323377", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holyrood Inquiry Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although it is true, allowing for the poetic licence that is accorded to newspaper headline writers, that \"a big civil servant did it and ran away\", this debate on Lord Fraser's report should ensure that although the civil servants, politicians and contractors who are responsible for bringing Parliament into disrepute can run, they cannot hide.

I would like to associate myself with Elaine Smith's peroration, in particular what she said about few of the words in today's motion and amendments providing a satisfactory solution to the problem. I will come back to that later.</p><p>The mess that is British policy on Iraq and the wider middle east was predictable. Before the war, al-Qa'ida was a small organisation that was based mainly in the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Now, it is estimated to number about 18,000 people and its offshoots are to be found in countries as widespread as Indonesia, Australia, the United Kingdom, Tunisia, Morocco, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. That probably answers the only weak point in Michael McMahon's otherwise admirable speech. When we consider the list of countries that now harbour al-Qa'ida members, there can be no justification for our going into one country with whose regime we disagreed.</p><p>Bush and Blair lied&#8212;they lied about weapons of mass destruction and Blair either lied or showed incredible incompetence in claiming not to know that the rocket-delivery system that was supposed to threaten us here in Europe was, in fact, a battlefield weapon system and not an intercontinental one. That fact alone means that our credibility has been gravely damaged in the middle east.</p><p>The political incompetence of Bush and Blair is staggering. They support a double standard in international law, and the actions of the Americans in their treatment of prisoners and their methods of policing Iraq&#8212;with tanks and random fire killing thousands of Iraqis&#8212;border on the insane. While the Arab world watches on Aljazeera television as Americans shoot up a wedding party, it also sees Israeli bulldozers smash the houses and farms of <place-holder colnum=\"8780\"/> Palestinians. While the Iraqis pay the price of occupation, Israel is rewarded&#8212;with American backing and weasel words from Tony Blair&#8212;for its brutal occupation of Arab land. If Bush and Blair had set out deliberately to stimulate al-Qa'ida, they could not have done it better than by using the policies that they have pursued. They have stoked fires of hatred that will take generations to cool even if, as we all must hope, the United Nations provides an alternative security force to the US and British forces that are in Iraq now.</p><p>I want now to turn to the motion and the amendments, which Elaine Smith said were unsatisfactory. I agree with her. First of all, it is right that the SNP motion has been debated. I will be frank: in this context, I do not care whether there is a European election or not, and neither do other Scots&#8212;especially the 75 per cent of those who answered the BBC poll that was published today. Those people expressed their disapproval of what is being done in their name. The SNP motion is superficial in its analysis and in its remedy. As we have already heard, blithely to suggest a Muslim-only armed force is infantile.</p><p>The Tories' amendment is out of touch with Scottish opinion. I do not think that Phil Gallie speaks for Scotland when he appears to support ever more engagement in Iraq. However, I believe that the Tories could and should vote according to what they believe and according to their conscience. They were bounced into supporting Blair in his adventure because Iain Duncan Smith made a poor decision, which I glimpsed in some of Phil Gallie's remarks. If his decision was wrong then, it is wrong now.</p><p>I do not think that the Tories should give any succour to the Labour Party's amendment, which says all the right things, except that the policy that it advocates is more of the same. That policy has failed to enthuse the other countries in the region, on whom the amendment says Iraq's security depends. None of the countries that border Iraq supports the policy. I think that there is also a small mistake in the Labour Party's amendment&#8212;it says that the UN should take \"a leading role\"; it does not say \"the leading role\". I wonder whether that is a mistake. Perhaps we will find out during the winding-up speeches.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats' amendment is consistent, but it fails to make a link to the Israeli Government's outrageous treatment of the Palestinians. That link cannot be ignored. In that respect, the SSP's amendment is superior but&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;it also calls for withdrawal \"immediately\" of British troops. If that is meant literally, I think that it would be impossible to achieve. If it means that it should be done as soon as possible, I might find it possible to vote for the <place-holder colnum=\"8781\"/> SSP amendment. Perhaps we can have clarification on that, as well.</p><p>One thing that I refuse to do is to endorse the Labour amendment and have this Parliament cravenly and obscenely vote for something that most of us do not believe in.</p>", "hdate": "2004-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13319101", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Situation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have just heard one of the best speeches so far in this Parliament.

He is absolutely right, and particularly so at this time. Only with a minister who is focused on Europe&#8212;its benefits, challenges, opportunities and whatever&#8212;will we get through the period leading up to the referendum on the constitution. I heartily applaud his suggestion that there should be a Scottish minister with responsibility for Europe.</p><p>I said earlier that there were four good reasons for backing my amendment, and it seems that nobody has said that there is a good reason for not backing it. I have listened carefully to all the speeches, but nobody has mentioned it&#8212;maybe it is not worth mentioning.</p><p>I finished my opening speech by saying that the motion appears to make assumptions that disregard any linkage between the disquiet across Europe about the proposed constitution's centralising tendency and the transfer of sovereign powers from national Parliaments. Some members addressed that point, but the motion does not and that is what is on the record. Even if we consider public reaction only in this country, France and Italy to the question of border security and immigration policies being decided by a Commission and Council of Ministers that will incorporate the 10 new members, it is not hard to imagine how that particular effect of enlargement <place-holder colnum=\"7566\"/> will influence how people vote in the referendum on the EU constitution. There is a definite linkage in that policy area. Now that we know that there is to be a referendum on the EU constitution, the motion is inadequate.</p><p>That brings me to the third reason for using my amendment to try to make the best of a bad job, which is the impossibility of absorbing the 10 new EU countries effortlessly into the euro zone. The single currency and enlargement are indivisible from the powers that the planned EU constitution would transfer to Brussels. Some members hinted at that during the debate. Let us suppose that the euro does not strengthen against the pound after enlargement&#8212;which seems likely. What implication would that have for regional funds in Scotland? Further, what if Prime Minister Brown continues to prefer the Bank of England's management of interest rates to that of the European Central Bank? Is there no linkage, therefore, between enlargement, EU regional policy, the economic performance of countries in the euro zone and a new EU constitution?</p><p>The fourth reason against passing the motion unamended is its inadequacy. It fails to address the consequences of enlargement and to relate those to the realpolitik of the UK referendum on the EU constitution or the effect of enlargement on the euro and the consequent potential effects on the Scottish economy. The amendment would at least provide the Executive with the opportunity to produce information that would better inform Scots of the issues surrounding enlargement and the questions that must now be addressed on its effect on the referendum on the EU constitution, the euro and perhaps even the EU itself, as was reported on \"Newsnight\" last night.</p><p>I have a few seconds left in which to address other remarks that were made during the debate. I was glad to hear Mike Pringle and Gordon Jackson introducing a note of common sense into the analysis of how others see us. People from other countries do not say, \"You are wonderful, Scotland. We want to do business with you immediately.\" They say, \"Scotland&#8212;is that the same as England?\" When it is pointed out that we are not the same as England and that we are the ones who make the whisky, they say, \"Ah! We like the whisky.\" We have a huge job of work to do in that area and I hope that the minister takes that on board. I know that the Executive is trying, but it should not underestimate the size of the job that it must do.</p><p>I, too, was in Poland just after that country freed itself from the Soviet yoke. At that time, only five companies were listed on the Polish stock exchange. I know how far Poland has travelled since then and I know how far it still must travel in order to regard Scotland as a partner. Poland <place-holder colnum=\"7567\"/> must go for the big stakes and that is not Scotland. We should not get our own importance in the new Europe out of proportion.</p><p>It was stated during the debate that we had very successful trade missions. However, how do we measure their success? Do we assess the number of companies that agree to go abroad and set up in partnerships or joint ventures? How do we evaluate trade missions? What is their priority and strategic thrust?</p><p>We discussed briefly in the debate the potential tyranny of the small states. Ireland was mentioned in that respect. However, that notion is absolute rubbish. Chirac and Fischler will have much more clout than will Barosso from Portugal, the Irish Prime Minister or any of the other small states. The big states will rule and that is what the EU constitution is about. That is why Parliament must consider enlargement and its effect on what the constitution will do.</p><p>I am sorry that I cannot go on, but I thank you for bearing with me, Presiding Officer.

There are at least four substantive reasons why his anodyne motion should be amended.</p><p>First, a motion should encapsulate a proposal that is either accepted or rejected by Parliament, but it should also be understandable by the people in whose interests it is debated. The motion asserts that enlargement of the EU</p><p class=\"indent\">\"provides both challenges and opportunities to Scotland\"&#8212;</p><p>the preposition is the motion's, not mine&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"7546\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"and encourages the Scottish Executive to promote actively the benefits of enlargement across Scotland.\"</p><p>I think that the latter reference is to a vigorous information campaign that would promote only the benefits of enlargement.</p><p>However, if enlargement presents challenges that we could fail to meet, enlargement could presumably result in Scotland experiencing disbenefit. The motion implies that that possible outcome should either be ignored or covered up by the Executive. Should not Scots be informed about the possible pitfalls of enlargement, so that defences can be planned and put in place now by Scottish Enterprise, local authorities and the private sector to combat the migration of jobs from Scotland to new member states that have lower-waged but skilled work forces? The accession countries may have lower GDPs than Scotland has, but some of them have pretty skilled work forces.</p><p>Before coming to the opportunities that are presented by enlargement, let us probe the possibility that enlargement will pose a threat to what is left of Scottish manufacturing industry. That such a calamity might befall Scotland does not come simply from the feverish fears of Eurosceptics&#8212;although I am sure that we have none of them in this Parliament. Volvo has already left Irvine for Poland. Polestar printing company considered going to Hungary as well as to the north of England. No doubt members will be aware of similar movements and discussions among manufacturing and service industries in their areas.</p><p>We are not the only peripheral maritime region to be at some economic risk from EU enlargement. Last week in Portugal, my friends were telling me about the companies that had transferred their operations to the new EU area that was formerly part of the Soviet bloc. The same fears are being voiced in Ireland, Spain and Greece.</p><p>Without a report from the European and External Relations Committee on the predicted consequences for Scotland of EU enlargement, the motion amounts to mere rhetoric. We should consider the conclusions that can be drawn from the pattern of employment migration that is emerging in Scotland and elsewhere. The amendment provides the opportunity for a serious analysis to be done on the effects of enlargement on employment.</p><p>If the EU fans who produced the motion are correct in their guess that the benefits of enlargement will outweigh the pitfalls, my amendment would provide the Executive with an opportunity to identify which sectors of our manufacturing and service industries are best <place-holder colnum=\"7547\"/> placed to expand into the 10 new markets. When Richard Lochhead spoke to the motion, he referred to business in general, but he did not specify which manufacturing and services sectors would benefit. If the Executive were to undertake the analysis that I propose, it might be able to assist the companies that are best placed to take advantage of enlargement&#8212;provided, of course, that the EU rules would allow that. I am not sure that they would, but the issue is worth thinking about.</p><p>My amendment refers to the social as well as the economic consequences of enlargement. The motion does not indicate whether enlargement enables or impedes the Executive's strategy of growing Scotland's population, which the First Minister has described as essential. Has the European and External Relations Committee considered the possibility that the sort of skilled young people whom the Executive would like to attract to Scotland will prefer to stay in their countries, to which jobs are migrating from Scotland and elsewhere?</p><p>Richard Lochhead mentioned that the groundless fears of being overrun by Romanians and so on are proving just that&#8212;such people need only stay where they are, as industry will move to them. Has the committee considered the morality and the consequences for new EU members of causing an exodus of trained, poorly paid, medically qualified workers from countries where they are needed even more than they are needed here? At the moment, health appears to be the only sector in which we are confident that people will be attracted to Scotland, because there are plenty of jobs over here for them to do and they will receive higher wages than they receive in their own countries. Should not Scots be given the opportunity to state their opinions on such a development? What do we bring to the new Europe if we ignore the effect of our comparative wealth on even poorer countries? Under the United Kingdom constitution, we cannot as a nation determine or act on decisions that are reached in such matters, even though the Parliament is supposed to determine policy and priorities for health and economic development in Scotland.</p><p>That brings me to the second reason for amending the motion: the proposed new EU constitution. How can we assume benefits for Scotland from enlargement separately from the proposed new structures and powers that are planned for the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, which will result in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania having more direct power over EU energy or fishing policy than Scotland has? Enlargement will impact on the referendum on the EU constitution, but this mouse of a motion makes assumptions that appear to <place-holder colnum=\"7548\"/> disregard any linkage between the disquiet that is felt across Europe about the proposed constitution's centralising tendency and the transfer of sovereign powers from national Parliaments.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13316206", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Union (Enlargement)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The intention behind my amendment is not merely to remove some shockingly poor syntax from the motion that Richard Lochhead presumably either wrote or approved.

They find that money helps a great deal, because it allows them to seek out the best possible coaching and residential courses.</p><p>Money is important. We should think about that if money is going to be taken from sports in Scotland that, in line with Executive policy, are trying to increase their rates of participation and to improve performance. The bedrock is to get more people participating and money is required to do that. Young athletes, who are often from deprived areas, frequently need help to buy the kit. Do members know how much it costs to buy ice hockey kit&#8212;for those who happen to live around Ayr or Kirkcaldy? It is a lot of money. The clubs need money if young people are going to take part. By denying them it, we are selling Scottish sportspeople short.</p><p>We also need coaches. It is not enough just to pay for the kit so that the kid can go and play ice hockey or whatever other sport; they have to be <place-holder colnum=\"7294\"/> properly coached. Coaches, who are not usually from the most salubrious backgrounds, have to be sent to training camps.</p><p>It all takes money, which is why the community sports clubs need it. I understand that sportscotland is concerned because it expects funding of only &#163;18 million next year compared with &#163;32.5 million in 1998, which was before the necessity was recognised of getting people to have an active lifestyle and of getting more people teaching physical education in schools&#8212;Jamie McGrigor is quite right about that. However, believe it or not, even that has an impact on the amount of money that sportscotland has at its disposal. We have to utilise properly a higher number of PE teachers, who can be used in the community to coach and stimulate interest in sports, because that is much more likely to get people participating in sport than are television pictures of an international-class athlete. It does not matter whether those pictures are being beamed from London or Rio de Janeiro. If the kids are going to be motivated by world-class athletes, it will not matter what the colour of their skin is or where they are performing their athletic skills.

We cannot do anything about getting fair pensions because we do not have that power, but I suspect that we will hear less about our lack of power in that respect than we heard yesterday about our shameful lack of power as regards the three men who are dying in Glasgow.</p><p>In exercising Parliament's power as a lobbyist, we have to persuade Gordon Brown that he is taking the wrong tack. I say that regretfully because I accept much of what the minister said about the improvements to the lives of perhaps 50 per cent of UK pensioners since the Government changed. However, that is not enough&#8212;what about the other 50 per cent? Let us not forget the figures that John Swinburne produced&#8212;50 per <place-holder colnum=\"6523\"/> cent of pensioners' income is below the level that we consider to be reasonable and acceptable in this day and age, and 25 per cent live in real poverty.</p><p>The minister cannot defend the current system: she can defend what the devolved Scottish Executive has tried to do to ameliorate the shortcomings of the present system, but it is not enough. Until the Scottish Parliament exercises sovereignty over a combined tax and monetary policy, we will not get things right. We must harmonise our tax system with our benefits and if we do not, we will only ever be putting a sticking plaster over the wounds that John Swinburne's speech exposed.</p><p>We should accept that pension levels are not an argument in favour of fiscal and monetary union with England. As well as lobbying for the pensioners who are suffering today&#8212;in particular the 25 per cent of them who concern Mary Mulligan as much as they concern me&#8212;we should also be looking wider, longer and broader. We should look to see how we can harmonise our tax system with our benefits system.</p><p>I commend to the minister the Pensions Policy Institute report that was published only yesterday. It draws on experience from New Zealand, where there is no attempt to target, or to differentiate between, pensioners. Every pensioner in New Zealand, depending simply on their age, is paid the set, basic state pension. It is obvious that some people make private arrangements and will therefore have an income that might comprise the state pension plus their private pension, on which they will be taxed. Therefore, rich pensioners pay more and poor pensioners who either do not have private savings or who have much smaller private savings pay less in tax. That seems to be a much more equitable system. I say with all due respect that if the Tories were able to forget the idea of trying to induce people to save, they could adopt the New Zealand policy, too. It would be much simpler to administer and would not involve the 39 pages of form filling that is currently required if people want to claim their entitlements.</p><p>What can we do to improve the quality of Scottish pensioners' lives? We know that we cannot do much about their basic pension at the moment. We have tried and I commend the Executive for that, but we could do more. To do more, we must ensure that local authorities are given more money than they have at present to operate, for example, free exercise schemes. Now that I have won my campaign to get physical education teachers into schools, I warn the minister that I am going for the golden oldies. I want proper exercise facilities and regimes in place at local level&#8212;depending on local facilities&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"6524\"/> and I want them to be funded and free for pensioners.</p><p>Television is an absolute requirement for providing information and advice in today's world. When one gets to be over 75&#8212;a lot older than I am, anyway&#8212;one can have a free television licence. For goodness' sake, why cannot people get a free television licence when they stop working? I do not see why there should not be free licences for those who are not working because that aspect should also be brought to bear on the judgment.</p><p>The Government's policy of targeting the poorest people is not working. If it were, we would not be having the debate today. The Executive has to be much more universal in its approach to benefits and it must use the time-honoured system of clawing back through the taxation system from people who can afford to pay their way. All sorts of notional payments can be levied from local and national services, but I will not go into that now. I would like to bang the drum for local authorities to be given much more freedom to ensure that older people make full use of existing services. I assure the minister that, if she went right now to the Edinburgh royal Commonwealth pool&#8212;where I should be instead of here&#8212;she would meet many ladies of my age, all of whom exercise two or three times a week in the pool. The pool is open to swimmers anyway, so it would not lose out on the paltry sum that we pay because we are not paying an economically viable sum anyway. I want free exercise to be available.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13313094", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pensioner Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will set the context for the debate&#8212;we are the Scottish Parliament in lobbying mode.

I would do so first, for the same reason as Tam Dalyell: he will break his principled self-denying ordinance, which prevents him from voting on measures that apply only to parts of the UK other than Scotland, because he believes that it is more important to prevent the introduction of a policy that will militate against the best interests of Scottish universities. He is as correct about that as he was when he pointed out the flaws and idiosyncrasies in the Scotland Act 1998, which placed us in the position that we are now in&#8212;although many members of the unionist parties in the Scottish Parliament sincerely believe that it is possible for us to produce and carry through a distinctively Scottish agenda, as the Deputy First Minister suggested.</p><p>The other reason why I oppose the Government's proposal is, of course, that the ethos of the Scottish Parliament has been to build a sense of community in Scotland. Although I can make plenty of detailed criticisms of the Executive's programme, I believe that the Executive's intention is to try to bridge the gaps in opportunity that exist between different groups of people and different regions in Scotland. I hope that I will not be proved wrong, but I do not expect to hear a defence of the policy on top-up tuition fees that is constructed along the lines of the patronising, selfish, stupid and divisive defence that has been offered by Tony Blair and some of his supporters. Dustbin men, hospital cleaners and porters have the same interest as doctors, lawyers or MSPs in ensuring that all parts of our education system are as good as possible and that entry to higher education depends on the ability to learn, rather than on the ability to pay.</p><p>The people who benefit financially from having obtained a university degree should pay their dues through income tax, when they are earning the big bucks. No one will be deterred from going to university by the knowledge that they will pay the top rate of tax when they earn more than &#163;100,000 <place-holder colnum=\"5075\"/> per year. However, people will, by the knowledge that they could choose a cheaper degree and pay &#163;20,000, be deterred from attending a university at which they would pile up a debt of &#163;30,000.

However, I will draw on the experience that I have gained. No matter whether we are on one side or the other of the great constitutional divide&#8212;or, indeed, whether we have a marked backside from sitting on the fence&#8212;we would all like Scots to be healthy, wealthy and wise. The starting point for our common ambition is a healthy Scotland.</p><p>The Executive shows commendable intent in attempting to improve the quality of the NHS, although it is for others in the chamber and elsewhere to deal with the question whether a cost-benefit analysis will vindicate its policies. I will not dwell on that question today. Instead, I will confine myself to awarding some roses and raspberries to the Executive's attempts to create a healthier nation.</p><p>Just as neither the Scottish Executive nor Scottish Enterprise can produce manufactured goods for export but must instead create the conditions that encourage and support industrialists to expand their markets, so the Executive is responsible for creating the conditions that encourage Scots to make healthy lifestyle choices. Of course, it is also the responsibility of those who would rule over us to get to grips with the health problems that poverty creates. The Parliament cannot eliminate poverty; instead, it can try only to ameliorate some of its worst effects.</p><p>Duncan McNeil was absolutely right to point out that the Executive cannot force individual adults to get healthy&#8212;after all, look at him.

However, just as public attitudes to drinking and driving and the infliction of passive smoking have changed&#8212;and have been changed&#8212;so we can and must change attitudes towards fitness and health.

On the Executive's policy of providing new schools through public-private partnerships, it has been discovered that access to the sometimes good, sometimes cramped facilities&#8212;I will not go into that particular matter at the moment&#8212;is very often constrained by commercial demands. That problem must be admitted and tackled. Although it might have been an unforeseen circumstance of levering money into education in such a way, it means that access to facilities that should be public is being restricted. In that respect, I hope that I am present this afternoon to hear the minister's summing-up speech.</p><p>Glasgow City Council has worked out that if it could increase its use of schools' sport facilities from the present 18 hours to 25 hours a week, it could also increase satisfied demand for sport from 53 to 81 per cent. We are beginning to find out how newer policies are working and are discovering that they must be tweaked. That is why blue-sky thinking is such a good idea.</p><p>The Executive has competition for the hearts, minds, stomachs and livers of Scots. The food and drinks industries spend squillions on making a mockery of what we have been saying this morning and of what the Executive's various health and fitness initiatives are trying to achieve. Money talks, and the Big Macs and the Colonel can drown out any message that the Executive tries to put across in its television advertising.</p><p>I said that I would make some suggestions&#8212;I will try to outline five of them. First, it has been proved that Gary Lineker can sell crisps and make Walkers crisps the brand leader. As a result, we need someone like Henrik Larsson to make fruit the brand leader; we need to get him into the schools and the places where the kids are. Style icons and sports idols must promote this policy. I <place-holder colnum=\"1854\"/> once persuaded Billy Connolly to promote the NHS patients helpline at no cost and he did a brilliant series of radio adverts for nothing. Public figures will do that sort of thing.</p><p>My second suggestion&#8212;[<em>Interruption.</em>] Please bear with me, Presiding Officer. I have a couple of suggestions and I just want to outline them.</p><p>My second suggestion is that we should tax the baddies. After all, the Westminster Government started to tax the tobacco companies. I know that we in the Scottish Parliament cannot tax these industries, but we could send a wee letter to Westminster saying that we think that it would be a good idea to tax foods that are injurious to health.</p><p>Thirdly, free school meals are nothing to do with equity and everything to do with the fact that we would be able to send children to school without money in their pockets and know that they would be fed the correct stuff. Finally, we need prescription exercise on the NHS for all people, particularly elderly people.

WeightWatchers thanks her as well. I reckon that I am about the best qualified in the chamber to talk about obesity.</p><p>A long time ago, when I qualified as a physical education teacher, I did not have the problems with my weight that I now have. That was because I was so active. I did not know it then, but I was a fat person waiting to get outside a thin athlete. However, because I was so active my weight was kept down. My weight started to go up only after a period of illness and it took me a long time afterwards to get back into the habit of regular exercise. It does not say much for my priorities when the choice tonight was between going to the golf course with my husband and two granddaughters and coming here to sit and talk about exercise. However, I continue to do it because old habits die hard.</p><p>I inform the minister that I have seen a huge change in attitudes towards exercise and physical education. In Scottish education, PE was always regarded as a frill. A terrible snobbery surrounded PE; people regarded it as just drill and thought that all that was needed for it were gym shoes or sannies. PE was not taken seriously. However, I think that not only health economists, but real economists are beginning to realise that an unfit population means a poorer population. Therefore, PE should by now have become central to policy making and all cross-cutting measures. If that is not the case, I sincerely hope that it will be. Physical education should be central to how we think now and should not be used just to alleviate <place-holder colnum=\"1727\"/> poverty, make for a better quality of lifestyle, keep kids occupied and out of trouble, or keep people thin.</p><p>I appreciate the moves that have been made to reclassify physical education as a degree subject in universities and to bump it up the academic ladder. However, that is not enough if we want to get teachers into schools quickly enough to meet what is now an epidemic. Extraordinary measures must be taken&#8212;for example, measures to get more PE teachers into schools and to provide more coaches at community level to get kids out exercising.</p><p>For the older age group to which David Davidson referred, prescription exercise could be a possibility. That would cost much less than lots of the pills and potions that are prescribed for women of my age. It would be better, for example, if older women were given a free ticket for an aquafitness session at the local baths, or were allowed to try out a pulse centre. I believe that prescription exercise is a practical solution that could happen right now.</p><p>Tommy Sheridan is right about free school meals. The reason for suggesting the provision of universal free school meals was not to prevent poor children from feeling stigma for getting free school meals, but to ensure that what children ate at school could be controlled. We could tell parents that they did not need to give their children lunch money because they would get a free school meal. That was the rationale behind the proposal to provide universal free school meals and that is why I continue to support that proposal.</p><p>I also support the free fruit in schools scheme, even though some kids throw away the fruit. We must persist with that scheme and extend it to all schools. We must get role models and sporting icons into schools to say, \"Look at me munching an apple. This is what it does for you&#8212;you can sign for Man United and get paid a fortune.\" We must meet the advertising giants on their own ground. The scale of the advertising to which Tommy Sheridan referred is undermining all the sensible foodstuffs and eating plans that we are discussing.</p><p>The issue affects not only poor wee Scotland with its bad dietary habits; it is an international problem. Just a few months ago in Portugal, I saw evidence of that. Portuguese kids, too, are getting fatter because they are watching the same advertising on television and eating the same gloop as our kids are. Similarly, their mothers are out working and do not have time to cook, so they use microwaves as well. In closing, therefore, I suggest that, as well as tackling advertising, the Government takes action that would hurt the companies and puts tax on foods that have high salt and fat contents. Think about it: if we can tax <place-holder colnum=\"1728\"/> cigarettes because they are bad for people, we can do the same thing with food.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13301193", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Obesity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Elaine Smith for the opportunity to debate obesity.

I would like some of the small change from the &#163;394 million end-year flexibility to go to that.</p><p>I understand what the minister said about the allocation of priorities by ministers with specific portfolios. However, perhaps the Minister for Finance and Public Services is in the best position to recognise that a year-end fund of small spending money might be established. There is something of a parallel with small businesses that cannot get a small loan from the bank or from any lender. If they want millions they can quite often argue a good case and get it, but the person who wants a small loan just cannot get it.</p><p>Much the same could be said of the organisations in which I am interested in relation to promoting fitness in the general population. I met representatives of sportscotland last week. Ian Robson and Allan Miller both told me of their great concern that in the community clubs to which Frank McAveety referred&#8212;the sports clubs that are the bedrock of sporting activity and fitness in the community&#8212;coaches are in short supply. There needs to be a fund&#8212;a relatively small amount of money that might not even need to be recurring money&#8212;to provide for the training of coaches, or else many such small community clubs will go to the wall. The same is true of training administrators to administer local funds and so on.</p><p>I am asking for a small-change fund, which might act as a stop-gap fund for sponsorships that may go out of fashion or simply come to an end. The BAA games in Edinburgh were very successful and were absolutely terrific. Schoolchildren from all over Scotland took part. However, the sponsorship deal has now come to an end. We therefore need a small amount of money to bridge the gap between the ending of that sponsorship and the beginning of a new one.</p><p>I concur with Brian Monteith: it is a good idea to have end-year flexibility.

I do not claim to have all the answers, but many questions arise about the implications for Scots law of the Prime Minister's announcement of fundamental constitutional changes, including his commitment to establish a supreme court.</p><p>It is not clear whether the proposed supreme court is to be a court of final appeal or a court whose jurisdiction is largely confined to cases that raise questions of constitutional law or issues under the Human Rights Act 1998. Obviously, the character of the court and its relationship to the different legal systems in the United Kingdom are dependent on the answers to those questions.</p><p>The issue is one on which, no matter how unionist individual members or parties in this Parliament may be, we require an independent Scottish approach. This Parliament is responsible for the Scottish legal system and it must exercise that responsibility, free from any influence exerted by the party system in Westminster. That does not mean that we cannot take good ideas from whatever source, but they should not be party-politically motivated and we should not feel constrained by party politics.</p><p>The Prime Minister's idea of a supreme court raises profound issues for Scotland and for this Parliament. The Scottish Parliament should open a dialogue with the Scottish judiciary, organisations that come into contact with the system and the public before we come to any certain conclusions about our view.</p><p>Lord Hope&#8212;by general agreement one of Scotland's best judges and now a law lord in the House of Lords&#8212;has pointed out that, because of the provisions of Treaty of Union, any supreme court that is part of the English royal courts of justice cannot be the supreme court of Scotland. As a treat, I will read from article 19 of the Act of Union 1707. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"And that no Causes in Scotland be cognoscible by the Courts of Chancery, Queens-Bench, Common-Pleas, or any other Court in Westminster-hall; And that the said <place-holder colnum=\"1081\"/> Courts, or any other of the like nature after the Union, shall have no power to Cognosce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within Scotland, or stop the Execution of the same\".</p><p>The immediate question, to which we have not heard an answer from either Prime Minister Blair or Lord Falconer, is whether the supreme court is to be separate from and above the Scottish and English legal systems. If it is, there is another question: are we to change the practice whereby, although Scottish civil cases can be appealed to the House of Lords, Scottish criminal cases stop at the appeal stage in the High Court in Edinburgh? Why, after centuries, should criminal appeals leave the Scottish judicial system? That system works and, if it ain't broke, why fix it?</p><p>The basic question is whether we in Scotland require a supreme court. Could not we repatriate the power of the House of Lords on civil cases, which was not given to it by statute but arrogated by it through a judicial decision? If anyone is interested, the Earl of Rosebery raised the matter in 1707 and 1708 and the House of Lords heard it&#8212;I thought that members would be interested in that.</p><p>Another interesting question is raised. This Parliament has the power to legislate over the Scottish legal system, so why do not we pass an act to cut out the House of Lords from Scottish civil cases? Our act, given that it would be a statute, would have greater authority than a judicial decision that was made around 1708 in Lord Rosebery's favour.</p><p>I remind members of another quirky feature of the present set-up. The Parliament is governed by its own supreme court, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, whose power over our acts is written into our constitution&#8212;the Scotland Act 1998. If we believe that the ability to appeal beyond the inner house of the Court of Session is necessary in Scottish civil cases, why do not we send appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council rather than to the House of Lords? I know that last year's Justice report on the subject was not enamoured of that idea and I can understand that in the future there might not be a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but the issue is worth considering.</p><p>Why do we need a supreme court in Scotland? If we decide that we need one, why do not we have our own supreme court, which would hear both civil and criminal appeals in Scotland, with the most eminent Scottish judges applying Scots law? There would be symmetry to the system and it would be consistent.</p><p>That idea raises another pertinent question about the Prime Minister's idea. Who is to appoint the supreme court judges? We already have the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland, but <place-holder colnum=\"1082\"/> England does not have a similar board, although I believe that one is promised. Is there to be a joint appointments board or a new board to appoint judges to the supreme court of the United Kingdom? If there is to be a new board, what will the Scottish contingent be?</p><p>I have discussed some propositions, but I will draw only two conclusions.

I freely concede that a 2 per cent interest rate would advantage the Scottish economy at the moment, as Keith Raffan said, but would it advantage the English economy? Why do I mention the English economy? I do so not just because I am an independent, but because the English economy is Scotland's biggest market. Do we want to beggar our neighbour and jeopardise our market by imposing on England an interest rate that is as unsuitable for its needs as the current rate that is set in London is for our needs?</p><p>If we want to consider the interests of the economies north and south of the border, we must examine the economic developments in Europe that will flow from the existence of a single interest rate. Europe's single interest rate suits us just now, but it might not suit us in future. I do not claim to know economics, but if we know anything about the subject it is that&#8212;as a number of honest European politicians have noted&#8212;there is a closeness between having a common interest rate and having a common fiscal policy, which is what the rate feeds into.</p><p>Would we be happy with a common fiscal policy that operates from Poland through to Scotland?

What does the Labour party think about the issue? We know what Tony Blair thinks, although like the rest of the population, I do not believe a word that he says. However, I am prepared to believe Gordon Brown. Gordon Brown has said that joining the single currency is not a good idea right now and that we should see how things develop before we commit ourselves. To go from one system of economic management to another and from one economic cycle to another would be a huge leap. Gordon Brown has said that we should give ourselves a bit of time. I happen to agree with that very sensible suggestion.</p><p>What does the Scottish Executive think of the single currency? We know that the Lib Dems think that we should go in tomorrow. Being federalists, the Lib Dems have no objection, as far as I can work out, to the federalisation and harmonisation of tax policy, but what does the other half of the Executive think? It would be nice if some of them were here to tell us. Perhaps that is why there are no Labour ministers in the chamber.</p><p>And what does the SNP think about tax harmonisation across Europe? SNP members want us to go into Europe. They love Europe, and are passionate about it, but do they realise that Europe is a pork barrel? The reason that Ted Brocklebank's party, when it was in Government, agreed to the common fisheries policy is that it traded off fishing against other perceived advantages to the British economy. What advantage would be gained for the Scottish economy? Would we trade fish for tax? What would we oppose? The SNP will need to take a cold look at the implications of the federal development of Europe.</p><p>We need to be honest about this issue.

I will call him to speak a lot at next week's meeting of the Subordinate Legislation Committee.</p><p>There is a chance, before August 2005, for the United Kingdom Government to ask for a new law on the issue. If, after debate, we decide that a new law would be the best way forward, we could ask for a new law that would allow national Governments to decide what would be suitable for their different circumstances. As I said, the point of the directive, which was sold on the basis of its raising of safety standards, is harmonisation. Anyone who reads the directive will see in the first two lines that that is the case. It is obvious that we all aspire to harmony, but in this case harmony is not a good idea, because we are all different&#8212;as I will explain.</p><p>It is not impossible to make a bad law good. However it is done, Scotland must have some sort of derogation from the directive. I suggested to the minister that the UK Government might be prevailed on to think about having a new law on the issue that reflected national circumstances and needs. However, there is an absolute requirement for that in Scotland because lower levels of essential nutrients exist in Scottish soil than exist in soil all over Europe, whence the directive came. As members will know, there is a great difference between Scotland's agricultural methods and those of other areas of Europe.<place-holder colnum=\"19060\"/></p><p>If the soil from which we obtain our food does not provide sufficient nutrients, we must obtain them in another way. That is where the idea of food supplements, consisting of essential minerals and vitamins, comes in. However, under the directive, the combination of echinacea and vitamin C, for example, would be forbidden. At the moment, we can buy that combined food supplement, which is used without problems by hundreds of thousands of people to prevent colds and influenza. I suppose that it is trendy to take echinacea, which can certainly be taken in conjunction with vitamin C.</p><p>The directive will prevent echinacea and vitamin C from being sold in combination because echinacea is regarded as an herbal remedy and vitamin C is regarded as a food supplement. However, there is no justification for not being able to self-medicate or look after ourselves by using those substances together. No contraindications of such use have been noted. There is no history of anyone falling ill because of using the combination or of anyone abusing it and falling foul of it. Therefore, why on earth is it necessary to ban the combined use of echinacea and vitamin C?</p><p>It could be argued that echinacea and vitamin C can be bought and taken separately. However, there is no recommended dosage for vitamin C. The recommended level for vitamin C is still being discussed by the European Commission and European food safety organisations. However, we can be certain that the level of vitamin C that will be allowed will be far lower than the level that we are used to taking in this country. That will perhaps be because many of the people who are helping to make the policy come from countries that have lovely sunshine. We have a fantastic sunshine record in Scotland and folk in Leith, for example, will probably never have to bother about what I am saying. However, there are areas in Scotland&#8212;in the north-east perhaps&#8212;where those who are getting on a bit and who are suffering from colds and flu might feel the need for echinacea and vitamin C taken together. As I said, the chances are that they have been taking them together for a while with no ill effects.</p><p>My motion seeks to persuade the Scottish Executive to oppose the directive in whichever ways are constitutional and feasible.

The most important paragraph in the committee's report is paragraph 92, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the new power to advance well being, for provision of support services to prostitutes, should be monitored and kept under review by the Executive.\"</p><p>Of course, I agree with that point.

Indeed, I must thank her for the care and attention that she and her committee gave to the issue. In her speech, she stressed the need to change attitudes. I could not agree more, but changing attitudes takes time. As we heard from Margaret Smith, we may not have time, given what is happening in Edinburgh just now. I appreciate that the situation may be different in other cities, but the bill is an enabling measure that would allow each city to adopt a pragmatic policy of management to suit the conditions that exist now. Local authorities would not be precluded from adopting a longer-term strategy for dealing with prostitution, which is what the committee favoured.</p><p>Bill Aitken asked what the police would do about drug users. He said that drug usage drives prostitution. He is right that it drives prostitution in many instances and drug use is most certainly allied to the growth of underage prostitution in Glasgow. As I pointed out, in Edinburgh&#8212;even with the deterioration over the past 15 months, since there has not been a tolerance zone&#8212;only 50 per cent of the prostitutes are estimated to be intravenous drug users. What are the police to do with them? Are they to be treated differently from other prostitutes?</p><p>I turn briefly to the differences in the record as regards violence and the number of murders committed. I certainly do not want to do a head count. In Edinburgh, which had the tolerance zone, there have been two murders in the past 12 years, both of which were solved and the culprits found and charged within 48 hours because, the police assure me, of the intelligence that had been built up. In Glasgow, there have been eight murders, but none has ever been solved and no one has ever been brought to court for them.</p>", "hdate": "2003-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13292364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prostitution Tolerance Zones (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Let me reiterate the views of the solicitor to the City of Edinburgh Council.

It is an enabling measure, which would empower a local authority, if it so decided, to designate an area forming part of the authority's area as a prostitution tolerance zone. By that, I mean a zone</p><p class=\"indent\">\"within which loitering, soliciting or importuning by prostitutes is not an offence under section 46(1) of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982\".</p><p>The bill seeks to exercise a duty of care towards prostitutes and to minimise annoyance, inconvenience and embarrassment to the general community. It does not seek to condone or promote prostitution; instead, it seeks to minimise the criminality that is associated with prostitution and to enable health and social services to be delivered more easily to a group of very vulnerable people.</p><p>I introduce the bill because for some years now I have been associated with the Scottish prostitutes education project&#8212;or SCOT-PEP&#8212;which is the voluntary organisation in Edinburgh that supports prostitutes. I was asked by officers in Lothian and Borders police to convene a steering group to investigate how best to build on the successful tolerance, or non-harassment, zone that had operated in Edinburgh for the best part of 20 years. The steering group became necessary after the area around Coburg Street in Leith, which had been the original tolerance zone, was redeveloped and residents complained of nuisance and embarrassment caused by the women who solicited there.</p><p>After discussions with SCOT-PEP, which represented the prostitutes, the police moved the zone to a strictly defined part of Salamander Street in Leith. As members will see from the evidence that was submitted to the Local Government Committee, such a solution might have proved possible if the police had had enough time to consult local people in the area before a <place-holder colnum=\"18814\"/> very unfortunate spate of mass media reporting made any calm assessment of the matter well nigh impossible. The Salamander Street tolerance zone was discontinued on 30 November 2001 and a new solution was sought, which is how the steering group came about. In fact, I should point out that the group has greatly influenced the production of the bill.</p><p>Therefore, as members will appreciate, the bill is not ideologically based. Instead, it is a pragmatic, workable and legal way of managing the problems that can arise from street prostitution and of exercising a duty of care to prostitutes and the wider community. I dare to suggest that such a duty will be needed for as long as there are street prostitutes. In their evidence to the Local Government Committee, even the bill's opponents conceded that street prostitution is likely to remain a part of life in Scotland's four big cities for the foreseeable future.</p><p>At this stage, I should assure members that we are talking only about the four big cities. To the best of my knowledge, no other area has street prostitutes. There might well be women who work indoors as prostitutes elsewhere, but the problems and challenges that are presented by street prostitution are to be found only in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow. I will explain the differences among the cities later.</p><p>Because street prostitution in those cities is a fact of life, even though we might not wish that to be so, local councils, health authorities, community drugs action workers and the police in Aberdeen and Edinburgh have indicated their support for the bill's intentions and principles. Both cities have operated acknowledged informal tolerance zones. Moreover, having heard evidence on Glasgow's red-light area, the Local Government Committee has concluded that it, too, is a tolerance zone by any other name.</p><p>Because the pattern of prostitution is different in those three cities, the bill itself is non-prescriptive. However, Dundee is something else. I can say that because Kate Maclean is not here this morning. Dundee has a very small number of women who work as prostitutes and who are known to the police. That system works, and if it ain't broke, I would not be so presumptuous as to say that it should be mended. However, representatives of Tayside police attended meetings of the steering group, contributed to our discussions and did not raise any objections to the bill's principles.</p><p>Grampian police and Lothian and Borders police noted that the benefits of operating a non-harassment policy within an agreed area include the very low levels of criminality within such a zone. Attacks on women are much less frequent and underage women are not tolerated either by <place-holder colnum=\"18815\"/> the women who work there as prostitutes or by the police who patrol the area. Pimps, managers or other exploitative people who live off the women's earnings are also not tolerated. Some people who enjoy dancing on the head of a pin would say that there are no such things as pimps in Scotland. I have used the word \"pimp\" to describe someone who lives off the earnings of a woman who works as a prostitute. Such people certainly exist.</p><p>Grampian and Lothian and Borders police officers cited the intelligence gained by the police as the most effective way of preventing or minimising alcohol and drugs offences and other crime. Obviously, as the law stands, soliciting is a crime. However, no other crime is tolerated within the zones that have been, or are, non-harassment zones.</p><p>One of the most urgent reasons for reinstating an agreed tolerance zone in Edinburgh centres on police officers' concern that, without knowing where prostitutes are working at any given time, they are finding it more difficult to prevent developments that are worrying municipal authorities all over Europe, including&#8212;as some members might know&#8212;those in English cities.</p><p>The new Mafias from eastern Europe and Albania are trafficking women from there and from elsewhere. Some of those women were discovered in Glasgow, not in its de facto street tolerance zone but working indoors, where it is much more difficult for them to be noticed by regular policing and the intelligence that builds up, as I described a few minutes ago.</p><p>Police in Edinburgh are concerned that, with the tolerance zone suspended, trafficked women might be working as street prostitutes. That would be an entirely new development and one that we should fear and attempt to meet as quickly as possible.</p><p>The ending of the tolerance zone has made it easier for drug dealers to infiltrate prostitution. During the time in which the Coburg Street zone was operational, it was estimated that about 20 per cent of the street prostitutes in Edinburgh were injecting drugs. In the 15 months since the zone was suspended, that percentage has grown to more than 50 per cent.</p><p>Aberdeen and Glasgow adopted their sensitive or tolerant policing policies later than Edinburgh, which might go some way to explaining why there should be such a difference between the 90 per cent plus drug injectors among prostitutes in Aberdeen and Glasgow and the much lower percentage in Edinburgh. To take members back almost 20 years&#8212;I can do that because I was there&#8212;when heavy drugs such as heroin first came on to the streets in Edinburgh, there was a fear that the HIV virus&#8212;and the hepatitis virus <place-holder colnum=\"18816\"/> before that&#8212;could be spread through the prostitution route via drug dealers and drug trafficking. The drug scene gave rise to the management of prostitution. That did not happen until a few years later in Glasgow, which might explain some of the differences between the cities.</p><p>When the bill reaches stage 2, I want to lodge an amendment to include in the list of persons to be consulted under section 2(4) community councils and drugs action groups. I want to do that before a tolerance zone has been established, even when the zone has been triggered by the local authority.</p><p>The bill makes provision in section 2 for voluntary and statutory agencies to consult residents, business people and prostitutes. There must be a partnership to effect the bill's provisions in order to maximise the benefits to public health, security and good order in the entire community.</p><p>Members will note that health boards are listed. The director of public health of Lothian NHS Board gave evidence to the Local Government Committee in support of the bill because of the perceived benefits to public health in a tolerance zone. The zone makes it easier to deliver preventative measures such as condoms or medical examinations for sexually transmitted infections. In support of that, during the time that the tolerance zone was operational in Leith, there was not a single recorded case of the HIV virus being transmitted via a prostitute. That is a record that no one else can lay claim to, certainly not among the people whom I have consulted when introducing the bill.</p><p>If there are measurable benefits from having a tolerance zone policy&#8212;even an informal one&#8212;why do we need legislation? The Local Government Committee recommends that Aberdeen, Edinburgh and presumably Glasgow&#8212;as it has a de facto zone&#8212;could apply the well-being provision of the new Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 and install whichever facilities those cities think necessary in a suitable area to deliver health services, support to get out of prostitution and security to prostitutes. Soliciting would remain a criminal offence. At this stage, I say that those are precisely the services that are being delivered via SCOT-PEP in Edinburgh. Aberdeen would like to replicate the delivery of those services to its street prostitutes. Aberdeen would deliver the services via Drugs Action.</p><p>Under the scheme suggested by the Local Government Committee, soliciting would remain a criminal offence. I might have been tempted to accept that but, unfortunately, I have had legal advice from local authority solicitors and others who doubt that councils would have the necessary legal basis to instigate that informal style of tolerance zone. Local councillors in Edinburgh <place-holder colnum=\"18817\"/> have told me that they are not confident that they could proceed on that basis after the breakdown of the previous policy and the ensuing publicity. Perhaps the convener of the Local Government Committee or the Executive could help to allay councillors' fears about that matter and I sincerely hope that they will be able to do so.</p><p>For a successful tolerance zone policy, there must be compliance from prostitutes, such as there was in Edinburgh, even when the tolerance zone was relocated. The women knew that if they observed the code of conduct agreed by SCOT-PEP and the police, they would not be prosecuted for soliciting. There was a strong argument for them to operate inside the zone and to respect business hours of opening and so on.</p><p>The suggestion from the Local Government Committee is that soliciting should remain a criminal offence. As evidence to the Local Government Committee has shown, there can be different views among procurators fiscal and police as to how rigorously the law against soliciting should be enforced, which might not induce an easy system of partnership among the relevant agencies. In time-honoured tradition, I have got my retaliation in first.</p><p>Finally, I record my thanks to the men who did such a professional job of producing the bill&#8212;Neil Brailsford and Kenneth Campbell from the Faculty of Advocates. I am also greatly obliged to the Parliament's draftsperson who gave advice, dotted the i's and crossed the t's, and to the Parliament's non-Executive bills unit. The clerks to the Local Government Committee, its committee members and the distinguished members of the superb Subordinate Legislation Committee are all to be thanked for their consideration and help with the bill. I also thank my advisers and SCOT-PEP, the researchers in my office who put up with me and all those who took part in the consultation and gave evidence to the committees. Thanks to their efforts, I am now able to ask Parliament to agree to the general principles of the bill.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Prostitution Tolerance Zones (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2003-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13292364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prostitution Tolerance Zones (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is with great pleasure that I invite Parliament's approval for the principles of the Prostitution Tolerance Zones (Scotland) Bill.

He made a fantastic nationalist speech about the inherent dignity of Scots and, I think, their inherent genetic superiority. He waxed lyrical about how well we have done in other parts of the world that have excellent fiscal systems to support all that entrepreneurialism.</p><p>All Robin Harper's motion asks for is the imaginative blue-sky thinking that John Scott <place-holder colnum=\"17613\"/> outlined&#8212;I see Robin Harper nodding&#8212;which is absolutely terrific. The motion simply asks the Executive to investigate land value taxation.</p><p>Although I hate to say this, Maureen Macmillan's speech, which outlined all the possible downsides of such a tax, made me quite sad. The Parliament was supposed to take time to investigate new ideas and new ways of doing things. Just because we have not done something in the past does not mean to say that we cannot do it in the future. We should not be so negative in our approach to this new system of taxation.</p><p>Contrary to the Tories' fears, land value taxation does not necessarily mean that Tory supporters&#8212;there must be some to whom the tax would apply&#8212;would be required to pay more tax. Land value taxation would mean that people would pay taxation in a different, fairer way. That is why I think it is a great idea that the Executive should investigate the proposal.</p><p>To be quite serious, we have got to the stage where Scotland's universities are under fantastic threat because of the way in which our tax system and social service delivery are interlinked. We seem no longer to be able to ensure that money is spent on providing for the next generation the quality, standard and equity in public services that should be taken for granted at this stage of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>It would be worth while to investigate a system that promises to redistribute more fairly. I make no apologies for saying that. My former colleague, Alasdair Morgan, said that there is not much wrong with Scotland's system of taxation, but that the problem is that Scotland has no fundamental control over it. He is right in the latter statement, but quite wrong in the former. When people live in abject poverty in blankets on Princes Street while other folk live off the fat of the land and do not pay the income tax that they should, there is something wrong with our tax system.</p><p>Therefore, I support Robin Harper's motion. The Executive should look into the future to see if there is any other way in which we could prevent land values from being distorted. In rural parts of Scotland, such distortion can discriminate against people and cause fantastic rural poverty, but the issue is equally important in a city such as Edinburgh, where land values can mean that house prices and property prices are utterly distorted. In turn, that means that a community or a society can be distorted because there is not that mixture of people to form a community in which, theoretically, people would help one another. I would like to see anything that would investigate an evening-out of land values in Edinburgh in particular. That is why I want members to support Robin Harper's motion.<place-holder colnum=\"17614\"/></p><p>I also support the Liberal Democrats' reasonable proposal that there should be trials. As one would expect, Donald Gorrie outlined the reasonable man's way of trialling: perhaps in a whole district, a part of a city or a rural area. That is very sensible, good thinking.</p><p>Of course there would have to be variations in the application of LVT. Robin Harper said that there were variations in how the principle was applied throughout the world&#8212;and why not? There are different conditions throughout the world. Events, dear boy, change people's priorities, and so they should. The Parliament must not sit on its laurels and get dug into a taxation system simply because it has been used for a long time.

There is a specific problem with HMOs in parts of Edinburgh that were previously known as the leafy suburbs&#8212;most unfairly, as they were just full of decent people trying to live in a decent area and bring their children up decently. Those people are now finding that the standards of communal behaviour, which Trish Godman referred to, have fallen.</p><p>After the HMO legislation had been in place for a year, a review was carried out. That indicates that <place-holder colnum=\"17170\"/> there is a need to include tenancy management issues in the registration procedure. I agree with that. I also back the extension of HMO regulations to ensure that the number of HMOs in a given stair or street is limited. For example, there might be a maximum of two per stair. Such an arrangement should take account of past problems with tenant behaviour and resolution of neighbour issues and might ensure that residential areas such as the ones that I have described are not dominated by one particular type of property. It would also help to ensure that mixed neighbourhoods with families, elderly residents, students and others can exist and that the people in them can get along as a community. We must take measures to ensure that a sense of community is once again injected into city living.</p><p>I would also like to raise with the minister the issue of mobile homes. It may seem strange, but in Scotland's boom city we have a bit of a problem with mobile homes, and I foresee that the problem will grow, because rents in Edinburgh are so high. I know of one instance of a private landlord who condemned a mobile home on his site. He then bought the mobile home, did it up and relet it. However, no subsequent checks are carried out to ensure that such properties are done up to a suitable quality or that the reasons why they were condemned have been removed.</p><p>There is a park homes charter, but it can only make recommendations. There are legal requirements for mobile homes, under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 and the Mobile Homes Act 1983, but there are lots of loopholes. For example, there are no minimum fire regulations. Mobile homes are not subject to the HMO regulations, so there is tremendous potential for overcrowding. On a mobile home site, home owners have no legal power to complain about the condition of other homes on the site, even if the value of their own home is at risk.

We are considering how we can express opinion in Scotland in a consistent, decent and humane way. Once the issue moves into the hands of the Security Council, after Hans Blix has reported, we would be foolish to imagine that the same politicking that persuaded Russia to support resolution 1441 will not go on.</p><p>Since resolution 1441 was passed, the membership of the Security Council has changed. Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain have joined the Security Council.

Let us consider what would happen if the former were true. Let us assume that there is a war, that Saddam Hussein is deposed, that a popular president or leader of the country is elected in Iraq and that he decides to pursue the same sort of weapons policy that the independent state of Israel is pursuing. Would the United Nations feel that it could again move in to remove such an arsenal from Iraq?

Rhona Brankin and I launched a questionnaire, which was unique in terms of health care surveys in that it was organised by women, all of whom had experienced the breast cancer service because they had been sufferers. They questioned as many women as they possibly could in 2000 on their experience of the breast cancer regime in this country. Their findings have to be listened to, because they are not theoretical; they are a record of what happened to them as individuals.</p><p> One issue that came through clearly was the postcode lottery that Shona Robison referred to. However, it is not that there is a postcode lottery for treatment: once someone gets to the treatment stage it is usually uniformly good. It is getting to the treatment that involves a postcode lottery.</p><p>One suggestion from the survey was that the Government must never let up on the information that is provided for all women, which means public campaigns every so often and money for information campaigns. It is important that women, particularly women in rural areas&#8212;the survey bore that out&#8212;are well aware of treatments, where they can be obtained and the frequency of clinics, so that they take advantage of the available services.</p><p>I would not say that referral from general practitioners is lacking, but it is not uniform. Considering mandatory guidelines for GPs to follow might be sensible, because GPs still have differences of opinion about how to deal initially with a woman who complains of vague symptoms. I will say no more than that, because I do not want to castigate any group of people who are concerned with breast cancer care.</p><p>As for the general service provision and back-up support from the voluntary sector in Scotland, <place-holder colnum=\"16926\"/> when the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign's survey was taken to international conferences in Europe and other places, we discovered that Scotland is way ahead of almost everywhere on information dissemination among patients and in the voluntary and statutory sectors. Perhaps a few lessons might be learned. I urged the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care's predecessor to examine that survey and to incorporate its findings into anything the Government promotes in Scotland.</p><p>I will pick up where Rhona Brankin left off on HRT and the fact that some women are scared and put off going for that first vital examination that might lead to earlier diagnosis and a less traumatic regime of treatment. When I inquired of my doctor&#8212;I have a personal interest&#8212;whether the HRT low-oestrogen pills had made any difference in my case and what I should say if people asked me about the matter in general, my doctor said that, first, what was involved was a particular trial of a particular brand of a particular type of HRT treatment, so drawing too wide a conclusion from that would be unwise and would certainly be scary for women.

Firefighters work a 42-hour week, which is a lot longer than most public servants. The other myth is that Bain has recommended a generous settlement. He has not.

From where I am sitting, there is nothing parochial about south Edinburgh.</p><p>I will think globally by reminding members of the attraction of New York Central station, which is an integral part of the city, its society, its culture, its tourism and its day-to-day life. We should aim for that for Edinburgh. It can be done. Franco's station in Barcelona, which was in a state of ruin&#8212;its condition was much worse than the present state of Waverley&#8212;was completely refurbished for the 1992 Olympics. Its refurbishment was considered to be central to the drive to ensure that people saw Barcelona on the world stage. Members should see that station now.</p><p>I point out that the Barcelona refurbishment was done quickly. We must concentrate on the urgency of the issue. We should not wait until 2008, when it appears that all sorts of things will happen. We must start to put in the services that will get people on the railways, keep them there and keep Edinburgh's economy turning over. It is self-evident that we need to facilitate the new services to the Borders and the airport. We must get those projects through the planning stage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It is also self-evident that the Strategic Rail Authority must prioritise Waverley. Kenny MacAskill asked who the lead agency would be. About three weeks ago, Iain Gray told me that the SRA would be the lead agency, which was very good. He saw no reason why things should not be scheduled for 2008, but he did not say who would pay. Kenny MacAskill asked the right question. Will the SRA pay, if it is nominated as the lead agency?<place-holder colnum=\"14925\"/></p><p>Kenny MacAskill was sensible in suggesting that the SRA should have an office in Scotland. The SRA needs an office in Edinburgh, because construction firms in Edinburgh are experiencing huge difficulties with the supply of skilled tradesmen in the local labour market. To do the job, we need an organisation that is on top of the local market situation. That suggestion is a good one, which we should push.</p><p>Let us not throw the baby out with the bath water. We have a responsibility to maintain our world heritage site status. Waverley could be a beautiful station. We should investigate keeping operations under the glass roof.

Its heart is in the right place and it has put its money where its mouth is. Unfortunately, not quite enough money to overturn the steady drip of venom and distortion that is fed, not only through badly edited newspaper articles, but through nightly television news. For example, if one listens closely to how news of the Sangatte camp is reported, the reporter makes the assumption that it is a bad thing that refugees should have come via that camp to this country. No attempt is made to analyse who came and why they came. No attempt is made to analyse why they would want to stay here, but I will return to that later.</p><p>The Executive's &#163;1 million will not be enough to change attitudes in the way that everyone in the chamber wants. What Michael Matheson said&#8212;and what Bill Butler said eloquently&#8212;must be listened to: it is local organisations that can use the minister's advertising campaign to kick-start a change in attitudes. Those organisations must be funded and listened to. If anyone wants to evaluate the &#163;1 million&#8212;incidentally, that is less than well-known comedians get for advertising the Lotto&#8212;ask the people who organise the neighbourhood anti-racist groups. They will tell you whether the kick start has achieved its objective.</p><p>I understand that it is difficult for the Scottish Executive to disown the Home Secretary. Behind the scenes, however, he should be advised that his choice of language has done harm. The Executive is trying to create positively the sort of atmosphere in which people who are refugees in this country for a short while, and for whom <place-holder colnum=\"14228\"/> English is not a first language, will not have their confidence swept away because of reported tales of what the Home Secretary has said. We all know that and it does us no good to ignore it. When someone of good standing, such as Robert Brown, says the sort of thing that David Blunkett was trying to say about the use of English in the home and the access that it can give a refugee or immigrant to the services that we have to offer, and not one of us thinks that there is anything wrong with that, then it must be that there is something wrong with David Blunkett, because when he talks about the use of English in the home of an immigrant family, we automatically assume that he has in mind the immigrant family whose children swamped schools in England. As Bill Butler pointed out, there is no such phenomenon in Scotland. We should not shy away from saying such things if they are the truth.</p><p>I wanted to talk about the global market in people and their skills moving all over the place. Most Government ministers who are concerned with enterprise and the economy might use that language too. However, when the Home Secretary says that he has no sympathy with young people in their 20s who do not get back home and rebuild their country and their families, it undermines everything we say about a global economy and an inclusive society. I am a nationalist: I am supposed to want Scotland only for the Scots. I want Scotland for everybody who wants to come and live here. Therefore, I welcome the Executive's initiative to try to get rid of racism, but I warn ministers&#8212;they will need a lot more than &#163;1 million.</p>", "hdate": "2002-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13280233", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Race Equality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I also associate myself with the Executive motion.

Before anybody accuses me of talking only about constitutional niceties, I point out that I am referring to the powers that reside not with the Executive, but with what has during the debate increasingly been called the national Government in Westminster.</p><p>As evidence I refer to a written answer that the minister gave me on 18 September 2002. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Neither the Scottish Executive, nor any of its executive agencies, has carried out any detailed study focused on determining the comparative suitability of Glasgow and Edinburgh airports for a hub operation.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-18.S1W-28784.r0\">[<em>Official Report, Written Answers,</em> 18 September 2002; p1607.]</citation></p><p>For goodness' sake why not? It is pathetic management of our economic development for the Executive not to have foreseen that it would have to come down on one side or the other and determine what its airport policy was to be. Is it going to be what is outlined in the strategic rail services review as determined by Westminster? When is the Executive going to decide that there is a priority for its spending review and for economic development?</p><p>I do not know whether to feel mad at the Executive or sorry for it for not deciding. It knows perfectly well that there is a limit to its powers and that the decision on the airport will be determined not by it, but by what I would call its superiors in Westminster&#8212;I do not doubt that the Executive would call them its senior partners. However, whatever the reason for the lack of a decision, will Lewis Macdonald undertake now to say what is likely to be the better option for Scotland's <place-holder colnum=\"14165\"/> economy&#8212;a hub airport centred on Glasgow or one centred on Edinburgh? The Executive cannot afford to hang around on the matter.</p><p>Just before I press the case for the capital&#8212;as members would expect me to&#8212;will the minister consider what John Bowis, the Tory MEP, is saying today. Because of the strategic air services review, he is saying that there is the possibility of a central Scotland airport at Airth. We screwed up on that once before and missed the opportunity. Although it is unlikely that the minister will foresee a huge economic benefit to outweigh the environmental concerns of starting from scratch with a central airport, I still think that the minister should consider it.</p><p>However, the hub airport should be at Edinburgh for the reasons that are outlined in the strategic air services review. Edinburgh airport is in the right place when we consider the development of the business park&#8212;the fastest growing business park in the UK, never mind Scotland. There is room for a second, close-spaced, parallel runway. Believe it or not, there is potential for a reduction in noise pollution, because the two runways could have alternate take-off and landing directions. That is the way that I read it.</p><p>I have concentrated on airports, but the minister mentioned that it was in his power to reorder priorities. Will he listen to what James Douglas-Hamilton said about Edinburgh and congestion? The minister says that his own studies have identified congestion as the primary concern of transport policy and strategy in Scotland. Instead of concentrating on the rail link to the airport, will the minister concentrate on moving working people and tourists around within Edinburgh? Iain Gray has suggested that we may know by 2008 whether there will be a rapid rail transit in Edinburgh. We need to know much sooner than that, and we need Government help to move people around within Edinburgh. After that, the priority will be the rail link to the Borders, to ensure that people can get in to work in Edinburgh. The other big barrier to economic progress is the labour market problems that Edinburgh is experiencing. There are priorities other than airport links.</p>", "hdate": "2002-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13279971", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport (Investment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, was tempted by the Tory motion, because everything is in it except the kitchen sink.

Sometimes at the level of Government, that relationship is a little less special than it might be. However, as we have heard, there is a continuing relationship at the level of communities. The ties of history, language and modern culture&#8212;let us hear it for Dolly Parton&#8212;are unbreakable. The function of good old friends is, in sensitive situations, to be able to say the things that others may not. Old friends can hold up the mirror that we might, as Burns said,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"see oursels as others see us!\"</p><p>How will the action of the United Kingdom Government and the United States Government be seen by our other friends throughout the world?

Will those friends understand, for example, that a justification for attacking Iraq&#8212;breaching Iraq's sovereignty&#8212;inside its borders is that that country has ignored United Nations resolutions? What about Israel? Israel has refused to observe United Nations resolutions, but no one talks of attacking Israel. \"Ah,\" the apologists say, \"Israel is a democracy, but Iraq is a dictatorship.\" What about Pakistan? Pakistan is not a democracy. Pakistan has nuclear weapons under the control of a military dictator, but no one would advocate attacking Pakistan. Our friends elsewhere in the world will be <place-holder colnum=\"13550\"/> concerned that more devastation might be visited on innocent Iraqi men, women and children.</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot support the SNP amendment, because it seeks to find some justification. Like John McAllion, I cannot agree with that. However, I may have misheard John Swinney. Perhaps the SNP can clarify whether the mandate in the amendment refers to a resolution of the whole General Assembly of the United Nations or just the Security Council.

As legislators, we must realise that there is no quick fix to this problem. Paul Martin mentioned one or two legal remedies that might be sought, and I hope that the minister will comment on those suggestions.</p><p>The Parliament must create a framework of social, legal and other policies that might make it easier to change attitudes or behaviour. That is what we are trying to do. One or two other people have referred to the fact that this is not just a problem of firefighters, bus drivers or ambulance men; it is not even about a specific form of public disorder. It is a whole attitude towards or lack of social responsibility, and that cannot be changed overnight.</p><p>On the other hand, the Parliament provides the forum in which we discuss how we might tackle the matter. I add my remarks to those of Angus <place-holder colnum=\"13363\"/> MacKay. He and I take the same approach to what is happening in Edinburgh. Both of us take a huge pride in the city we represent and we are horrified that there are areas in the city where the fire service cannot go without a police escort. That is horrendous in social terms. It is also poor quality in operational terms when we know that the police do not have extra people lying around to accompany a fire truck. It is a waste of resources and money. I will keep my remarks short. We all share a sense of horror and a sense of urgency. We must start tackling the situation.</p><p>I regret to say that, in this instance, I disagree with something that the Executive has already decided, and that is to pack in public service broadcasting. I do not say that because I still have a family interest in that trade, but there is a role for the attitude-changing mechanism of television. If we know that children behave badly because of what influences them on television and in video games, then for goodness' sake, the good guys can start influencing them as well. If we think back 20 years to the anti-AIDS campaign that was run on television and in the mass media, we recognise that awareness can be raised quickly and we can do something to change attitudes. We will have to do that quickly.</p><p>I ask the minister to consider public service broadcasting. We cannot expect police and fire officers to visit every school in Scotland to start undoing the neglect of today's parents and grandparents in social education. I am part of the me generation and we are to blame in that we have not instilled in our children an understanding of the respect that is carried merely by being a public service worker. We have told them nonsense about having to earn respect. Nonsense! If someone is a firefighter or an ambulance man, they have already earned respect. Children have to learn the difference.</p><p>I did not mean to lecture too much, but it is off my chest now. We can hardly sit here and pontificate about how much we value public service workers, particularly firefighters, without saying&#8212;as Angus MacKay said&#8212;that we should consider how we prove that we value them through how we, as a society, reward them. I certainly believe that the Fire Brigades Union should be supported by the Parliament in calling for an independent inquiry into the worth of firefighters and their wage levels. We could do that as a Parliament. That is not going to upset anyone in London, is it?</p><p>As well as that, one or two of the suggestions that Margaret Smith made should be taken on board.

America bears a large responsibility for what has happened because we all know the practicality of the situation. If it were known that America would not veto security council sanctions against Israel for its disobedience of UN resolutions, we could start the ball rolling.</p><p>Ken Macintosh talked about a path to peace. If America did not use its Security Council veto, that would be part of that path to peace. Any pressure that the British Government or other permanent members of the security council can bring to bear on America must be brought now. The situation is urgent and serious, not only for the humanitarian aspects that Lloyd Quinan described, but for the global implications.</p><p>There are other consequences. It is not merely that we diminish the UN at our peril. Yesterday, a Libyan friend told me that he had spoken on the phone to his family in Libya, who had expressed their part of the world's disgust at, and distrust of, British hypocrisy. He is a Libyan Scot who has lived here for ages and his family are young Scots. How do we build the sort of multicultural harmony of which we have talked if Arab people such as my Libyan friend know that our Government is discriminating against Arabs? That is how he sees the situation and I do not think that he should see it any other way. I do not think that there is any other interpretation of the part that our Government has played. It has tried to play a middle role but there is no middle role&#8212;illegality is being practised against the Palestinians and we should take their side.</p><p>I spoke to Saudis yesterday, who told me that, <place-holder colnum=\"11610\"/> although some people here think that it would be impractical to have a boycott of Israeli goods as there was a boycott of South African goods, in the Gulf area there is an effective boycott of everything American. Young Gulf Arabs do not want to know about America and do not trust America. Does everyone understand the seriousness of having a whole region of the world totally opposed to the world's only superpower? I am sure that everyone in the chamber understands why we must take every possible step to break down the total distrust that is growing between what we call the middle east and the far east and the west.</p><p>We are dividing the world. There are areas of the world that will look with dismay at our attitude towards the middle east, which is that our sanctions on Iraq are legitimate because it has ignored UN resolutions and has not allowed UN weapons inspectors but that it is fine for Israel to refuse to accept a UN fact-finding mission without the imposition of sanctions.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13273476", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Middle East"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion refers to \"the key role of the United Nations and the rule of international law.\" This debate is not only about the middle east.

Like him, I do not know how that happens but I am glad that it has happened because it allows us to do two things. First, as Donald Gorrie said more eloquently than I might, we are able to mark Colin O'Riordan's extraordinary contribution to music in the city. I met him twice in the course of my work as a journalist. It was his work that I knew. I did not know the man, but his work stands as testament to the man. It is absolutely proper that we should find time in the Parliament to record what he did for this city and for the music education of children outside the city&#8212;and not just their music education.</p><p>Secondly, the debate gives us the opportunity to put into context the contribution of music to the education of the whole person. It gives us the opportunity to make the case, again, for motivated and inspired specialist teachers of music, drama and physical education, because those three subjects link and they are all required. They must be taught by people who are as motivated as Colin O'Riordan was.</p><p>Yesterday, I was out in Wester Hailes. As Edinburgh members will know, the school there is in an area that is pockmarked by severe deprivation&#8212;which, unfortunately, is reflected in the results in quite a number of the academic subjects. They are not as good as we would want them to be, but the results in music soar way above the others. There is a life about the music in the school. It is the music that inspires children. It is the music that makes them feel a sense of self-confidence and self-worth. There is also an inspired teacher in the school, whom I will not embarrass by naming. I wish to pay tribute to the work that is done by her and other specialist music teachers in Edinburgh.<place-holder colnum=\"5836\"/></p><p>During question time this afternoon, Susan Deacon asked the Minister for Education and Young People for an assurance that we will continue to educate the whole person. To do that, we should not just concentrate on the basics and the three Rs, although they are important. We will never produce civilised citizens unless they are taught about music, art and drama. Unfortunately, as Donald Gorrie said, those subjects are looked on as frills.</p><p>I learned much from Peter Mooney, who was the conductor of the Glasgow Phoenix Choir and who I am very happy to record was also the man who took the choirs when I was at school. The choir was where I learned the self-confidence to get up in front of a crowd of people. The first time I entered the Usher Hall was to sing in a choir conducted by Peter Mooney.

One of my few good habits is that I have maintained my interest in exercise and sport&#8212;I think I am the only professionally qualified physical educationist in the Parliament. Exercising regularly is one of my few good habits. You do not need to be a wee skelf to exercise. That should be some comfort to some of the shyer members in the chamber.</p><p>I am glad that my bandwagon for more PE teachers is finally coming home to stay. The minister assured me in his speech that the Executive will consider again the provision of PE teachers and specialists in primary schools. Dennis Canavan is right. Every teacher should be encouraged to take part in the development of every child in every way.</p><p>So much benchmarking and administration is done now, particularly in primary schools, that primary school teachers who may not have a background in PE cannot be expected to participate. For the past 20 years, a huge gap has developed between the people who had the opportunity to play sport in schools and the folk who were educated in the 70s and 80s and did not have that opportunity.</p><p>The minister must go back to basics&#8212;if he will excuse the expression&#8212;and get PE specialists into the primary schools, where they will do three things: they will properly teach and coach the pupils; they will teach and support the teachers; and they will co-ordinate with the parents, because parents, too, must be brought into this. The message must be sold all over again to parents, because they probably did not take part in organised school sport. The key to all this&#8212;I hope that the minister hears me&#8212;is more PE specialists in primary schools. I am glad that the minister is nodding, because I did not want to hear once again in a debate that we have school sport co-ordinators. I am glad that we have them, but they <place-holder colnum=\"3186\"/> were meant to co-ordinate something that was already there; they were not meant to be coaches, teachers and sport developers.</p><p>If the minister wants to add to the welcome announcement that he made about the sport alliance, I suggest that he looks at the example that was set by the British Airports Authority youth games, which were held in Edinburgh at the weekend. I attended them and I was absolutely knocked out by how good they were. The games involved parents, coaching to a high standard, organisation and hundreds of active children. By the way&#8212;I am sure that Murdo Fraser will be pleased to hear this&#8212;all those children understood competition and understood that competition is a part of growing up that allows them to learn to win and to lose, and to learn to do both with equal grace.</p><p>Further to the idea of the sport alliance, it might be a good idea for the minister to set a target for the sport co-ordination strategy to look forward to an all-Scotland youth games for all Scotland's young people. That would be a target and an innovation. That is why I will probably support the motion, because it talks about innovation.</p>", "hdate": "2001-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13258715", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sports Promotion in Schools"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If members will indulge me, I will conduct a wee exercise of my own so that we do not just preach without practice.

Is it just another figment of my imagination?</p><p>I also want to correct the misapprehension about inflation in the building industry in Edinburgh which, once again, the motion rests on. The motion claims that inflation is 16 per cent. Last night, we heard from the progress group, which estimates that inflation of 16 per cent has been built into the contracts that have been let and that are about to be let. Because only British indices for inflation exist, it is difficult to get a figure specifically for Edinburgh, but according to the Halifax house price survey, we should allow for 8.5 per cent inflation for house building in Edinburgh. That is half of what is being claimed. I suggest to the progress group that if it had a professional manager running the project, he might tell them that contractors sometimes&#8212;only sometimes&#8212;add in a little bit to cover contingencies. Perhaps that is why we estimate inflation to be twice the rate that everybody else who is building in Edinburgh just now is working to.</p><p>I said that I would not take any more time, Presiding Officer, but I sincerely hope that my friend and colleague Donald Gorrie will be given time.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255356", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holyrood Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, since you have already said that the time for the debate is limited, I will give a wee   piece of information and ask a question.

I am so overcome by the debate that I have forgotten his second name&#8212;[MEMBERS: \"Hamilton.\"] So it is&#8212;Duncan Hamilton. I must put that right. [ <em>Interruption.</em> ] Or perhaps I meant Duncan McNeil.</p><p>I imagine that the motion will be backed unanimously by the members who sat in the chamber and basked in the warm glow of the words of President Mbeki, when he congratulated the people of Scotland on their contribution to his nation's struggle for democracy and freedom. That sits ill with the denigration of Scottishness and Scottish nationhood that we have heard from some members this morning. However, in the brief time I have available, I would prefer to ponder what Scotland's contribution to the world should be.</p><p>When we talk about Scotland's place in the world&#8212;or in the EU&#8212;we should focus not simply on what we can get, but on what we can give. We <place-holder colnum=\"1797\"/> have a great deal to contribute as individuals and as a distinct nation. I want to focus on the opportunity and responsibility that that implies for our ability to influence the future political and social development of the EU. I must take issue with what Keith Raffan said&#8212;I am sorry that I cannot give way to him on this point&#8212;about our ability to exert influence through the Committee of the Regions. The EU is based on an international treaty; treaties are brokered between power-brokers. The issue will always centre on the exercise of power; although it might sometimes be about an agreement to share power, it always centres on power. A delegate body such as the Committee of the Regions will never exercise that power, which is why regionalism is not enough.</p><p>We should aspire to the sovereign status that allowed Irish voters to have a referendum on the treaty of Nice. Through such a mechanism, people in all EU member states have been encouraged to challenge the anti-democratic, centralised policy making and future planning of the EU by EU leaders such as Chancellor Schroeder, President Prodi and Wim Kok.</p><p>It might be a little late, but democrats across all EU countries are beginning to wake up to the dangers of using a eurodiktat to forbid finance ministers of the member states to do what Charlie McCreevy has just done in Dublin. The Irish finance minister defied the instructions from Frankfurt and Brussels and kept Ireland's taxes at the levels he judged would mean that other countries in the eurozone would not experience inflation. He has been proved right and the Irish are still good Europeans; their democracy is stronger than ours because he exercised that democratic right on their behalf. Good Europeans will welcome Ireland's spirit of independence and action. People who mouth euroslogans miss the point and jeopardise the spirit of Europeanism, as more and more European citizens judge the EU to be just another powerless playground for politicians.</p><p>I am disappointed that David McLetchie thought that it is better to be a big gun in Europe. Bigness is not necessarily a sign of strength, as I am sure he will recognise with the small number of folk he has behind him. No one should imagine that the antithesis of global corporations is a situation in which states can get together to do away with the individuality and awkwardness that allowed Ireland to do what she has done. She has lit a beacon of democracy for the rest of Europe and I will be ashamed if the chamber does not implicitly endorse what Ireland has done by endorsing the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13254988", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Place in the World"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Contrary to the expectations of my dear colleague Duncan Macmillan&#8212;[ Interruption. ] That is not right.

I am not referring only to universal jurisdiction, which has taken up most of this morning's debate: there are many more areas of detail that need to be considered at stage 2.</p><p>Several members have suggested that we are in a pickle tackling the huge concept behind this important piece of legislation. We are squeezed for time because we must march in step with the UK legislation. Well, why? Is it not more important to get it right than to get it at the right time? I know that there is a desire to be among the first 60 signatories to the statute, but we will probably manage that anyway without too much trouble. It is much more important that we get it right, rather than at the right time. We are altogether far too mindful of Robin Cook's late signing and decision to bring a bill into the Westminster system. We should determine our own timetable, which should be conditioned by doing things to the best possible standard in producing legislation, particularly legislation that will take part of Scotland into the international arena. We should not short-change ourselves or our legislation.</p><p>It is pretty obvious from what the minister said this morning that the absence of universal jurisdiction from the Scottish bill is entirely due to the fact that it is not in the UK legislation. We must ask why it is not in the UK legislation, because many of the countries whose legal systems and societies the UK has influenced have adopted that principle without any problem at all.</p><p>Many of our new partners in the European Union have adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction. Why have we not? Could that indicate a parallel with what Roseanna Cunningham suggested might underlie the United States' decision not to sign up&#8212;if we no longer have victor's justice, but have the concept of victim's justice in international law, a number of people could be called to account, such as Henry Kissinger for his policies in Cambodia?</p><p>We should not be too sniffy about this. People in the former Yugoslavia have been indicted under current international criminal law, but NATO has not. If the universal jurisdiction that we are asking for existed and there was equity in apportioning blame for acts that were outwith what we would consider the usual rules of warfare, NATO might well have been indicted for the type of bombing it undertook in Serbia.</p><p>The UK might have a vested interest in ensuring that there is not universal jurisdiction. Is that why the UK Government is fighting shy of it? Even if it is, we should not fight shy of it; that would be <place-holder colnum=\"1600\"/> wrong. We are trying to right the world's ills in this bill. We are trying to make justice equitable throughout the world, so our actions should be conditioned only by what would be the right thing to do. It is rather feeble for Jim Wallace&#8212;a man whom I admire in this field of activity&#8212;to say that universal jurisdiction would compromise the principles of Scots law. It would enhance the principles of Scottish justice. That is why we want to see it incorporated. I presume that that is why Alastair Duff from the Law Society of Scotland made it clear on page 76 of the Justice 2 Committee's report that lawyers such as him, who share with the Minister for Justice an appreciation of Scots law and a determination to protect it, believe that universal jurisdiction is \"a matter of policy\", which is for politicians to decide.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13254448", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Criminal Court (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to comment on what Bill Aitken said about the difficulties in the bill that remain to be ironed out.

After hearing John Home Robertson, I am sadly disappointed. I have heard what are now shibboleths repeated by Richard Simpson, a man whom I respect, who says that Queensberry House should be knocked down&#8212;that was the clear implication. It was vandalised after the project started. We should not allow such things to go unrecorded and unreported.</p><p>I used to believe that the Parliament had been misled inadvertently. Having heard John Home Robertson, I believe that it is no longer inadvertent; I believe that systematic deception is being practised on this Parliament by the people associated with the project team and I am prepared to back up that claim if anyone asks me to. If I am wrong, let those concerned come to the Parliament today with the true costs to which they are now working. I do not believe that they do not have a bottom-line figure.</p><p>I want to know whether it is true that we now expect to pay &#163;15 million for landscaping. If we are, where will the extra &#163;4 million come from? It will have to come from the health, education or local authority budget. We have a duty and a right&#8212;on behalf of the people who sent us here and who believed that we were going to spend &#163;195 million on the building&#8212;to find out how much <place-holder colnum=\"588\"/> more is to be spent.</p><p>Let me say to anyone who is interested in the facts that I have never, ever carped about the cost of the building; people can go through the records and will see that. What I have carped about are the aesthetics and the siting of the building and whether it represents value for money. The same is true today, which is why I will not support the Conservatives' motion, although I thank them for bringing it to the Parliament.</p><p>The rubicon of &#163;195 million has been passed; we cannot now go back on that. I may be the only person in the chamber who believes that the project need not become a hole in the ground. Michael Russell mentioned that and it is true that there is a history of that happening in Edinburgh. However, the same council that was responsible for such projects is now looking for a new place to roost. Perhaps the City of Edinburgh Council should try Holyrood; Eric Milligan said it was a great site. There are a number of uses to which the site could be put and many millions of pounds could be recouped from the sale of the MSP block, such as it now is.</p><p>A number of architects do not concede that we must go forward as planned rather than take another route. However, I accept that I have probably lost that proposition, so there are two things we must get straight today on behalf of the people who have sent us here: how much will the project now cost and does that represent value for money? When will we be told?</p><p>We must also establish the principle&#8212;perhaps the most important principle of all&#8212;that, if the Parliament votes for an amount of money to be spent on its behalf by a minister of the Parliament or a group appointed by the Parliament, that minister or group must come back to the Parliament, if they go above the budget, to explain why they have done so and to seek permission to go ahead. That is what the SNP amendment seeks to establish. I am thankful to see Labour members who agree with what I have just said. Members should support the amendment.</p><p>I accept that we are never going to agree on the aesthetics of the building. As far as I am concerned, it will ruin a very beautiful part of Edinburgh. We are never, ever going to hear the admission we should hear that misleading information was given to Parliament about the exact state of Enric Miralles's health. I do not expect ever to have an apology from where I ought to have one, to say that I was right in saying that the poor man would be unable to see his concept fulfilled and that anything following that would be a hotch-potch job.</p><p>It is nonsense to say that we have gone down the same route as the politicians in Australia who <place-holder colnum=\"589\"/> objected to Sydney Opera House. Sensible people realised that the architect was a signature architect who had been chosen for his vision and that, when he was no longer there to see the project through, that vision should perhaps be reassessed in the light of reality. We were misled.</p><p>As this is probably the last chance that I will have to say this, I urge the Parliament, please, to do away with the lies, to do away with the people who have given misleading information to the chamber and to demand to know what the budget now is.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13251577", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holyrood"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Tories for putting this motion on the agenda before the general election.

In no way does the motion touch on any of the points that Gordon Jackson addressed in his speech.</p><p>I am well aware of the view, as is everyone here, <place-holder colnum=\"268\"/> that the fear of crime is not warranted by the number of crimes that are reported and detected, but if as legislators we do not take on board the perceptions of members of the public to inform our policy making, we will not produce policies that reduce the number of crimes that make people afraid to go out at night in their own areas. This is where Gordon Jackson got it absolutely right. It may be possible to point to a Scottish figure and say, \"We have reduced it by 1 per cent\"&#8212;which is the number we are talking about for some of the statistics&#8212;but if people do not see a genuine reduction, they will not believe that anything is being done to fight crime or to make the place a better place to live in and they will lose faith in the system of justice and policing.</p><p>We should not be too haughty about the importance of public perception. It may be that people do not always get the right end of the statistical stick, but they know what it feels like to live in their areas, and they know whether they have the confidence to report petty crimes, which can make their lives a misery, to the local community policeman who they know is run off his feet, or to the policewoman who is stretched by trying to do her best in the community.</p><p>The SNP amendment recognises the contract of reciprocal trust and respect between lawmakers, keepers of public order, those who dispense justice and the ordinary people who live in Scotland. That is why I am happy to support the SNP amendment rather than to go wholeheartedly into the breach behind Gordon Jackson.</p><p>In all fairness, the Executive has given the impression of trying to meet the criteria for a successful criminal justice policy, as was outlined by Gordon Jackson. For example, in Edinburgh, the Executive gave additional funding to the police. I am tempted to damn the Minister for Justice with faint praise by thanking him&#8212;a wee bit, anyway&#8212;for handing over the money that has allowed Sir Roy Cameron to set up the city centre policing unit. Previously, he was denied the ring-fenced money for the police in Edinburgh to provide the sort of capital-city policing&#8212;proportionately&#8212;that is provided by the Metropolitan police in London. It is reassuring, not just for tourists, but for ordinary people in Edinburgh, to see the 22 officers, two sergeants and chief inspector in and about the city centre. That is excellent. Seeing them there, residents also know that policemen and policewomen have not been drawn off their normal day-to-day duties.</p><p>However, that is still not good enough, because it is possible to go up to the south side of the city, for example Morningside&#8212;I will not excuse myself for being parochial here; not after what Gordon Jackson said&#8212;and find that all the shops have been broken into. They are not in a social <place-holder colnum=\"269\"/> partnership area. They are not in an area of tremendous need; the area is not targeted for help; but the people are losing faith in the natural order of a pleasant part of the city in which to live. They need more police. It is as simple as that. Even though more money has gone into the police service, it is not enough to suit the genuine requirements of the people in that area. Although it is not an area of tremendous social deprivation, the people there are entitled to good policing and a feeling of security.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13250863", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with almost everything Gordon Jackson said, but far from persuading me to vote for this complacent little Executive motion, it confirmed my belief that the motion does nothing to reassure people who are afraid to leave their houses at night and who fear that their cars will be burgled.

The right noises have been made about providing money and a scheme of treatment for sufferers, but no one understands how many people are involved. At a seminar yesterday, Dr Toby Delahook from the University of Edinburgh's infectious diseases research unit explained that 1,200 people with the virus had been picked up in Edinburgh alone. As yet there is no screening, because we have not worked out how to implement a screening programme that would not make life impossible for the people who have the virus, which incubates for 10 to 15 years. People can get on with their lives without knowing that they have the disease, so it comes as an absolute bombshell to realise that they probably have inoperable liver damage. This is not the time or place to go into details; however, it is the time to acknowledge that hepatitis C is as much a priority as HIV was. As a result, I ask the minister to tell us in his summing-up what happened to the promised helpline for hepatitis C sufferers. As someone who managed the national AIDS helpline, I know the absolutely crucial part it played in supporting sufferers and ensuring that the pool of transmission was contained. Such containment should be part of any hepatitis C strategy.</p><p>As the two ministers with responsibility for health are local Edinburgh representatives, will they urgently consider using some of the money for <place-holder colnum=\"100\"/> drug action teams to ensure that Capital C&#8212;the support and counselling service for hepatitis C sufferers in Edinburgh&#8212;does not go out of existence because of lack of funding? It is a well-grounded and well-established service that desperately needs funding and, as far as I am aware, the money that was allocated to the drug action teams to combat the drug-related effects of infection has not all been spent.</p><p>I apologise for being a bit garbled, but I had a number of specific points to raise, and I hope that the minister will be able to answer them.</p>", "hdate": "2001-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13250364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hepatitis C"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I might return to the member after I make the following important point.

It is not that someone is taking over our law&#8212;we agreed that the treaty was a good thing and therefore we signed up to it. What has been said about making the ECHR more accessible to people in Scotland is both perfectly obvious and entirely reasonable, and I would have thought that that would be accepted throughout the chamber. The remarks from the Conservatives therefore came as a bit of a surprise, because, as far as I am concerned, so far, so good. I will mention a couple of exceptions to that comment later.</p><p>Like most members, I welcome the proposed change in the treatment of adult mandatory life prisoners, which the bill brings into line with the sentencing of designated life prisoners and is the correct way to go about sentencing. The Minister for Justice jumped before he was pushed, and I hope that he will complete his answer, now that he has started, to the question about the length of mandatory life sentences. He must be aware that strong voices will be raised in favour of allowing the punishment element of any future sentencing policy to be lengthened beyond the period during which a prisoner might hope to return to the community&#8212;that applies even to prisoners who have committed crimes that are judged most harshly by the public.</p><p>The Scottish Consortium on Crime and Criminal Justice reports that there is no evidence that tougher or longer sentences have a deterrent <place-holder colnum=\"754\"/> effect on serious crime. We must examine the effect of any changes on deterrence, as that is what the public is interested in. It is important that we stress that, in order to reassure the public. When the bill becomes law, there is no doubt that there will be media interest in how it will affect different categories of prisoner, or even individual prisoners. It is in everyone's interests to show that the bill does not soften the existing system of punishing murderers and the like. Rather, it introduces a more consistent and effective way of dealing with prisoners&#8212;both as individuals and as members of the prison community&#8212;that is much more likely to produce the sort of regime that will make our prisons more satisfactory places.</p><p>I could not agree more with Maureen Macmillan's comments on the proposed changes to how information is relayed to victims. The victims of crime should be informed, after sentence has been handed down, about when release will be considered. However, after that, the onus should be on the victims to seek further information should they wish or require to.</p><p>It is absolutely excellent that Jim Wallace is prepared to do what Jack Straw&#8212;who is being pulled by his back teeth by the more liberal consensus north of the border&#8212;is not. Far from the Parliament and Scots law being subservient to UK law, I suggest that by taking the approach that is proposed in the bill, we may be showing the way forward for UK law and taking a properly responsible role in building international law.</p><p>The task of making sentencing policy must be removed&#8212;and be seen to be removed&#8212;from ministers. Such policy must be left to an independent parole board. I urge the minister to take note of the evidence of the Law Society of Scotland to the Justice 1 Committee. The number of members of the Parole Board must rise and more resources must be allocated to the board, as my colleague Roseanna Cunningham pointed out.</p><p>To distance the Executive further from the day-to-day operation of compliance with the ECHR, an independent human rights commission seems to be the best way of ensuring that justice is seen to be done. We had much debate about the bill's provisions on subordinate legislation and about how the remedial orders are envisaged and would be introduced.

It sets an excellent precedent for dealings in the Parliament, which will probably contrast unhappily with the dodgy deals that we are likely to see later today. However, I would like to probe the laudable sentiments. I endorse what Gordon Jackson said about the clarity of the intention behind the draft bill. I hope that when the minister sums up he will answer some of the questions.</p><p>I would like to test a couple of issues that I have come across when representing people who have approached me and who were perfectly entitled to seek clarification. The first case probably falls within the qualified class exemptions to which sections 30 and 31 relate. According to my reading of those sections, the information that is collected by an enforcing authority during routine inspections would also be exempt, even if no offence had been detected or a decision not to prosecute had been taken.</p><p>The first case concerns a gentleman from Edinburgh who approached me in October 1999 about interceptions that he suspected had taken place in the previous year of regular telephone calls between him and his girlfriend in Ireland. I wrote to Jack Straw on 7 December 1999, 2 February 2000 and 24 May 2000 to ask for information. None of those letters was acknowledged. I changed tack and approached our own Minister for Justice, who I admit replied to me, although it took him a long time. I will be interested to hear how we will improve the culture of information, never mind secrecy. The minister directed me to the Interception of Communications Tribunal. We sent out the required forms on 30 September 2000. As of today, I still await an answer, as does the person who contacted me. That is not good enough. I want to know how our freedom of information bill will better serve that member of the Scottish public. He is entitled to know why letters went unanswered and why the <place-holder colnum=\"566\"/> staff to whom we spoke by telephone were unhelpful.</p><p>Is there a conflict of interest between Westminster's Freedom of Information Act 2000 and our draft bill? What legitimacy do we have? What legitimacy do I have in representing the person who approached me with what I consider a reasonable request for information? Gordon Jackson said that he thought that the clear statement of intent at the start of the draft bill would make it difficult for public authorities to deny information, but will it make it as difficult for an authority that is under Westminster's control? We are dealing with the security services. What will be the information commissioner's role vis-&#224;-vis the security services and the exempt cases at Westminster?</p><p>My second case concerns the information that is freely available about a Government or Parliament project. I will use the Holyrood project as an example&#8212;I am sure that that will surprise a few people. I want to test whether the aspirations of the bill, the minister and all those present for the debate measure up to discovering what we and other Scots should know about the Holyrood building. Will the bill place any requirement on the policy makers who decided where to site the Parliament building to explain their reasons? Are no minutes of their meetings open for inspection on request? That is not just to satisfy a nosey-parker member of the Parliament. Such information is part of our history and the legacy that we will hand on to future generations in Scotland.</p><p>We need such information to take a balanced view about whether we have the Parliament that we say we want&#8212;the Parliament that we deserve and that Scots were told to expect. I presume that that information is contained in minutes of committees. Will the bill allow us to see them or will we have to go to the Scottish Parliament's visitor centre? There, interactive displays are to help us to understand the who, why and how of the Parliament today. I have tried to do that ever since I entered the Parliament, and so far my efforts have been thwarted.</p><p>I will judge the draft bill's effectiveness&#8212;not its intentions&#8212;by its ability to deal with the two test cases that I outlined.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20158266", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freedom of Information"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like my colleagues, I welcome the draft bill.

Up to now, it <place-holder colnum=\"846\"/> has been about the Scottish Executive's programme for government. I would like to consider the responsibilities of government in general.</p><p>Before I do, I will pay tribute to the First Minister. I applaud&#8212;as will everyone in the chamber, I think&#8212;his personal commitment to social justice. I sense that he really means it. That is excellent, and quite different from what we hear in some of the speeches from another Parliament. However, although not exactly boasting, he spoke about the richness of the talent to be found among young people in Scotland and said that he wanted them to make a contribution. So do I&#8212;but not only in Scotland. It is not enough to say that each of them will have access to the internet. The idea of contributing internationally is much bigger and wider than that, as I will explain later.</p><p>I freely concede that the Executive's plans in some areas might well improve some of the services and facilities for which the Executive has ultimate responsibility. However, it is not enough for this Parliament to be judged to have fulfilled the normal expectations of a Parliament. People look for much more than that. Although Hugh Henry said that, as a former local government leader, he would have given his right arm for some of the settlements that local government has now received from the Executive, it is not carping of the SNP and other Opposition parties to say that that is not good enough.</p><p>Last night, I was in the company of people who are described as handicapped or physically disabled. They were marvellous young people, and much of that is down to the fact that they go to a particular club. That club is due to run out of funds on 31 March. If that happens, it will be a stain not just on local government in Edinburgh but on the Executive for not being able to provide the support to develop the talents that the First Minister talked about. I do not mean to carp, but where there are shortfalls we are, as Donald Gorrie said, entitled to comment on them.</p><p>I said that I wanted to widen the debate. I believe that Parliaments are supposed to exercise rights and responsibilities. In negotiating with teachers, Jack McConnell has rights and responsibilities. Devolution has given him responsibility for the Scottish education system. In another defining area of our society, Jim Wallace and the Scottish law officers have rights and responsibilities&#8212;looking after the system within our boundaries. However, because the system stops at the border, it is constrained. In the past few months, we have seen that Scottish justice will stand up to international scrutiny. Just like Scotland's children, it has much to contribute to the world. We have much to contribute to the development of international justice and to the <place-holder colnum=\"847\"/> improvement of civil rights for all people. We should not do that through the prism of Westminster. If we have the right to have our own legal system, we have the responsibility for ensuring that it contributes to the development of legal systems in the world. We have that responsibility and the aim is achievable and reasonable, as has been demonstrated at Camp Zeist.</p><p>I believe that the Executive and Parliament should seek to exercise that responsibility on behalf of the people whom we represent. The exercise of such a responsibility will make us all grow. It will make our aspirations higher. We will benefit more people&#8212;and not just here in Scotland. If we think small, we will do small things. We must think a lot bigger. If we have our own criminal justice system, and if it is seen throughout the world to be a sound system, let it interact directly with the other systems of the world.</p><p>I urge the Scottish Executive to embrace as part of its programme for government all the aspirations, responsibilities and rights of government. Do not cut us off from global developments in any area of human activity, as will happen if we think small.

But we have a legal system, so I do not take the minister's attitude that the situation is anomalous, and that we should just allow Westminster&#8212;which has the political system and the right to sign an international treaty&#8212;to pass the legislation that is required for our legal system to interact with other international legal systems.

That is where I stand today. If Scotland has a voice in Europe, I do not see why it should be submerged by Europe. David McLetchie suggested that that was what the SNP wanted. He is so wrong. The SNP wants Scotland to be up-front, visible and equal in Europe, not submerged. That is why we cannot support any of the rubbish in the Labour party's amendment.</p><p>I want to take Mr McConnell to task. I understood that he could not give way during his speech because of the time limit, but he gave the impression that he wanted the chamber to do the job of the Confederation of British Industry and pave the way for business in Poland and similar places. I have no doubt that, with his background, Mr McConnell would be a great addition to the general effort in building up economic and trade links throughout Europe.

I attended a conference in Maastricht recently&#8212;unfortunately it was not an intergovernmental conference&#8212;that the eminent Professor Guenther Schaefer addressed. I see Ben Wallace smiling at the memory of that. The professor said that we were headed for a federal Europe and that we&#8212;including members in the chamber&#8212;should not kid ourselves that the European Committee of the Regions had any power. He said that it was the least effective of all the European institutions. I wonder whether that is why that committee is not mentioned in Labour's amendment.

Perhaps the difference between Scotland and Finland is that PE is compulsory between the ages of seven and 17 in Finland.

I have been trying unsuccessfully to raise the matter with the Home Secretary since last December; I have written three or four letters that have gone unanswered.

I am bringing living proof of the validity of Donald Gorrie's demand that we keep an eye on what is happening in the Home Office, because my experience of trying to act from this Parliament on behalf of a constituent has certainly not been productive.</p><p>Mr Munro contacted me to see whether I could help him discover whether his personal phone calls to a friend in Ireland had been intercepted during the period April 1996 to December 1998. It is known that the British security services eavesdropped electronically on calls from the UK to the Republic of Ireland during that period.</p><p>Mr Munro has no police record, nor has he ever been connected with any terrorist organisation. His calls were of a more personal nature and of no concern to anyone other than the person to whom he was speaking in Ireland. His simple and entirely reasonable request is that he should know whether his calls were spied on, by whom, and for what reason; he would also like to know whether a record was kept of his private conversations, by whom, and for how long that record would be kept.<place-holder colnum=\"279\"/></p><p>During the period when Mr Munro suspects his calls were intercepted, the technology used in Capenhurst Tower in Cheshire to monitor calls between the UK and Ireland&#8212;until 1997&#8212;involved calls being selected and codified, and listened to specifically by the intelligence services. That is well recorded. Unfortunately, I discovered that information, at Mr Munro's behest, not through replies from the Home Office to my written requests for information, but from answers to parliamentary questions to the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, following an investigation that was shown on television on Channel 4.</p><p>One of the weaknesses of the intended legislation, as far as I can tell, is that if people are going to discover something, they will discover it by accident or through a leak; that is perhaps true of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Bill, but certainly true of the UK legislation. That is not at all satisfactory. When new legislation is being drawn up, we can be a bit more precise about how people can monitor their individual human and civil liberties.</p><p>The nub of the objections to the new scheme for interception and surveillance is that Mr Munro would not have known anything about the infringement of his personal liberty unless there had been open questions and answers in the Dail and excellent investigative journalism into Capenhurst Tower by Duncan Campbell. Nobody dropped Mr Munro a wee card to let him know that he was off the hook. He was not told that his calls had been intercepted as a matter of routine security, or that they had either been kept on record or not and that he should now count himself out.

I will try to be brief. Rather than simply giving my own point of view, I would prefer to show the breadth of support that there is for the continued mutuality of Standard Life.</p><p>I should declare an interest. No, I am not a with-profits policyholder. I am not even a without-profits policyholder. However, I do live in Edinburgh, and so have a real interest in ensuring that Standard Life continues to be, in a practical sense, a very important part of the economy of Edinburgh. Europe's biggest mutual life assurance company provides 7,500 secure and satisfying jobs. That is to say nothing of the spending power that comes into this area from the &#163;160 million it pays in wages. We should think of the local companies that are involved with Standard Life because of its local purchasing power.</p><p>I support the ethos and humanity that is implicit in Standard Life continuing as a company that puts the best interests of its policyholders first, rather than the demands of shareholders. I am a nationalist who believes that Scotland will achieve its full potential as a distinctive community of people in Europe and the wider world only if we aspire to the quality standards of the world's best in business, inventiveness and administration in public and private enterprises. We should also take the greatest amount of responsibility possible <place-holder colnum=\"93\"/> for the effects of our decisions on future generations.</p><p>By and large, those sentiments are echoed in the way in which Standard Life goes about its business. Mutuality eschews the quick buck in favour of handing the benefits of the accumulated savings down the generations. It is to the credit of the 6,000 employees of the company who presented the Parliament with a petition that they are determined to resist&#8212;on behalf of their company, their community and all Standard Life's policyholders&#8212;the quick buck, quick fix and gold that Freddie Woollard has been suggesting. I do not intend to refer to that gentleman any further, because I have a feeling that he is a star that has shone briefly and brightly and, perhaps, is waning even now.</p><p>I also salute the management of Standard Life, although it is an open secret that they have not always made common cause with the point of view that I represent. However, as the anthem reminds us, those days are past now and we are all in it together. It is in everyone's interest that Standard Life should continue to exist as it does. I salute the management's fight to keep the company mutual. They could make a lot of fast bucks for themselves if they decided to follow the plc route of Freddie Woollard.</p><p>I will turn to the business case. In the endowments and pensions that it guarantees to its policyholders, Standard Life stands comparison with any of its publicly quoted, shareholder-owned competitors. Time is short, so I will resist rhyming off the figures with which I am by now very familiar. However, I will advise policyholders who have to vote on the demutualisation proposal to consult pages 6 and 7 in the booklet \"The real facts and figures about your future\", which is published by Standard Life.</p><p>In explaining why, as a nationalist, I can make common cause with an excellent example of a capitalist Scottish enterprise&#8212;as it is seen as part of the Scottish financial establishment&#8212;I have referred to the need for inventiveness as well as entrepreneurial ability. We need to be all that we can be and maybe even half as good as we sometimes kid ourselves that we are. I am aware that some people think that Standard Life is not as inventive or adventurous as it might be in its investment policies. Perhaps a dash less considered calculation and a soup&#231;on more flair might have realised an even bigger and better yield for its policyholders. There may be some truth in that assessment&#8212;there is always room for debate&#8212;but the company has the time, expertise and assets to live a bit more dangerously in today's global economy, if the policyholders urge the board to do so. Part of the whole exercise will be that the board will be acutely aware of the <place-holder colnum=\"94\"/> policyholders and their point of view.</p><p>Having said that, we should not forget how successful that board has been through the recent years of demutualisations, mergers, alliances and what have you, which have taken place in the shareholding sector of life assurers. Standard Life is not a company that needs an injection of cash, either to expand or to stand still. Thanks to the prudence of the management, its high standing in the estimation of the independent financial advisers and without the need to pay dividends to shareholders, Standard Life is a very viable company. Why should anyone, other than an opportunistic carpetbagger, want to risk upsetting the apple-cart?</p><p>Lots of people I have spoken to in and around Edinburgh have said that nobody is going to pass up the chance of a quick buck. I hope that other speakers will have the time to dissect some of the more hopeful calculations as to what policyholders might expect. I will just mention in passing what they might not expect should they vote against Standard Life's continued mutuality. For example, if the company becomes a plc, and is just as well managed as its competitors&#8212;as it is just now&#8212;everything being equal, there is a strong argument that policyholders will have to invest 10 per cent more in order to reap the same rewards as they do now. If they go for the windfall, if they go for the fast buck, sure, it is attractive if they have the bathroom to do up, but five years down the road, if they have a big roof repair and they have to take out another policy, or if they have to increase their present policy, they will have to pay 10 per cent more for it. That is the other side of demutualisation.</p><p>The ethos of mutuality is admirable. Standard Life is the sort of company that bestows an admirable reputation on Scottish business. Therefore, as the representatives of Scotland in this Parliament, we should promote and cherish it. At a time when the future pattern of investment is uncertain because of e-commerce and other new factors, which I will leave others to rehearse, it would be folly to destabilise a company such as Standard Life in pursuit of a one-off windfall. Even the most enthusiastic demutualiser must recognise the risk of diminishing the excellent performance of the company during a time of turbulence in investment patterns throughout the global economy.</p><p>Demutualisation is probably a bad idea. I am certain that it is one whose time has not come. I urge members to fall in behind this motion and give support to the notion of Standard Life remaining a mutual company.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13230178", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Standard Life"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to thank all members from all sides of the chamber who have offered their support for this motion, both by signing it and by staying for tonight's debate.

If he had been in my class, I would have chosen him first and he would have had a completely different attitude to sport.</p><p>Mr Mundell went on to be a bit skeich about synchronised swimming. As a wee girl I was so desperate to get into the Hamilton baths synchronised swimming team that I lied about my age. I have since changed that bad habit. When Cathy Jamieson spoke about the Cumnock outdoor pool a few folk tittered. I mind going there from Hamilton as a wee girl for inter-club galas. Sport never did me any harm; it made sure I did not get into trouble. It was only when I took up politics that trouble started.</p><p>I endorse the sentiments expressed in the debate. Although there are amendments to the motion, it is generally agreed that sport is an essential component of getting people&#8212;particularly poorer and older people&#8212;out of their houses and into the community, and that is what matters. I want to address how we might do that and change the culture that Ian Jenkins referred to. It is great to wear a football shirt that identifies a person with Man United or whoever, but when young people are sitting watching television or some other screen, it is not so great. Young people used to spend hours playing heidie against a wall or out in the garden or the street learning how to trap a ball properly. That does not happen <place-holder colnum=\"385\"/> any more and it should.</p><p>I make a particular plea for the sort of people who, contrary to David Mundell's experience, can inspire and help people to reach the levels of attainment and fitness that they have to have to properly take part in sport and enjoy it. People only really enjoy sport if they do not always get gubbed. Ian Jenkins would have liked golf better if Lord James hadnae beaten him thon long time ago. We need more specialist PE teachers in schools and particularly in primary schools. I am sorry that the Minister for Children and Education is not here to hear me say, yet again, that unless we catch children young, we will not change the culture of watching rather than taking part in sport.</p><p>I realise that this is a devolved Parliament and that we cannot spend all the money we might want to. I have ideas for that too, but I will not go into them just now. We could shift some of the education spending to specialist PE teachers coaching in schools and incorporate them into the sort of scheme that Fitness Scotland could introduce to train people in communities to be coaches and community sports leader. That would also start to redress the balance in terms of classroom assistants. Primary teachers do not have the time, nor do most of them have the motivation or the skill to coach and teach PE.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13227130", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I endorse what Cathy Jamieson has just said and will come back to that, but I must deal first with the terrible trauma revealed from the Tory front bench.

When we talk about studies on developing the Parliament's site, we are not talking about the temporary campus of this building and those across the road at George IV Bridge. We are talking about developing an area of land that reaches from Mylne's Court right up to Ramsay Lane. I believe that that site would be feasible, and we have time to consider whether it would provide a suitable Parliament at better value for money. Certainly, many people in Edinburgh think that it might.</p><p>For around &#163;20,000, we could obtain an immediate feasibility study, and if the site were not feasible, I would be the first to say, \"Walk away from it\". I think that we owe that to the people who are questioning what is happening to the project, its operation and the Holyrood design. We owe it to them to say that there may well be alternatives, and that we have considered them. Even people who are absolutely enamoured of the design envisaged for Holyrood would be in a much stronger position if they could say to people in Scotland that they have considered the alternatives and still recommend Holyrood.</p><p>I appreciate that many members think that we should just go ahead with Holyrood, because it makes a statement about Scotland. Well, it sure does&#8212;we thought big and we built small on too small a site. I take issue with those who say that John Spencely said that there was nothing wrong with the site, because he said that this had nothing to do with the location of the site. We should not forget that he was not asked to consider the traffic implications and so on, nor did he comment on the size of the site, which is an issue that Donald Gorrie and I raised during the debate last year. We asked whether the Parliament would be able to expand on that site once it got into its stride. Yesterday, at the presentation, I asked the architects what room for expansion was still possible. I was told, \"Perhaps 2,000 sq m.\" When I asked, \"Where?\", I was told, \"On the tower\".</p><p>The First Minister spoke&#8212;quite movingly, I thought, as someone who now lives in Edinburgh&#8212;of the beautiful sweep of the architecture in total harmony with the natural development that has occurred over millions of years in that part of Edinburgh. However, the tower&#8212;it is no longer an upturned boat, but a tower&#8212;is higher than Queensberry House. According to the model that we saw yesterday, it is higher even than the new hotel that stands behind <place-holder colnum=\"1346\"/> what is envisaged as the MSPs' block. That goes against the grain for most of the people who think that Edinburgh should develop as a historic site and a place of architectural beauty and excellence.</p><p>Se&#241;or Miralles's design has much to commend it, and I do not deny that. However, I question whether that is the best site for it in Edinburgh. In Edinburgh, the people who have written to me stop me in the street and say, \"Dinnae put it there.\" They know fine that it is the last place in Edinburgh to put the Parliament. I do not know where the first place should be, but we now have a natural hiatus in which work can continue on the MSPs' block&#8212;and on the repairs to Queensberry House&#8212;while we look at the alternative sites, to report back to the people of Scotland by 8 June, in line with the time scale that was outlined by John Spencely. If Se&#241;or Miralles is ill, that gives us another week or two to play with&#8212;that was something else that we learned in the course of this debate.</p><p>I appreciate what the other amendment seeks to do: it seeks to cap expenditure. People in Scotland cannot understand how we can start out with a proposed cost of &#163;50 million and end up with a proposed cost of &#163;200 million. However, I do not believe that a project of this sort can be capped. The First Minister told me that the SPCB does not believe in fixed contracts, but it has virtually tied itself into a fixed contract if it accepts that amendment. The target is &#163;195 million, but what happens if the building does not reach the roof when the money runs out, because the designer is ill and cannot meet the targets that the SPCB has set for him? That amendment is all too restrictive.</p><p>Our amendment is not restrictive. We must get this right; if we get it wrong, the whole Parliament will be diminished in the view of the people who wrote these letters to me.

I am glad that he said it, because my first thought, on reading the terms of today's motion, was, \"Why?\" It is not exactly what could be called a crowd puller&#8212;it is more like a time filler. It is a tribute to some of the folk in here today that we have managed to talk some sense, based on a nonsensical motion. It was a wee bit like ministerial motherhood and electronic apple pie.</p><p>Much of what we have come to call the knowledge economy is cloaked in an impenetrable, obscure language. We talk about social inclusion&#8212;this makes people feel right outside the loop. Let us try to use language that people can relate to their everyday lives.</p><p>I interpret the knowledge economy as meaning that most of the big money in the international market is now to be made from the sale of software designed to carry out or assist almost any traditional manufacturing or service work imaginable, rather than the construction of manufactured things, even if they are computers and telephones. So, we had better do everything we can through our various education channels to encourage Scots to use new technology. As others over here have said before me: dead obvious.</p><p>As some of us used to say, what about the workers? What about the people who do not sit in front of a computer screen designing a software package for a medium-sized chain store group's stock control? What about the people whose part in the knowledge economy is to use the software <place-holder colnum=\"882\"/> package to order the goods from whoever makes them, to stock the warehouse, to deliver the goods to the shop, to stock the shelves, to attract the customers and to sell the goods? Where do they fit into the knowledge economy?</p><p>Lothian is perhaps the most successful part of the Scottish economy. People who work here can earn enough money to spend in the shops, the restaurants and so on, that make this a terrific city to live in. However, in the main they are not software designers. They work in shops, restaurants and small factories. They work in the caring services and the bureaucracies that glue a modern society together. How do we apply the precepts of the knowledge economy to how those people do their jobs?</p><p>As a result of innovations in applied medical knowledge, people who work at normal jobs now live longer. That in itself produces the potential for economic growth&#8212;they need more, therefore they consume more. However, they also need more medical and support services in their old age. How do we ensure that the profit from all that knowledge and the economic growth that it produces is not consumed by the cost of looking after elderly people?</p><p>That is where the knowledge economy begins to mean something to the people it is meant to serve: the workers. A motion such as this tends to obscure the simple truth that economic systems, and even task forces like the ones set up by the minister, are meant to serve human needs. They are not meant to bend people's lives to suit the marketplace. I was surprised to hear my colleague, Allan Wilson, say that we have to bend our skills to the needs of the economy. We must suit our skills to the needs of the economy&#8212;people's skills should not be bent to capitalist means.</p><p>This morning, the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee heard evidence from Dr Andrew Goudie, who discussed the units of civil servants who are employed to stimulate the knowledge economy. He did not tell us what the measurement of their success would be. He did not say when we will know whether those units have stimulated the knowledge economy.</p><p>David Mundell referred to the lack of clarity. I could not agree more. The knowledge economy means something only if it is part of an attitude and a programme for lifelong learning&#8212;another misunderstood catchphrase. Lifelong learning is not just about having our technical colleges and senior schools able to adapt their teaching programmes at the drop of a hat to provide a training course for people made redundant from businesses such as Continental Tyres. I can see Nick Johnston being upset about that. Lifelong learning is about much more than that. It is about <place-holder colnum=\"883\"/> encouraging people to learn things, using new technology and old technology, such as libraries, books and teachers. That is how the economy will prosper. That is how the shop workers, the taxi drivers and the city guides in Edinburgh will have learned how to make visiting Scotland a great experience.</p><p>I have one last point to make, with the workers in mind.

I am almost tempted to follow Richard Simpson's line and say that I would like to vote both for the Executive's motion and for my party's amendment. However, I am slightly concerned that, although tribute has been paid to the huge amount of voluntary agencies and drug action teams and so on, we are in danger&#8212;unless we start rationalising fundamentally&#8212;of creating a drugs-solving industry, similar to the poverty industry that we have been accused of having. For that reason, I reserve judgment on the Executive's motion until I hear more about how the new bodies will operate.</p><p>What are the enormous financial and social resources tackling? Are we attempting to completely eradicate the use of drugs, including stimulants, opiates, tranquillisers, analgesics, nicotine, tobacco, cannabis, ecstasy, heroin and cocaine? Or does our approach to drug use uneasily acknowledge that drugs of some sort are used and abused by every society in the world? Today's debate seems to suggest the latter to be the case. Although much of what the minister said chimes with my thoughts on the matter, there was no definition of what was meant by the drug problem.</p><p>Keith Raffan, whose attention to the issue I respect, talked about a serious drug problem. How do we define that? Which drugs create a serious drug problem? Does a problem become serious only when crime is involved?</p><p>The Scottish National party's amendment acknowledges that the motion lacks definition. The amendment recognises that drug use and abuse is a multifaceted area for policy making. The minister described locally sensitive drugs strategies. Although nobody could disagree with the concept, we must ask how such a strategy would be operated in an area such as Lanarkshire. The drug action teams are under the aegis of the health board, which is not coterminous with the local authorities and the police authorities. How will the strategy work in a sensitive area when there is such a conflict in the boundaries of the agencies that are involved as well as a varying pattern of drug use?</p><p>When Lyndsay McIntosh made her presentation, <place-holder colnum=\"324\"/> she said that we should face up to our failures and be honest. When the minister talked about the audit process, it sounded as if that would happen. However, he also said that the Scotland Against Drugs campaign&#8212;which has no credibility with young people&#8212;would continue. I was one of the original people involved with Scotland Against Drugs. I set up Drugline. I am a former chair of the Scottish Drugs Forum. The relevance of many of the agencies that we have should be reconsidered&#8212;although the mapping exercise might turn out to be part of the drugs-solving industry.</p><p>We require a fundamental examination of which drugs are used, by whom and why. We need to know more about the medical and social effects of the different types of drug use. We have to do that before we commit resources to rehabilitation, detoxification and preventive programmes.</p><p>As legislators, we need to understand the effects of cannabis use as opposed to heroin use. We need to examine and evaluate more objectively and consistently the number of young people who are killed or whose lives are ruined by allergic reaction to ecstasy compared with addiction to alcohol, for example. Most important, because of the criminality inherent in the drugs business and young people's disrespect for the laws governing drug use, the Parliament must demonstrate its relevance to young people before it can hope to have more influence over the use and misuse of drugs than the siren voices of pals and pushers. Incidentally, we should remember that pals can be pushers as well as users.</p><p>We need a commission. I promise that I will back Richard Simpson's motion if he will sign my motion for the establishment of a commission on cannabis.

Similarly, the camp followers of the Blair crusade to do it the third way are wrong and arrogant to assume that they can claim leadership of the EU.</p><p>It is true that the Tories can claim some leadership. Mrs Thatcher, along with Mitterrand and Kohl, developed the single market. I know that the Tories will not thank me for reminding them of that, but she did, and they have to live with the consequences. Roy Jenkins went native in Brussels, when he was president of the Commission, and the Labour party went in a huff. I remember the opt-outs from the socialist manifestos for the European parliamentary elections in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>I wonder whether Donald Dewar, as an old Jenkinsite, will thank me for asking whether he considers that record strong enough for the Executive to claim the right to lead the European Union. What does he think of the fact that the EU is moving ahead to consolidate its political development, now that the penultimate stage of its economic development&#8212;the euro&#8212;is in place, without the superior leadership qualities of the British Government?</p><p>The motion shows that although the Brits may have lost an empire, they have still not found a role big enough for their delusions of grandeur. It would be much better for the people who live in Scotland, and in England for that matter, to be represented in Europe by Governments without delusions of grandeur, which would approach the EU nations in a spirit of equality and fraternity. <place-holder colnum=\"461\"/></p><p>That would be unlike our own dear, gifted and sensitive Foreign Secretary, who urged people in Scotland to stick with the leadership and power of Britain in Europe, as a region, rather than join the smaller nations which&#8212;according to him&#8212;have no clout in the EU. Today, even Donald Dewar, a sensitive man who has visited Europe loads of times, stated that we would be leaving the strength of the big player behind us in going out on our own.</p><p>We would not be going out on our own&#8212;we would be joining the other small nations of Europe. Perhaps when he sums up, the Deputy First Minister can tell us which small countries do not have the clout that Donald Dewar and Robin Cook want us to have. Is it Ireland, is it Finland, which currently has the presidency of the EU, or is it some of the applicant nations?

The First Minister should not get too worried, as I will not make independence the sole template for judging the memorandum. However, I will take advice from Des McNulty and take note of the fact that underlying the memorandum and the concordats is a fundamental set of principles. I hope, therefore, that I will be excused for addressing some of those principles.</p><p>I refer first to the vision of the consultative steering group, set out in its report, \"Shaping Scotland's Parliament\". It states that the Parliament<place-holder colnum=\"1135\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"should adopt procedures and practices that people will understand, that will engage their interest, and that will encourage them to obtain information and to exchange views.\"</p><p>I refer also to what appeared to be the First Minister's vision for this Parliament: that it should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"find just the right solutions to Scotland's problems\".</p><p>I had hoped that we would set our sights a little higher than that.</p><p>The CSG report goes on to record the cynicism about and disillusionment with the democratic process&#8212;with which all of us are becoming increasingly familiar. It urges that this Parliament</p><p class=\"indent\">\"should set itself the highest standards\"</p><p>and states that its intention is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to achieve a Parliament whose elected Members the Scottish people will trust and respect, and a Parliament with which they will want to engage.\"</p><p>Let us consider the matters on which people want to engage with the Parliament. They do not place artificial boundaries on how their humanity should be practised and expressed by this Parliament, or on how their international responsibilities should be enacted.</p><p>The objectives of the CSG report are laudable, although I might quibble a wee bit with the narrow nationalism of the implication that this Parliament should seek the trust and respect only of the Scottish people. I want us to have the trust and respect of people outwith Scotland as well. However, it was still quite a good start.</p><p>We cannot meet the report's objectives if we adopt the spirit and letter of these concordats. They place an artificial barrier on the views that are expressed and exchanged by Scots outside and through the Parliament about our relationship with the citizens of the EU and our wider citizenship of the world. We have a stake in those issues, and we should not be able only to talk about them&#8212;we should be able to act on our conclusions.</p><p>In the section dealing with how Scotland will engage with people and their Governments outwith Scotland, it is made perfectly clear that Scots will be able to lobby, as we can at present, but unable to act, even on matters that have direct, day-to-day relevance to affairs in Scotland.</p><p>At the next EU intergovernmental conference, for example, which is due to be held in a couple of years' time, the treaties will be reviewed. Further political integration and the expansion of EU membership will be on the table. Under the terms of the memorandum, this Parliament will be able to discuss with Euskadi&#8212;the Basque country&#8212;Bavaria and Wallonia what we think about those matters that impact directly on Scotland, such as <place-holder colnum=\"1136\"/> structural funds, fishing policy and employment policy.</p><p>However, when it comes to acting on the thoughts and priorities that we may evolve, either ourselves or with other Governments, we will have to lobby Westminster as usual, albeit through the joint ministerial committee. We will just have to hope that Westminster's thoughts and priorities are in tune with ours. That is not a situation calculated to re-engage the interest and energy of Scots in the democratic process. The principles underlying this document, as outlined by Des McNulty, have been undermined.</p><p>I will provide another, more sharply focused, instance of how the constraints of the document militate against engaging Scots with their Parliament. I believe that Pinochet came to Scotland once. Let us imagine that another Pinochet were to come here and the Spanish Government said that it would like him to be extradited.

It is not enough to prove to teachers that the Government values them. COSLA made the offer, but it is the Scottish Executive that will carry the can for the disappointment and bitterness that will result from this situation, which comes in the wake of a new Labour Prime Minister who promised so much for education and devolved so little power to the Scottish Executive.</p><p>I do not believe that Sam Galbraith wants to defend the indefensible offer that has been made, but he has been left with no choice. Murray Tosh eloquently described the bottleneck in career development, promotion and management that would arise in schools under the arrangement proposed by COSLA. Sam Galbraith knows that that can only damage children and education.</p><p>I believe that the minister also knows that the percentage increase in salary that he is offering, compared with that offered to other professions, is no motivation for young people to enter teaching. We need younger people in teaching for no other reason than to take up the slack that has been left by the experienced older teachers who are being forced out of the profession early because they cannot take any more.</p><p>We talked yesterday about the need for a highly educated, flexible work force. Where will that come from, without teachers? Without teachers, there is only ignorance. It is an insult to teachers to try to compare them with other professionals, as previous Conservative Governments did. With their partisan pecking order, those Governments are to blame for much of the disappointment that has been visited on the SJNC. The Conservative Government wanted to ensure that it paid policemen&#8212;it did no harm to policemen. It wanted to pay people in the armed services&#8212;it did no harm to them, either. However, teachers paid the price for that.</p><p>As a young teacher, more than 30 years ago, with my first pay packet I was able to buy my mother a three-piece suite. I know that it is anecdotal, but it happened. No young teacher leaving a training college or university now can walk into the Co-operative store, as I did, and put their money down to buy a suite. I am sorry if that sounds homespun, but a lot of teaching is homespun: that is how we have asked teachers to be over the past 30 years. As we have been cutting their status and their purchasing power relative to other professions, we have asked them to buttress the breakdown of the family unit. We <place-holder colnum=\"901\"/> have asked them to buttress the effects of horrible poverty in schools, amid the plenty that children see on television. We have asked teachers to make good all the gaps that have been left by the social changes of the past 30 years&#8212;and how have we rewarded them?</p><p>I regret, as I think that the minister is a decent man, that he is having to pursue a policy of further reducing the status of teachers. I will not repeat the arguments in favour of the diminution of career development paths, which is what that policy will do. I have a letter from someone who teaches in a school in Lothian, asking me whether I know of any comparable professional team that suffers the same percentage of nervous breakdowns during its work. Among teachers in that school, the figure has been 17 per cent over the past five years. That is what teaching is about.</p><p>If we value teachers, we will not take away the only protection that they have, which is the statutory role of the SJNC. That body has disappointed people&#8212;much of what Jamie Stone said was correct&#8212;but teachers know that they would lose a great deal if they lost the means to enforce the results of an objective review of their salaries and conditions. The representation of their interests would have only the status of a pay review board, and we know what Governments have done with the salary recommendations of pay review boards.</p><p>We are asking teachers to give up far too much, and I am asking the Government to think again. I am asking it to think about arbitration, and about whether the Education, Culture and Sport Committee of this Parliament can contribute more.

The fact that the chamber is half full indicates that a lot of us have more sense than I had given us credit for.</p><p>The minister missed out one thing, which we may get in his closing speech. He talked about the improved intelligence gathering that we will require if there is to be a strategy for the maintenance of the manufacturing sector and the growth of the Scottish economy in general. One thing that has emerged from this debate is that there are still a lot of shibboleths around, and not a lot of new thinking.</p><p>Normally John McAllion and I agree on just about everything, but I have to take issue with something that I think he was implying. Henry McLeish and Bristow Muldoon both alluded to it too, when they talked about the split&#8212;the demarcation line&#8212;between manufacturing and service industries. These days, there is practically no demarcation. The motion refers to manufacturing; is manufacturing about things made from girders, or is it about the software packages made by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology in partnership with <place-holder colnum=\"846\"/> Microsoft? Those packages are manufactured products and export products. It is only fair that we should ask the Executive how it defines those sectors of the Scottish economy so that we can evaluate its strategy.</p><p>We should not talk ourselves down just because of the way in which things are now done. For example, someone working in the kitchens at Digital in Ayrshire 20 years ago would have been counted as part of the manufacturing sector. But there is now a lot of outsourcing&#8212;to use another jargon term&#8212;which means that a catering company will no doubt be supplying the food to the people who work in that manufacturing industry, and their employees will be counted as part of the service sector. We could do a lot more to give ourselves better statistics on which to dream our dreams and build our schemes.</p><p>We should all have regard for what Christine Grahame said. We have a centre of excellence in the Borders. It is still producing much better stuff to wear than most other places in the world, but it is supplying a niche market. Although I regret it, it is true that the big growth area will be in the newer technologies, in places such as the Dundee Centre for Medical Education; in Cadence Design Systems in Livingston for leading-edge software; or in Heriot-Watt University for laser technology. I could name an awful lot more.</p><p>We must not talk down the importance of what to those of us who did not grow up in this part of the century are rather airy-fairy sounding industries. We grew up with men pittin overalls on and going to their work and if they did not do that we wondered what they were doing wi their time. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Members laugh? There are some folk out there who know that that is the truth.</p><p>We need much more of the new technology. We should replicate what happened in Austin, Texas. The city was going down the tubes so it turned itself into the brains capital of the United States of America. Why should Scotland not become the brains capital of Europe? We have the potential&#8212;it is there in our universities. One thing that is lacking from this strategy is a connection between the creation of the knowledge economy in our universities and our companies that are still involved with manufacturing. I hope that the minister will tell us that he will consider that.</p><p>Someone once said that it was education, education, education into the next millennium.

The best practice that the professionals would like us to adopt is for a unit to serve a radius of territory that encompasses about 10 million people&#8212;in some parts of the world, particularly north America, where a one-centre system of excellence is operated, those areas can often be more than 50 miles in diameter.</p><p>When you are making that decision, minister, do not be held fast by the professionals. You say that you want more family-friendly policies. It will not be friendly to any of the families whose children have, unfortunately, been admitted either to the royal hospital for sick children at Yorkhill or to the Edinburgh sick children's hospital if you have to close one unit. I do not underestimate the difficulty of the decision that has to be made and I share your concern that there should be no turf wars, because we should have the best possible service.</p><p>Mr Reid, I apologise for speaking directly to the minister, but she has the responsibility for ensuring that we have a quality service and that that service is dictated not by the professionals but by need and by what we already have. We have two centres, each with an excellent record and each with competing claims that are very difficult to judge between.</p><p>In the case of Edinburgh's unit, we know that, if we lose the paediatric cardiac service, we may lose the whole intensive care unit. That is a huge price to pay. I do not imagine that any of my colleagues from Glasgow would want to be forced to take the decision that you, minister, are going to have to take if, as is said, you have already conceded the case for there being only one centre. I hope that you have not conceded that case.

I will also put aside the unkind jibes that I made about where we might find an alternative source of funding-by getting rid of nuclear weapons-and address myself to the situation here in Edinburgh. </p><p>I have an urgent reason for bringing the chamber's attention to the reality of PFI. Although I welcome a sinner who has repented, and what Jack McConnell said today about making wee improvements at the margins, I fear that, for some aspects of the Edinburgh royal infirmary contract that has already been signed, and for the contract <place-holder colnum=\"769\"/> that is waiting to be signed, that may be too late. </p><p>There is a second PFI at the Edinburgh royal infirmary-for equipment. Before the election, I was concerned because every piece of advice that I had received-from the British Medical Association, from the people who work in the area that will be covered by the second PFI and, of course, from Unison-suggested that it would, almost certainly, lead to a lowering of the standard of clinical care. The equipment PFI covers equipment that is patient-critical. The equipment is operated by a health team that is made up of the same people who purchase, install and maintain it, and who train the staff in how to use it. They are an integrated part of the medical care. Under the equipment PFI, they would be split off from the rest of the clinicians and nursing staff. </p><p>I was also very concerned about the total absence of British health care companies from the companies that tendered for this PFI, because I do not want the bedside bookkeeping of the American health care companies in Edinburgh's new royal infirmary. I am sure that Mr McConnell does not want that either. </p><p>I have a compelling third reason for revisiting the PFI. When the minister sums up, I want him to give us an assurance that the Executive will re-examine the books for the Edinburgh PFI. I have here a letter dated 31 May. It is addressed to the executive directors of the Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust, and is from the heads of service and business managers at the royal infirmary. It says that  \"effective planning of and communication about the entire project has ground to a halt\"  and that  \"plans for equipment specification and purchase are causing deep anxiety.\" </p><p>Most worrying of all for the people who will use the privatised new infirmary at Little France, the letter states that few of the service heads and managers  \"have gained confidence about the level of service they will be able to provide after going through this process.\" </p><p>During the election campaign, some new Labour spokespeople brushed aside criticisms that I was making.

There is the concern that the Holyrood site is not the most suitable. I know that we are past the time when the then Scottish secretary was advised against choosing other than Calton hill. I accept that time has moved on, that the General Post Office building is not available and that other considerations will have to be taken into account. The amendment asks for those other considerations to be taken into account. </p><p>In the time that has elapsed, we have also found that the four-acre site at Holyrood, which was judged to be adequate, is probably not adequate. When any of the local authority people in this chamber were building big, they would usually have a wee bit of land for contingency expansion, but no contingency expansion has been built into this grand design. </p><p>However, there is a site that has not yet been built on; I think that it has been procured by Teague Homes (Scotland) Ltd. If we use the time that the amendment asks for productively, perhaps we could revisit that decision. Do the builders need all that land? Could we do a bit of business with them? We need some land for expansion purposes, as the site has already expanded from 16,000 sq m to 23,000 sq m. I am not arguing about that-we may well need the extra support staff to cope with the expansion. However, before the people-who pay for everything-see how the Parliament benefits the quality of decision making in Scotland, they will ask \"What do you need all those staff for?\" </p><p>I appeal directly to the First Minister for time to sell our idea to the people who elected us. There <place-holder colnum=\"562\"/> is no doubt about the site's shortcomings. I am not talking about the design of the building, but about how the site is hemmed in and cannot expand without going into Holyrood park. I think that Patricia Ferguson said that such an expansion might enhance and bring life to the park. However, we do not want too much life in the park; we like it as it is. Furthermore, we do not want the kind of office-block accommodation that we have at the moment. </p><p>There is another important point that members did not raise, perhaps because Robin Harper has a specialist interest in these matters. When I first expressed an interest in this issue, I was contacted-before the election-by many architects, two or three of whom advised me that no wind-tunnel test had been done. At least, we have not seen any results of a wind-tunnel test. Perhaps when Mr McLeish sums up, he can tell us whether such a test has been carried out and, if not, whether there are plans to have one. We also have to ask what would happen if the plans were to fail that test. </p><p>Frank MacAveety suggested that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body could do everything that I am asking for. However, if the site is not big enough and if an independent assessor's estimate shows that extra land is needed, will the SPCB be entitled to go ahead with its plans? We have been told that the Executive has full responsibility for the configuration of roads around the site. Who will be responsible for the recalibration-which is referred to in documents that I have-that the site will probably need? The amendment seeks time for us to find answers to such questions. </p><p>Traffic is the big concern in Edinburgh. Too many people are trying to get to work from Newington or by using London Road. Most members may not be familiar with Edinburgh's traffic problems, which are becoming intolerable. Those problems are operating against the city's best interests and the question is too serious to leave to the SPCB to decide in our interest. The interests are much wider than that. </p><p>When members come to vote, they should remember that we are not saying that Holyrood should not go ahead, but that too many questions remain unanswered. We plead for time to find adequate answers to those questions and to find a building for this Parliament of which we can be proud. </p>", "hdate": "1999-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13207797", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holyrood Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that that is true, but it is also true that neither her constituents nor mine make a habit of reading Hansard .
