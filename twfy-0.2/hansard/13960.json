It is a statistic that has been used a number of times by the Scottish Government over the past couple of years. It is the Government&#8217;s contention that the cost of benefit changes is &#163;4.5 billion. The Scottish Government suggests that life would be very different if we were to be independent.</p><p>I asked the cabinet secretary, during his opening speech, how much of that &#163;4.5 billion-worth of changes would be reversed were Scotland to be independent. I asked that because, although the Government says in the white paper that there are two or three measures that it would reverse, it is silent on all the other measures. Apart from that, it says that it would broadly adopt the welfare system from the rest of the UK.</p><p>The largest single measure within that &#163;4.5 billion, which is about a third of it in total, is the change from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index. Is there any commitment from the Scottish Government to reverse that if we are to be independent? If not, it needs to take off a third of that &#163;4.5 billion when it criticises the benefit changes.</p><p>The second largest measure is the changes to child benefit. Is there any commitment to reverse that decision? I do not think that there is, because I heard Christine Grahame ask the First Minister about that a couple of months ago and no commitment was given. If that is the Scottish Government&#8217;s position, it cannot complain about that sum of money either.</p><p>If we drill it down, I would be surprised if there was a commitment from the Scottish Government to reverse any more than &#163;200 million out of the &#163;4.5 billion were we to be independent. I look forward to hearing which additional measures it would change; otherwise, it is not legitimate for the Government to use that figure in future. It knows fine well that it would not change most of it if it had the power to do so.</p><p>We have said from the outset that this should have been a budget about the economy. I disagree with Jean Urquhart when she said that she did not think that it was the biggest issue. Poll after poll shows that at the very top of people&#8217;s agenda is jobs, growth and the economy. That is where our focus ought to be.</p><p>We hear from the Government that, if it had the powers, it would set a business tax strategy to stimulate investment. If it is to be taken at its word on that, why does it not do that with the tax powers that it currently has?

The increase in Barnett consequentials that the Government gets is far more than &#163;4.5 million; about &#163;80 million to &#163;90 million of the Barnett consequentials that it gets came from business rates.</p><p>What has happened in the SNP&#8217;s second term, in which it has been a majority Government, is that it has brought in the retail levy and empty property rates. We have diminished enormously a big advantage that we used to have over the rest of the UK. There has been a refusal to publish the land and building transaction tax rates. We have a business incentivisation scheme that has not got off the ground at all, with COSLA being blamed for that instead of the Scottish Government. And, of course, there is the retail rebate, which will be brought in south of the border and for which we get Barnett consequentials of &#163;29 million next year and &#163;39 million the year after. However, Scotland has refused to look at it, even though it would have boosted the retail sector at a time when that was needed and a time when we had a retail levy that put the sector in a tougher position here than in the rest of the UK.</p><p>The focus of the Scottish Government in this budget is not on the economy. There are many measures that it could have taken on tax. It could have brought back the town centre regeneration fund, a popular fund that had support across the chamber when it was introduced and which has been cited by many SNP back benchers over the past 12 months or so.

We think that the Government must use every lever at its disposal&#8212;I emphasise &#8220;every lever&#8221;&#8212;to do that.</p><p>An issue on which we feel strongly is business rates.

Retailers have had a particularly tough time and, given that the retail levy came to Scotland, a retail rebate would be welcomed across the board.</p><p>Barnett consequentials will flow directly from the UK Government&#8217;s decision to have a retail rebate: &#163;29&#160;million of consequentials in 2014-15 and &#163;39&#160;million in 2015-16. This Government wants the most competitive business rates across the country; it is important that it not take measures that help that goal to recede, and that it keep pace with some of the positive measures that are happening elsewhere. That is why the retail rebate is important and why we think it critical that the Scottish Government introduce a rebate to help retailers across Scotland.</p><p>In last week&#8217;s debate, we expressed our great disappointment at how the business rates incentivisation scheme has operated so far. It was announced by the cabinet secretary in 2011, when it was said that it would &#8220;attract new economic growth&#8221; and help to grow business rates income in councils across the country. It was the flagship centrepiece of the SNP&#8217;s campaign in the local government elections in 2012. It was heralded as a great way forward, through which councils would get 50 per cent of anything that was collected above the targets that they were given. In year 1, the targets were changed at late notice. Most councils were expecting to get something; it now looks as if many councils will get nothing and some will get little. In year 2&#8212;the current financial year 2013-14&#8212;unless the position has changed in the past week, councils still do not have targets. The financial year will end in a couple of months, but councils still have not been given targets for collecting business rates. If that is the case, how on earth can the Scottish Government call it an incentivisation scheme?</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s own external expert advisory group reported last summer. It felt that the scheme was a key action point and it put forward the idea&#8212;which I think is excellent&#8212;that 100 per cent of what is collected over the target should go back to councils.

However, I hope&#8212;as most of us in the Parliament do&#8212;that that complaint will become a little less common.</p><p>Red tape comes from various sources. Much of it comes from Brussels; some comes from Westminster and from here; and some comes from councils. We must focus on what we can do and the bill is right to do that. We are focusing on the legislation that will flow from this place and on the regulators that were in broad terms set up by this place.</p><p>It is not just the regulations that are passed that cause angst to business; often it is the way in which they are enforced and the inconsistency with which that is done in different parts of the country.</p><p>We welcome the bill. As my colleague Murdo Fraser said, we welcome the better regulation agenda as a whole, and all the work that the regulatory review group has done since it was set up. The policy memorandum states that the bill seeks</p><p>&#8220;to improve the way regulation is developed and applied, creating more favourable business conditions in Scotland and delivering benefits for the environment.&#8221;</p><p>We can sign up to those suggestions and ideas. The bill deals with the flow of regulation passing through Parliament.</p><p>The issue that attracted most attention today and during the stage 1 debate, and in the committee&#8217;s work, was the duty of regulators in respect of sustainable economic growth. As I said earlier, the Government has called this right. There is a fine balance to be found and good points have been made, even by those who are against that provision. However, the way in which the provision has been framed was the right way to do it, and it makes it clear that the regulators will not have to sacrifice their core and other functions. The requirement is additional to those functions.</p><p>Some members have worries about the requirement becoming the overall priority against what the regulators were set up to do, but I do not share those fears and I have not done so since stage 1. The original section made it clear that the regulators had to</p><p>&#8220;contribute to achieving sustainable economic growth&#8221;;</p><p>that was correct, as was the caveat</p><p>&#8220;except to the extent that it would be inconsistent with the exercise of those functions to do so.&#8221;</p><p>That was set up from the start. The additional security that was given by the Government, through the committee, about the way in which the code and guidance will be set up, strengthens that and reduces the risks; while those risks were quite rightly pointed out, they have been dealt with fairly well.</p><p>The FSB pointed out in its written submission that how the code is monitored and reported on will determine its effectiveness in changing practice. Producing legislation is one thing, but in many ways the hard work is about to begin for the Government and the Parliament. Setting out a framework is one thing, but what will matter most is what goes into the guidance and code of practice. That is harder to define and put together than the primary legislation. The work is far from complete and it is incumbent on us all, particularly the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and the Government, as well as parliamentarians across the board, to ensure that we get the code and guidance right so that the legislation does in practice what it was set up to do.

An impressive list of people sat on the group and contributed to it, and the report is a basis from which we can move forward. However, I am disappointed by the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to it, which ducks some of the big issues, ignores some of the more radical and interesting objectives in the report and restricts comments to things that the Government was already doing and things that are easier to talk about than to do.</p><p>One of the recommendations on the key town centres first principle&#8212;this is on page 6 of the expert advisory group report&#8212;is:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government and all public sector bodies need to ensure that funding and investment programmes are aligned to achieve the maximum effect in supporting diversity, enterprise and creativity in our town centres.&#8221;</p><p>That is a strong statement but, as it came out last summer, what was the Scottish Government doing? It was busy shutting down courts right across the country. We have a report that talks about a town centres first principle, but we have the Scottish Government busy with a court closure programme. When the Scottish Government produced its response in November, it gave a warm welcome, or at least a lukewarm welcome, to the town centres first principle, but what was it busy doing? It was busy with a police counter closure programme right across the country.</p><p>There is no point in the Minister for Local Government and Planning or the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism standing up and talking about how critical town centres are to our economy while another wing of Government is taking action that has the effect of denigrating or doing down our town centres. That makes no sense whatsoever. If there is going to be such a principle, it has to be joined up not just across the Scottish Government but across the public sector in Scotland as a whole.</p><p>Another strong and radical policy in the expert group&#8217;s report is a business rates incentivisation plus scheme&#8212;it is called a &#8220;BRIS+ scheme&#8221; in the report, which states:</p><p>&#8220;As Business Rates traditionally go to Central Government BRIS represents a new model of Local Authority Incentivisation.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to state that the</p><p>&#8220;BRIS+ scheme&#8221;</p><p>that it suggests would give</p><p>&#8220;Local Authorities ... 100% of additional business rates collected in town centres&#8221;,</p><p>as opposed to the 50 per cent under the current Scottish Government policy. That has been Conservative policy since 2011 and it is something that the Government needs to respond to positively and give full consideration to.</p><p>In my part of the chamber we are very disappointed with the current business rates incentivisation scheme&#8212;a scheme that was missing from the minister&#8217;s opening statement; I hope that he comes to it in his closing speech&#8212;because we were told:</p><p>&#8220;Any council that exceeds its annual business rates target will share the additional income equally with the Scottish Government. The scheme therefore incentivises councils to maximise their existing business rates income and to encourage or attract new economic growth which will grow their business rates income.&#8221;</p><p>The problem is that the Scottish Government said that in 2011. It was the SNP&#8217;s flagship policy when it went into the local authority elections in 2012. We now find ourselves in 2014, and what has happened with that policy? In year 1, the goalposts or targets were changed at the last minute. Councils were in line to receive moneys, but many will now receive nothing and lots will receive far less than they expected. In year 2, as we heard just last month, targets have not even been set. We are two months away from the end of the financial year and councils have not been given targets.

The fundamental point that my party and other parties have made in the debate is that the Scottish Government has the power now to do many of the things that it could and should be doing. We face economic challenges now, but we have headwinds coming in the short and medium term, and we have some leverage that we can use. The Scottish Government is so concerned with the referendum and independence that its eye is not on the ball and we are not doing many of the things that we could and should be doing.</p><p>The report by the office of the chief economic adviser was excellent. It made a lot of points, and a lot of the news was positive, as we must all acknowledge. However, it raised issues of concern, on which the Scottish Government needs to focus now. What is the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to export market fragility? We have not heard its response yet, although surveys during most of the second half of last year highlighted the danger. The Bank of Scotland business monitor report, which a number of members quoted, said that export activity has been showing a negative trend over the past three months, after a nearly flat performance in the previous three months. Why is that? Maybe it is just a blip, but if it is not, Government ought to be doing something about it.</p><p>What about the forecasts? When I mentioned the ITEM club&#8217;s forecast, I heard the cabinet secretary shout, &#8220;What about Fraser of Allander?&#8221; For the record, Fraser of Allander said that there would be growth of 1.3 per cent in 2013 and 1.8 per cent this year; it predicted an increase. However, an equally respected commentator says that the rate will go from 1.9 to 1.7 per cent. Who knows who is right? The point is that if a respected commentator is saying that growth will go from 1.9 to 1.7 per cent, and the same commentator&#8217;s projection is that growth in the UK will go from 1.4 to 2.4 per cent, questions must be asked by the Government, and we require a deeper analysis and consideration of whether the Government in Scotland can do something with its levers to try to counteract the effect and ensure that there is an increase in growth.</p><p>The state of the economy report made other points. For example, it considered the United States of America interest rate rises that are expected at the end of the tapering off of stimulus activity. What impact will that have on Scottish businesses, given that the USA is our single most important international export partner? What about conditions across the eurozone if growth does not happen there? What will be the impact on the Scottish economy?</p><p>We have levers, and there are issues on which the Scottish Government should be focusing. We call on the Government to focus on those issues.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22827587", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not know where the oil fund will go if we are to spend it on everything else, but never mind.

We discussed it with the cabinet secretary and, indeed, with the Scottish Futures Trust. The figures, of course, are laid out in the appendix to the budget document and show that, in this financial year, the spend will go from &#163;338&#160;million down to &#163;185&#160;million, which was predicted. Next year there will be a reduction from &#163;973&#160;million to &#163;809&#160;million.</p><p>The Scottish Government said to us initially in the budget statement that the changes were partially to do with savings and partially to do with delay. Subsequent to that, the Government has suggested that the balance will be more to do with delay than with savings. What we do not know at this stage is what percentage of the change is down to delay and what percentage is down to savings.</p><p>Any reduction in spend due to savings is to be welcomed, in our view; any reduction due to delay is clearly not to be welcomed. I ask the Government either to get back to us today or to get back to the committee on what percentage is down to delay as opposed to savings. Indeed, while we are at it&#8212;now that we are eight months through the financial year 2013-14&#8212;the Government could say where are we in relation to the &#163;185&#160;million that was predicted to be the case in September. We are two thirds of the way through the financial year. Is two thirds of the construction spend happening? Are we likely to hit that or, indeed, to be over it or under it? Also, how will the Government address that going forward, as suggested by the convener?</p><p>I want to touch on one other issue. We looked at business rates over the course of the inquiry and there is just one question that I want to put to the Government at this stage. The Scottish Government has central projections for business rates. It believes that it will be &#163;2.688&#160;billion for 2014-15. It predicted &#163;2.435&#160;billion for 2013-14. What impact do the recent announcements have on those projections, because they are going up by 2 per cent instead of 3.2 per cent? Clearly, that will reduce them slightly but growth is projected to be higher than it was previously&#8212;it is projected to be 1.4 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent next year. What impact will that have on the projections for business rates? We would certainly welcome any update on that from the Government.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I look forward to seeing the Government&#8217;s written response to the Finance Committee&#8217;s report.

Bob Doris spoke eloquently, in a fairly thoughtful contribution&#8212;for the first 90 per cent of it; I will ignore the last 10 per cent&#8212;about change funds. The committee and everybody else in the chamber buy into the concept of preventative spend; indeed, it has had cross-party support over a number of years. The committee came to a conclusion at paragraph 105 of its report that is worthy of a specific response from the cabinet secretary&#8212;if not today, then certainly in written form:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee invites the Government to update it on the progress in &#8216;establishing fit-for-purpose monitoring and evaluative processes&#8217; as stated in the response to last year&#8217;s draft budget report.&#8221;</p><p>I take on board the comments that were made last year by the cabinet secretary to the effect that is it very difficult to evaluate every single public pound that is spent, but given the amount of money that is going into change funds&#8212;Bob Doris mentioned &#163;500&#160;million&#8212;it is worth looking carefully at that to ensure that we are spending the money on preventative spend, as opposed to covering gaps, so that we get long-term results.</p><p>Murdo Fraser made a couple of comments to which I hope the Scottish Government will respond. One was about the percentage of contracts that are awarded via public contracts Scotland to Scottish companies. We heard the figure for the number of contracts, but what is figure for the value of the contracts? That would very useful information that is important for Parliament to know.</p><p>Murdo Fraser also commented on what Scottish Enterprise said about the gap of &#163;26.3&#160;million in this year&#8217;s budget, which is to be covered by extra property sales over the financial year. There is the question whether disposing of property is the best thing to do. Is it a good idea to sell property at a loss now, in order to cover a revenue gap in a single year?</p><p>I will finish where the debate started. Mr Gibson talked about the national performance framework. Evidence that was heard led a number of committees to conclude that linkages should be improved. The cabinet secretary challenged committees to come to him with more detailed proposals. That was fair; there is work for Parliament to do. However, there is also work for the Government to do. Will the cabinet secretary work in tandem with the committees and perhaps take the lead on the issue by convening a meeting, so that we can drive things forward together rather than wait for Parliament to act alone?

Those organisations that regularly contribute to consultations are pretty adept at doing so, and I wonder whether there is any way of levelling the playing field, so to speak, so that communities that are definitely affected but are perhaps not good at voicing their concerns can be heard through that process. Perhaps the cabinet secretary could say something about that in his closing remarks.</p><p>Although there is nothing wrong with the bill, it is worth while to reflect on a couple of areas in which the Government will have to do further work when it comes to secondary legislation and the regulations. Waste tourism has already been touched on today and was heavily focused on in the committee process and the stage 1 debate. In my view, the analysis of waste tourism is still a little underdeveloped. Resources ought to be put into that at a Government level so that we can get to the bottom of whether it is likely to exist. We had strong representations to the committee about how sensitive small differences could be, and strong representations in the chamber from those who felt that waste tourism would not be an issue as it would not exist at all.</p><p>The issue matters because whether and the extent to which waste tourism exists will have an impact on the rates that the Government might put forward and that we might set as a Parliament and on decisions on whether it is worth having more than the two bands that we currently have. It also matters because it is a factor in whether we play about with what is in each band or in what would be in each band if we moved to having three bands, for example. It would be useful to hear from the Government what it intends to do as regards waste tourism in dealing directly with the UK Government. The Government said that it will continue to have discussions on the matter, but in paragraph four of its response to the committee&#8217;s report, it stated:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government has had no direct discussion with the UK Environment Agency on this matter.&#8221;</p><p>That might have been superseded since the response was produced but, if not, it is important that the Scottish Government takes those discussions forward so that we can get to the bottom of the waste tourism issue.</p><p>The next issue on which it is worth while to reflect a bit more is the taxation of unauthorised disposals. The cabinet secretary mentioned that in his speech and, again, I think that it is welcomed by members throughout the chamber. A tax charge on illegal dumping sends out a signal to those who do it and potentially will bring in a stream of revenue for the Scottish Government to use on suitable measures.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22813652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that the bill commands broad support across the chamber.

In paragraph 12 of its response to the committee&#8217;s report, the Scottish Government set out its forecast for receipts between 2015-16 and 2024-25. The table looks pretty good, but the Government noted that the forecast</p><p>&#8220;has been produced internally by the Scottish Government and has not been independently verified&#8221;,</p><p>and went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Tax rates are assumed to remain as they are at present. No allowance has been made for receipts from taxing illegal landfilling at this stage.&#8221;</p><p>It would be helpful if the Scottish Government published the work that it has done in a bit more detail, to give the outside world some background about the modelling that it used and information about what would happen to the projected receipts if certain things changed, such as the rate of the tax, how tax rates increase, and whether there are two or three rates. That would help us to take matters forward.</p><p>I think that I am right in saying that modelling by the Scottish Government and the Office for Budget Responsibility thus far has been on the tax as it currently stands. It would be useful to know what sort of tax the Scottish Government intends the landfill tax to be and what rates it proposes. We would then be able to get predictions on the tax from the OBR and from the Scottish Government that enable us to see what would happen if changes were made.</p><p>When the cabinet secretary makes his closing speech, it would be helpful to hear for how long he intends to set the tax when he sets it for first time. What approach does the Scottish Government intend to take? A number of witnesses to the committee made suggestions or requests in that regard. For example, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities made a formal request in its written submission for the tax to be set for a five-year period. Other organisations suggested shorter periods. It would be useful to know the Government&#8217;s intention, so that we can try to give a degree of certainty to the people who will be affected by the tax.</p><p>In paragraph 2 of its response to the Finance Committee, the Scottish Government gave the impression&#8212;I do not know whether this is correct&#8212;that it intends to set the tax on a year-by-year basis, when the draft budget is published each year. It would be helpful to know whether that is the case or whether the Scottish Government intends to provide a degree of stability and certainty by setting the tax for a longer period.</p><p>There is much to commend in the bill. There are issues to consider&#8212;waste tourism, the taxation of unauthorised disposals, the landfill communities fund and the tax rates that will be set&#8212;but I reiterate that we will support the bill at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22813652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a pretty good, if short, debate, which did not differ enormously from the debate at stage 1.

The average motorist will save &#163;7 every time they fill up. While that is good news for motorists, it has a wider impact on the economy as a whole, as it flows through to the prices that we all pay for goods and services.</p><p>We heard an extremely interesting announcement on national insurance. The chancellor announced last week that, starting from April 2015, the UK Government will abolish employers national insurance for all employees who are under 21 provided that they earn less than approximately &#163;813 a week. That will apply to existing employees and future ones. It will represent an enormous saving to businesses up and down the country as it is worth the best part of half a billion pounds a year. It is a boost for employers, for young people who have been hit hardest during the downturn, and for the economy as a whole. The Scottish Government ought to welcome that policy when it makes its contribution to the debate.</p><p>The UK Government also made big announcements about business rates. We heard about the business rates cap. The UK Government decided that, instead of capping the annual increase at September&#8217;s widely predicted retail prices index increase of 3.2 per cent, it will cap it at 2 per cent for the year starting in April 2014. That is an example of a Government that has listened to business. There have been many complaints about increases in business rate, and the Government listened to them and took them on board. It showed leadership when that was required.</p><p>The Conservatives therefore welcome today&#8217;s announcement from the Scottish Government. Just an hour or so ago, the cabinet secretary announced in the chamber that the Scottish Government would match the UK Government decision. Instead of business rates in Scotland going up 3.2 per cent, they will rise by 2 per cent. We welcome that, but it is incumbent on the Scottish Government to acknowledge that leadership on the issue came from the UK Government. The Scottish Government is following where the UK Government has led. We can be fairly sure that, had the chancellor decided to raise business rates in line with September&#8217;s RPI, the Scottish Government would have followed suit.

There will be a special discount on business rates of &#163;1,000 to occupied retail and food and drink premises that have a rateable value of &#163;50,000 or less. That is worth about &#163;350 million to the business community, and the Barnett consequentials that will flow from that will be approximately &#163;29 million in 2014-15, and approximately &#163;39 million in financial year 2015-16. That is a big shot in the arm for retail south of the border. It has been widely welcomed by businesses across the land. Our challenge to the Scottish Government is on what it intends to do to help retail in Scotland. Although the small business bonus scheme is an excellent policy, and we support it, premises with a rateable value of more than &#163;18,000 do not get that benefit. South of the border, the threshold will be a rateable value of &#163;50,000 whereas up here it will be &#163;18,000.</p><p>We welcome the extension of the small business bonus, as announced earlier, but the cabinet secretary&#8217;s assessment is that that would be worth about &#163;3.8 million to businesses in Scotland, while the Barnett consequentials of the UK Government&#8217;s announcement are almost 10 times that. What will the Scottish Government do in response to that? What will retailers in Scotland get to match it? Retailers in Scotland have had a particularly difficult time as a sector.

That comes from a Government that claims that we will, when we are a separate Scotland, be able to decrease tax, increase spending, decrease borrowing and have not one but two oil funds&#8212;one for the short term and one for the long term. That is spending the money five times.</p><p>The debate on the autumn statement is usually one that the Scottish Government is particularly keen to have. In 2008, it had a statement and a debate on the pre-budget report, as it was then called; in 2009, it had a debate on the pre-budget report; in 2010 we had the spending review; in 2011, it wanted a debate and in 2012 it wanted a statement. However, in 2013&#8212;this is interesting and noteworthy&#8212;the Government, for the first time, did not want to have a debate or a ministerial statement on Government time on the consequences and consequentials of the autumn budget statement. Perhaps that is because most, if not all, the news in that statement pointed to a positive economic position. It contained policies that could help to drive forward our economy and it included consequentials for Scotland that the Scottish Government does not want to talk about terribly much.</p><p>Let us look at what the Scottish Government asked for. In keeping with usual practice, the cabinet secretary wrote a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer setting out his key priorities. The Scottish Government&#8217;s priorities were additional capital investment, improved access to finance and no additional cuts to spending. I will take those in reverse order. He got no additional cuts to spending; in fact, as we know, the UK Government went further and gave him additional money to spend over the next two years&#8212;an additional &#163;1 million for the current financial year, which I accept is not terribly much, an extra &#163;120 million for 2014-15 and an extra &#163;187.5 million for 2015-16. So, his primary objective was delivered.</p><p>The cabinet secretary wanted additional capital investment. That is what he got, with an additional &#163;98 million to add to the March budget and the previous year&#8217;s autumn statement. We have made the point that, when the chancellor gave that money a year ago, it turned out that a significant number of the Scottish Government&#8217;s so-called shovel-ready projects were not particularly shovel ready&#8212;some did not even have planning permission. However, for a considerable time, it was claimed that they were shovel ready.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s third priority that it asked for in its letter to the chancellor was improved access to finance. That is exactly why funding for lending is being turned towards the business sector and away from the housing sector, with incentives in that particular scheme being skewed heavily towards small and medium-sized enterprises. All major banks will have to appoint a senior champion to promote the independent appeals process. Furthermore, additional sums are going into the British business bank&#8212;&#163;250 million&#8212;to add to the existing &#163;1 billion. The Scottish Government demanded its three priorities; they got those three priorities through consequentials and a number of positive policies to help to grow the economy.</p><p>Let us return to the theme of business rates, with which the cabinet secretary ended his speech with his talk about the regime south of the border. Firstly, let us look at the business rates cap. Although we welcome that it is 2 per cent instead of 3.2 per cent, the reality&#8212;to be fair to the cabinet secretary, he admitted this&#8212;is that, had it not been for the chancellor&#8217;s intervention or the announcement in last week&#8217;s autumn statement, the business rates increase in Scotland would have been 3.2 per cent and not 2 per cent. That is crystal clear. The logical conclusion that was drawn by Murdo Fraser is that it looks as though if people want business rates to be cut in Scotland they should go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer instead of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22801215", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Finance"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am rather amused to hear that the cabinet secretary seems finally to have realised that we can spend the money only once.

The Government and&#8212;I have to say&#8212;the Labour Party have completely ignored the fact that there was a meltdown of the euro two years ago. When the UK Government made predictions in 2010, of course it did not predict that the entire continent was going to go into meltdown and that some members of that currency were at serious risk of departing from it. No one predicted that. Of course, that had a knock-on effect on growth and borrowing between then and now. Anyone who tries to ignore the effects of that is not facing up to reality.

I, too, was disappointed in Alistair Darling because it took him an hour before he gave interviews rubbishing the white paper.</p><p>Let us look at some serious issues that the white paper does not properly address. Central to the debate are the public finances that Scotland would not only inherit but have to deal with over the first five, 10, 15 or 20 years of a separate Scotland. In a report published just over a week ago, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which is a heavily respected independent organisation, said:</p><p>&#8220;the main conclusion of our analysis is that a significant further fiscal tightening would be required in Scotland, on top of that already announced by the UK government&#8221;.</p><p>That was the IFS&#8217;s central conclusion, which no amount of obfuscation or cherry picking from later sections of the IFS report will hide. In a separate Scotland, we would have to undergo further fiscal tightening in order to manage the public finances and in order to balance the books.</p><p>Therefore, it is disappointing to see that the white paper gives only a single year&#8217;s figures looking forward. As we all know, page 75 looks only at what the position would be in 2016-17. There is nothing about 2017-18, nothing about 2018-19 and nothing at all for any year after that. How is it possible to produce such a document without giving anything on future years? Even compared to the annual budget document that is produced for this devolved Parliament, the information in the white paper is extremely thin&#8212;a single page.</p><p>When, just a couple of hours ago at question time, I asked the cabinet secretary whether the Scottish Government has done any projections for post 2016-17, he was unable to give a straight answer. Therefore, I ask the Government ministers now&#8212;I do not know which of them will sum up today&#8217;s debate&#8212;whether they have done projections that go beyond the first year of separation. If so, why have those projections not been published? If not, how on earth can they argue that they are taking a long-term positive view about Scotland when they have not even done any of the sums?</p><p>We know from the cabinet secretary&#8217;s paper that was released accidentally that separation would involve additional costs. At paragraph 43 of his report to the Cabinet just over a year ago, he accepts:</p><p>&#8220;Undoubtedly, there will be a cost associated with setting up and running the necessary institutions and in some cases these are likely to be significant.&#8221;</p><p>The finance secretary accepts in private that there will be significant costs, but the white paper says nothing about the costs that would be incurred in the first year of separation.</p><p>At paragraph 45 of that same report, the finance secretary says:</p><p>&#8220;Corresponding annual costs of tax administration in Scotland would on this basis be expected to be in the region of &#163;575m to &#163;625m.&#8221;</p><p>That is the cost of setting up a revenue Scotland that is capable of dealing with all the taxes with which it would have to deal, but there is nothing about that in the white paper.

We think that it is a step in the right direction, although there is still much to do on regulatory reform, both in principle and in the bill itself, so we will vote for the bill at 5 o&#8217;clock today.</p><p>It is a common complaint from business of all shapes and sizes that the volume and burden of red tape is too much. In the recent Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland survey, 45 per cent of those who were surveyed said that the cost of compliance had risen over the past year, and 29 per cent said that the time that is taken in order to comply with regulation had increased over the past year. Some regulation clearly is necessary and some of it is less so, but having as much regulation as we have can stifle potential and innovation and, ultimately, make us less productive as a country.</p><p>We welcome the bill, the better regulation agenda and, indeed, the work of the regulatory review group. It is not just regulation itself, of course, but the way in which it is interpreted and enforced that causes much of the angst across the business community.</p><p>Let us look at some of the key issues, many of which have been touched on. First, section 4&#8212;which is entitled &#8220;Regulators&#8217; duty in respect of sustainable economic growth&#8221; and is to be read in conjunction with sections 5 and 6&#8212;provides that regulators</p><p>&#8220;must contribute to achieving sustainable economic growth&#8221;.</p><p>That is a principle that I and my party support&#8212;indeed, there was something pretty similar in our manifestos in 2007 and 2011. The provision gives a signal that sustainable economic growth is a priority for Government. It raises the profile of the issue, and it sets out a clear vision: Scotland needs sustainable economic growth.</p><p>I do not agree with Jenny Marra&#8217;s suggestion that the provision will override all the other duties that regulators have. The minister was right to point out the precise wording of section 4 in that regard. Two parts of the section are relevant. First, section 4 provides that regulators</p><p>&#8220;must contribute to achieving sustainable economic growth&#8221;.</p><p>The achievement of sustainable economic growth is therefore not an overriding duty, but something to which regulators must contribute.</p><p>Secondly, in relation to the duty to make such a contribution, section 4 provides for a clear exception for all regulators, where</p><p>&#8220;it would be inconsistent with the exercise of&#8221;</p><p>their</p><p>&#8220;functions to do so.&#8221;</p><p>Before we even consider that guidance will be produced, those two points in section 4 mean that the argument about the duty overriding all other duties is overblown and ought not to be central to the debate.</p><p>Questions were asked and fair points were made by people who are against and people who are in favour of the principle. The conclusion was that the success of section 4 and the bill as a whole will depend almost entirely on the guidance and code of practice that the Government will issue under sections 5 and 6. The FSB was right to say that how the code is monitored and reported on will determine how effective it will be in changing practice. I hope that ministers will focus on that in their speeches, in the context of subsections (2) and (3) of section 4.</p><p>Fair questions were asked by people who are in favour of the principle. How will we ensure that the duty is enforced at operational level, where it matters? How will we avoid legal challenge? That is a fair question, which Jenny Marra and other members asked. None of us wants to see time being taken up in the courts. How will we ensure that the meaning is narrowed down, so that that does not happen?</p><p>People who are concerned that the section 4 duty might override other duties have asked how it will sit alongside regulators&#8217; primary purpose, and how regulators will balance their priorities. It is crucial that the code of practice and guidance are right in that regard, so I was pleased to hear from the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8217;s convener that the committee will take evidence on the code of practice and the guidance in order to ensure that Parliament and the Government get things right.</p><p>It is possible to get things right. I trawled through the written submissions to the committee and noted that the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator said that it</p><p>&#8220;already reports on sustainable growth, as required by&#8221;</p><p>section 32(1)(a) of the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. The approach in the bill is therefore not without precedent. One regulator must already comply with a provision, the wording of which is pretty close to what is in the bill. There is much to be done, but I am persuaded that it can be done at stages 2 and 3.</p><p>We heard about primary authority partnerships. We strongly approve of the approach, which will bring cost efficiency for businesses and local authorities, and greater consistency across the board, which is important for all concerned. It would be helpful to hear from the minister, in his closing speech, about the analysis of the responses to the consultation, and about the Scottish Government&#8217;s updated position on that.</p><p>We heard about the planning authorities. I do not know whether the planning minister will speak in the debate, but it would be helpful to hear from the Government what its definition of unsatisfactory performance is likely to be, what levels of reduction we are talking about and what measures could be put in place.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We welcome much of what is in the bill today.

That is important, because our analysis of waste tourism impacts on how we might approach various aspects of the bill and the secondary legislation.</p><p>For example, there is the number of tax rates. Some people said in evidence that there ought to be three rates. They said that there ought to be a third rate specifically for stabilised materials. If waste tourism does not really exist, that is fine and that suggestion might be perfectly sensible, but if it does exist, that could have a detrimental impact. It has an impact on the materials that are applied under each rate. Some suggested that material that is close to inert but does not have a route for reuse or recycling ought to have a separate rate. Again, if waste tourism does not exist, that is a perfectly sensible suggestion that we might be able to put into practice fairly swiftly. That is why the matter is so important.</p><p>It is critical for the Scottish Government to interact as much as it can from now on with the UK Environment Agency. The committee asked about that, and the response was that there had not been any direct discussion with the UK Environment Agency thus far. I request that the Government take up that matter fairly swiftly so that we can at least get a reasonable guess at what is likely to happen, which will then flow into other decisions.</p><p>I am conscious that I did not respond to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s initial challenge. He wanted to hear from all parties about the existing 10-mile radius rule for the landfill communities fund. I listened carefully throughout the committee&#8217;s deliberations and I have listened carefully again today. I am hugely persuaded by Michael McMahon&#8217;s passionate contribution about his constituency and the impact that the fund has had on his constituents. It is difficult to get around what he said, although John Mason made the fair point that 10 miles might be a little bit rigid in a rural area and a little bit too wide for an urban area. Perhaps there is an opportunity to change that slightly. However, the committee agreed on the principle that those who are most affected by landfill should be those who gain. I would be particularly nervous about widening the radius too much, particularly as we know that the size of the fund in question is almost guaranteed to drop year on year to the extent that, if the Scottish Government&#8217;s projections are right, by 2025 it will probably be worth around 26 per cent of what it is currently worth. I would find it difficult to favour widening the scope while the fund drops quite dramatically.</p><p>I will return to unauthorised disposals. I think that I said at the start that we welcome that part of the bill. What is proposed represents a huge improvement on the current system and the Government ought to be congratulated on that, but I again request that the cabinet secretary returns to the question about the political objective behind it. If it is to get SEPA to do more and go to more unauthorised landfill sites, the Government probably needs to back that up with resources. The Chartered Institution of Wastes Management said to the committee that SEPA would require</p><p>&#8220;additional resources in order to bring such activities into the tax regime and to apply any criminal sanctions.&#8221;</p><p>There is a benefit in simply having the law there, because the likelihood is that we will get additional revenue and it will send out a bit of a message to the unauthorised landfill sites fraternity, but perhaps there is more to be gained by making it a policy objective that we will put greater effort into things and that SEPA will tackle proactively even more landfill sites than it currently does so that the criminal element is stopped and more revenue is brought into the Scottish consolidated fund, which allows us to fund our public services.</p><p>I am content to leave it there, Presiding Officer.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Conducting research and looking at the matter in a bit of depth, specifically between Scotland and England, would at least give us a degree of comfort and a better guesstimate than we have.

There is much to be commended in the report, but I want to focus on one specific aspect that the commission will explicitly look at in the second half of its work. It is an area where there is a genuine weak point in the system. It has been pointed out by others over a period of years, but it remains a weak point. It is a weak point across the United Kingdom and not just in Scotland, and it has existed under several Governments&#8212;not only the current one. The issue is employer engagement and, in particular, engagement of small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up the backbone of the Scottish economy.</p><p>At page 2, the commission states that it intends to</p><p>&#8220;explore how more employers can be encouraged to employ young people as they come out of education.&#8221;</p><p>That is of course to be welcomed.

We are not good at engaging with SMEs, and the consequence of doing that better could be terrific not just for the young people and SMEs, but for the economy of Scotland as a whole, in the longer term. Our building of relationships with employers is a significant hurdle. They take time to develop, but it is worth investing the time to do so.</p><p>To me, the entire argument was encapsulated by an encounter that I had during a workshop that I attended in Dundee as part of the Finance Committee inquiry. I spoke to a lady who described herself as head of human resources for the business that she ran. However, she also described herself as a director of the business and as head of procurement for it. She was also in charge of cleaning its office and was sometimes a delivery driver for it. That lady did just about everything there was for that business to do, and said quite bluntly that although she would love to take on one or two more young people, she simply did not have the time to find and locate them. She put it as bluntly as it can be put: &#8220;If it&#8217;s straightforward to take on a young person, I&#8217;ll do it. If it&#8217;s complex, I probably won&#8217;t.&#8221; We have heard that from businesses up and down the country&#8212;especially from smaller businesses that do not have a dedicated HR director and which find it difficult to send somebody along to a meeting and to be proactive.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commission for Developing Scotland&#8217;s Young Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have done, I welcome the interim report, which was led by a highly regarded industry figure with very credible members alongside him, using a range of consultees, as is obvious from the list at the end of the report.

Marco Biagi talked about his spurning the university. I have a similar tale, except that it was the other way round, because the University of Edinburgh spurned me when my exam results were not quite what I had hoped they would be.</p><p>However, let us skip over that and congratulate the staff and students of the University of Edinburgh on getting a terrific ranking result based on all that they have done over the past 12 months. I had a little look at the QS report and the points that served Edinburgh so well. The areas that were looked at include academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty student ratio, international indicators and citations per faculty. Of course, as we would expect, Edinburgh scored highly on all of those. However, in the area of academic reputation, to which all speakers have referred, Edinburgh got a score of 99.7 out of a possible 100. It is obviously close to impossible to get far higher than that, which highlights how academically strong the university is.</p><p>As members have said, Edinburgh&#8217;s score this year was no flash in the pan. I could find rankings dating back only to 2007, but they paint a pretty useful picture. Edinburgh was 23rd in the rankings in 2007, but it subsequently moved up to 20th, then 21st and is now 17th on the planet this year. The university&#8217;s scores increased steadily over that time from 88.8 to 91.3. It is clearly doing well across all areas and has moved steadily and firmly up the rankings table over the past six or seven years.</p><p>At a presentation that the university gave recently, we heard about the excellent work that the university does in relation to renewables and the bioquarter, and how it helps to cement a global reputation not just for Edinburgh but for Scotland as a whole. We heard also about the competitive research grants, in relation to which the university had a record year.</p><p>Of course, the university has a very important place in the wider economy of Edinburgh and, indeed, Scotland. The University of Edinburgh is the third-largest employer in Edinburgh, with well over 8,000 full-time equivalent jobs&#8212;I think that there are in fact 12,000 staff&#8212;and it adds well over &#163;1 billion to the Scottish economy. It is estimated that the university supports around 23,000 jobs. Of course, it is also a big factor for many inward investors who come to Scotland. Moreover, it is reckoned that the tourism aspect alone of the University of Edinburgh is worth about &#163;17 million.</p><p>The university&#8217;s commercial liaison unit, Edinburgh Research and Innovation Ltd, provided some particularly interesting figures at the recent presentation. One that really encapsulates what the University of Edinburgh is all about is that since 1969 the university has created more than 262 spin-out companies. That is an impressive figure in itself, but I was more captured by the fact that 81 per cent of those companies are still trading, and that 89 per cent of those are still in Scotland. Those are remarkable statistics from a remarkable department in a remarkable university. I look forward to finding out how the University of Edinburgh fares in the QS survey in 2014.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697642", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: University of Edinburgh"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jim Eadie on securing the debate and giving a particularly interesting speech on the history of the University of Edinburgh.

The Government needs to explain what percentage of offenders will be dealt with under the proposal and why, if there is such a strong principle&#8212;a principle with which we agree&#8212;it will apply only to such a small number of offenders.</p><p>We heard from the First Minister about the courts reform bill. That is another bill that we will examine in detail. Lord Gill&#8217;s initial report was a weighty one. An element of that bill&#8212;the Cabinet Secretary for Justice may want to respond to this&#8212;is that it gives far more work to sheriff courts. We are giving the sheriff courts more work to do tomorrow, but the slight problem is that we shut many sheriff courts yesterday. Perhaps the justice minister will explain how we can give sheriff courts far more work while shutting them at the same time. The First Minister said, in relation to the UK Government, that some people see the price of policies and not their value. That applies equally to the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to close down numerous sheriff courts across the country.</p><p>We heard the usual hyperbole. The Scottish Government is creating a quango by the name of revenue Scotland&#8212;indeed, it already exists&#8212;which will be responsible for the collection of the landfill tax and the land and buildings transaction tax. The Scottish Government says that establishing revenue Scotland is &#8220;an historic step&#8221;. If setting up a tax quango to pick up two taxes&#8212;in fact, it is not even collecting the taxes but overseeing their collection, which is a minor detail&#8212;is an historic step, I do not want to see something that is not an historic step.</p><p>Perhaps the Government or any SNP member can explain what is happening with the procurement reform bill. We welcomed the proposal when it was announced in 2011 and when it was re-announced in 2012, but I heard nothing about the bill from the Government today, and when I checked this morning it had not been introduced. The bill seems to have been delayed, rather like most of the Scottish Government&#8217;s procurement projects, which is ironic.</p><p>During the past few years, we have heard numerous bits of new language to describe the consequences of the recession.

Some businesses said 12 months, some said 18 months and some said now, but they were resolute that the notice had to be sooner than the Government proposed.</p><p>We heard evidence from the Scottish Building Federation, the Scottish Property Federation, Homes for Scotland, the Confederation of British Industry Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and many others, all of whom took the same view. The cabinet secretary then announced that he was considering publishing later, because in his view the evidence was mixed. In my view, the evidence was unanimous and the only person who argued that publication ought to be later was the cabinet secretary.</p><p>When investors prepare their project assessments, a question mark hangs over LBTT. They cannot put a rate to it, which leaves uncertainty. If an investor is attempting to invest in north-west England, they have a clear number that they can put against stamp duty.

As we all know, investors do not like question marks.</p><p>I note that the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report said:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government will consider the evidence provided to the Committee regarding the timing of the publication of the proposed LBTT rates and bands for both residential and commercial property transactions.&#8221;</p><p>I ask the Government to consider that evidence and accept amendment 9, to give at least some certainty and remove one layer of uncertainty from the business community.</p><p>I move amendment 9.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694428", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The key question to be answered is: does the Scottish Government believe in evidence-based policy?

When the cabinet secretary talked about its being the first new tax for well over 300 years, I was reminded of one practitioner in tax, who shall remain nameless, saying that new taxes are a bit like buses and that, by the end of 2013, we will have another one with which to contend in the shape of the Scottish landfill tax.</p><p>We welcome many elements of the bill. One of the Scottish Government&#8217;s strongest decisions is to remove the existing slab structure that is found in SDLT. Without any shadow of a doubt, that structure has previously led to market distortions, and the one simple move of removing it will make a big difference to the marketplace. I have yet to find anybody from any profession who has a bad word to say about that decision.</p><p>Over the course of the bill&#8217;s passage, the Scottish Government has made strong progress in certain areas, as has been indicated in the stage 3 voting on amendments, and it ought to be credited for the work that it has done. The cabinet secretary talked about the working group on non-residential leases that he set up, and I join him in commending the work of that group, whose members sat down, rolled up their sleeves and pulled together some provisions that are complex but far superior to those that they replace. Indeed, as I said earlier, I commend the decision that the cabinet secretary took in relation to licences, which were initially to be a part of the tax but are now not to be, apart from those that may be granted at a later date.</p><p>We have had discussions about issues on which we disagree, too. As the cabinet secretary will know, I find myself holding a different position from him in two areas. The first relates to the timings of the rates. I will not rehearse all the arguments; I will simply respond to John Mason&#8217;s intervention on Ken Macintosh. He is right to say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has raised stamp duty. Budget day in March 2012 was an example of that. However, the concern that businesses are raising with me at the moment is that this is an entirely new tax and a new framework with new thresholds&#8212;we do not know exactly how many&#8212;and new rates at every level apart from the nil rate. There is greater uncertainty over an entirely new tax than there is over an existing tax, even when there are changes late in the day.</p><p>We also disagree on sub-sale relief. I will not rehearse all the arguments. Suffice it to say that I feel that the Scottish Government has slightly overstated the case in relation to tax avoidance. It has not quite taken into account enough areas of competition. The cabinet secretary has outlined what he intends to do, but we are in a slightly different place. Most of the group on non-residential leases that he mentioned&#8212;including ICAS, the Law Society, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Scottish Property Federation and others&#8212;take a view that is broadly closer to what I have suggested than to the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach of trying to exclude everything and looking at bringing in only one or two aspects.</p><p>The fact that there is still work to be done is acknowledged in the specific regulatory powers that the bill provides.

The subject is very complex and in his speech Mr Campbell dealt with it in a very fair and fairly straightforward manner.</p><p>Concerns about interest-rate swap agreements have been around for a year or two. Anecdotally, the original issues were about the inappropriateness of the products, the lack of explanation of the risks and, in particular, the pressure to buy that was put on various businesses; indeed, taking out the product was sometimes a firm condition of the loan. It was also suggested that in a number of cases businesses were given a very short timescale within which to make its decision, which made it even more difficult for it to get its head around the matter and to take independent advice.</p><p>Roderick Campbell said that it is difficult to get your head around this issue if you do not have a degree in economics or finance. That is true, but I also know plenty of people with degrees in both who say that it is equally difficult for them to get their heads around it. When the then FSA looked at this, its initial findings, which were published in June last year, almost entirely backed up everything that businesses had been telling MPs, MSPs and the FSA itself, highlighting the very poor disclosure of exit costs from the products; the failure in many cases to ascertain the customer&#8217;s understanding of risk; non-advised sales straying into advice; overhedging; rewards and incentives being a driver of practices; and&#8212;to cap it all&#8212;evidence of poor record-keeping. Among the biggest concerns was that there was no mention at all&#8212;or, at least, minimal mention&#8212;of the break costs of leaving the contract, nor of the fact that, in many cases, the length of the hedge contract was substantially longer than the length of the loan period. As a result, when the loan came to an end, perhaps after five years, the business might find that it had signed up to and would have to continue to pay for a 10-year contract for a hedging product for a loan that no longer existed; after all, when the crisis hit, the banks simply did not renew many of those loans.</p><p>The findings of the initial pilot review in January would have been of concern to many people. Of the 173 sales that were looked at in greater detail, more than 90 per cent did not comply with at least one regulatory requirement. That figure is staggering. It is fair to point out that all of the cases were complex and might not be wholly representative of the tens of thousands of other cases but, notwithstanding that, the fact that the figure in the pilot was so high should be a matter of concern to us all.</p><p>Most important, we need to decide where we go from here and, although it is absolutely critical for the timescale to be as swift as possible, we also need to take time to get this right. The banks that are looking at the customers who took out these products must prioritise the most vulnerable companies; many of them will be in great difficulty at the moment and must be processed quickest to ensure that they do not stray into administration in the interim period.</p><p>On top of that, the banks must go further than they need to go legally to resolve this issue. Roderick Campbell was quite right to talk about reputational issues. In this case, the banks simply cannot do just the bare minimum; they must do everything that they possibly can for their customers to ensure that the independent reviewers are not consistently sending them back.</p><p>The ultimate sting in the tail is that most of these problems have arisen because of our record low interest rates, which are due in quite some measure&#8212;although not exclusively&#8212;to the behaviour of the banks.

It is clear that underemployment is a complex topic.

However, even measuring skills underutilisation quickly and accurately is a difficult problem, never mind doing something about it, which is even more tricky.

We need to start to do that at school level and take it all the way through. Of course, people accrue different skills and change their mind about what they want to do as they go through their educational journey, but trying to get a better alignment between employment opportunities and the skills that we train people in is a challenge that every Government, including the current one, must face. We have to continually improve what we do in that regard.</p><p>The committee concludes that the decline in output has resulted in a reduction in the demand for labour, and suggests that underemployment is likely to decrease as demand for labour increases. However, it is unclear what that rate of decrease will be and when it might start to occur. From the figures, it seems likely that, even a couple of years after the economy starts motoring along again, we will still face the challenge of underemployment and will have to wrestle with some of the issues that the report covers.</p><p>One chart in the report shows that, between 2005 and 2008&#8212;the years immediately preceding the crisis&#8212;the average rate of underemployment was just over 7 per cent. Another chart shows that, between 2009 and 2012, the rate was 10.2 per cent. It is quite likely, in the normal course of events, that there will be a reduction in underemployment. Whether that leads to a reduction to 7.1 per cent, which is where we were before the crisis, is questionable, and we will still have the best part of two-thirds of our current rate of underemployment if those figures turn out to be correct.</p><p>Murdo Fraser said that, ultimately, the report raises more questions than it supplies answers. That is true. A couple of those questions are worthy of greater exploration.</p><p>If we look at what are described as the regions across the UK, it seems that the picture in most areas is pretty similar. The exception is Northern Ireland, which currently has an underemployment rate of 6.3 per cent. The next lowest is the east of England, with 9.7 per cent, and the highest is the north-east of England, which has a rate of 11.5 per cent. There is a marked difference between the situation in Northern Ireland and that in the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland&#8217;s rate of underemployment&#8212;today, at the height of an economic downturn&#8212;is lower than the rate that existed in any other part of the UK during the boom years, when the lowest rate, in the south-east of England, was 6.5 per cent. I wonder why that is. It might be worth looking into that to see whether something can be learned.</p><p>How does the spread of underemployment work across various sizes of business? We have seen some breakdown of the figures according to business type, which allows us to see that the rate of underemployment is particularly high in retail, hospitality and tourism, but it would be useful to know how the figures break down between micro businesses, small businesses, medium-sized businesses and large businesses. Is there any pattern to that? Is there any link between the size of an enterprise and the level of underemployment that it experiences?</p><p>What are we going to do about the issue that Highlands and Islands Enterprise raised in its evidence to the committee? Its view is that the annual population survey underestimates underemployment in the Highlands and Islands area. The HIE submission states that underemployment in its area</p><p>&#8220;is probably significantly more prevalent than the national statistics indicate, especially in fragile areas where much employment is very part-time or casual.&#8221;</p><p>Also, why are there quite stark differences in underemployment for full-time and part-time workers in the public and private sectors? Underemployment for full-time workers is higher in the public sector, at 5.2 per cent, compared with 4.9 per cent in the private sector. Obviously the difference is small, but the rate of underemployment for full-time workers is still marginally higher in the public sector. However, when it comes to part-time workers, the position is flipped. Underemployment for part-time workers in the private sector is 24 per cent, compared with 18 per cent in the public sector. Why are there differences between the public and private sectors as regards underemployment of full-time and part-time workers?</p><p>The committee has produced an excellent and thought-provoking report. I agree with many of the conclusions, in particular the conclusion that the Scottish Government should monitor developments closely. I was encouraged by what the cabinet secretary said about the Scottish employability forum, and I agree that underemployment ought to be part of the forum&#8217;s work programme.

We heard about new services and stations, too.</p><p>I particularly welcome the update that the minister gave us about the four bids that there have been so far for the Caledonian sleeper and about his plan to take that to the next stage&#8212;in August, I think he said. We also welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement in relation to Whifflet. There is plenty to be satisfied with.</p><p>On the other hand&#8212;and although I hate to use this term again, which has been overused in the debate&#8212;the suggestion that the motion is a little self-congratulatory has been a fair criticism by members from all the Opposition parties in the debate. Where anything has gone wrong, the Government&#8217;s position appears to be that it is entirely Westminster&#8217;s fault, because we are</p><p>&#8220;at the mercy of Westminster&#8221;,</p><p>according to Keith Brown, or it was the fault of the previous Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive. We did not hear a single admission from any Government party member that some of what has gone wrong over the past couple of years is actually down to the Scottish Government. It would have been a better, more objective debate if it took some responsibility for some of the failings.</p><p>Murdo Fraser commented that the First Minister made a pledge in 2008 that the journey time between Edinburgh and Inverness would be cut by 35 minutes by 2012. Clearly, that has not happened. We heard specific information from Tavish Scott in that regard, and I have a letter from my colleague Mary Scanlon that gives a similar picture. We have not heard any explanation from the Scottish Government&#8212;perhaps the minister can provide one in his closing speech&#8212;as to why that pledge from the First Minister has not happened. We would be very grateful for an explanation in that regard.</p><p>There was fair criticism of the Scottish Government last September, and there has been again today, over EGIP. Bruce Crawford is right, in that it is not true to say that nothing is happening on the ground&#8212;it clearly is&#8212;but, compared with what was promised, as I pointed out to Mr Crawford in an intervention, we are not getting what the SNP said it would deliver in its 2011 manifesto. We were told in that manifesto that we would have train journey times from Edinburgh to Glasgow</p><p>&#8220;of just over half an hour&#8221;</p><p>and that much of central Scotland&#8217;s rail network would be electrified.

I congratulate the founders who set up the organisation and drove it forward, the volunteers who help events to happen regularly and, of course, the dads and kids who go along every week and make up Dads Rock.</p><p>As we heard from previous speakers, the organisation achieved an amazing amount in setting up the first free musical playgroup for dads, then setting up the second one, which the minister opened; it now has plans for a third group and more. All that was being done while a fun and positive environment was being created. Most remarkable is that it has all been achieved in such a short space of time. If the first group went live in February last year, that means that everything has been achieved in a mere 15 months or so, and I suspect that much more is to come.</p><p>I was interested to hear Gordon MacDonald talk about how Dads Rock started. How many conversations have there been elsewhere in the country in which people have complained about something? Perhaps they even talked specifically about how little there was in Edinburgh for dads to do, but nothing came of it. As a result of David Marshall&#8217;s and Thomas Lynch&#8217;s specific skill set in music and experience as a post-natal depression counsellor, combined with their determination to drive the project forward, something unique and specific happened. Many people have had conversations about such ideas at various times, but very few have taken them forward. There are lessons for us all in what has happened with Dads Rock over a very short period.</p><p>Looking at Dads Rock&#8217;s blog and Facebook page, I was most struck by how proactive the organisation has been and continues to be. Several groups are operating already, with more on the way. I read an entry on the Facebook page about dads going out leafletting in Granton. Instead of waiting and hoping for people to show up, members of Dads Rock went out and put letters through mailboxes to encourage people to come along and to let them know that events were happening. Dads Rock has also been proactive with exhibitions here in the Scottish Parliament and elsewhere on at least one occasion, and in its involvement with Fathers Network Scotland among other groups. Its members seem extremely determined to take things forward.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the minister&#8217;s response to the debate. Does she propose to end this session with the chorus of &#8220;We Will Rock You&#8221; or something similar? I confess that I am struggling to get the image of Aileen Campbell playing the drums, as pictured on the Dads Rock Facebook page, out of my head.</p><p>This has been a very interesting and exciting 15 months for those involved in Dads Rock, but I rather suspect that the next 15 months will be even more interesting and exciting.

It is not the first time that I have heard a Liberal Democrat support the three-year funding measure, but to hear it again is most welcome.</p><p>Would three-year funding help with preventative measures? In comparison with single-year funding, it undoubtedly would. There will be occasions when funding for longer than three years is deemed necessary and is the right thing to do, and there will be occasions when short-term funding is the only option and is better than nothing. However, as a general proposition, three-year funding is a far better suggestion for the third sector than is annualised funding, which is what is often provided today.</p><p>Single-year funding is just not an ineffective way in which to conduct business. It is inefficient because it means that far too much time is spent on application processes, and it diverts key staff away from the critical function of delivering for the most vulnerable service users. Any time that is spent on filling in extra application forms is time that is not spent on the front line with those who need their help.</p><p>Single-year funding can also lead to instability. What is required is stable employment for staff in the third sector and a stable and consistent service for service users. Close and long-lasting relationships are key for the most vulnerable citizens, who use the services, and any hint of instability through single-year funding is to be avoided. When inefficiency is combined with instability, that leads to a less effective service for those who truly need it and an overall negative impact.</p><p>It is important to conduct the debate in Parliament, as it is pretty difficult for individual charities and voluntary sector groups that are going to lose out to stand up for themselves publicly. For example, a charity that is reliant on one particular local authority for survival is unlikely to complain seriously about getting only a single-year deal because of the perception&#8212;if not the reality, although it could be both&#8212;that that would count against it in the next funding round. Therefore, it takes it on the chin, crosses its fingers and hopes for the best for next year, the year after and probably the year after that. It is critical that Parliament stands up for the third sector, as it is difficult for individual organisations to do so.</p><p>The issue of three-year funding has been recognised by many in the public sector, including the present Scottish Government, which was responsible for pulling together the joint statement on the relationship at local level between Government and the third sector. That statement was signed by the Government, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the SCVO. On paper, it is a very useful piece of work that covers what successful relationships should look like, talking about funding, shared services, applications and evaluations. In paragraph 7, it states that</p><p>&#8220;as a general rule funders will aim to take a three-year approach to both grant and contract funding&#8221;.</p><p>It is there in black and white, and it has been signed up to by all parties. However, what matters is what happens on the ground in relation to three-year funding, not what appears in a document.</p><p>I accept that there is no full evidence base at this stage to outline exactly how many local authorities have followed the statement and how many have not. We will call for that from the Government later in the debate. However, the anecdotal evidence is heavy that, in practice, the joint statement has not made an enormous difference in respect of three-year funding. Many organisations say that three-year funding is the exception rather than the rule and that the statement is ignored almost as much as&#8212;and potentially more than&#8212;it is applied.</p><p>During a round-table discussion that was attended by members from across the chamber, it became apparent that annualised funding was the most common form of funding and that, on occasion, six-monthly funding happened, too. It also became apparent that some work, sometimes lasting months, is done up front by third sector organisations before a contract is put in place, which means that they bear the risk if the contract is not concluded. One particular organisation stated that it has no contract at all for 40 per cent of its engagements with the public sector, that only one in six of its contracts has multiyear funding and that, at the time&#8212;this was a couple of months ago&#8212;with 10 weeks to go before the next financial year, it had no idea about the funding arrangements for 60 per cent of its operations.</p><p>It is clear that action is required. In the past couple of months, the Scottish Government has appeared to be listening. I call on it to take forward some of the ideas, look at the concerns and gather the evidence base that is needed to make progress and to prevent single-year funding and adopt three-year funding.</p><p>The spirit&#8212;and the letter&#8212;of the joint statement should be implemented in practice. As a general rule and a default position, the public sector ought to give three-year funding to the third sector.</p><p>How can that most effectively be achieved? Simply having a debate shines a light on the issue, particularly if consensus is reached in the debate.</p><p>As set out in the motion, we call on the Scottish Government to remind all those organisations over which it has both direct and indirect influence about the joint statement and the responsibilities contained in it. It is time to examine in more detail the credible claims made by individual third sector players and the groups that represent them. We need an evidence base to show the extent&#8212;with regard to volume and value&#8212;to which three-year funding is happening on the ground. By shining a light on the issue, we can initiate change.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament acknowledges the outstanding contribution made across Scotland by the third sector; recognises the importance of multi-year funding to the sector in order to allow it to maximise its contribution; notes the Joint Statement on the Relationship at Local Level between Government and the Third Sector, which states that &#8220;as a general rule funders will aim to take a three-year approach to both grant and contract funding&#8221;; is concerned by reports that this three-year approach does not happen as widely as it could; calls on local authorities, NHS boards and the wider public sector to take a three-year approach as a general rule, and further calls on the Scottish Government to encourage the application of the joint statement on the ground and to review how widely the three-year approach currently happens in practice.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689902", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector (Funding)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome that Liberal Democrat support.

Near the end, one of its managers said, almost in passing, that she was about to issue staff with their annual redundancy warning notices. That happened each year&#8212;most staff members were told that they were at risk of redundancy. I found that fairly shocking at the time but, having spoken since then to representatives of a number of organisations, I have found that that is not unusual. In essence, that was captured by Jackie Baillie, who mentioned that her time in the third sector involved nine months of working on the front line and three months of chasing the next funding opportunity. A combination of work since then led us to lodge a targeted motion on the issue of three-year funding, and for the most part it has been a targeted debate with good contributions from members all round the chamber.</p><p>Jackie Baillie got to the heart of the issue quite well when she said that three-year funding captures a broad consensus but that, despite positive efforts from the previous Scottish Executive and the current Scottish Government, we have not quite delivered it on the ground. Members on all sides need to look at that carefully, take responsibility for it and, most important, decide exactly how we can turn it around. There have been good intentions on the part of several Governments over at least a decade since devolution was given, yet three-year funding still does not seem to happen on the ground.</p><p>Although I entirely accept the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comment that we do not have an evidence base, we have good anecdotal evidence from many organisations. I would describe it as fairly heavy anecdotal evidence and it is almost exclusively in one direction, which leads me strongly to believe that, when we get the evidence base in front of us, it will broadly back up the sense that many of us in the Parliament have about what has happened and is happening on the ground. We can call it an audit of what is going on, a survey or an inquiry. The name does not really matter. It is critical, though, that the work happens fairly swiftly. We do not want it to happen overnight. At least, we want the thinking to begin overnight, but we want to get it right so that we start to solve the problem instead of simply looking as if we are attempting to solve it.</p><p>I hope that the work will show us who within the public sector is performing, because there are examples of good practice. Some local authorities do a very good job and some health boards have excellent examples of funding. Who is performing and who is not? What are the differences between the various elements of the public sector? What are the differences between local authorities? We should also consider the differences within certain local authorities, because at the round table there was some evidence to suggest that, even within a local authority, one department will perform well and give longer-term streams of funding but the department just next door will give only annualised funding or less. In some senses, what happens seems to depend purely on the personalities or processes of departments rather than being part of the wider culture that we all want to foster.</p><p>We have had useful contributions from across the chamber. The cabinet secretary rightly pointed out that three-year settlements are given by central Government, so there is no strong reason why we could not get three-year settlements from local authorities and other parts of the public sector to the third sector. I listened carefully to what he said. If I wrote it down correctly, he said that he is willing to explore the issues of the extent&#8212;or not&#8212;of three-year funding. I take him at his word on that and hope that we will get announcements in due course. We do not want to be too hasty, but I hope that that happens sooner rather than later.</p><p>Margaret McDougall rightly made the point, as did my colleague Alex Fergusson, that rather than being about the level of funding or about more funding, the debate is about certainty and the ability to plan. She put it particularly well when she said that it is about people being able to plan securely so that they can build projects. I emphasise, as I think that she did, the word &#8220;build&#8221;. It is pretty hard to build something over the course of a single year. She gave an excellent local example&#8212;it is local to me; I do not think that it is local to her. If people are going to build projects, they need multiyear funding. They certainly cannot do it over the course of a single year.</p><p>I was interested in Kevin Stewart&#8217;s speech, because he has some good experience from his previous life as a councillor. He said that, in his view, annual grants did not deliver the goods on the ground. I was also interested to hear that, when the committee that he convenes looked at what was going on on the ground, it found a similar picture to that which was found by the Finance Committee.</p><p>I was also interested in Dennis Robertson&#8217;s speech. He said that, although the organisation that he was involved in had three-year funding, he recognised that many others did not. Having single-year funding precludes forward planning and takes away a little bit of the confidence and security that the organisation as a whole should have, as well as the confidence and security that is passed on to the service users of the third sector; we should all have those people at the front of our minds, because it is they who make this area so important.</p><p>In the main we have had a very consensual debate, which has been particularly refreshing for me as someone who is usually involved in fairly robust exchanges across the chamber. The issue commands widespread support, as it has done for some time, but it is critical that we move it forward.</p><p>The ball is in the Government&#8217;s court, and it is for the Government to reflect on how best to take the issue forward. I hope that we return to the issue soon and that we achieve a degree of progress, so that when we debate it in a year&#8217;s time we can say something different, and so that when we speak to various third sector organisations we will not hear the manager say, &#8220;I&#8217;m about to issue the annual redundancy notices.&#8221;</p><p>I was particularly taken by a statement from the SCVO briefing:</p><p>&#8220;These issues&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>homelessness, unemployment and reoffending&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;are generational yet public bodies fund them annually.&#8221;</p><p>Although we cannot fund them generationally, I hope that we can take a step forward by funding them for at least three years.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689902", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector (Funding)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was probably about five months ago that I attended what might be described as an outreach day, organised by the Finance Committee, when various committee members were sent to different parts of Scotland to speak to representatives of the third sector, local businesses and the public sector about employability and employment opportunities for people furthest from the labour market.

It is an important part of the economy, but I accept that it has in the past led&#8212;as I am sure it currently does&#8212;to tax avoidance, and the Government must strike a balance between those two aspects. As far as I can recall, no one who gave evidence said that sub-sale relief should be kept exactly as it is, but there was a strong view in the commercial sector that the relief&#8217;s wholesale removal was a bit of an overreaction and that there ought to be some exemptions.</p><p>I was encouraged by the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments on forward funding, and I hope that progress is made through an amendment at stage 2.

Indeed, we do not know any of the rates or bandings. That makes it different from simply putting up one of the rates or changing one of the bandings.

The independent budget review was published before a UK Government spending review and a Scottish Government spending review. At that point, the cabinet secretary was able to give the independent budget review projections for the universal services that we have been debating. I ask again: if that was possible then, why on earth is it not possible now to give us the data so that all members can have a serious debate on the issue?</p><p>The Finance Committee quite rightly picked up on that issue when we reported on demographic change.

With a budget that is pushing close to &#163;200 million, it is worthy of greater review.

However, as we all know, next year it goes up in cash terms.</p><p>The SNP is determined to discuss anything but the NPD programme; it wants to talk about anything and everything, except areas for which it is responsible.</p><p>Let us look at the facts. At the time of the 2011 spending review, the Government said that its capital spending would be between &#163;50 million and &#163;150 million in 2011-12, &#163;353 million in 2012-13 and &#163;686 million in 2013-14. What happened on the ground in 2011-12 was precisely nothing; the spending in 2012-13, we are told, will be &#163;20 million, instead of &#163;353 million; and the latest spend projections for the next financial year are &#163;338 million instead of &#163;686 million.</p><p>The Parliament and the country deserve an explanation. Initially, when it was clear that the Government had overpromised and underdelivered, its strategy was simply not to mention it in the budget or anywhere else. It said in the budget that it was accelerating the NPD pipeline; it did not admit that it was being decelerated. It said that the pipeline was so good that everyone else around the world wanted to copy what it was doing.</p><p>They also said that the figures were different because of a variance. However, when a Government says that it will spend &#163;353 million and only delivers &#163;20 million, that is stretching the definition of variance to quite a degree.</p><p>Since the Government has finally had to confront the issue, we have had numerous excuses for it. At First Minister&#8217;s question time, the First Minister&#8212;at least twice&#8212;said that it was the fault of the Aberdeen western peripheral route. However, when we got the Government&#8217;s official document about the forecast profile, it was clear that money was not projected to be spent on the Aberdeen western peripheral route until 2013-14. That does not explain the situation in 2011-12 or 2012-13, even by a penny.</p><p>Then it was the fault of the Edinburgh sick kids hospital, which the Government said was a big project that had been delayed for a number of reasons. However, when we got the Government&#8217;s official paper, money was not projected to be spent on that until 2014-15. That does not explain the position either.</p><p>Then we had a partially true excuse: the Government said that it was all down to the Borders rail link, because that project is worth more than &#163;300 million and that explains the difference. However, when we got the Government&#8217;s official paperwork, we saw that there was no spend on the Borders rail link in 2011-12 and that it accounts for &#163;39 million out of the &#163;353 million in the current financial year. None of those excuses explains the situation at all.</p><p>We move then from the incorrect to the inept. When the Scottish Government was asked for a list of projects that had been delivered, the First Minister stood up in the chamber and reeled off a list of 20 projects that had not been delivered&#8212;in most cases they had not even been started.</p><p>We heard from the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities at topical question time the reason given for the delays:</p><p>&#8220;These are large, complex projects that are being procured by a wide range of procuring authorities.&#8221;</p><p>Those were always &#8220;large, complex projects&#8221;; they were always</p><p>&#8220;being procured by a wide range of procuring authorities.&#8221;</p><p>We also heard from the Deputy First Minister that they are delayed because time was taken up on</p><p>&#8220;the preparation and design stages&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 5 February 2013; c 16357.]</p><p>That was always going to be the case: with any construction project in the history of the world, there is a preparation and a design stage.</p><p>We now know which broad areas were held up. We know that the areas in which there were delays and in which projects failed to happen this year&#8212;to which none of the excuses that have previously been given apply&#8212;were community health, to the tune of &#163;84 million; colleges, to the tune of &#163;65 million; schools, to the tune of &#163;119 million; and roads, to the tune of &#163;27 million.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684424", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Capital Projects"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has never been denied from this side of the chamber that, over the course of the spending review, the Scottish Government budget has been reduced in real terms.

If memory serves me right, I think that in a previous debate Mr Mason said on the record that at least the Conservatives had made some suggestions. He did not agree with them, but he is now nodding in agreement that he said in the past that we have, indeed, made proposals.</p><p>We are particularly concerned, however, about some areas in which the economy is not being prioritised. Clearly, one such area is colleges. We have all seen the depressing youth unemployment figures in Scotland and, indeed, across the rest of the UK, but we still see a drastic reduction in the colleges&#8217; budget for next year. According to the Government, the budget is &#163;546&#160;million in the current year and will be &#163;511.7&#160;million next year; a drop of &#163;34&#160;million in cash terms in a single year&#8212;a 6 per cut in cash terms at a time when the Scottish budget as a whole, much to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s disappointment, has seen a cash-terms increase of &#163;7&#160;million, which is a small increase, but a cash increase nonetheless.</p><p>We are particularly concerned about the Government&#8217;s approach to taxation. It started way back in 2007-08 when it introduced the small business bonus scheme&#8212;an excellent suggestion that has helped businesses across the country. However, since the Government was re-elected, we have seen it bring in the retail levy and the empty property rates tax, which punish the unlucky and those who are unable to let or sell on their properties.</p><p>We have seen an overreliance on business rates, with the Government believing that there will be a 7 per cent increase in the amount that it will collect next year and a 9 per cent increase in the amount that it will collect the year after that. However, when questions are asked about those figures, the Government refuses point-blank to share the figures with Parliament. Despite the Finance Committee last year and this year asking for more regular updates on collection rates of non-domestic rates, we get nothing except the annual projection and get the annual collection rates only after the event. We know as a matter of fact that there have been years in which the Government has not collected as much as it projected. That is why it is important that we as a Parliament have the figures.</p><p>We are all concerned about housing. We hear about the four additional tranches of investment, and the Government keeps emphasising the phrase &#8220;additional money&#8221;. However, the money, in fact, simply reduces the shortfall; it is not an actual increase in housing spending, at all. Over the three-year period, if the Government had kept the flat cash rates from 2011-12, &#163;800&#160;million would be going into housing. As it is, however, the sum will be &#163;650&#160;million. That is better than the &#163;450&#160;million that was projected, but it is still &#163;650&#160;million instead of &#163;800&#160;million. To suggest that that is additional is an interesting interpretation of the word &#8220;additional&#8221;.</p><p>There is no time at the moment to refer to capital projects, but I will return to the issue in my closing speech. I particularly want to talk about the non-profit-distributing model, which this Government has let the country down on by overpromising and underdelivering.

This Government has talked a very good game about capital spend for the past couple of years, but it has not been quite so strong on delivery.

Not only was the NPD pipeline delivering but he was accelerating what the pipeline was achieving, which is a curious interpretation of &#8220;accelerating&#8221;.</p><p>The cabinet secretary went on to say that he is &#8220;not disappointed&#8221; at all with the results and that the NPD model is so good that others want to copy it.</p><p>In response to the Finance Committee yesterday, the Scottish Government quite rightly made the point that an</p><p>&#8220;additional &#163;100 million of capital spending supports around 1,400 jobs in the Scottish economy&#8221;.</p><p>How does that compare with the figures on the ground? In 2011-12, the Scottish Government said that &#163;50 million to &#163;150 million would be spent through the NPD pipeline. How much was spent? Absolutely nothing. I ask the cabinet secretary: based on his &#163;100 million figure, how many jobs did the inactivity and sloth-like performance of the Government cost the Scottish economy?</p><p>In 2012-13, the Government said that approximately &#163;350 million would be spent. It turned out that that figure would not be &#163;350 million but &#163;20 million. Of course, last week the Finance Committee heard that it might not be &#163;20 million in practice&#8212;it remains to be seen.

We heard Kenneth Gibson say that everybody knows that it takes 18 months for an NPD project to come on site&#8212;everybody apart from the Scottish Government, it would seem. The NPD pipeline was announced in November 2010, which was 26 months ago. In that time, we saw nothing in the first year, we saw &#163;20 million in the second year and next year it is predicted that, at best, we will see about half of what the Government projected.</p><p>That is not good enough.

In the main, the amended bill is superior to the one that was presented at the beginning of stage 1, with a notable exception&#8212;which is, of course, the fact that the royal exemption has been removed. When I listened to the cabinet secretary at stage 1, I thought that I had found a kindred spirit who was a fan of the royal exemption. Alas, she made the error of listening to the majority of the committee&#8212;apart from me&#8212;and decided to remove the royal exemption.</p><p>It is most important that we hear from the cabinet secretary in her closing speech and, in the coming days and weeks, detail on the extension of the FOI legislation&#8217;s coverage and, in particular, on use of the order-making power under section 5 of the 2002 act, which she mentioned. I think that she has a clear understanding&#8212;as members of all parties have&#8212;that there is disappointment out there that the power has not been used since the FOI regime started.</p><p>I acknowledge the cabinet secretary&#8217;s use of the wording</p><p>&#8220;as soon as is practicably possible&#8221;,</p><p>but I intervened on her to get a handle on what that means in practice. That might be seen as splitting hairs, but given the issue&#8217;s background and history, and the fact that complaints have come from various parts of Scotland about the operation&#8212;or non-operation&#8212;of section 5 of the 2002 act, it is important that as much detail as possible be provided as quickly as possible about the initial stage, which she mentioned in her response to my intervention, and the second stage, to which she intends to progress. The more information that can be provided to the committee and made public, the better things will be for all concerned.</p><p>A number of amendments that were defeated would have strengthened the bill and made it a better package overall. Regardless of those amendments having been defeated, Conservative members will support the bill at 5 o&#8217;clock. The areas in which I thought a bit more work could have been done include the consultation process under section 5 of the 2002 act. I think that it was acknowledged by all that the initial definition was too narrow. The amendment that the cabinet secretary lodged at stage 2 was welcome; it definitely widened the consultation process. Despite that, Elaine Murray was right to point out the weakness that existed.</p><p>However, it was not just Elaine Murray&#8212;an Opposition member&#8212;who said that. As I pointed out, that was also the view of the Scottish Information Commissioner. At stage 2, having seen the minister&#8217;s amendment, the commissioner stated again:</p><p>&#8220;A weakness of the current provision is that it does not require consultation with the users of public services whose rights may be curtailed as a result of changes in public service delivery.&#8221;</p><p>I noted the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comment that consultations will involve members of the public, but given what the Scottish Information Commissioner has said and given that the amendment was not agreed to, it would be welcome if the cabinet secretary could outline in the coming days exactly how she intends to involve the general public, particularly in the initial consultation.</p><p>The other area that I felt could have been stronger relates to when the first report under section 5 of the 2002 act ought to be published, about which there was debate at committee. The initial proposal from Elaine Murray was that it be published in 2013, which I felt was too soon; I think that she acknowledged that it might be too soon. The bill initially mentioned 2016, but there was clear acknowledgement from the cabinet secretary that 2016 would be too late.</p><p>The position that Elaine Murray adopted in amendment 4 was a superior one. Agreement to that amendment would have given us a year and a half in which to report under the 2002 act&#8217;s section 5 order-making power. As I pointed out in an intervention, given what we heard about what the Government intends to do, there would be a great deal to report in a year and a half in terms of what the Government had done under section 5 of that act and in terms of progress. Amendment 4 is a missed opportunity.</p><p>I will be happy to return to those points in the closing speeches.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681662", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freedom of Information (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I find myself being somewhat less critical of the Government than the Labour Party has been, and than I anticipate the Liberal Democrats will be.

I think that we missed a trick today in not agreeing to Paul Martin&#8217;s amendment 12, on functions of the commissioner. Mr Martin proposed that the commissioner should</p><p>&#8220;prepare, publish and update as necessary a list comprising those persons or bodies who are Scottish public authorities&#8221;.</p><p>I thought that that was a fairly straightforward proposal, and I was happy to support it. Given that the amendment was not agreed to, I ask the cabinet secretary whether there is a way in which we can strengthen the partial list that currently exists. As a consequence of the vote on amendment 12, Mr Martin&#8217;s approach has not been put on the statute book, but is there a way of improving the list so that the objective that he sought to achieve can be achieved in practice? I hope that the cabinet secretary will address the matter, either in her closing speech or in the days to come.</p><p>I will bring my remarks to a close in a positive fashion because, as I said earlier, we will of course support the bill at decision time. I acknowledge that there are a number of big improvements in the bill. One is the move away from the three-year reporting period to a two-year reporting period. That is generally acknowledged to be fair, and I think that that was one of the few amendments that went through without a vote.</p><p>Section 5 of the bill, on time limits for proceedings, is extremely important, as the cabinet secretary said in her opening remarks. The change from six months after the commission of an offence to six months from when sufficient evidence of an offence comes to the knowledge of a prosecutor is crucial. There were potential investigations and prosecutions that did not go ahead simply because we ran out of time.</p><p>It was, possibly, inevitable that the previous arrangements would not work. If there are 20 working days to respond to a request, 40 working days to ask for a review if the response is felt to be unsatisfactory and 20 working days to review a response, that cuts a large slice out of the six-month period. The amendment that will be made by the bill that will no doubt be passed at decision time makes the legislation far stronger and gives real teeth to the prosecution.</p><p>I welcome the intention of the cabinet secretary in relation to various points that she alluded to this afternoon.

The phrase &#8220;Cabinet Secretary Fergus Ewing&#8221; has a nice ring to it.</p><p>When I first saw the motion, I had two observations. The first was to ask whether John Mason is a man of extraordinary power and influence because, on 8 October 2012, he lodged the motion, which cast doubt on the potential merger between BAE Systems and EADS, and days later&#8212;on 10 October&#8212;the deal was aborted. Some say that Angela Merkel put the final nail in the coffin; some say that John Mason had the larger influence.</p><p>Aside from that, I am slightly unsure about exactly what Mr Mason wants to happen. He gave us a list of mergers and acquisitions with which he was uncomfortable and which he did not think had succeeded. My view on Scottish Power and Iberdrola differs slightly from his; on many levels, that merger has proven to be successful and enduring. He was absolutely right about the merger of AOL and Time Warner&#8212;a corporate disaster that was so bad that a demerger took place afterwards. There is now no AOL Time Warner.</p><p>I got the impression that Mr Mason&#8217;s starting point was that mergers and acquisitions are potentially negative, in the main, and that UK or Scottish companies are more likely to be taken over than to take over others. I looked at an Office for National Statistics bulletin on mergers and acquisitions, to get a flavour of what happens out there in the marketplace. The most recent publication came out at the start of December last year. In quarter 3&#8212;the most recent quarter for which we have figures&#8212;outward mergers and acquisitions, which involve UK companies taking over overseas companies, amounted to &#163;7.8 billion, while inward mergers and acquisitions, which involve UK companies being taken over, amounted to &#163;8.6 billion. Slightly more UK companies were taken over than were taking over. In quarter 3 of the previous year, the figure for UK companies that took over foreign companies was &#163;6.8 billion, and the figure for UK companies that were taken over by foreign companies was &#163;5.1 billion. Therefore, I am not convinced that everything is one direction; things seem to ebb and flow year on year.</p><p>On the bald numbers, there were 736 mergers or acquisitions over &#163;1 million in 2010, and 896 mergers or acquisitions over &#163;1 million in 2011. Most of those mergers and acquisitions happened without comment. There has been no fall-out and there have been no negative consequences. Merger and acquisition activity is a normal and critical part of a successful economy.</p><p>John Mason is right to point out that there are dangers and that not every merger or acquisition will have a successful result, but the system that we have is fairly robust for most of the time. We have the combination of the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission. The secretary of state has limited&#8212;I stress the word &#8220;limited&#8221;&#8212;powers to intervene, of course. There is also the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, which is now on the 10th edition of its takeover code. It has more than 300 pages and the express interest is in having orderly mergers and takeovers and in protecting offeree shareholders. Therefore, the position is not entirely negative. That said, regardless of the system that we have, there will, of course, be some mergers and acquisitions that simply do not work.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681229", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mergers and Acquisitions"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That was a nice promotion, Presiding Officer.

As the convener pointed out, even in the best of economic times such individuals find it difficult to get a job, but in an economic downturn they are almost literally swept aside and find it almost impossible. Our report is therefore a critical piece of work.</p><p>I aim to focus my remarks on a couple of elements of the report that have been mentioned already, but they are ones in which there are gaps and weaknesses. I hope that the Government will respond to them today when the minister is summing up but, more importantly, I hope that it responds to them when it gives the committee its formal written response to the report in a couple of weeks.</p><p>The first element is the barriers to success. I and some other committee members were struck by the issue of single-year funding for third sector organisations. The convener touched on that during his remarks and, in the spirit of what the cabinet secretary called new and open thinking for 2013, it is vital that Parliament and the Scottish Government get a good handle on single-year funding for the third sector.</p><p>The Government has made all the right noises about the issue during the past couple of years. In evidence to the committee, Mr Swinney said:</p><p>&#8220;As increasing evidence will show, we have tried for some time now to expand the duration of financial support for third sector organisations.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 31 October 2012; c 1736.]</p><p>Again, to his credit and the credit of the Government, there is a joint statement on the third sector from the Scottish Government and partner organisations, which states:</p><p>&#8220;As a general rule funders will aim to take a 3-year approach to both grant and contract funding.&#8221;</p><p>Most members in the chamber will agree with that principle, but the critical point is whether those good intentions translate to what happens on the ground.</p><p>That issue was raised repeatedly with the committee, but usually in private session because individual third sector organisations do not want to get involved with it publicly. That is understandable: they do not want to upset the council or national health service trust that might be funding them, whether on a single-year basis or longer.</p><p>Nevertheless, the issue was raised repeatedly to the extent that at the committee&#8217;s workshop in Dundee one group stated that it was about to issue its annual notices to staff about the risk of redundancy. That was no exaggeration, and I do not think that anyone in this chamber can feel comfortable about the fact that a great charity doing tremendous work with those who are hardest to reach and have the most difficulty in accessing the labour market has to issue annual notices of potential redundancy.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s intention is absolutely right, but it is not synchronised with the reality on the ground. The general rule in the joint statement appears to be broken almost as much as it is observed.</p><p>I note in passing that in the briefing that it passed to all members for this debate the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations states very clearly:</p><p>&#8220;We would like to note that in our experience three year funding is rare to non-existent between local authorities and third sector organisations...</p><p>SCVO would welcome the Scottish Government examining the reality here and would be keen to work with the Government in any way possible.&#8221;</p><p>The committee took the same view. Although we praised the Government for some of its work, we felt that it is important that it carries out some form of audit or investigation on the extent&#8212;or lack&#8212;of three-year funding on the ground.</p><p>I do not expect a full response from the Government this afternoon but it would be useful to know its initial views on that conclusion and whether it intends to take it forward. It is vital that when it formally reports back to the committee we get a full and detailed response about its intentions&#8212;or, if it does not intend to do anything, why not. I have to say that the issue represented the biggest gap between what the Government was saying and what critical third sector organisations were telling us is happening on the ground.</p><p>The Government is getting a number of things right. However, in the very short time I have left&#8212;and I will return to this issue in my closing speech&#8212;I want to highlight the importance of looking at how the various initiatives, some of which seem to be excellent, are evaluated. When money is tight, we must ensure that every single pound is spent as wisely as possible.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680834", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, begin by thanking the convener of the Finance Committee, fellow committee members, our clerks and, particularly, all those who gave evidence to the committee on what is an extremely important piece of work and an ultimately fairly creditable report.

Weight has been added to that report by members who do not serve on the committee but who have brought to the chamber their individual experiences. I hope that that will help the Government to reflect on its formal response to the committee.</p><p>The importance of the issue cannot be overstated. Elaine Murray captured the spirit well when she quoted evidence to the Christie commission from the Improvement Service on the educational gap between the bottom 20 per cent and the top 20 per cent. She referred to what I think is the terrifying statistic that</p><p>&#8220;the bottom 20% at age 15&#8221;</p><p>are</p><p>&#8220;performing as if they have 5 years less schooling than the top 20%&#8221;.</p><p>That sends out the message loud and clear to all political parties in Parliament that much needs to be done. With such a large gap, an enormous amount of effort and time will be needed to achieve meaningful change, which is why the tone of today&#8217;s debate is extremely important. The solutions that we put in place will have to outlive the political cycle and, probably, several sessions of Parliament, if they are to make any meaningful difference.</p><p>I want to return briefly to single-year funding for the third sector, on which I focused in my opening remarks. Since I spoke, the Government has not had a chance to respond to my points, but I repeat that I hope that the Government gives serious consideration to the committee&#8217;s requests on that, and to what the SCVO said in its briefing for the debate.</p><p>Because of the removal of ring fencing in local authorities&#8212;a measure with which I agree&#8212;it is difficult for the Government to demand action, but it could make a big difference in outcomes by simply shining a light on the issue and by taking a confidential approach so that individual third sector organisations can speak up. I encourage the Government to do that as soon as possible. Many organisations signed up to the joint third sector statement, so the Government is perfectly entitled to ask why they are not living up to the ideals of that statement.</p><p>Another fundamental issue that was touched on in the debate and the report is how initiatives are evaluated. Again, the Government has made the right noises on that. At the Finance Committee on 31 October, Mr Swinney said:</p><p>&#8220;Underpinning all those efforts is an emphasis on getting the best possible value from the range of investments that we make.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 31 October 2012; c 1731.]</p><p>Evaluation is key, although I accept that a balance needs to be struck, because putting effort and resources into evaluation takes time and resource away from the front line. We do not want to overevaluate because that can hamper what we are doing, but based on evidence to the committee, evaluation is at present simply not taking place. Again, in evidence to the committee, Mr Swinney said:</p><p>&#8220;The Government has not undertaken a self-standing independent evaluation of all those programmes to then decide whether to continue funding.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 31 October 2012; c 1735.]</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm touched on a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation from 2010, which is entitled &#8220;The impact of devolution: employment and employability&#8221;. It is worth dwelling on a quotation on evaluation from that report. It states:</p><p>&#8220;At present, in relation to employment and employability, we can document much action, but little strong evidence of resulting improved access to jobs, earnings and progression in work&#8221;</p><p>when compared with a control group. The report implores the Government to look seriously at evaluation and to invest heavily in it, and the committee has reiterated that.</p><p>We need robust and independent evaluation of initiatives. Money is tight, so it is important that we get best value&#8212;not just good value&#8212;from the money that is spent. Many of the other issues that the committee considered depend on robust evaluation. Without serious evaluation, it is difficult to consider the relative successes of interventions, the barriers to success and what further action can be taken.</p><p>The final issue on which I will touch, which has been mentioned in a number of speeches, is how to improve business engagement. Improvements have been made in dealing with businesses over the past couple of years. There are some outstanding examples of businesses throughout Scotland getting involved in a number of initiatives, but there is a slight gap or weakness in engagement with smaller businesses. That gap is not only the Government&#8217;s fault; it is more difficult for such businesses to engage because the same person may have several roles in addition to trying to engage with young people. However, as Jamie Hepburn mentioned, the FSB said in its report that more businesses could take on young people who are furthest from the labour market. The gap may have been only 5 per cent or 6 per cent but, because of the difference that that 5 per cent or 6 per cent could make, it would be well worth the effort and investment.</p><p>I see that my time is at an end, so I shall leave it there.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680834", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had a useful debate on the Finance Committee&#8217;s report.

However, two points on the strategic review of the bank are worth noting and give us some hope for the future.</p><p>First, it is the bank&#8217;s intention to concentrate, in future, on its heartland, which it describes as Scotland and Yorkshire. If that intention is carried through at an operational level, that will be welcomed not just in Glasgow, which Drew Smith spoke about, but in other parts of Scotland.</p><p>Secondly, although painful short-term decisions are being made, we must hope that if a more sustainable and secure operation is created, that will be better for Scotland and the Clydesdale in the long as well as the medium term. Only time will tell whether the strategic review achieves that, but if it does, it will make the jobs that still exist more secure. In addition, it will&#8212;we hope&#8212;enable the bank to attract more business and start to grow successfully again.</p><p>I suspect that the minister is bound to address this when she sums up, but I would be interested to know, just for the record, what work the Government has done with the Clydesdale in relation to the redundancies, what meetings have taken place that are allowed to be talked about and whether any action is planned in the coming months to assist those workers who have lost their jobs. I suspect that there are some issues that cannot be discussed in the public domain, but I would be grateful for anything that the minister can put on the record.</p><p>It is important that the Clydesdale Bank succeeds in Scotland. It has an extremely good track record over the years. It is an important institution and it has been for a long time, as has been pointed out. We need the bank to succeed, for the good of the Scottish economy. It is a large employer, with branches and important centres all over Scotland. We must hope that that remains the case.</p><p>The future of the bank is also critical in the sense that we need competition in our banking sector. If we were to lose a large slice of the Clydesdale&#8217;s operations, that would make banking in Scotland even less competitive than it is at the moment, which, ultimately, would be bad news for business, particularly small businesses, which would have even less choice than they do today. Consumers, too, would have less choice.</p><p>For all those reasons, I hope that the decisions that the bank has taken prove to be sustainable in the long term, but I openly acknowledge that some short-term pain is being experienced, and I am sure that the effects on those who have lost their jobs and on their families will be remembered by members across the chamber at this time.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Clydesdale Bank Job Losses"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Drew Smith on securing the debate.

First, let me point out to the Scottish Government that it is the total budget that it is given that counts the most. It is within Mr Swinney&#8217;s gift to switch money from revenue to capital if he so desires and if that is the Scottish Government&#8217;s political priority.</p><p>Let us look at the NPD model, which has raised its head a number of times in the past couple of weeks. Back in September in this chamber, we were given the impression not only that all was going well with the NPD model and we were on track with everything that we had planned to do, but that we were accelerating and bringing forward capital spending for schools under the model. That was the narrative that the Scottish Government sought to weave but, my, how it has unravelled over the past couple of weeks.</p><p>The Scottish Government originally said that up to &#163;150&#160;million would be spent under the NPD model in 2011-12, but in reality zero pounds were spent in that financial year. We were told that in the current financial year &#163;350&#160;million would be spent under the NPD model, but just a month ago we were told in evidence by the cabinet secretary that &#163;20&#160;million would be spent. That is not the fault of councils, the present UK Government or UK Governments in the past; that is entirely down to the Scottish Government&#8217;s political priorities and the fact that it is not pushing the NPD model. Just for good measure, the amount spent next year was initially to be &#163;774&#160;million but will actually be about half of that: &#163;338&#160;million.</p><p>It is about time that the SNP Government took a share of the responsibility for the position that the construction sector finds itself in. Kenneth Gibson quoted the Scottish Building Federation, which also said:</p><p>&#8220;To suggest that this budget, or any budget at this time, could be a budget for growth in the construction sector is out of touch with reality.&#8221;</p><p>Although it acknowledged the UK Government&#8217;s reductions in capital spending, it described in Scotland a</p><p>&#8220;constipated ... procurement system.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 26 September 2012; c 1630, 1618.]</p><p>That is not the fault of the UK Government; it is entirely the fault of the Scottish Government, which has not got capital projects moving.</p><p>Even yesterday, when we were told how the &#163;205&#160;million or so was going to be spent, the Scottish Government was unable to tell us exactly when the projects were going to happen, other than at some time in the financial year 2013-14. That is not good enough. We have seen the sloth-like performance of the NPD model under this Government; the construction sector deserves far better.</p><p>Yesterday, the Scottish Government could not even tell us which of their shovel-ready projects do not have planning permission, but at First Minister&#8217;s question time today the First Minister boldly asserted:</p><p>&#8220;the shovels are in the ground&#8221;.</p><p>On Wednesday the Scottish Government could not tell us which projects have planning permission; on Thursday it could tell us that the shovels are in the ground.

He genuinely believes that there is no profit in the non-profit-distributing model. He and the other SNP back benchers are going to be devastated when they find out that it is capped profit instead of no profit. I have to say that, up to now, it has been no profit, but that is basically because it has no been happening since it was announced in December 2010.</p><p>Yes, the NPD programme has taken a little bit longer than we expected. It was announced in December 2010 and re-announced in September 2011, when the figures were put in front of the Parliament. Something happened during that year to reduce use of NPD almost to zero. The figure is a mere &#163;20&#160;million in the current financial year. The cabinet secretary stood up in the chamber and said that he is not disappointed by that because there is &#163;900&#160;million in procurement, yet he told the Finance Committee that, next year, &#163;338&#160;million will be spent. Apparently, there is &#163;900&#160;million in procurement, but only &#163;338&#160;million will be spent in the financial year 2013-14. That is the first thing that the Government has failed badly on when it comes to capital spending.</p><p>Its other big-ticket item to win back Scotland&#8217;s economy is the magical resource-to-capital plan. Apparently, more than &#163;700&#160;million will be shifted from resource to capital during the current spending review period to create jobs. There are just a couple of flaws in the suggestion. One is that a big slice of the money comes from savings from the Forth crossing, so Mr Swinney is saving money from one capital project, putting it into others and somehow describing that as a transfer from resource to capital when it is, of course, simply from capital to capital.</p><p>The other flaw concerns the enterprise agencies. More than &#163;200&#160;million over two financial years&#8212;the current year and next year&#8212;was going to be transferred by the enterprise agencies. However, we heard recently that the figure is not &#163;200&#160;million at all but is going to be only &#163;99&#160;million. We have lost &#163;101&#160;million of transfer from resource to capital over the course of a year. At the same time, with the other hand, the cabinet secretary is demanding money for shovel-ready projects because the enterprise agencies have lots of them. Perhaps if they transferred the money from resource to capital that they said they were going to transfer, there would be no need for the money for the enterprise agencies&#8217; shovel-ready projects.</p><p>The central question that the committee asked was whether the budget is a budget for the economy. That is the yardstick by which the Scottish Government wanted to be judged. Indeed, a week before the budget was announced, Mr Swinney said:</p><p>&#8220;I guarantee I will squeeze every penny out of the money we have available to us to boost the pace of recovery and to support the hard pressed households of Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>The central theme of the Finance Committee&#8217;s investigations was to look at whether the budget is a budget for the economy, and we found evidence in favour of that proposition. There was an evidence-taking session at which evidence was presented, or asserted, that it is a strong budget for the economy. The only difficulty for the Government is that all that assertion came from one person&#8212;it came from the cabinet secretary himself, who said that he believes that it is a budget for the economy.</p><p>It was difficult to find one single other organisation that genuinely believes that it is a budget for the economy. The Scottish Council for Development and Industry stated in its written evidence:</p><p>&#8220;it is difficult to discern a pattern of spending which aligns with successive Scottish Executive&#8217;s/Scottish Government&#8217;s top priority/purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth.&#8221;</p><p>The Centre for Public Policy for Regions stated:</p><p>&#8220;Spending on the ... NHS ... budget has ... been favoured at the expense of others&#8221;.</p><p>It added:</p><p>&#8220;Whilst this meets the election pledge of passing on the UK Health Barnett consequentials, it is less clear how it helps secure faster economic growth&#8221;.</p><p>Perhaps most damagingly of all for the Scottish Government, the Finance Committee&#8217;s own budget adviser said:</p><p>&#8220;Given the relative changes in other budgets, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that maintaining current spending on health is currently the main priority of the Scottish Government.&#8221;</p><p>The committee was encouraged to investigate the claims as to whether or not this was a budget for the economy. When we look at what is happening to colleges, for example, at a time of high youth employment, it is difficult to suggest that this is a budget for the economy. When we look at what is happening to housing, with the construction sector on its knees, it is difficult to say that this is a budget for the economy. When we look at the new taxes&#8212;the retail levy or the empty property tax&#8212;it is difficult to see how those support the economy. When the Government increases the amount that it expects to take in business rates by more than &#163;200&#160;million a year, year on year, it is almost impossible to say that this is a budget for the economy.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I stand to make my closing speech, I have fresh in my mind the speech of Mike MacKenzie, who tickled me rather towards the end of his speech when he said of NPD that the clue is in the name.

Therefore, the Scottish budget as a whole is going down by 0.5 per cent while the college revenue budget is going down by 6 per cent. That shows the priority that the SNP Government gives to colleges. It is its political choice to reduce the college budget and to reduce it year on year.</p><p>There have been interesting contributions from SNP back benchers. Joan McAlpine claimed that the FSB is behind what the Scottish Government is doing, and there were claims that the SCDI is behind what it is doing. During the debate, I sought those organisations&#8217; written submissions to the Education and Culture Committee. The FSB said:</p><p>&#8220;We recognise the need for colleges to operate more efficiently and for greater collaboration however we are concerned about a decline in further education spending, despite additional allocations in the 2013-2014 budget.&#8221;</p><p>The SCDI said:</p><p>&#8220;SCDI members remain concerned that despite&#8221;</p><p>the increase in the 2012-13 budget,</p><p>&#8220;the long-term trend for college funding is a substantial cut.&#8221;</p><p>The organisations that were quoted in defence of what the Government is doing therefore said something quite different in black and white in their written submissions to the Education and Culture Committee.</p><p>Several members have proposed that the way to get through things is to spend the reserves. It is true that I was critical of those who suggested that as the primary way forward last week. There will be a cut of &#163;34 million in the next financial year, but we see from the budget that there will be a further substantial drop in the year after that&#8212;in 2014-15. The budget will not be &#163;511 million; it will be down to &#163;470 million. If the answer is to spend the reserves, it could mean that half of the reserves are spent in only two financial years in trying to plug the gap that the Scottish Government has created. I do not understand how anybody can suggest that that is a sensible way forward and a sustainable solution to what the Scottish Government is imposing on the college sector.</p><p>Students are worried about what is going on, and staff are extremely worried, too. It is absolutely clear that, next year, the Scottish budget for colleges will go down substantially in revenue terms. I call on the cabinet secretary to acknowledge in his closing speech the fact that the college budget will go down substantially next year and substantially further the year after that.</p><p>I also call on the cabinet secretary to start to be a champion of the sector.

However, it does matter. The figure was 374,000 just two years ago and has gone down to 305,000. If it is, as Mike Russell seems to think, just one of those volatile things, is he suggesting that when we get next year&#8217;s figure it will have gone up by 70,000&#8212;or is it more likely that the figure will have gone down again?</p><p>We had a couple more corkers from the Government and SNP members over the course of the afternoon. I find it a little churlish to dismiss entirely that which went before. Yes, the college system was not perfectly run before; yes, things ought to change; and yes, we should always strive to be better. However, to dismiss the system almost in its entirety does a great disservice to many wonderful staff and students across the country. Mr Russell said that there was division among staff before he came along. Well, the great healer has united parties in this chamber and staff the length and breadth of this country&#8212;just not in the way that he thinks. To describe, as Mr Russell and Joan McAlpine did, part-time courses as hobby courses does an enormous disservice. If any SNP member wants to stand up and tell the chamber which hobby courses ought to be cut and which colleges are running hobby courses, I will agree to the request with alacrity.</p><p>It is difficult to pick the most absurd comment that was made, but I note that Angela Constance and Marco Biagi think that the solution to our college crisis is to spend the reserves. We should not worry about what might come in the future; if we spend those reserves, everything will be absolutely fine.</p><p>The budget that is given to the colleges is extremely important. At First Minister&#8217;s question time last week we heard the First Minister trying to wriggle free by comparing the current college budget with the college budget under the previous Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive&#8212;not that Executive&#8217;s last budget, though, but the budget from 1999. He suggested that because the budget that the colleges are getting next year is bigger than the 1999 budget they should feel jolly lucky and fortunate about all that they have. I had a quick look at the last budget from the Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive. In 2007-08, funding for FE colleges was &#163;526 million. In 2014-15, at the end of the spending review, the funding for FE colleges will be &#163;470 million. That is a pretty big reduction from 2007-08.</p><p>We have heard this said time and again, but it is worth repeating the real-terms position on colleges: there is a real-terms cut to the Scottish DEL budget over the spending review period. We have said that in the chamber before and Liz Smith said it again today. There is in fact a 6 per cent real-terms cut to the Scottish DEL budget over the course of the spending review. However, the real-terms cut to colleges between 2011-12 and 2014-15 is not 6, 10 or 12 per cent, but 24 per cent. If colleges are genuinely a priority for this Government, how on earth can it have a 24 per cent real-terms cut for colleges when there is a 6 per cent real-terms cut in the budget as a whole?</p><p>It is not just Opposition parties that are worried about what is happening to colleges. We have heard a number of quotes from SNP members over the course of the afternoon, but what is interesting is that the only quotes that they could produce were those that supported in principle the idea of mergers, regionalisation and change. What they have been unable to quote is a single source that thinks that next year&#8217;s college budget is a good idea. Those two things are not the same. Jeremy Peat, who gave evidence to the Finance Committee on 3 October, said:</p><p>&#8220;I like the structural changes that are going through and I believe that substantial efficiency gains can come from them but, as I said earlier, I worry about whether the resource will be available for the skills development end of FE on a lifetime learning basis. You&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>he was addressing the committee&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;should ensure that that is addressed as a priority, because it is important.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 3 October 2012; c 1678.]</p><p>The Education and Culture Committee heard from Professor Jim Gallacher that it would be difficult to maintain the quality of provision under the current circumstances. As Mary Scanlon pointed out, when Audit Scotland looked at the issue in greater depth, it said that</p><p>&#8220;the Scottish Government should provide a clear assessment of the expected benefits and costs of regionalisation including structural change, how these benefits contribute to its reform objectives and how costs are to be funded&#8221;.</p><p>We had not had that from the Scottish Government and we still have not had it.</p><p>Elizabeth Smith outlined in her motion one of the consequences of the savage cuts to college budgets. If we have drastic cuts, we will narrow access instead of widening it. I have touched already on the decrease in the total headcount over the course of two years. However, as Elizabeth Smith pointed out, there has been a 26 per cent decline in female students since 2007 compared to a 13 per cent decline in male students.

The figures are pretty stark. The unemployment rate is about 24 per cent for those aged 16 to 24, 7.5 per cent for those aged 25 to 34, and 5.4 per cent for those aged 35 to 49. The stark contrast between the age groups is poignant when we look at the size of the youth unemployment cohort.</p><p>Any Government, whether in Scotland, the UK or elsewhere, has a difficult balancing act to achieve in the actions that it takes. All of us want quality and quantity at the same time, but within the finite funds that are available in the budget given to the minister, there is a decision to be made about how much should be invested in quantity&#8212;getting as many people as possible out of the dole queue and back into work&#8212;while trying to focus on the people whom we have heard about, who are furthest away from the labour market and who have been out of work for months or years. At times such as these, when there is such a high level of youth unemployment, those who are furthest away from the labour market have a real problem and are swept away by the tide of other people moving into unemployment.</p><p>I accept the Scottish Government&#8217;s good intention in appointing the Minister for Youth Employment. I acknowledge the budget and the figures that the minister mentioned in her opening remarks. I also acknowledge that many areas that affect unemployment and youth unemployment in particular are not under the control of the Scottish Government or, indeed, even the UK Government&#8212;we are affected by what goes on in Europe and the rest of the world. However, for the purpose of the debate it is worth focusing on where we have powers and the various schemes that have been put forward by the Scottish Government. I will go into a bit of detail on some of those initiatives and pose some questions, not putting criticism out there for the sake of it but looking at how things might be applied in 2013-14 and 2014-15 as opposed to what has happened in this year.</p><p>The first part of our amendment calls on the Government to think carefully about the initiatives that it puts forward and the criteria for deciding which initiatives to run with.

That decision may turn out to have been a good one. Once the money is applied and the results come in, we may look at it with hindsight and decide that it was a great decision and that we should have done more of the same or that we should do more of it in following years.</p><p>The difficulty that I have is that the decision was taken to give the money to the councils before any agreement was reached on what would be done. Simply giving money, whether to councils or any other part of society, without working out what we are trying to achieve with that money is not wise policy or practice.

Members of all parties have put useful contributions into the mix.</p><p>I noted in particular Elaine Murray talking about the confusing landscape. It is not easy for employers&#8212;particularly smaller employers&#8212;to work out what opportunities exist so that they can get involved.</p><p>I, too, attended a workshop on Friday last week as a member of the Finance Committee, in Dundee. At that workshop, an owner of a small business made the point that they are in charge of human resources and health and safety, and that they also have to deal with the payroll, win business and clean the office. Trying to find ways to make things as easy as possible for all businesses, particularly smaller businesses, to engage is critical.</p><p>Elaine Murray also talked about transport difficulties in rural constituencies. She gave two anecdotal examples, but I suspect that the problem is far wider. Such problems probably translate across much of the country.</p><p>My colleague Alex Johnstone talked again about labour mobility and made points that ought to be taken on board.</p><p>John Park, as ever, made a fairly thoughtful contribution. He focused in particular on skills utilisation and leadership and management aspects that are sometimes missed.</p><p>The convener of the Finance Committee, Kenneth Gibson, rightly focused most of his remarks on those who are furthest away from the labour market. The Finance Committee is involved in an inquiry into that matter. Those people can be easily forgotten because it is far easier, quicker and cheaper to get those who are on the edge of the labour market back into it than to get into it those who may be several years away from even getting close to it. However, we forget them at our peril.</p><p>Liam McArthur from the Liberal Democrats touched on two issues that probably deserve a bit more exploration&#8212;certainly in the future, if not today. A good look at the distribution of modern apprenticeships in the public and private sectors and a breakdown of them among large, small and medium-sized companies in the private sector would be helpful so that we have a better handle on things. I note in passing that the matter was raised at the Finance Committee and the minister&#8217;s written response was based on work that was carried out in 2006. That work was useful and it may give us an inkling of where we are now, but it ought to be updated sooner rather than later.</p><p>On the key themes, I must touch on colleges, which have featured in the debate. I did not labour on them in my opening speech, purely because the minister in front of us does not have specific responsibility for the budget for colleges, but they have been a key feature of the debate that I must comment on. According to the draft budget, there will be a cut in the colleges budget in 2013-14. It does not matter how that is dressed up; there will be a pretty substantial cut from the budget in 2011-12. We can talk about how colleges were well funded in the past and how we would like to do more, but the reality is that, even taking into account efficiency savings, transformation and mergers, there will be a cut in the teaching budget for our colleges in particular.</p><p>It is not just politicians who make that point. Yesterday, at the Finance Committee, Professor Jeremy Peat commented on the issue. The Official Report of the meeting is not out yet, so I cannot quote him directly, but he stated that he was worried about the resources for the skills development end of further education as he did not feel that it was sufficiently resourced. If I have slightly misquoted him, I apologise, but I have not seen the Official Report of the meeting.</p><p>It is not good enough for Mr Crawford to stand up and say that the SNP is meeting its manifesto commitments. Since the manifesto was written, youth unemployment has got demonstrably worse and far worse than most of us anticipated. That is the reason for having a Minister for Youth Employment, which was a response to the situation. For the SNP to say that it has met its manifesto commitments is of little comfort to the almost 100,000 people who are sitting out there unemployed.</p><p>The other big theme that was picked up by members from every party and mentioned by the minister is the frustration of employers. There is a crowded landscape out there, with many initiatives. For many employers, it is difficult to work out what is going on. I hope that, as I requested at the start of the debate, we will get an update in the minister&#8217;s closing speech on the SDS skills force and the idea of a one-stop shop, so that if we have a similar debate in several months&#8217; or several years&#8217; time, employers will be able to say that there is a difference on the ground. It is not how many initiatives we put out there that matters; it is what employers say to us. Only if they are impressed by it and it works for them will it work for people looking for jobs.</p><p>I have a final point that has not featured heavily in the debate, but I would be grateful if the minister could address it, even briefly. An announcement was made in May this year about &#163;25 million coming from European structural funds. In June, Alex Neil, who was then Cabinet Secretary for Capital Investment and Infrastructure, said clearly that the &#163;25 million</p><p>&#8220;now fully approved by Scotland&#8217;s Programme Monitoring Committee, almost doubles the funding that the First Minister announced in December&#8221;.</p><p>Given that it was &#8220;fully approved&#8221; in June, can we have an update on the position of that &#163;25 million so that we can see what actions are being taken?</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674359", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been wide ranging, interesting and productive.

If we are honest, the debate on universal services is not one that any member wants to have. People like universal services. Inaction on those services feels like the path of least resistance and, in the short term, it most certainly is. It is not a debate that we want to have, but it is a debate that we need to have. I agree with what Johann Lamont had to say on that point. We must take some decisions now, and we must look into the issue extremely carefully.</p><p>Why? First, universal services cost substantial sums of money. In a report last year, Audit Scotland said that the combined cost of free personal care, eye tests and travel was around &#163;870 million a year and rising. That is not to say that the Conservative Party or any party in the Parliament wants to get rid of any of those services as the Deputy First Minister suggested&#8212;I make that absolutely clear&#8212;but it means that we should look at how they operate, including the age limit and other criteria that make people eligible for them. Holding that view does not mean automatically that we want to get rid of them.</p><p>Those services cost a lot of money. At the same time, we face a tough environment for public finances, with demographic change coming in behind it. Between 2008 and 2033, the number of people aged 60 or over will rise by 50 per cent, and the number of people aged 75 or over is set to almost double. If we are honest, we know that doing nothing is not an option. It is not good enough just to make a stump speech about independence. It is important to look carefully, critically and analytically at the issues.</p><p>Today, the Scottish Government has given the impression that it is not open to any discussion on any universal service. Let us look at bus travel, on which the Deputy First Minister gave the impression that there is no chance of anything changing under the SNP. A couple of years ago&#8212;in 2009&#8212;in its own review of the Scotland-wide free bus travel scheme, the Scottish Government concluded:</p><p>&#8220;there may be a case in the future for examining the value for money of concessionary travel for those passengers over the age of 60 in full time employment&#8221;.</p><p>One of the final recommendations in that report was</p><p>&#8220;That further work should be undertaken specifically to examine the long-term sustainability of the Scheme.&#8221;</p><p>In 2009, the Scottish Government accepted that the system could be reviewed and that the age criteria could be changed over time, but in 2011, just before the Scottish Parliament elections, it was suddenly against the idea and felt that such changes would be a terrible crime. Ever since, the Government has made it sound as though anyone who questions concessionary travel automatically wants to remove it. What a lot of rot, given the Government&#8217;s own words a mere three years ago.</p><p>The reason why it is so important to examine our universal services is that they are primarily demand driven. With the very best of intentions, we have created demand-driven engines in our budget. Professor David Bell said:</p><p>&#8220;the big thing about universal services is that they are open-ended commitments. I think that they should be revisited every five years to see whether they remain affordable.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 25 January 2012; c 578.]</p><p>It is also important to look at the afford-to-pay principle. We heard some discussion of that and we heard some examples of people who benefited from the concessionary travel scheme&#8212;Nicola Sturgeon gave an excellent and perfectly fair example. However, we also hear examples of people who can and are perfectly willing to pay but who do not pay because they have free bus passes. We could trade examples, but let us look at what the former Auditor General for Scotland had to say. He is someone who did not just assume that millionaires did not go on the bus although they have bus passes. He said:</p><p>&#8220;the cost of providing free transport to people who are over 60 and still in employment is &#163;34 million or so.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 25 January 2012; c 587.]</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673958", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have no comment to make on that&#8212;I am genuinely stumped.

Our particular concern involves the changes to empty property relief under the non-domestic rates regime. Although the changes will protect industrial property and listed buildings, they will almost extinguish the discount for empty commercial property, taking it from the&#8212;broadly accepted, to be fair&#8212;50 per cent down to 10 per cent.</p><p>We have three main concerns about the policy. First, it will not make any positive difference, it will not achieve the policy objective and it will not get empty properties back into use. Everyone in the chamber and most people across Scotland wish empty properties to be brought back into use. However, the prescription from the Scottish Government simply will not work and will not have any impact.</p><p>Secondly, not only will the policy not make a positive impact, but it is fairly clear that it will damage our economy and make it more difficult for it to grow when the upturn begins.</p><p>Thirdly, the policy has a cost to the public sector&#8212;something that was missed by the Scottish Government when it introduced the proposal. The bill suggested that the cost to the Scottish Government would be minimal because it has only 12 properties to be concerned about. That idea was knocked on the head the first time that the Finance Committee considered the bill, when it was gently pointed out that Scottish Enterprise has several hundred empty properties, and the cost to that agency alone could be pushing &#163;500,000.</p><p>Underpinning all that&#8212;it is the reason for a lot of the negativity and the bad ideas&#8212;is the fact that the Government undertook no formal consultation on the measure. It consulted formally on all other parts of the bill, including a part that will cost only &#163;750,000 a year and affect only one council. That part of the bill was deemed worthy of consultation, but a proposal that will affect thousands of properties, will affect every public sector agency in Scotland and will cost the business community millions of pounds a year was not deemed worthy of consultation by the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government has to explain to us clearly why the proposal was specifically excluded from the consultation on the bill. This has all happened when sales of commercial property in Scotland have slumped by 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>My first substantive point is why I do not think the measure will achieve the policy objective. Paragraph 4 of the policy memorandum states that</p><p>&#8220;Reform of empty property relief will provide incentives to bring vacant commercial premises back into use and raise additional revenue for the Scottish Government.&#8221;</p><p>That is a fairly loose definition of the word &#8220;incentive&#8221;. Clobbering them with a tax does not sound to me like an incentive to bring properties back into use.</p><p>The policy has two objectives: to bring vacant properties back into use and to raise additional revenue. Most people&#8212;even people who are not sceptical&#8212;feel that most of the Scottish Government&#8217;s emphasis is on the latter; it is about the money.</p><p>However, helpfully, Derek Mackay, the minister in charge of bringing forward this part of the bill, gave evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee a short while ago. When I read the Official Report of the meeting, I was interested to see that Derek Mackay had stated:</p><p>&#8220;If it were just about income generation at the expense of the business community, we would not be progressing it.&#8221; &#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 30 May 2012; c 1070.]</p><p>The Scottish Government and the minister in charge of the bill therefore accept that, if all that the measure does is raise additional revenue, it should not be taken forward. To win the argument today, and in the coming weeks and months, the Scottish Government therefore has to demonstrate clearly how the measure will bring vacant commercial property back into use, because, by its own admission, the measure should not be only about additional revenue; indeed, the Government would not introduce the measure if that was all that it was about.</p><p>We have asked repeatedly how many properties would be brought back into the fold. It turns out that the Government has made no attempt to model that. The bill team stated:</p><p>&#8220;we cannot say that we have seen any evidence in Scotland on whether the incentive works&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 2 May 2012; c 1070.]</p><p>In addition, having observed four years of evidence in England and Wales, the bill team was unable to present any evidence that the measure might have had any impact south of the border.</p><p>To correct the record, when the First Minister answered my question on the matter at First Minister&#8217;s question time, he said that 5,500 properties would be brought back into use as a consequence of the bill. I put the question to him very specifically. However, the 5,500 properties are the number of commercial premises that would immediately be hit by the tax. That does not mean that a single property will be brought back into use. The figure of 5,500 properties is the number that would be clobbered by the tax.</p><p>There is a basic misunderstanding on the part of the Scottish Government about why the properties are empty. They are empty because of market conditions and lack of demand. I accept that there will be exceptions, and during the evidence sessions individual members pointed to examples in their constituencies, but the vast majority of landlords want to let their properties. That is the meat and drink of what they do. If they are not letting out a property, they are not generating an income. Landlords want tenants, but the market is weak. The measure punishes landlords who have been unlucky and who have been hit by the downturn and the recession, without doing anything positive to bring the properties back into use.</p><p>The direction of travel in Wales seems to be the opposite to that in Scotland. The Welsh Government, which has had such a measure in place since 2008, has had a business rates review undertaken by an independent group. The independent report, which was published last week by the Wales business minister, said:</p><p>&#8220;We have not come across any examples in Wales where property owners have intentionally left property vacant; indeed pressure from insurers and the risk of holding vacant property are ample enough incentive to re-let.&#8221;</p><p>There we have it. The measure will not bring empty properties back into use. There is no evidence whatsoever that that will be the case, and there is a fundamental misunderstanding by the Scottish Government about why those properties are empty.</p><p>That is bad enough, but on top of that, the measure is quite likely to cause damage to the economy. Various properties have been demolished in other parts of the United Kingdom. In some cases, it was cheaper to demolish the property&#8212;no rates were paid at all as a result of that&#8212;than to pay the additional tax. A report by Lambert Smith Hampton on behalf of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said:</p><p>&#8220;there has been an increase in the demolition of perfectly sound properties ... largely as a result of their liability to Empty Property Rates&#8221;.</p><p>Therefore, there could be demolitions.</p><p>A reduction in speculative activity is also likely. If we want more premises, including commercial properties, to be built, there must be speculative activity, but the Scottish Government&#8217;s measure will choke off the development of new business space because substantially more will have to be paid for vacant rates. That is a big deterrent for speculative commercial development. It has an impact on the viability appraisals and is an extra contingency to be built in at a time when the sector is finding things extremely difficult. Our view and the view of industry is that the industry does not need extra punishment, and certainly not at this time.</p><p>The measure sends out a signal to the world and the business community at large that the Scottish Government will impose new taxes on a whim without consultation. I think that I am correct in saying that empty property relief was not mentioned in the Scottish National Party&#8217;s manifesto, which was published not that long ago and on which, admittedly, it won a fairly healthy majority. I stand to be corrected on that, but I had a good look through the manifesto. Why was the measure not mentioned in that manifesto if the SNP intended to introduce it? I am pretty sure that the First Minister will not mention it to the business community in the United States as something that the Government is proud of bringing forward. I am sure that that will be deeply hidden from everyone everywhere.</p><p>The measure will damage the economy and will not do anything to bring empty properties back into use. That is the key for the Scottish Government. Can the Government demonstrate at all that the measure will put properties back on to the market? There will also be costs to the public sector; we can return to that later.</p><p>I am very happy to move,</p><p>That the Parliament is concerned by the Scottish Government&#8217;s plans to substantially reduce empty property relief for non-domestic rates through the proposals in the Local Government Finance (Unoccupied Properties etc.) (Scotland) Bill; is deeply concerned that the Scottish Government has introduced this proposal with no formal consultation and without making a business and regulatory impact assessment; notes the Finance Committee&#8217;s report on the Bill&#8217;s financial memorandum, which concluded that, &#8220;the Committee finds it surprising that the [Financial Memorandum] makes no attempt to estimate the number of commercial properties that will be brought back into use as a result of the Bill&#8217;s empty property relief proposals&#8221;; believes that reducing the tax relief for empty properties will have a detrimental effect on business and the economy; notes that there will be significant costs to the public sector, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to abandon its proposed changes to empty property relief for non-domestic rates.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669778", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government (Empty Property Relief)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I bring to the chamber our deep concern with a part of the Local Government Finance (Unoccupied Properties) (Scotland) Bill.

Everybody knows the state of the country, everybody knows that the books have to be balanced and everybody knows the level of debt that the country is carrying. It is very easy for Scottish National Party members to say that the UK Government has to reduce VAT on tourism, but they have also called for reductions in VAT in a number of other industries and for an overall reduction in VAT, as well as for reductions in almost every other tax. It is easy to call for such a reduction, but how serious the SNP is about it remains to be seen.</p><p>I say to Dennis Robertson that it would be better for the Scottish Government to use the powers that it has instead of complaining about those that it does not. The Scottish Government has complete control over business rates, so it can adopt any policy that it likes on them. If the Scottish Government wants to pursue a policy that helps the hospitality industry on business rates, let us hear its proposals and what it has to say about that. The Scottish Government seems to have a lot to say about taxes that it has no control over instead of telling us what it intends to do with those that it does have control over.</p><p>I did not particularly want to get political, as it has been a positive debate but, when one is challenged like that, such a challenge has to be responded to reasonably and fairly.</p><p>I will comment on the new tourism strategy, which is an excellent document. As the minister said, it has been pursued by the industry, for the industry. That will be key to its success. A refreshed or new strategy was definitely required. Tribute has rightly been paid to the tourism leadership group and to the Scottish Tourism Alliance, which will take responsibility for driving the strategy forward.</p><p>What I think is right in particular about the strategy is that it has a new focus on the visitor experience across the entire journey instead of just part of it. It has a greater emphasis on leadership within and by the industry. By its nature, the tourism industry is potentially very fragmented. It is made up of an enormous number of small businesses, and we have seen it coming together over the past couple of years a lot better than it did five years ago, say. Given the strength of the strategy document and the leadership that the group has shown thus far, the industry can be less fragmented as it goes forward.</p><p>I think that it is also right to say that growth will come about by people having top quality experiences&#8212;with an emphasis on the word &#8220;quality&#8221;. As a country, we must compete on quality, not price. We are more Switzerland than Latvia in terms of the type of tourism that we are trying to promote. Quality does not have to be luxury, but the strategy quite rightly says that we must offer something that exceeds visitor expectations.</p><p>The other point that is worth making about the strategy document is that there are fewer key performance indicators, but we are looking at the indicators that matter&#8212;namely, overnight visitor spend and visitor satisfaction. Those two indicators will be looked at as the most important. There is a much sharper and finer focus than there has been in the past. The strategy also talks about progress being reviewed annually, with a more fundamental review after three years. Some of the risks that are faced in the tourism industry are acknowledged, and there will be a fundamental review after three years, once we start to get out of the downturn, as we all hope that we will.</p><p>I acknowledge what the minister said about the tourism statistics. The most recent statistics are definitely moving in the right direction, and the industry has to be applauded for that, particularly given the difficult year that 2011 was for just about every other industry. It is worth noting that our particular strength was in domestic tourism, in which spend was up by 16.4 per cent. International tourism spend was up by 2.4 per cent, but the number of trips was marginally down and the number of nights was down quite substantially. As things stand, the strength of the figures seems to have come from domestic tourism.</p><p>In looking forward, we must have one eye closely on what happens in the euro zone. Rhoda Grant touched on that in her opening speech. The pound is strengthening and the euro is weakening, which makes staycations more difficult to push. We must be very alert to that. As the pound strengthens, holidays in Europe become comparatively cheaper, and people may decide not to do staycations. We have to work hard to ensure that we keep getting the benefit of staycations. If the pound is stronger, of course, tourists from Europe will find it more expensive to come here.</p><p>I applaud the strategy and most of the motion, other than the point that I mentioned right at the start.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670079", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Visitor Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The minister made the same point, although he perhaps did not put it quite as robustly as Mr Robertson has.

Although Spain does not immediately require a bailout if it hits 7 per cent, if it is over 7 per cent for a sustained period, it is very likely that it will require a bailout, in the same way that Ireland, Portugal and Greece did.

On a purely personal level, I was particularly impressed by the speech given by David Stewart, who gave a sound analysis, perhaps not of how we solve the immediate problems but of some of the more medium and longer-term issues that the euro zone faces.</p><p>I will pick up on some issues that came through in the debate, which have to be corrected or pointed out for the record to make our position clear. First, the cabinet secretary said that he felt that the direct impact of a Greek default could be managed. He correctly referred to the statistic that only 0.8 per cent of our exports go to Greece. However, my first concern is that if the euro as a whole were to drop in value, which would be likely to happen on a Greek exit, that would have big impacts on all our trading partners, or on at least 45 per cent of our exports&#8217; worth.</p><p>Secondly, I question whether a default can take place in a vacuum and whether we need look only at the direct impact. Although we have put up various firewalls and so on, it seems to me not credible that there would not be a degree of contagion and that we would need to consider only the direct impact. There does not have to be wild contagion for there to be a big impact on the UK.</p><p>I will give just one example. The biggest funders of Greece are French banks, which have the largest exposure. In fact, their exposure is greater than that of all other investors combined and is about &#8364;41 billion; the UK banks&#8217; exposure is considerably less. However, the problem with the French banks is that they owe the UK &#8364;227 billion&#8212;they are the biggest group to owe us and our banks money. That compares with the &#8364;9 billion that Greece owes us. It would not therefore take a huge degree of contagion for there to be substantial impacts on the Scottish economy.</p><p>It has been challenged already, but I challenge again Rob Gibson&#8217;s comment that there would be an imminent run on the pound. Over the past couple of months the pound has strengthened considerably against the euro, as we all know. In addition, as a couple of speakers said, 10-year Government bonds today reached 1.74 per cent&#8212;the lowest in 318 years. It is therefore a far-fetched idea that there would be a run on the pound, given the situation as it stands at the moment, although obviously situations change.</p><p>Chic Brodie, who quite rightly gave way to Margo MacDonald rather than me earlier, referred to the McKinsey &amp; Company reports on Sweden and Finland and the previous banking crisis. His point has merit: there are lessons to be drawn from that crisis. However, I would be careful about saying that if we go down the austerity route, bad things happen and the economy never recovers, but that if we go down the route of putting more and more borrowing and money into the system, good things happen and the result is always a happy outcome.</p><p>Germany is deemed by many&#8212;indeed, by all&#8212;to be taking what might be called the austerity approach, including cutting welfare by &#8364;30 billion and cutting the budget deficit by &#8364;80 billion. It has extremely low unemployment compared with just about everyone else in Europe, including us. Germany is also getting growth: in quarter 1, growth in Germany was 0.5 per cent, while most countries in Europe, including us, saw negative growth.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667921", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Economy (Euro Zone Situation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had a productive and constructive debate, with good suggestions on all sides.

We have cut the deficit by a quarter in the space of two years. Although the overall debt is still growing, it is due to come down year on year once we reach a peak next year.</p><p>Points about the IMF have been made, but it is worth reiterating that Christine Lagarde&#8217;s report and the IMF article IV consultation concluding statement were fairly balanced. Criticisms were made, as others picked up on, but the IMF said that:</p><p>&#8220;Strong fiscal consolidation is underway ... Bold monetary stimulus has helped support the economy ...

I do not expect the cabinet secretary to stand up today and announce that the Government will do that, but I ask him to reflect on the point that there should be urgent meetings with anybody who has promised inward investment&#8212;who has made a commitment&#8212;and is not yet here. The Government should get those meetings set up at the highest possible level to see whether there is anything that we can do to provide a bit of security, to cut down on any risk and to help to ensure that any investments that may be on the cusp go ahead. We do not need too many withdrawals such as that of Doosan Power Systems for there to be a big impact on the economy.

The acceleration in the reduction in Scotland led to the figure being lower here than it is in the UK&#8212;as we heard, it is 8.1 per cent here compared to 8.3 per cent in the UK. However, we cannot get even remotely complacent about that statistic, and the cabinet secretary rightly said that the figure is still far too high. However, it was deeply concerning to read earlier this week about a report from the respected organisation the Centre for Economics and Business Research, whose regrettable prediction is that unemployment in Scotland will be higher than that in the rest of the UK at the end of the year. The prediction, which I certainly hope is wrong, is that the figure could remain higher until 2016. Although it was right to welcome the reductions, we must keep our eyes firmly on the ball and we cannot have a shred of complacency from any party in the chamber.</p><p>I want to discuss some of the things that the Scottish Government has done. As the cabinet secretary outlined fairly eloquently in his speech, the Government has done some good work. Certainly, the Conservatives would not deny that some very good work has been done. We approve whole-heartedly of the small business bonus&#8212;we pushed for it to be accelerated when it was first introduced. We think that the appointment of a Minister for Youth Employment is a positive move and we support it. We think that the focus on exports is absolutely correct. Although we did not support the recent budget as a whole, I certainly approved of the increase in funding for Scottish Development International, which was a critical measure.</p><p>It was good to hear good news on exports. Of course, we must be nervous about that, too. Although we have had success, and although we do not really compete on price as a country and therefore have to compete on quality, the move of sterling against the euro and the dollar in the past couple of months is a cause for concern. Sterling is now 3 per cent higher on a trade-weighted basis against the euro than it was in February and it is projected to continue in that direction, because we are seen as a safe haven.</p><p>There are positive points, but my critique of the Scottish Government is that it is not using every lever at its disposal to try to move the economy forward. That is the yardstick by which the Government has asked to be judged. In my view, as we have said already, the cuts to college funding were definitely a step backwards at a time when youth unemployment is so high. At a time when the construction industry is struggling hard in Scotland, the cuts to the housing sector, which were addressed in the budget debate, were a mistake. As I said at length in the chamber, I feel that the retail levy, which makes Scottish retailers less competitive than those in the rest of the UK, was a backward step that sent out the wrong signal.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666719", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Government Growth Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There has been much talk in the chamber today, at First Minister&#8217;s question time and earlier in this debate, about the elections last week in Scotland and in France, but we have not yet heard any mention of the most critical, or I should say the most worrying, election that took place last week from an economic point of view, which was the one in Greece.

It proposes to bring in that measure without any form of impact assessment or consultation whatsoever. The measure has not proved to be successful elsewhere&#8212;indeed, the Welsh Government is reviewing the policy as we speak, and its consultation made it extremely clear that the measure had not been successful. Further, not even the Government&#8217;s documents estimate that it will put any properties back on the market. Last week, the First Minister claimed that the measure would put 5,500 properties back on the market but, if he had read his bill and his Government&#8217;s documents, he would have realised that 5,500 is the number of properties that would be due to pay the tax, not the number that would come back on to the market.

We had a number of wide-ranging sessions that covered a breadth of issues, but we barely scratched the surface of what can and must be done in the next few months and years.</p><p>The subject of the committee&#8217;s first session was demographics, on which a number of members have touched. The OBR put it neatly when it said:</p><p>&#8220;the public finances are likely to come under pressure over the longer term, primarily as a result of an ageing population.&#8221;</p><p>At the start of the debate, Kenneth Gibson gave us the statistics about the large increases in the number of people aged 65 and over and even greater increases in the number of people aged 85 and over. The number of people aged 85 and over will have increased by 38 per cent by 2016 and by 144 per cent by 2031. That will have an impact on our public services, regardless of who is in Government and who is sitting in the Parliament. That must be borne in mind for every policy that we put forward from now on and for the existing policies that we need to review in the coming period.</p><p>Although that is, in many ways, obvious, I was struck by an observation made by Professor Charlie Jeffery when he gave evidence to the committee. He said:</p><p>&#8220;A decade or more ago, we were in danger of painting older people as a terrible problem and a fiscal calamity that faced us all. However, we have quite successfully moved to a different concept of older people as active citizens who make a valuable contribution to our society.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 11 January 2012; c 473.]</p><p>Although policy makers have to take many points on board, Professor Jeffery&#8217;s observations are worth having at the front of our minds, because a 65-year-old in 2012 does not compare to a 65-year-old 30 years ago. Because of advances in medicine and the increase in life expectancy, somebody aged 65 today can make a far bigger contribution than someone aged 65 could just decades ago.</p><p>Every member who has spoken so far has mentioned preventative spending. I am happy to acknowledge the work done by the Scottish Government and, in particular, John Swinney, in the last budget to try to create a shift of both money and the overall culture towards preventative spending. It is important that that be monitored very closely. The funds that John Swinney mentioned are a positive step, but we must ensure that that money is spent on genuine preventative spend instead of plugging gaps or being spent on emergencies.</p><p>That point was well made by the SCVO when it gave evidence to the Finance Committee. It felt that in one of last year&#8217;s funds&#8212;this is only its view&#8212;only 18 per cent of the money was going into preventative spend. I know that the cabinet secretary disputes that figure, but it highlights the point that we must monitor very closely whether the money that we say goes to preventative spend actually goes to it.</p><p>That also means that we must have a tighter definition of exactly what we mean by preventative spend.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fiscal Sustainability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I suppose that I am slightly biased because I sit on the Finance Committee, but I think that the work that the committee has carried out in the past couple of months is extremely important and will play a valuable role in the work of the Parliament and the Government.

With a finite source of money, if money is shifted to preventative spend from elsewhere, somebody, by definition, loses out in the short term.

I hope that closing speeches spend more time on the latter than on the former.</p><p>Regarding the substance of the debate, I will focus my closing remarks on improvements to data, evidence and tracking. I will look at some of the challenges that have been outlined and I will speak about universal services. The debate, thus far, has been a little one-sided on services and does not reflect the evidence to the committee, so I will begin with universal services.</p><p>It was fascinating to observe the round-table evidence session, because the panellists and the arguments they put forward were finely balanced. There were strong arguments in favour of retention of universal services and there were equally good arguments, not on the abolition of universal services&#8212;far from it&#8212;but on reform of some universal services.</p><p>The points in favour of universal services have been well made by a number of members. One point was in relation to administration costs. A move to a system of means testing, as Jeremy Peat pointed out, could save &#163;50&#160;million on benefits, but the spend on administration could be &#163;40&#160;million, which would almost entirely wipe out the saving. A quotation from Professor Jeffery about the fixation on headline costs came up several times.</p><p>That view has to be balanced against other contributions that were made by equally eminent people on the panel. Professor Bell said that they are &#8220;open-ended commitments&#8221;. The fact is that they increase year on year&#8212;sometimes dramatically and sometimes out of proportion to what was expected when the bill was passed and the measure was introduced. In many cases that increase is likely to be accelerated. His view is that universal services ought to be</p><p>&#8220;revisited every five years to see whether they remain affordable.&#8221;</p><p>Jeremy Peat, who made the point about the cost of administration, put forward his view that the benefits should remain in place until &#8220;year X&#8221;&#8212;as he described it&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;and would continue beyond that date only if the Parliament took a positive decision to that effect.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 25 January 2012; c 578, 581.]</p><p>He therefore put the burden on Parliament to make a positive decision and to examine the policy properly, instead of allowing it to continue automatically.</p><p>The costs of concessionary travel, for example, have increased year on year and out of proportion to what was expected when the policy was introduced. There are difficulties with means testing, to which Margaret Burgess referred when she spoke about the people in their 70s who rely heavily on their bus passes. However, there are ways to restrict access to the scheme without using what might be defined as means testing related to income. For example, one could move the age up from 60 to reflect the fact that many people who are in their early 60s are working. One of the professors who gave evidence in committee pointed out that he has a bus pass, which he thinks is a waste of public money because he is earning what is, in his view, a perfectly good salary.</p><p>The threads of the debate were pulled together in the phrase &#8220;opportunity costs&#8221;, which struck a chord with many committee members. If we start to do one thing, what can we no longer afford to do? We should not be considering simply whether what we are doing is a positive use of public money, but whether it is the optimum use of public money. For that reason, we ought to debate universal services in greater detail. The debate in committee was much more balanced than the views that have been put forward so far in today&#8217;s debate.</p><p>On the challenges, I return to some of the comments that were made earlier in the debate. When we move to a preventative spending agenda, we must accept that it takes time to get results. It can take five or 10 years to do so, which is way longer than electoral or political cycles. In addition, I reiterate that the agencies that gain are not always the ones that invest. For example, a local authority might make an investment but see no benefit to its budget, even over the course of time, while the financial benefit to the NHS in that area might be huge. Similarly, an intervention by the NHS might not benefit it at all financially, but might save the justice system a considerable amount.</p><p>My final point is one to which I hope the cabinet secretary will return in his closing remarks. The convener talked eloquently about social impact bonds, on which the committee spent a considerable amount of time and on which the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, Apex Scotland and Addaction gave positive reports. The convener asked the cabinet secretary to update the chamber on the Government&#8217;s position on social impact bonds, and I hope that he will take the opportunity to do that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fiscal Sustainability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I make the observation that the debate might have been slightly better had the percentage of time that was spent on independence and Westminster been reduced and the amount spent debating the comprehensive issues that were examined by the Finance Committee increased.

The campaign was excellent and it was won on merit. The campaign was critical, because when it came to the crunch the decision was pretty close. If we look at the secretary of state&#8217;s decision, which was published on 8 March, we find that of the 32 locations that applied, 26 were eliminated because they could not match the criteria that had been set down, which brought the number of competitors down to six. We comfortably beat Birmingham, Milton Keynes and Peterborough, which left Edinburgh, London and Manchester. The review panel gave London a perfect score in all categories, but the competition between Edinburgh and Manchester was tight. In our view and the Parliament&#8217;s view that was not a close contest and Edinburgh was streets ahead, but Edinburgh ended up with 115 points and Manchester ended up with 100 points. That shows just how important it was that people united. It was the thrust and momentum of the campaign that made it happen.</p><p>The next steps are critical. We need early recruitment of a chair and senior independent director. We need the right people, but we need them early. The Parliament and the Scottish Government ought to be champing at the bit to meet the chair and independent director as soon as is practicable after their appointment.</p><p>The bank must focus on making an early and a lasting impact. As Alison Johnstone said, &#163;200&#160;billion of investment in the energy sector is needed if we are to meet our targets. The bank has a fraction of that amount, so it is critical that everything that it does has an impact and that it focuses on areas in which it can make a genuine difference, instead of spreading itself too thinly.</p><p>We should all ask ourselves what we can do to speed things up and get the bank up and running as quickly as possible. What does the bank need in terms of office space, infrastructure and recruitment? Are there things that the local authority, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government can do to assist the process? How can we best support the bank&#8217;s work, not just here but throughout the United Kingdom? The bank must serve the whole UK, even though there are many opportunities just in Scotland.</p><p>We all joined together to win the bid, but that was just the beginning. The work on the real prize starts now and we all need to pull together in the same direction. There is a big opportunity. We could become the epicentre for Europe&#8217;s renewables, as the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce suggested.

However, it is important to note what else Moody&#8217;s said around that negative outlook, which is why I intervened on Mr Wheelhouse.

The Edinburgh bid was pulled together from several areas of expertise in a highly professional fashion. We should not pick out favourites and give special praise, but mention should be made of the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, which I think was first out of the traps in spotting an opportunity&#8212;I see Sarah Boyack nodding and I acknowledge her previous comments about the chamber of commerce. The chamber seized the initiative and pushed the issue, to the extent that things probably went further and faster than they would otherwise have done. Indeed, Edinburgh had a professionally produced draft business case ready well in advance of the formal call for business cases.</p><p>Edinburgh has many strengths. A look at the assessment criteria that were published in December, to which the minister referred, shows that Edinburgh scores particularly highly across the board. The criteria are</p><p>&#8220;(i) The ability to recruit and retain staff with the necessary specialist expertise ...</p><p>(ii) The quality of the transaction &#8216;ecosystem&#8217; in the locality;</p><p>(iii) Cost effectiveness considerations.&#8221;</p><p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills described the criteria as being set out</p><p>&#8220;in descending order of importance&#8221;.</p><p>Therefore, although cost effectiveness is important, the ability to recruit and retain staff with the necessary expertise is the number 1 criterion for BIS.</p><p>When we delve a little deeper into criterion 1, we find that BIS talks about three important groups of experts,</p><p>&#8220;Financial services experts ... Green economy experts&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;Other professional experts&#8221;,</p><p>and highlights that the financial services industry is extremely important&#8212;perhaps more important than the other two areas.</p><p>The minister&#8217;s comments about Edinburgh and Scotland&#8217;s financial services industry were well made. It is well known that Edinburgh has the fourth largest financial services industry in Europe. We are rich in relation to pensions, life assurance, investment management, banks, insurance and asset servicing. Across the spectrum of financial services, Edinburgh scores extremely well. I have not seen the other 31 bids or the formal bid from Edinburgh, but it will be difficult for any of the 31 to beat Edinburgh on financial services expertise.</p><p>On the call for green economy experts, a number of organisations in Edinburgh, including Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, have shown green thought leadership. During the past couple of years, the Scottish low-carbon investment conference, which was attended by ministers and numerous VIPs from around the world, put Edinburgh on the map. The green investment bank would add to that. We have the technical and engineering skills and we have the universities, as the minister said. I am told that there are 11 universities within an hour&#8217;s drive of Edinburgh. I have not seen all the detail, but I am led to believe that, across those universities, there are no fewer than 87 low-carbon and environmental research units.</p><p>With regard to the second main criterion, which is the ability to work closely with others&#8212;or what is described as the &#8220;transaction ecosystem&#8221;&#8212;the assessment criteria paper points out that</p><p>&#8220;Specialist businesses have a natural tendency to form clusters in particular locations to optimise their performance.&#8221;</p><p>It is almost as if that had been written with Edinburgh in mind. After all, we are strong in financial services, green energy and the infrastructure that will be required for the green investment bank.</p><p>Edinburgh also scores pretty highly on the third criterion, cost effectiveness, particularly in relation to one of the other potential riders and one of our biggest competitors for the prize: London. Obviously, we score far more competitively than London in that regard.</p><p>As I have said, Edinburgh was first out of the traps, producing a very strong business case before it was required. The bid has pulled together all the political parties and organisations across Scotland, and the Scottish Conservatives are very happy to vote with the Government and very much hope that Edinburgh&#8217;s bid is successful.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Investment Bank"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There are occasionally debates in the Parliament in which all members pretty much agree with one another on the substance and it is extremely difficult to disagree with a single word of the Government motion.

I am sure that I picked the comment up correctly, but I would like to know who is ahead of Mr Swinney on the pile, if he is only one of the best.</p><p>I will pick up on some important points connected with the order and local government finance for next year and the coming years.</p><p>I turn first to the general resource grant. A number of times, SNP members made the point that, at 37.2 per cent, the local government share of spending will be higher in 2012-13 than it was when the SNP came to office. However, all parties&#8212;not only the Government&#8212;must focus on the direction of travel for local government in the spending review.</p><p>Yesterday, we voted on only the 2012-13 budget but, according to the spending review that was published in September last year, the cash that goes to local government for revenue, as opposed to capital, will decrease from &#163;7.7 billion to &#163;7.3 billion while, at the same time, the overall departmental expenditure limit resource budget will goes from &#163;27.9 billion to &#163;28.5 billion.</p><p>That, of course, could be subject to spring and autumn revisions but, in his closing speech, the minister ought to give us his analysis of the direction of travel for the local government budget over the next three or four years, given that its amount of cash is predicted to go down as the Scottish Government&#8217;s amount of cash increases. That suggests that the 37.2 per cent figure will inevitably drop. Will it, potentially, drop to below the level that it was at when the SNP came to office?</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives welcome the business rates incentivisation scheme. We had a similar policy a couple of years ago called the business dividend fund. However, my slight concern is that the targets have been set fairly high and there is a danger that, although the policy may look good on paper, only one or two&#8212;or, potentially, none&#8212;of the 32 local authorities will end up getting any money back through the scheme. I accept entirely that, if the bar is set too low, it will not incentivise people, but I am slightly concerned that it has been set particularly high, given the current climate. Is the Government willing to share its prediction for what each local authority will get through the scheme?</p><p>We have touched on the retail levy. I do not intend to dwell on it because, as the cabinet secretary said, the separate order relating to it has been laid before the Parliament today. Nevertheless, I return to Kenneth Gibson&#8217;s view that the levy will have no impact whatever on jobs. His justification for saying that was that Asda announced last week that it is creating some jobs, and he asserted that there is no evidence that the levy will have any impact. However, the Scottish Government has failed repeatedly to carry out a business impact assessment on the retail levy. That is not a difficult concept&#8212;it is Government policy to carry out such an assessment in relation to most orders and other legislation that it introduces. It has carried out impact assessments on many other orders that would have a much smaller impact on the economy. It is beyond belief that it has failed to carry out an impact assessment on the levy.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2012 [Draft]"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This morning&#8217;s debate on the draft Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2012 has been interesting, although it has fluctuated at points between being a municipal hustings and a series of councillor retirement speeches.

I have tried to intervene on every SNP member so far&#8212;I tried to intervene on him a number of times&#8212;but none of them accepted an intervention.

Conservative members accept entirely that the Scottish Government will have less money in real terms next year than it has this year, but we point out that it will have more money in cash terms&#8212;&#163;250 million more&#8212;than it has this year.</p><p>The reason why the issue is important and why the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens have joined in with the Conservative Party today is the terrifying youth unemployment figures. As Elizabeth Smith said, 88,000 people between the ages of 18 and 24 are unemployed. That figure goes to well over 100,000 when 16 to 24-year-olds are considered. That number is particularly bad because it has increased by 20,000 in the past nine months. Since the draft budget and the SNP manifesto were pulled together with the aim of maintaining student numbers, the youth unemployment situation has deteriorated. That is why we need action on colleges.</p><p>We have heard about the magnitude of the cuts. In year 1, the cut will be &#163;38 million, but we admit and accept that that is negated by &#163;15 million from the transformation fund. However, that fund is for one year only. The cut will be &#163;50 million in year 2 and will go up to &#163;74 million in year 3. We ask the Scottish Government to explain why Scottish colleges will get such a large cut in their budget in comparison with the size of the overall cut. That is about political choices from the SNP; it should not blame the Westminster Government for cutting the budget as a whole.</p><p>We welcome the moves on youth unemployment that the Scottish Government announced yesterday in its draft strategy and we support the appointment of Angela Constance as the Minister for Youth Employment, but we need a bit of joined-up government. When we are trying to tackle youth unemployment, what is the point in giving Angela Constance a budget of &#163;30 million while at exactly the same time taking away &#163;40 million from the college budget?</p><p>I note that college funding will not decline in next year&#8217;s Welsh budget. That comes back to the point that the Scottish Government must explain why it thinks that the college budget deserves such a large cut next year in comparison with other parts of the Scottish budget.</p><p>We have heard that a multitude of organisations and people across Scotland are fighting for the colleges.

The sharp increases in inflation were not completely unanticipated and the reality is that the Government has more money at its disposal for next year than it has this year.</p><p>We should judge the SNP on its words. It claims that it wants to prioritise the economy and to use every lever that it has at its disposal, but when we look at what the SNP is doing in the budget, we find several gaping holes in that statement. The first of them relates to colleges. It is a pity that Mr Russell has left the chamber&#8212;well, I suppose that it is kind of a pity, although the jury might be out on that. However, there is a one-year cut in the college budget. The cabinet secretary boasted that the Government will spend &#163;500&#160;million on further education colleges over the next financial year. However, in the previous year, the college budget was the best part of &#163;550&#160;million and in the year before that it was considerably higher. The point is this: at a time when unemployment is dangerously high and when youth unemployment in particular is at its highest, with 88,000 18 to 24-year-olds in Scotland out of work, we are deciding to cut the college budget dramatically in a single year. That makes no financial sense. It is not only that; the cut will be &#163;74&#160;million by the end of the spending review period, which also makes no sense in the current financial climate.</p><p>For me, the second gaping hole is in relation to housing, because the housing budget is being cut from &#163;389&#160;million to &#163;300&#160;million in a single year. We have heard all the rhetoric from the Government and from economists about the importance of infrastructure and housing and the effect that they can have on the economy. However, in the draft budget the Government is making a very sharp reduction in the housing budget in a single year, and it will drop further after that.</p><p>I gently point out that the First Minister talked at great length earlier today about the fantastic mandate that he won in the May election last year, so I ask the SNP this: did it say in its manifesto last year that it would slash the housing budget from &#163;389&#160;million to &#163;300&#160;million?

In 2006, the high-interest pay day loans industry was worth hundreds of millions of pounds, but it is now worth the best part of &#163;2 billion a year, and probably more. There has been pretty rapid growth. According to the R3 research, which prompted Margaret Burgess&#8217;s motion, concern over debt levels is the highest ever recorded, with 60 per cent of the population concerned, and there has been an enormous increase in what are known as zombie debtors, who are those who pay only the interest on the debt and none of the principal sum. For people in such situations, any slight change in circumstances can plunge them into insolvency.</p><p>We also have fairly depressing research from YouGov, which shows that the average adult in Scotland racked up almost &#163;900 of debt in 2011 alone. Accountants PKF produced a paper this week and predict that, sadly, about 400 people in Scotland will go bankrupt every week in 2012 and estimate that, in total, about 20,000 people went bankrupt last year. The situation could get demonstrably worse if interest rates increase.</p><p>The debate is timely and I agree with much of what members have said, but the solutions are probably a little more complex than some of the solutions that have been outlined so far. The R3 research considered why people turn to high-interest pay day loans. Of those who did so, 39 per cent said that it was because they had been refused bank loans and 68 per cent said that they could not get credit anywhere else. For those people, there were no alternatives. As members have said, some people have the alternative of a credit union.</p><p>The high-cost credit sector across the UK is worth about &#163;35 billion per year, according to the Office for Fair Trading. At that magnitude, even the advances that we have seen in credit unions during the past couple of years will not come close to compensating for the size of the high-cost credit sector. Yes&#8212;credit unions are a part of the solution, and I hope that they are a growing part, but given the current size of the sector, it is not realistic to suggest that credit unions can take up all the slack.</p><p>Liverpool John Moores University recently published a paper that contains a quote that has stuck with me:</p><p>&#8220;The demand for credit is perennial and inelastic and unlikely to go away any time soon.&#8221;</p><p>The concern that was expressed in that report was that, depending on what it is, the danger of a rate ceiling is that all high-cost lenders will depart from the market, and the poorest and most vulnerable customers will lose any access to legal credit. As Kenneth Gibson said, those people are not borrowing money to spend it on glitzy presents but to spend it on their vital needs, and if they cannot access credit legally, the danger is that we will see a dramatic rise in illegal lending and an increase in loan sharks. I therefore caution slightly against some of the solutions that have been proposed, while agreeing entirely with the sentiment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658774", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High-interest Pay Day Loans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Margaret Burgess on securing the debate, which is timely for the reasons that Kenneth Gibson outlined.

She had intended to begin her speech by saying how disappointed she had been by the cabinet secretary, John Swinney, but after listening to him, she had to do a 180&#176; turn and say how enthusiastic she was about his speech. This morning, I had intended to begin by paraphrasing the former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, by saying, &#8220;I agree with Fergus&#8221;. Having listened to what the minister had to say, however, I will now have to change about three quarters of my speech. I shall outline briefly what I was going to say. First, it is right to praise the regulatory review group, which has done an outstanding job since it started. It has been ably led by Professor Russel Griggs, and he has an excellent team around him that has been drawn from trade unions, business organisations and farmers. It has done a very good job indeed.</p><p>Let me also praise the previous Government&#8212;the Labour-Liberal Executive&#8212;that set up the group in 2004, as well as the current Administration, which reinvigorated the group and took it a step further in 2007. It was ably led at that point by Jim Mather, and it has now been taken forward by Fergus Ewing. He arrives in post with a strong personal track record on regulation&#8212;he mentioned fire regulations earlier&#8212;and I hope that he will carry on in that vein.</p><p>That was what I had intended to spend most of my time on this morning, but I have changed that plan slightly and will now comment on the minister&#8217;s speech. He said that the one in, one out approach is illogical. Indeed, in response to a question from Tavish Scott, he said that it is something that his party has never supported. Let me quote from page 21 of the Scottish National Party&#8217;s 2007 manifesto; I know that Mr Ewing had a pretty big hand in writing that manifesto, particularly the parts of it that relate to business. It states:</p><p>&#8220;Finally, we would adopt the Better Regulation Commission&#8217;s policy of &#8216;One in, one out&#8217; meaning each new regulation must replace another.&#8221;</p><p>Tavish Scott asked Fergus Ewing when he had changed his mind on that, but the answer was not forthcoming.</p><p>When the SNP came into government, the regulatory review group took the view that, given the flow of regulation that was coming from the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government, it was not hugely enthusiastic about the one in, one out approach for Scotland. So, if the Scottish Government were to follow the RRG&#8217;s recommendation, I would say, &#8220;Fair enough&#8221;. To criticise the UK Government for going ahead with one in, one out and for adopting a degree of deregulation is pretty unfair, however. I would commend to Fergus Ewing the work that is being done by the UK Government and urge him to read the first-year report on one in, one out that it has recently produced. The report outlines the UK Government&#8217;s sensible approach, and shows that one in, one out has worked in that context. It might not have worked for the Scottish Government, but that does not mean that it is not a good thing for other Governments to do. Since the UK Government started, there have been savings to business of approximately &#163;3&#160;billion annually, which has been welcomed by businesses throughout the UK.</p><p>One such &#8216;out&#8217; is a measure that permits credit unions to communicate with their members electronically. That is estimated to have reduced the net cost to business by approximately &#163;10.4&#160;million. That calculation has been validated by the Regulatory Policy Committee. Some deregulation works and it does not all have to be about children going up chimneys. Certain examples, including the one that I have just given, can be particularly effective.</p><p>I turn to business and regulatory impact assessments. Rhoda Grant quite rightly read out from the regulatory review group&#8217;s 2011 annual report its view on how critical BRIAs were. On the page following the quotation that she read out&#8212;page 11&#8212;the group stated:</p><p>&#8220;In the light of the formal approach that RRG has received in recent times regarding the issue of Ministerial exemptions to doing BRIAs we will be looking particularly at how these have been used since BRIA started and if appropriate making further recommendations if we identify opportunities to enhance current arrangements and outcomes.&#8221;</p><p>A number of regulations have been introduced for which impact assessments have not been carried out. If the cost is genuinely disproportionate&#8212;if the BRIA will cost more than the regulation will save&#8212;an assessment ought not to be done. However, where it is clear that there will be some economic impact, there ought to be a regulatory impact assessment. That is the clear spirit that is coming from the regulatory review group.</p><p>The retail levy, to which the minister referred, is predicted to cost business &#163;110&#160;million over the course of the spending review. That is slightly more than the cost of carrying out the impact assessment, so according to the Government&#8217;s own guidelines an assessment should have been carried out.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My colleague, Mary Scanlon, learned yesterday of the dangers of pre-judging a debate or a speech.

In the current financial year, local government gets &#163;8.3&#160;billion in resource funding. Next year, the amount will go down to &#163;8.1&#160;billion. The year after, it will go down to &#163;7.7&#160;billion. In 2014-15, it will go down to &#163;7.3&#160;billion, which is a reduction in real terms of &#163;1&#160;billion over the course of the spending review. However, the cabinet secretary stands up in front of us today and says that the Government will maintain spending.</p><p>Whenever the Government talks about budgets being handed down from the United Kingdom Government, it is always in real terms. It never wants to talk about cash terms, particularly if budgets are going up; it only wants to talk about real terms.

The profit is capped, but it is not a non-profit model, as the party in charge often claims. Borrowing does not represent new money; all that it does is change the time at which the money becomes available. That could be very important but, at some time, those debts must be paid while, of course, the borrowing itself incurs charges.</p><p>As the Scottish Futures Trust said just the other day regarding capital spend, one pays for a facility as one builds it or as one uses it, but pay for it one must. We must take account of the fact that whatever limit is placed on borrowing and whatever figure goes into the revised Scotland Bill, any borrowing that is undertaken by the present or any future Scottish Government will, by definition, restrict the budgets of the Governments of following years. From listening to the rhetoric of SNP members, it sometimes appears that they see the &#163;5 billion figure as a target to be reached as quickly as possible, as opposed to a limit.</p><p>We must remember David McLetchie&#8217;s well-made point that borrowing by the Scottish Government will form part of the UK public sector borrowing requirement and that our powers must be exercised within that framework. The UK Government must take account of the size of the deficit.

When the Scottish Investment Bank was proposed, it was put forward as part of the solution to lending to businesses in the economic downturn. As something that could make a big difference to businesses on the ground, it received cross-party support. The Scottish Investment Bank was announced, reannounced with reduced funding and reannounced again with further reduced funding. It took two years for the SNP Government to set up a bank of &#163;50 million, so we in the Conservative Party will accept no criticism at all from it on the pace of change.</p><p>Nor will we take any lessons from the SNP on its economic theories.

Mr Biagi acknowledged, as did Sarah Boyack, the outstanding work that Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce has carried out in leading the Edinburgh green investment bank group. It is right to commend the business case that it produced, in conjunction with Grant Thornton. In producing that good piece of work, it was assisted by contributions and sponsorship from engineers, banks, professional services, utilities, lobby groups and academia. The involvement of all those groups demonstrates Edinburgh&#8217;s strength in relation to many of the Government&#8217;s criteria.</p><p>It is important that we focus on the three broad criteria that are set out on page 26 of the Government&#8217;s document &#8220;Update on the design of the Green Investment Bank&#8221;. The first is &#8220;Ability to fulfil the GIB&#8217;s mission&#8221;, the second is &#8220;Ease of access to the talent pool&#8221; and the third is &#8220;Commercial costs&#8221;. The first criterion involves close proximity to the players in the wider green and financial markets. It is clear that Edinburgh scores pretty highly there. With regard to private sector financiers, we are the fourth-largest financial centre in Europe, and Lloyds Banking Group and RBS contributed to the business case as sponsors. This city and this country are strong in banking, asset servicing&#8212;as we heard in an announcement last week&#8212;asset management, project finance, insurance and private equity. We have everything in Edinburgh with regard to private sector finance.</p><p>We are strong in project sponsors, by which the Government means utilities and waste companies. The business case was sponsored by two of the largest utilities in the United Kingdom. We are strong in specialist advisers, and we are strong in one of the other criteria: green thought leadership. Edinburgh, via the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, hosted the first ever Scottish low-carbon investment conference, which was an enormous success and gained us plaudits from all over the UK and Europe. Further, although it is based in Glasgow, Scottish Renewables is active in Edinburgh. That hugely impressive industry group can claim to exhibit green thought leadership. We are therefore strong on the ability to fulfil the mission.</p><p>We are also strong with regard to the second broad criterion, which is ease of access to the talent pool. We have always had a skilled and well-qualified workforce, and, as the business case points out, 11 universities are within one hour&#8217;s drive of the city and there are 87 low-carbon and environmental research centres in central belt universities.</p><p>The third criterion&#8212;commercial costs, which includes rental costs and the costs of recruiting advisers and employees&#8212;has also been touched on. Edinburgh&#8217;s rental costs per square foot are around half of those in London, so we are extremely competitive compared with London and most other cities in the UK.</p><p>Edinburgh has the critical mass of activity that is required to make an impact with the green investment bank. We are strong in financial services and we are strong in green energy. As others have said, the green investment bank&#8217;s identity will be more distinctive if it is located outside London. For all of those reasons, the Scottish Conservatives support the green investment bank being located in Edinburgh.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648175", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Investment (Edinburgh)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Marco Biagi on securing the debate and on his speech.

Each Scottish Administration since devolution has said that, but it is even more important this time around. In that regard, there was a lot to welcome in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s speech.</p><p>I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s brief comments about the Scottish Investment Bank and how it can be used to help exporters, which is crucial for the country. His comments about apprenticeships and training opportunities were welcome, too. I accept entirely his point that the private sector must be the engine for growth over the next few years. As a Lothian MSP, I particularly welcome the announcement by State Street, which came to Scotland in 1998 with a mere 50 employees. That number had increased to 750 by the time that the organisation appeared before the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee last year and, today, it has announced that the workforce is to increase to 840. That represents strong growth, not in a short spurt, but over a period of years from 1998. From the evidence that the company gave and from its deeds, it certainly appears that it is here for the long run. Asset servicing is sometimes the forgotten cousin of the financial services industry, but it is a branch of financial services in which Scotland is particularly strong&#8212;I think that it provides between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs&#8212;and we ought to celebrate the role that it plays in Edinburgh and across Scotland.</p><p>That is where we agree with the cabinet secretary, but I want to make a plea to him and to make a couple of positive suggestions, which he called for in his speech. My plea is one for realism. I ask that the Scottish Government and Mr Swinney and Mr Ewing, in particular, put forward the economic statistics about Scotland in a straightforward and realistic manner. Any Government wants to highlight the very best of what it is doing and to point to all the good news to which it can, but I fear that previously and, again, in some of what Mr Swinney said today, the SNP Government&#8217;s intention has been to comment only on the positive and almost to brush aside some of the negative aspects of the statistics that have come out.</p><p>We heard about the recovery plan saving 15,000 jobs, about Scotland going through a shorter and shallower recession and about unemployment in Scotland being lower than the rate in England, but we heard nothing about any of the negative news concerning our economy that has come out recently. We owe it to the people of Scotland and to the business community to put forward a balanced and realistic assessment of where our economy is going and to tell us how the Scottish Government is doing against its growth target&#8212;which was its number 1 target&#8212;of matching the growth rate of the UK by 2011. From 2011 onwards, rather than it being a case of Scotland trying to catch up with Britain, it should be a case of Britain trying to keep up with Scotland, but the cabinet secretary made no mention of that, nor did he mention the key, secondary economic target of matching the performance of the small European Union countries by 2017. According to the Scottish Government&#8217;s website, on the UK target, we are simply maintaining our performance, which has been poor over the long term, and, on the EU target, our performance is worsening. We must acknowledge the Scottish Government&#8217;s failures as well as its successes.</p><p>Turning to suggestions, I passionately agree with the cabinet secretary on the need to grow exports. One of the best ways of doing that is to internationalise and to grow our export markets by hitching ourselves to those economies that are already growing exponentially. Over the past decade or so, we have punched below our weight on exports. In 2001, Scottish exports represented 9 per cent of UK exports, whereas today they account for only 7 per cent of UK exports. We welcome initiatives such as the smart exporter initiative, funding for which the Conservatives fought to be included in the budget, but a step change is required. We must insist that SDI develops a far stronger focus on exports, as I think that it has had a stronger focus on inward investment, to the detriment of exports. That situation must be reversed.</p><p>We must give serious attention to how Scottish companies that want to export utilise SDI&#8217;s international network. At the moment, Scottish companies that want to go to the Baltics or to central or eastern Europe must do so via D&#252;sseldorf. How can we tackle eastern Europe through D&#252;sseldorf? We need a step change on exports.</p><p>The same is true of start-up businesses. We must increase the country&#8217;s business start-up rate, because those are the businesses of the future. There are only 34 VAT registrations per 10,000 people in Scotland, whereas the equivalent figure for the UK as a whole is 47. Although we have the same start-up rate as Wales, our rate is lower than every other UK region apart from the north-east of England and Northern Ireland. We must do more to address that. Entrepreneurship training is key to that, as is considering how we can get public sector contracts to SMEs. That was the purpose behind my question to the cabinet secretary.

I am sorry if it inconveniences George Foulkes to have to stay behind for two hours to discuss the issue, but so be it. It is critical that the Parliament discusses it and sends out a message on it. The situation could get worse. It is bad at the moment and we are suffering record high prices, but if we see an increase in taxation and the globally traded oil price, it will get worse. That is why it is important to send a message.</p><p>I will focus on three areas: the planned rise in taxation; the fair fuel stabiliser; and the derogation pilot for certain rural areas in Scotland and the rest of the UK. We made it clear in our election manifesto that we will consult on the introduction of a fair fuel stabiliser, which would cut fuel prices when oil prices rise and vice versa. It would ensure that families, businesses and the whole British economy would be less exposed to volatile oil markets and would ensure a more stable environment for low-carbon investment. Where we part company with the Scottish Government is on the pace of change. The proposal is far more complex than the minister gave credit for in his opening speech. He criticised the UK Government for things not having moved faster than they have, but I do not think that anybody in the world expected a fair fuel stabiliser to be in place so soon after the general election.

The areas that the pilot would cover have been outlined. Scottish National Party members have criticised the speed at which that has taken place. Again, however, getting that scheme in place is far more complex than it would first appear. As Alison McInnes said in her speech, not only is clearance required from the EU as a whole, but each individual member state in the EU has to agree to the derogation that the UK Government wants to put in place.

It protects many of the commitments that the Scottish Conservatives secured in previous budgets, and those are things that we continue to value highly&#8212;the 1,000 extra police officers across Scotland, the council tax freeze and, indeed, the small business bonus, which helps more than 70,000 small businesses throughout the country. I was reminded just last week, at the Federation of Small Businesses reception, how important and beneficial that policy has been. I spoke to businessmen at that event who said that their business had survived in the main because of that policy, so it is critical that it remains.</p><p>At stage 1, the Scottish Conservatives said that the Government had to do more on jobs and more to help grow the Scottish economy using the powers that we have, and that sentiment was echoed by the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee across the parties, so we welcome the measures that the cabinet secretary has put forward today.</p><p>In particular, we welcome the commitment to employment support for SMEs and start-ups and the &#163;10 million that is being allocated to that. It will be of particular interest to sole traders and microbusinesses that want to get over the important hurdle of taking on their first employee. About half the small businesses that are sole traders want to take on an employee but are nervous about doing so and need some assistance to give them that final push, and I think that the Government&#8217;s employment support policy will help them with that. It is particularly welcome that an allocation has been included specifically for exporters. Such measures will help this country to have an export-led recovery and to start punching above its weight again in exporting, and they will add to the excellent work that is already being done through the smart exporter initiative.</p><p>We welcome the announcements on housing. My colleague Derek Brownlee mentioned the evidence that the Finance Committee heard that doing more on housing would have a significant economic impact. The &#163;16 million that has been allocated to that is particularly welcome. I am told that it is estimated that the part that has been allocated to infrastructure connections could result in the creation of about 5,000 jobs in building new houses and getting mothballed projects moving again. That will certainly go down very well with the construction industry. The provision of more new-build shared equity and the extension of the open market shared equity scheme will allow first-time buyers to get their foot on the ladder, which is overdue.</p><p>We welcome the commitments to examine carefully the proposals to target absenteeism in the public sector. That is an important move. If the estimate of my colleague Derek Brownlee is right and just two days per year per employee were saved, that could lead to savings of &#163;130 million, which is a pretty substantial sum.

The SNP Government pushed forward the regulatory scheme and Mr Swinney was personally at the vanguard, but the Government could not be bothered to do an impact assessment of the tax.

His motion is positive. He used the word &#8220;innovative&#8221; to describe the proposal, which it is. It is also highly practical. I like the fact that it is designed to solve a specific, difficult and intractable problem. The motion is specific because it focuses on 16 to 19-year-olds, who have suffered disproportionately in the recession. Anything that could improve the lot of our young people must be explored, as Robin Harper&#8217;s motion says. It has been good to hear that everybody across the chamber is open-minded about the suggestion and thinks that it is definitely worthy of being taken forward.</p><p>Before considering the proposal&#8217;s strengths and commenting on it, I will say that the Conservatives concur with what Jim Mather and David Whitton said about the PSYBT, which is an excellent organisation. A couple of years ago, I read that Tom Hunter had said that if the PSYBT did not exist, it would have to be invented. That is absolutely right.</p><p>One reason why the timing of Robin Harper&#8217;s proposal is appropriate is that, in the current climate, a gap exists in the market because of the financial crisis. Many banks and other institutions are reluctant to lend and certainly to lend on the criteria on which they used to lend. Even some viable running businesses are finding it difficult to obtain credit, overdrafts and access to the facilities that they need. Those difficulties are magnified for young people who have no track record in business and who might not have access to other funds. A gap exists in the market in general and in particular for the people with whom Robin Harper hopes to connect in his motion.</p><p>There is a specific group of people who have no money and no access to capital or savings&#8212;all that they have is a terrific idea that could make money, put bread on the table and do far more than that. For such people, the suggestion of a Scottish youth microcredit scheme is strong.</p><p>As everybody has said&#8212;the motion also makes the point&#8212;it would be important to ensure that repayment rates were as high as they have been in other countries and to combine the funding with the suggested mentoring. In many cases, funds alone would be insufficient to ensure that a business thrived and succeeded&#8212;they would have to go hand in hand with mentoring.</p><p>We have talked about microcredit and small businesses, but it is important that mentors do not teach businesses to think small or in micro terms. Some businesses might end up only ever being small, but some might end up as gems. Duncan Bannatyne, who is a multimillionaire and who of course appears on &#8220;Dragons&#8217; Den&#8221;, started his entrepreneurial career as a young man simply by delivering newspapers to far more houses in his area than had previously received them. That entrepreneurial spirit, which was crafted at a pretty young age, along with a load of other attributes, led to his being a success. It is important that mentors do not think small, even though the initial sums will be small.</p><p>My time is practically up. The idea is good and should be explored.

A loss is bad news for any part of the country, but Scotland was the only part of the UK that experienced a cash loss in relation to exports over the period. Wales and Northern Ireland experienced small increases. London experienced a small decrease over the period, which was bizarre, but Scotland&#8217;s decrease was pretty sizeable.</p><p>The picture on inward investment over the decade is better. In 2000 we had 18 per cent of UK foreign direct investment, so we were punching well above our weight, as we continued to do in most years until 2007. In 2008 and 2009 we had only 8 per cent of UK foreign direct investment, which represents a big fall from 18 per cent, but if we consider our performance over the decade we find that it was pretty creditable. SDI ought to be congratulated on that. However, we must ensure that foreign direct investment does not remain at its 2008 and 2009 levels. I hope that some of the measures that the minister announced will take us some way towards increasing the level of inward investment.</p><p>Let us consider what we could do better. I highlight, as I think that the committee highlighted, the need to get far more companies in Scotland, particularly SMEs, exporting. The Bank of Scotland suggested last year that only a third of SMEs do any exporting at all and, more worrying, that only 2 per cent of the SMEs who do not export have any intention of doing so. We must achieve what the minister described as a step change in that regard. That is the single most important thing that must happen.</p><p>I welcome the smart exporter programme, which was launched last autumn and is due to run until 2012. The initiative represents a good example of collaborative working, although it is too early to tell how it will go. I think that the programme is projected to reach 8,000 companies throughout Scotland. I hope that that aspiration comes to fruition.</p><p>When the committee was writing its report it was my understanding that the smart exporter programme could not apply to the Highlands and Islands Enterprise area, because of the way in which the European funds are sourced. There were hopes that that would change, but I have not heard such a change being announced. It is possible that I have missed the announcement. I would welcome a response from the minister on the point.</p><p>It must be a central and core purpose of SDI not just to focus on the companies that it currently deals with but to get far more companies, particularly SMEs, exporting. In his letter to the committee on 12 October, the cabinet secretary said that, as soon as the new chief executive was in place, he would ask that person to write to the committee on the points that it had made, and on that specific point in particular. I ask the minister to pledge in his closing speech to take that forward. It is important that we get movement before the Parliament dissolves.</p><p>The report is positive. There are many suggestions in it and other members will touch on other suggestions that have been made. The picture has been mixed over a decade.

There is increasing demand, which is likely to accelerate, especially if the market for electric vehicles grows at the rate at which we hope it will as we decarbonise transport and heating. The consultation document suggests that electricity demand across the UK could double by 2050.

We need new entrants into the marketplace and new sources of finance.</p><p>The initial speakers from the Scottish National Party and Labour outlined the four main planks of the electricity reform consultation: carbon price support, feed-in tariffs, capacity payments and the emissions performance standard. Much of the debate so far has focused rightly on feed-in tariffs and the potential replacement for ROCs and I intend to focus most of my remarks on that subject too. However, before I do that, I will reiterate a couple of points about the consultation.</p><p>Like Lewis Macdonald, I was at the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee yesterday when Chris Huhne gave evidence to us. He made it clear that the UK Government does not have a firm set of policies at this stage and intends to consult. The consultation document backs up what Mr Huhne said to us.

However, it has made it clear that the premium tariff might be better.</p><p>Both Mr Mather and Mr Macdonald raised the substantive point about ROCs that we have had some flexibility in Scotland so we have been able to give more support to wave and tidal power, which makes sense. The potential in the Pentland Firth is probably greater than that anywhere else in the world. The map that I saw at the European Marine Energy Centre suggested that it was either the second or third best stretch of water for wave and tidal power generation on the planet.</p><p>Yesterday, Mr Huhne was candid in saying that concerns had been raised with him by the main trade body for renewables. He did not say whether that was Scottish Renewables or RenewableUK, but he was forthcoming and candid about the concerns. Mr Macdonald mentioned that Mr Huhne stated clearly that there could be a premium price or, if I heard him correctly, a range of premium prices to reflect the stage at which the technology was at the time. He stressed the view that one of the benefits of a contract-for-difference feed-in tariff was that there would be greater price certainty for all low-carbon sources of energy. Speaking as an economist, Mr Huhne said that such a tariff had the potential to lead to greater certainty for investors in the short and medium terms.</p><p>Shortly before attending this debate, I received the Scottish Power memorandum that was submitted to the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee inquiry. I do not want to rebut completely Mr Macdonald's point, but I will put another emphasis on it&#8212;although Scottish Power is not jumping up and down with its arms in the air demanding a feed-in tariff, it states that that could be a beneficial approach to investment in low-carbon technologies. It adds the caveat that there are major complexities and uncertainties still to resolve before it can be confident that such a <place-holder colnum=\"32222\"/> tariff would be workable. However, at this stage, Scottish Power is not saying that it is a particularly bad idea; it feels that it could have benefits even though there are complexities.</p><p>Given the terms of the consultation and what I heard the secretary of state say yesterday, it seems that there are enormous potential benefits in many of the reforms suggested. There are specific issues to work through, particularly in relation to ROCs, but the parallel systems proposed for between 2013 and 2017 provide some comfort. Those systems potentially give the option to new entrants between 2013 and 2017 either to go for a feed-in tariff or to stick with ROCs, which would remain open until 2017.</p><p>There is also a commitment to accelerate the review of the current banding so that investors can be given greater confidence. The document contains an entire annex devoted to investor confidence.

I reviewed all the evidence that was submitted to the committee in the course of its inquiry and I listened to all the arguments that were put to us by the business community in relation to the enterprise networks. I will, therefore, focus the bulk of my remarks on that.</p><p>On the major reform that has been proposed by Mr Purvis and the Liberal Democrats, I will read out three quotes that were submitted to the <place-holder colnum=\"31126\"/> committee. The first quote comes from the representative of the Federation of Small Businesses who gave evidence to us in September. He stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I do not think that there is a case for major structural reform or for ripping things up and starting again&#8212;precisely the opposite, given some of the difficulties that we have experienced during the transition period.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee</em>, 22 September 2010; c 4030.]</p><p>A week later, Alasdair Northrop, the editor of <em>Scottish Business Insider </em>magazine and <em>Business7</em>, stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Today, I will argue that it is more important than ever to have agencies such as Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee</em>, 29 September 2010; c 4082.]</p><p>On 22 September&#8212;the same day on which we heard from the Federation of Small Businesses&#8212;the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Business would certainly not welcome the wholesale changing of things every three or four years. Instead, we need to look at how we can evolve and improve the current system and plug any gaps in it to ensure that businesses receive the support that they need.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee</em>, 22 September 2010; c 4032.]</p><p>There was a strong feeling among the businesses and agencies that gave evidence to the committee that we certainly should not be ripping things up and that we ought to be&#8212;as the Scottish Chambers of Commerce stated&#8212;improving the current system and plugging the gaps. Therefore, I feel that the Lib Dem motion has failed to capture the mood of the business community and fundamentally&#8212;certainly at this time&#8212;gets it wrong. Having read the paper, I am not persuaded that the proposed system would be less complex. That is what I asked Mr Purvis in my intervention. I watched the clock, and it took him four minutes to explain how the new system would be simpler than the one that we have. On the basis of that and the response that he gave, full as it was, it is difficult to argue that the proposed changes would be simpler.</p><p>I worry about the amount of time that businesses, business leaders and politicians would spend changing things, reviewing things and ironing out the details if the proposal were to go ahead, particularly through primary legislation.

There is a perception that the business gateway deals only with start-ups and that Scottish Enterprise is interested only in the 2,000 or so account-managed companies. That leaves companies in the middle feeling that they are not getting a fair deal.</p><p>We cannot help everybody and we must not spread the resources too thinly, but there is merit in providing some changes to the business gateway. When the contracts are renegotiated in 2012, they should be changed so that credit is given for not only starting businesses up or moving them into being VAT registered, but providing help to businesses that are not start-ups but are in temporary need because of cash-flow difficulties or some other such temporary problem. There probably also need to be changes to ensure that Scottish Enterprise provides more help to businesses that are in the middle&#8212;not on a one-to-one basis, which would be impossible, but by providing more online support and, perhaps, working in tandem with business organisations to run more events, so that people feel that Scottish Enterprise is doing something for them, even if they are not getting account-managed support.</p><p>There must be a stronger focus on internationalisation. Scottish Development International is in effect tasked with two things: inward investment, and exports and international trade. I think that it has done a pretty good job on inward investment. Over the past decade or two, we have punched above our weight in that regard, but well below our weight on exports and international trade. Over the past 10 years or so, the value of our exports has fallen from &#163;17 billion to &#163;15 billion. We are the only part of the United Kingdom whose exports have fallen in cash terms. I will repeat a statistic that was given to the committee and which I have mentioned in this chamber on several occasions, because it really stuck with me. Some 8 per cent of all VAT-registered companies in the UK are headquartered <place-holder colnum=\"31128\"/> in Scotland, but we have only 5 per cent of the exporting companies. We punch well below our weight in that regard. SDI must be charged with focusing a bit more on exporting and internationalisation.

I do not intend to talk about the voluntary sector for my entire speech but I wanted to use that example to demonstrate that parties across the political spectrum, including the current Government party, agree that three or four-year funding, not one-year funding, is the right solution.</p><p>If that is right for the voluntary sector it must follow that it is correct for the Scottish Government's and the Parliament's budget. If we go back to first principles, I think that members of all parties agree&#8212;although SNP members might not want to admit it today&#8212;that the three or four-year funding approach is superior to the provision of figures for only one year.</p><p>All the Opposition parties are united behind the motion, and, more important, there is a united group outside the Parliament. Organisation after organisation has put its name to the principle that there ought to be figures for three or four years. I challenge Mr Swinney to tell us who is saying to him that one-year budgets are superior. Are the chief executives of local authorities telling him that they prefer one-year figures and do not want three-year figures? Are health boards telling him that they do not want indicative figures for three or four years and would rather have figures for one year? Are the police and fire services telling him the same thing? Is anyone out there saying to the cabinet secretary, \"We prefer one-year figures; we do not want three or four-year figures\"?</p><p>Throughout the debate we have heard that south of the border there are departmental figures up to 2014-15. In Wales there are figures for more than one year. We heard recently about Northern Ireland, too. If the devolved Administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland can do it, why cannot we do it?</p><p>The first reason that we heard for not providing figures for more than one year was that the 2007-08 budget in advance of the election contained figures for only one year. However, the critical difference between then and now is that at that time there was no UK spending review. It would have been unreasonable to have forced the then finance minister to produce a three-year budget, <place-holder colnum=\"30888\"/> when he had figures for only one year. That is why the Conservatives could not support an attempt to force the Scottish Government to produce a budget in advance of the comprehensive spending review.</p><p>Secondly, we heard that the figures could change. That argument has been fairly well rebutted. It is true every year that the figures could change. For example, there are the autumn revisions south of the border, as Jeremy Purvis said. Chief executives of organisations and people who run charity and voluntary sector organisations understand that. They also understand that there will be an election next year and that there is potential for change in that context.</p><p>Thirdly, we heard that it would be foolhardy to provide figures for three years when the Scottish Government wants to reform public services. I say again, if Wales, Northern Ireland and England can provide such figures, why cannot the cabinet secretary do so? Is he seriously suggesting that there will be no reform of public services in Wales or Northern Ireland? The SNP has levelled criticism at the coalition Government, but it cannot suggest that reform of public services is not taking place south of the border. An enormous amount of reform is taking place, so if we can have three or four-year figures south of the border, why cannot we have them for Scotland?</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21103848", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: A Budget for Scotland's People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the member for his intervention.

It has been a rather different debate from the one that I thought we might get when I saw the rather positive title. We heard the words \"George Foulkes\" and \"bland\" being used in the same sentence, which is a first&#8212;and, hopefully, a last. We heard discussion about red squirrels and, of course, a mention of Harriet Harman. It is nice that she got a mention because I note that her speech to the Scottish Labour Party conference, which I was keen to read, has been taken off the party's website.</p><p>I am pleased to announce, however, that Andy Kerr's speech from that conference is still available on that website&#8212;the speech that he gave today in the chamber was basically a cut-and-paste job, so that gave us helpful notice of what was coming up. I was tickled by one comment in his conference speech. Describing the past year, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In that time I've grown 365 days older, but no wiser\".</p><p>There were a couple of other peaches that he did not repeat today. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have the blame game. We have the unaffordable pledges\".</p><p>I will not say what else he said, as it is not as interesting.</p><p>Today's debate has, I fear, been pretty negative. People have commented on Malcolm Chisholm's slip of the tongue, which resulted in him saying that the motion is party-political nonsense. Among the points that are made in the motion is the complaint that the enterprise budgets have been reduced, despite the fact that we have not heard the Labour Party say, in any budget discussion in the past three and a half years, that it wants those budgets to be increased. That has never been part of its platform. Today, neither Lewis Macdonald nor Wendy Alexander were prepared to pledge to increase the enterprise budgets that they complain about in their motion. Similarly, we heard the Labour Party complain about transitional relief but were given no commitment that it will introduce a transitional relief scheme if it is elected as the Government of Scotland next year.</p><p>It is surprising that the Labour Party would not make those commitments because, at the weekend, it committed to about &#163;1.7 billion-worth of pledges and things that it wants to do if it forms the Government. Of course, we were given no idea at all about where that extra &#163;1.7 billion will <place-holder colnum=\"30015\"/> come from, when we know that the Scottish budget will be reduced in April next year. David Whitton explained that he told us last night where he intended to find that money. I have to say that I am looking forward to his wind-up speech, in which he will tell us, line by line, how he intends to pay for those pledges.</p><p>We heard a commitment to scrap the Scottish Futures Trust, which will save Scotland about &#163;23 million a year, so that is a start towards the &#163;1.7 billion.</p><p>It came as a surprise to me to learn that the Scottish Labour Party is not too committed to the Borders railway. Hugh Henry described the case for it as being \"shaky\" and gave the impression that he thought that it ought not to be going ahead. I would love to know whether he discussed the matter with Rhona Brankin or David Hamilton MP before making his announcement in the chamber today.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21055347", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Official Report 4 November 2010: Managing Scotland's Finance"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was courageous of the Scottish Labour Party to wish to debate the issue of managing Scotland's finances today.

I also challenge anybody to say that it better meets</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the needs of the key economic sectors and industries of the future.\"</p><p>There are many positives in what the Scottish Government has done with skills and I have no doubt that the document contains positives, but I feel that we are not quite getting it right. As my colleague Elizabeth Smith said, there is a big prize for getting it right. A 1 per cent increase in productivity across the country would add &#163;1 billion to the economy's value. Achieving a 1 per cent improvement should not be a difficult job with a spend of between &#163;2 billion and &#163;3 billion. There are big prizes for getting it right, but big dangers in getting it wrong.</p><p>We all know that the outcome of the comprehensive spending review will be announced on 20 October. We do not know the results, but we know the direction of travel&#8212;not as much money will be available to spend on skills next year and for the spending review period. If the independent budget review is correct, we will not have the same amount of money in real terms for about 15 years.</p><p>We must consider the skills strategy critically, to ensure that we extract every possible value from the public pound that is spent on skills. My biggest concern and gripe, which our amendment reflects, is that the skills system is not demand led. That was a complaint 20 years ago, 10 years ago and five years ago and it has been a complaint every time we have discussed skills in the chamber. It remains a complaint today.</p><p>During the minister's opening speech, I asked him to give us examples of where the Government had genuinely engaged with employers. He gave one or two. However, although having a summer leavers package and a telephone line as a one-stop shop for employers in relation to that is a positive step, the examples that the minister gave come nowhere near the type of engagement that we need to have with employers.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis referred to page 48 of the document, which admits that the information and guidance that is available is not understood and is too complex and that people are frustrated. Page 21 of the document states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is evident that individuals and businesses ... still perceive the skills system in Scotland to be complex and difficult to access.\"</p><p>The Government knows and accepts that, as its document makes clear.</p><p>On page 48, the document offers a solution to the difficulty. It states:<place-holder colnum=\"29503\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The SDS Corporate Plan for the three-year period to 2012 contains the goal to 'make skills work for employers' ... SDS will identify industry needs for skills and use this to improve the skills and learning system\".</p><p>That is not good enough or strong enough. There is a complete lack of engagement with employers, whether they be from the private sector, the public sector or the third sector.</p><p>When we last debated skills in the chamber, I gave the specific example of tourism. The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, of which I am a member, had examined tourism and spent some time looking at skills in the industry. All members of the committee concluded that there was a complete disconnect between those who were providing the services and those who wanted to employ people in tourism businesses when they came out at the other end. The then Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning set up a group to review the issue, which concluded that there was no problem and that things ought to carry on as normal. However, only two of the group's 16 members were involved in the industry. An article published in a national newspaper just this week reports:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"College training young people for Scotland's multi-billion-pound tourism ... trade have been criticised as ineffective and presiding over declining standards.\"</p><p>That was a criticism not by Opposition politicians but by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education.</p><p>It is not good enough to say that we want the system to be demand led and that we will take action. The system must become demand led if we are to have any chance of improving the outcomes for our learners and, ultimately, our economy.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006955", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy (Refresh)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My difficulty with the Scottish Government's skills strategy is the difference between the rhetoric and the reality.

The Conservatives will support the motion, our amendment, obviously, and the amendment in Jim Mather's name.</p><p>The key issue to have been raised so far by Lewis Macdonald and responded to by Mr Mather is the timetable for ensuring that a Government policy of one contract for supported businesses from each public authority is realised. Opposition parties always call on Governments to do things faster and ensure that things are implemented but, in this case, the call for speeding up is fair and reasonable.</p><p>The Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 have been in force since 31 January 2006 and, as we heard, we have had a procurement policy for three years. In October 2009, \"The Scottish Sustainable Procurement Action Plan\" was published and then, in September this year, the \"Scottish Government Sustainable Procurement Delivery Plan\" was published.</p><p>Delivery activity 13 in that most recent document is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Develop a strategy for awarding at least one contract to a Supported Business or Factory\".</p><p>That is absolutely right, but it calls for a strategy to be developed by 30 November 2010. Given the length of time that the regulations have been in force and the importance of public sector contracts <place-holder colnum=\"29394\"/> to supported businesses up and down the country, it is right to call for a timetable and it is appropriate that the Government put one in place so that article 19 contracts are awarded.</p><p>Later in my speech, I will return to the timetable with a word of caution. However, the minister's response was fair in that we must be careful that the timetable does not become simply a tick-box exercise, although the principle of having a timetable that proceeds as quickly as possible is absolutely correct.</p><p>The regulations have been in force since January 2006, but everybody agrees that not many contracts&#8212;whether zero, a handful or one&#8212;have been reserved under article 19. The reason for that is unclear. One suggestion that Richard Baker made in his members' business debate in January is that there is a lack of awareness of article 19. From memory, I think that he quoted a council in the region that he represents, which, when asked why nobody used reserved contracts, responded that nobody had asked it to use one. That may be hearsay, but it is what was said in the debate. If any council is unaware of article 19 or has not been asked to use it, it is extremely helpful that we have a debate such as this one and get all the parties to support the motion. Anything that moves the debate on is to be welcomed.</p><p>I turn to our amendment, which has two parts. The second part says that we should encourage main contractors to take on subcontractors that are supported businesses. That tries to take the issue one step further, although we cannot compel main contractors to do it.</p><p>Having one direct contract between a public authority and a supported business is a good start, but trying to foster a culture in which those who contract with the state give serious consideration to taking on subcontractors that are supported businesses would be a good way to take the matter forward. It would create supplier diversity in the supply chain and help businesses to achieve their corporate social responsibility targets.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006667", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supported Employment Workplaces"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Labour Party has brought an extremely important issue to the Parliament.

I think that I made my position clear that a timetable is absolutely right and appropriate, but we have to be careful not to put an arbitrary date of a matter of months on it just for the sake of doing so. We need to take all public authorities and public bodies with us. They have to be active, rather than reluctant, participants. If they are reluctant participants they will probably give only one contract to a supported workplace. Given that there is no strict policy on the value of the contract that has to be given to a supported workplace, if the timetable is too arbitrary and too short, there is a danger that they will simply give a low-value contract, such as a &#163;10,000 contract, to the supported workplace, whereas if they had waited six or seven months, they might have given a &#163;1 million contract to a supported workplace. We do not want them to low-ball, just so that they can tick a box; we want them to award more than one contract if that is appropriate.</p><p>The Labour Party was quite right to lodge the motion and we certainly support it.

Members have referred to Professor Muscatelli's point that he believes that his university will run out of cash in 2013. Recently, we heard from Lord Sutherland that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we cannot fund the status quo on current cash flows.\"</p><p>That is the reality. The Parliament and Government must find a solution to it. Some people say that the solution is to do absolutely nothing and to allow our universities over time to run into the ground and drop down the league tables. Some people think that the solution is more central Government funding for our universities. That was the main plank of the NUS report. That is a perfectly legitimate position, but the difficulty with it is the crisis that the country faces in the funds that are available to us.</p><p>We have all read the independent budget review report. Although we do not know what the outcome of the spending review will be, there are pretty clear indications in that independent report that we will be about &#163;1.7 billion down in real terms next year and, potentially, &#163;3.7 billion down at the end of four years of the spending review period. The difficulty is not just short term. Rather worryingly, the independent budget review report suggests that it could take us 15 years to get back to where we are today in real terms. We therefore need a solution that does not simply bridge a gap for a couple of years. It has to be a long-term solution.</p><p>So, should we do nothing, provide more Government funding or introduce a different system&#8212;as has been suggested by Elizabeth Smith and the Scottish Conservatives&#8212;revolving <place-holder colnum=\"29122\"/> around some form of graduate contribution? Elizabeth Smith outlined the case clearly. It has been misinterpreted, perhaps unintentionally&#8212;although perhaps not so unintentionally&#8212;by various members. It would be a deferred contribution; that is why we call it a graduate contribution, rather than a student contribution. It would not be paid until the graduate was working. It is also an income-contingent contribution. Until the graduate reached a threshold of earnings, they would pay back not a penny of the sum. If, at some point in the future after they had begun to pay it back, they were unlucky enough to be made redundant or lose their job, there would be a pause in the payment. They would not pay a penny until they were again above the threshold for payment.</p><p>We heard some good rebuttal to the worries that the proposal might reduce access to university.

Although there was not complete consensus in our debate of just a couple of months ago on the outcome, there was broad consensus that the current system is not fit for purpose. The reason for that is simple: when the system was designed, cutting carbon emissions was not central to the public policy platform. Policy at that time was all about price and security of supply, in the context of which building power stations close to centres of population made sense. Given the policy of cutting carbon emissions, the previous policy no longer makes sense. The comprehensive review is therefore absolutely right. My view is that we have a good Government in the coalition Government. I also have every faith in David Cameron as Prime Minister, but even I did not expect that&#8212;even with his skills&#8212;the entire system would be changed within four months of his taking office. The matter is hugely complex and the fact that we already have an announcement is to be welcomed.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006085", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Low-carbon Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had a wide-ranging and useful debate this afternoon, with some good contributions from all parts of the chamber.

I do not agree 100 per cent with the minister, but the current system is not fit for purpose and the consultation is definitely to be welcomed.</p><p>When the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism spoke, I raised with him the issue of energy efficiency, on which many speakers have touched. Reducing demand and making our houses, buildings, schools and so on more energy efficient is a much less painful way of cutting our carbon emissions, but the energy efficiency action plan&#8212;or inaction plan, as it now appears to be called&#8212;is disappointing. The plan has been years in the making. When the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee considered the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill back in January last year, it took the view, based on evidence from a number of groups, that there was no need to take six months from the legislation coming into force to produce the plan&#8212;the work had been done and was ready to go, and the plan could be published and acted on immediately. Even at that time, we felt that we were moving a bit too slowly, as we did not have the plan.</p><p>We have heard that the plan was on the books and ready to be published in May this year, but at the last minute&#8212;for whatever reason&#8212;the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism took the decision not to publish it. Now we hear that it will be published in the autumn; the minister felt obliged to add the phrase \"this year\", just to make matters clear. I ask him in all seriousness, if the plan was ready to go in May 2010, as the Government says, can it not be published today or tomorrow? We accept that changes may be made to it as matters progress, but what is preventing the Government from publishing it now, with the caveat that it may be subject to change? I ask the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to tell us in his summing up why that cannot be done.</p><p>Electricity generation, which produces about a third of our carbon emissions, has been discussed. My colleague Jackson Carlaw gave a good speech on the subject of nuclear power. He asked how much carbon would be saved in total by getting rid of nuclear power generation at Hunterston and Torness and replacing it solely with renewable energy. I would love to hear the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism answer that question, because I believe that the amount would not be great. I urge the Government to listen to its Council of Economic Advisers and to <place-holder colnum=\"28953\"/> the independent consultant report that was produced, which stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"With Hunterston B and Torness removed, Scotland will lose a significant volume of low-carbon power.\"</p><p>The minister should judge the reliability of a technology over the 30 or 40-year lifespan of a power station, not just on the year 2006, which he is fond of citing. That will give him a fair analysis of how productive the technology is.<place-holder time=\"16:43:00\"/></p><p><a id=\"TOC_SPKR_81524d83-517c-44bd-8e7f-64d694\" name=\"TOC_SPKR_81524d83-517c-44bd-8e7f-64d694\"><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab): </strong></a>>Today's debate has confirmed that there is wide agreement about objectives, but less agreement about the means of achieving them. There are real questions about how to make the actions deliver on the words.</p><p>Targets are essential in meeting the challenge of climate change&#8212;that is why Labour pressed so hard for us to set demanding targets for emissions reductions and why we will continue to argue that Government needs to provide leadership in drawing the route map of how to meet them.</p><p>Renewable energy is a case in point. As we have heard, Scottish ministers take every opportunity to highlight their enthusiasm for new energy technologies. However, in practice, they have not taken every opportunity to endorse projects on the ground. After nearly four years, in spite of the warm words, it remains the case that nearly 40 per cent of the potential electricity generation from new onshore wind developments that have gone to ministers for decision since 2007 have not progressed because ministers have chosen not to give consent. It is not enough to say that we have huge renewables potential while avoiding the hard questions about how we will realise that. Not every renewables project that comes forward must gain consent, but it is important that the balance is right. If 40 per cent of our overall renewables potential were to be rejected in planning, our aspirations for a low-carbon economy would not be achieved.</p><p>Offshore wind should be the next big thing in renewable power. There are major opportunities for Scotland in the demonstration and deployment of offshore wind generation, in the transfer of skills, expertise and technologies from offshore oil and gas to offshore renewables, in fabrication and in the supply chain. Those opportunities must not be lost. If SNP ministers have found it hard to endorse projects of scale onshore in Lewis, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire, how much harder will they find some of the challenges in relation to the marine environment?</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006085", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Low-carbon Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I view it not as a concession but as a matter of fact.

The cabinet secretary started the debate in a positive manner by pointing out just how important it is to raise awareness about the quality and variety of Scottish food. He pointed to the food and drink fortnight as being a good example of joining together producers, retailers, restaurateurs, farm shops, hoteliers, markets and just about everybody else in between. He also said, quite rightly, that this is the year of food and drink, which I understand started in May and will run for the rest of the year.</p><p>A range of topics were covered and my colleague John Scott majored on two of them: food security and pricing. Mr Scott put forward his fears about the volatility of prices in the food <place-holder colnum=\"28716\"/> sector, particularly in relation to wheat, which has had a difficult year as a result of disasters in Russia and Pakistan. He also pointed out that the input costs for many producers are going up significantly and highlighted the cost of fertilisers. He said that food inflation is running at about 7 per cent, which is pretty high when we consider that the consumer prices index, announced last week, is at just over 3 per cent. Mr Scott also touched on his slight difficulties with regulation and red tape. Many businesses in Scotland suffer from too much red tape and regulation, but those in the food and drink sector probably take more than their fair share of that burden and anything that can be done to cut it must be positive.</p><p>We heard about healthy eating and obesity. Elaine Murray spent a lot of her speech labouring that issue. There is a particular concern about obesity in our children and what we can do to try to turn that around. I do not think that there are any quick fixes there, but turn it around we must if we are to prosper as a nation.</p><p>We heard about the reputation of Scottish food, procurement and the economic impact of our food and drink industry, on which I will spend my remaining time. We know that there are an enormous number of jobs in the supply chain, however one decides to carve that up. We know that somewhere in the region of 75,000 businesses are involved in food and drink and that there is an enormous gross value added, to the tune of about &#163;9.5 billion, for the Scottish economy.</p><p>Whichever way exports are dressed up, food and drink account for a massive slice of them. Whether food and drink exports are worth &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion, total Scottish exports last year, on which figures came out at the end of last week, were worth about &#163;15 billion. So, whether food is worth &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion, it is an enormous slice of that total.</p><p>I asked the cabinet secretary about the figures that he set out in his speech. The Scottish Government website and the food strategy document say that food and drink exports overseas are worth &#163;5 billion a year; Scottish Development International says that last year was a record year, with exports worth &#163;4.06 billion; and the Scotland's global connections survey says that the figure was &#163;3.8 billion. Different organisations occasionally come up with different figures, but my worry is that all three are part of the Scottish Government: Scottish Development International is a part of the Scottish Government; the global connections survey is carried out by the Scottish Government; and of course the cabinet secretary's food and drink strategy document comes from the Scottish Government.<place-holder colnum=\"28717\"/></p><p>There might not be an answer to that today, but it is important to know the value to the Scottish economy of overseas food and drink exports. Is it &#163;4 billion or is it &#163;5 billion? There is a pretty big disparity between the two figures. The figure is important not just for its own sake; we need a baseline because the Government, in alignment with the industry, has set targets for driving the industry forward. The strategy sets a clear target of going from &#163;7.5 billion for total sales, including exports, to &#163;10 billion by 2017. If the figure for exports is &#163;1 billion out, how on earth can we measure progress towards that target and how would we have any idea in 2017 whether we had got there? I hope that the cabinet secretary will address that point, either today or later on, because it is extremely important to get a baseline.</p><p>We heard about the value of exports from the Scottish whisky industry. Iain Smith gave us the good news that South Korea has decided to relax some of its trading arrangements; the Scotch Whisky Association has been pushing for that for a number of years.</p><p>We are doing a lot at the moment&#8212;the Government is clearly acting and all parties and the industry are engaging in that work&#8212;but there is a reason why this subject is so important just now. Usually, we cannot compete on price. Usually, we compete only on quality, but because the pound is weak at the moment, particularly against the euro, we can compete on price for the foreseeable future. For that reason, we must drive the industry forward now.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997464", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We began this afternoon by celebrating the growth of the Scottish food and drink fortnight and thereafter the debate expanded widely across a whole range of food and drink topics.

That was my starting point and, having heard the views of a number of constituents, I decided to take on the campaign and to spend time pushing it forward. The campaign has garnered the support of thousands of people in Edinburgh and the Lothians, and beyond. It has support from shop owners, travel agents, other tourism businesses, small businesses throughout the region, Age Scotland and the Scottish Taxi Federation, among others. I am grateful to all of them for the support that they have given.</p><p>The reasons why there are big concerns are several. The first is that when the idea was first suggested, the airport's response to the <em>Edinburgh Evening News</em> in the middle of June was that it was not going to happen: there were a number of options for changing the forecourt and only one of them contained the possibility of a charge. The airport said that it would consult on and discuss the matter with a range of stakeholders, including passengers, before reaching any decision. I discovered that that was not correct: the decision had, indeed, been taken and there was no intention at all to consult passengers about the proposal to charge people simply for dropping <place-holder colnum=\"28488\"/> someone off. The only consultation that would take place was on how the decision would be marketed and how the signage at the airport might look.</p><p>Big concerns were expressed by elderly residents and people with mobility difficulties who do not have blue badges. Those with blue badges are of course exempt from the charge, but many of my constituents have mobility difficulties but do not have a blue badge and so would not be exempt from the charge. Concerns were also raised by families with young children who said that going to the airport and flying is stressful enough without having to pay to be dropped off, or go to a drop-off point a mile or so away and await a bus.</p><p>The other concern for a number of residents, which the previous managing director of the airport did not put to bed, is that the charge is unlikely to stay at &#163;1 for long. Taxis were initially charged &#163;1 for picking up at Edinburgh airport, but that moved to &#163;1.50, it is now at &#163;2 and I understand that it is scheduled to go up again. It would just be a matter of time before the &#163;1 charge became something more than that.</p><p>So, why did the airport make this decision? We were given an array of reasons&#8212;and the primary one appears to have changed with the passage of time. The initial justification for the decision was to get people on to public transport. That sounds good, but the problem is that for many people within the Lothians&#8212;as well as in Fife, the Borders and elsewhere&#8212;taking public transport to Edinburgh airport is simply not an option. It might be okay for someone who lives on the main bus route, which offers an extremely good service, but that is not an option for people who live in most parts of Midlothian, East Lothian and West Lothian or even for people in most parts of Edinburgh. Not many people will buy the suggestion that the primary reason is to get people onto public transport, given that public transport is not available. A constituent who signed the petition said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I would need to take 2-3 buses to get there and it would take me several hours. It's not viable with toddlers, prams and luggage, and if it's early in the morning I can't even take 2-3 buses.\"</p><p>We then heard from the airport that the reason was that it wants to upgrade to a \"better passenger experience\". A constituent told me that it would be a better passenger experience not to have to pay &#163;1 simply to be dropped off. If that is an upgrade, I would hate to see a downgrade to the passenger experience. A constituent said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This will just irritate and deter. An insult to our wallets and intelligence.\"</p><p>The reason the airport now gives&#8212;this is a late entry&#8212;is that the current forecourt is not fit for <place-holder colnum=\"28489\"/> dropping off because it is congested and dangerous and people cannot get in or out. I was surprised to hear that reason, particularly given that it was a late entry. I have visited the airport many times and I have had feedback from hundreds of constituents on the matter, none of whom has said that there is congestion in the current set-up and none of whom could point to where the problem lies. When I visited the airport and spoke to the management after the point was raised, it was a little embarrassing for the management that while I was there only about six cars visited the forecourt to pick up or drop off and there was space for many more.</p><p>If the drop-off charge goes ahead, people might drop off at unauthorised points to avoid the charge.

From that investigation, my overriding sense is that various Government departments and governmental bodies are doing nowhere near enough work now to consider the impacts of the cuts; very little discussion other than superficial discussion has taken place about how such bodies might approach their budgets next year, the year after and the year after that.</p><p>I will illustrate the point by referring to bodies that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee examined. Scottish Enterprise's grant-in-aid budget this year is &#163;277 million. In its evidence to our committee, Scottish Enterprise said that it is working towards a budget next year of &#163;285 million&#8212;albeit that that is obviously unconfirmed&#8212;and that its budget for the year after that is also &#163;285 million. The grant in aid for Highlands and Islands Enterprise this year is &#163;54.6 million. It is working towards exactly the same amount next year and, again, in 2012-13. VisitScotland, which is the other body that falls under the remit of our committee, has &#163;43.6 million grant in aid this year and is working towards &#163;43.2 million next year.</p><p>Those are just three of the bodies that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee looks at, but it was apparent to all committee members that no body or agency had done anywhere near enough work on how to tackle the difficulties that clearly will be thrown at them. Of course they do not yet know the exact extent of those difficulties <place-holder colnum=\"28222\"/> and cuts, but from reading various sources it is pretty apparent that cuts will come and the committee was disappointed to find that they had done so little work thus far. We appreciate that those bodies and agencies do not have precise figures on which to focus, but they can focus on principles. They can also consider the things that they ought to be doing less of and look at what their core work is. Also, given the likelihood of cuts to come, they should focus on what ought not to be core. We felt that far more work ought to be being done now, in advance of September, October and November.</p><p>My party has consistently called for the work that the cabinet secretary's directorate does on potential in-year revisions to be published. When I have put that point to the cabinet secretary he has said that the Government has decided not to have in-year revisions. If his directorate has done that work and papers have been produced, it would form a useful addition to the debate. If that work has been done, why will he not publish it?

At the moment, around the world, there are a number of movements. Just last week, a small savings bank in Spain was nationalised. In the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is proposing an overhaul of the way in which banks report their loans on their balance sheets. Further, there are the Basel III proposals that will be finalised by the end of the year, leading to bigger safety buffers of capital and liquid assets.</p><p>When we began the inquiry, the committee had a number of principles to which we thought we should stick. We felt that we should be forward looking, rather than becoming involved in a backward-looking approach that was concerned with who ought to be blamed. We felt also that there should be as little duplication as possible, because one or two Westminster committees had considered banking issues as well. We also felt that there ought to be a strong focus on the areas on which the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government could have a direct, or at least an indirect, impact. Broadly, the committee stuck to those principles pretty well.<place-holder colnum=\"26817\"/></p><p>I will focus on the issues on which the Scottish Government can have a direct or an indirect impact. When I intervened during the minister's speech, I mentioned the issue of competition and the OFT. I will outline why that issue is so important and so specific to Scotland. When the Lloyds TSB takeover was first mooted some time ago, the OFT raised three particular concerns with regard to competition. Those concerns related to personal and current accounts and mortgages UK-wide, and business lending in Scotland. In its report, the OFT singled out Scotland in relation to business lending&#8212;it felt that the consequences of the merger would have a negative impact primarily in Scotland alone. That is why we as a committee singled out business lending.</p><p>We welcome the report that we received from the OFT two months ago on personal and current accounts, and the next investigation that has been announced on the barriers to entry in banking. We have heard more about that from the minister and other members. However, we have not had an investigation on the specific issue of Scottish business banking.</p><p>The minister at the time of the merger, Peter Mandelson, said&#8212;I am speaking from memory&#8212;that the matter should be kept under review, which was stronger than saying that a watching brief should be kept. However, it was clear from the evidence to the committee that that seemed to amount to not much more than the occasional conversation and a reading of the <em>Financial Times</em>. For that reason the committee stressed that the investigation ought to take place. We pushed the Scottish Government and asked it in the strongest possible terms formally to request such an investigation.</p><p>The Scottish Government does not have direct power or control over the OFT; I think that everyone accepts that. However, it came out in the OFT's evidence that if a request was to come in from the Scottish Government, it would be treated extremely seriously. The OFT may decide not to investigate&#8212;we cannot force it to do so&#8212;but it is very important that the Scottish Government requests a formal review of Scottish business banking.</p><p>The minister has suggested that he is prepared to do that, and I hope he will confirm that in his summing up. Some members of the committee, and many experts at the committee's meeting earlier today, have requested an investigation, and the FSB called for one in the press this morning.</p><p>The second area where we can have influence is the Scottish Investment Bank. The minister said in his speech:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We now have the Scottish Investment Bank\".<place-holder colnum=\"26818\"/></p><p>That troubled me slightly. The First Minister announced the creation of a Scottish investment bank at the Scottish Trades Union Conference in April 2009. The bank would have &#163;150 million of funds, held in the Scottish co-investment fund, the Scottish seed fund and one other fund within Scottish Enterprise, and an additional &#163;150 million that would be leveraged in from Europe.</p><p>However, it did not happen. A couple of months ago it was reannounced that the Scottish Investment Bank was about to be created, but this time the figure was &#163;50 million instead of &#163;150 million. The committee was told a couple of weeks ago that the money was ready and the bank was up and running. We were told that businesses could apply now to get money from the Scottish Investment Bank.</p><p>The committee received a letter this morning from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, which stated that that simply was not correct and that the Government hoped that the bank would be up and running by the end of 2010. We do not have a Scottish Investment Bank at the moment, and that is part of the problem.</p><p>It was identified early on&#8212;particularly from the Scottish Government's work in its extremely good paper, \"Access to Bank Finance for Scottish SMEs\"&#8212;that something was required for small businesses, such as renewables businesses, and that there was a gap in that area. However, 14 or 15 months on that gap has not been filled, and it looks as if that will not happen until the end of the year. The Government must explain what on earth has been going on, and why it announced the creation of the bank in April 2009 if it now hopes that the bank will be ready by the end of this year.</p><p>The committee's report is extremely positive. The inquiry put Scotland on the map&#8212;as the committee's convener said&#8212;in that organisations such as UKFI, the FSA and the OFT got to hear directly from Scottish legislators. Big commentators such as Robert Peston and Gillian Tett also got a direct view from Scotland, so it was good in that respect.</p><p>As other members have said, the report allows us to tell a more positive story about the financial services sector as a whole. We have heard about pensions, insurance fund management and asset services, but what we have not heard so far is that 50 per cent&#8212;it is a statistic worth mentioning&#8212;of the Scottish financial services sector is not banking.

The evidence that was given to the committee by Transport Scotland and others did not put the bridge forward on a predict-and-provide model; I think that they described it as a \"distress purchase\", given the state of the existing bridge. Therefore, I do not accept Robin Harper's argument.</p><p>The debate has also focused on economic development. The committee was persuaded that there are economic imperatives associated with the new crossing, stressing&#8212;as I do&#8212;the word \"imperative\". The councils in Edinburgh, Fife and West Lothian agreed on that, as did the chambers of commerce of Edinburgh, Fife and West Lothian&#8212;as one might expect&#8212;and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, which stressed the imperative. Phrases such as \"absolutely necessary\" and \"massively important\" were used, and, as Tricia Marwick said, Fife Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will not rest until such time as the new crossing is in place\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Forth Crossing Bill Committee</em>, 24 February 2010; c 24.]</p><p>Two other points are worth noting. First, we have heard a lot of talk about the cost of the bridge, but the cost of not going ahead is also critical. Charlie Gordon correctly cited the figure of &#163;650,000 a day as the cost of serious closures of the existing bridge and Alex Johnstone referred to the figure that the chambers of commerce put forward of &#163;1.5 billion a year in lost opportunity and economic costs. Secondly, while there is any uncertainty at all about what is going to happen with the bridge, investment in the central belt will be discouraged. So, the sooner that we can move forward, the better.</p><p>The other area that many members, including Margaret Smith, Mary Mulligan and George Foulkes in his interventions, touched on is the impact of the bridge on the local communities. As a Lothians member, I am far more familiar with the <place-holder colnum=\"26588\"/> south of the river than with the north of the river, and the concerns that have been raised by residents of South Queensferry and Newton are well made. David Stewart's description of them as being put forward professionally and in a polished manner is absolutely correct. A number of concerns have been expressed in that way. The level of consultation was an issue right from the start, and the view that was fed back to me by my constituents was that that was not acceptable. If someone was on the mailing list they might have got the information, but many people&#8212;particularly the more vulnerable residents&#8212;were not on the mailing list and were not in a position to stand up for themselves.</p><p>There were concerns about the construction sites, about the M9 spur&#8212;or, at least, about the lack of a link&#8212;and about other environmental impacts on the community.</p><p>I acknowledge the minister's comments in his opening speech about the code of construction practice and changes that he might be considering. The more changes that he can tell us about in his summing up, the better. Similarly, the sooner that we hear about subsequent changes, the better.</p><p>The committee said that there must be genuine discussions between Transport Scotland and parties who are seeking mitigation. The committee wants specific measures to be taken to counter the problems that are faced by Newton village, which were acknowledged by Transport Scotland.

The debate on that report a year ago was extremely good. Developments since then have made today's debate, too, a good one.</p><p>A couple of unusual comments were made in the debate. For the first time, blame was laid at the door of the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government, which has apparently not done nearly enough during its first nine days in office to lay tracks all the way through. We heard the interesting argument that high-speed rail would happen far faster simply by Scotland having independence, especially if we had some borrowing powers. Cathy Peattie was right to say that politics cannot be done by remote access, but an examination of whether that improved outcomes might make an interesting study.</p><p>The debate has been broadly consensual. It is important that it should be, because high-speed rail is an enormous, very long-term project that will impact on the whole of the United Kingdom. It will straddle several elections both north and south of the border, so it will probably straddle several Governments both north and south of the border. Therefore, it is critical that we proceed with a degree of consensus.</p><p>Many members pointed out that the UK is behind Europe and many parts of Asia on the issue. As Christopher Harvie indicated, we have only 50 or 60 miles of high-speed railway, so we must take forward the issue with a strong degree of consensus. Today's announcement in the programme for government, which Alex Johnstone and Jeremy Purvis read out, is an important one. There is a vision in black and white of a truly national high-speed rail network for the whole of Britain.</p><p>As Alex Johnstone pointed out, given the financial constraints that exist, we will have to achieve that vision in phases.

I will start by moving the amendment in my name.</p><p>This important debate concerns a matter that is strategically vital to our energy industry in the short, medium and long terms. I start on a firm note of consensus: the Conservatives agree that there must be a review of the transmission charging methodology and that that review should take place sooner rather than later. Indeed, we have used the word \"urgent\" in the amendment.</p><p>As we have heard, the current locational model for transmission charging has its origins in another era. At the time when it was established, renewable energy and carbon emissions were not at the centre of public policy&#8212;indeed, they might not even have been at the fringes of public policy. At that time, everything was focused on price and security of supply, so we got the system to suit those policy objectives.</p><p>The game since then has changed completely. I am pleased to say that renewable energy forms a central part of the vision of every party in this Parliament and at Westminster. Furthermore, climate change targets are now set out in legislation north and south of the border, so one element has changed completely. It is clear that if we were to design the system of transmission charging today from a blank slate, we would not end up with the current scenario.</p><p>Locational charging makes little sense in the case of renewable generation. The idea that we can encourage power stations to locate closer to centres of population can work from a thermal power point of view&#8212;at least, it used to work. However, a power station or a supplier of energy has to locate close to the potential power source, so renewable technologies have to locate where the waves, the tides and the winds are. In Scotland, much of the marine power will be based in the Pentland Firth, so those facilities have no choice about where they must locate.</p><p>The review must take place, it must include the additional element and it must adapt to the policy <place-holder colnum=\"25487\"/> agenda of today, tomorrow and the future. Furthermore, in doing all of that, it has to ensure that there is no disadvantage to Scotland in terms of investment in energy.</p><p>The minister referred to the report that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee published a year ago. It was apparent to me and, probably, to all members of the committee that the economics of the totality of the transmission charging regime are considerably more complex than they might at first appear. It is easy to make the case that Scotland is getting a terrible deal and that we must fight tooth and nail against that. In some of the First Minister's press releases and statements&#8212;although not in the minister's speech today&#8212;a black-and-white situation has been painted that ignores much of the complexity that exists. There are several dimensions to the issue.</p><p>The figures that the First Minister has cited relate only to the infrastructure costs of transmission charging. When the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee investigated the issue, it became clear that there are at least three elements to transmission charging; Mr Macdonald spoke about a few additional elements today. The operating costs&#8212;not just the infrastructure costs&#8212;of transmission charging were discussed. With infrastructure costs, there is a flow from north to south, but with operating costs there is a flow&#8212;although not to the same degree&#8212;from south to north.</p><p>In addition, an element of transmission charges is paid directly by consumers. I know that the figures that I have are out of date, because the evidence session at which they were presented to the committee took place a year ago, but they suggest that English consumers pay about &#163;1.1 billion a year, whereas Scottish consumers pay about &#163;50 million&#8212;about 5 per cent of the total, instead of about 10 per cent, as one might expect on a crude analysis. Those figures are out of date and may be challenged, but they were presented to the committee when it took evidence on the subject. It is important to look at all of the elements of transmission charging, instead of focusing on one black-and-white issue.</p><p>We agree strongly that a review must take place urgently. I think that my party is in a slightly different position from the Government, in that we believe that the review should not be prejudged. Previously, I had the impression that the minister was firmly of the view that transmission charging should include no locational element. However, when I asked him today, his position did not seem to be quite so firm. We think that all of the evidence must be put on the table. Representatives of Scottish Power, Scottish and Southern Energy, Scottish Renewables, National Grid and Ofgem were present at the evidence <place-holder colnum=\"25488\"/> session to which I have referred. It was apparent to all members that there were competing analyses and that facts were disputed by both sides. In some senses, the position was quite murky, and it was clear that something needs to be done. It is important that the review be comprehensive and that every statement be tested, so that we end up with a charging regime that reflects all of today's current policy and considers all elements.</p><p>It could be argued that some degree of locational charging might still make sense. Should some power stations be built closer to centres of population, to reflect the fact that electricity is lost in transmission and that many people do not like having electricity pylons and lines in their areas? The system must be changed, but I am not convinced that there should be no locational element. For the sake of the customer interest, there should be a degree of cost-reflective charging. However, I accept that the current position must change.</p><p>At the same time, it would be useful for us to have a debate on the effects of the transmission charging regime on investment in renewables and the energy industry. Today we have heard competing analyses. The minister mentioned two projects in which he thought that investment had not gone ahead because of transmission charges. When the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee took evidence from a representative of Scottish Renewables, he said that he had evidence of several such cases but was not, for commercial reasons, at liberty to mention them, which is perfectly understandable.</p><p>In the same evidence session, however, it was admitted that the regime is not completely prohibitive and the picture that was painted of the sheer number of projects that were going ahead certainly suggested that it is not quite as prohibitive as some people had been making out, although it is useful to have the debate and to find out the regime's exact effect on investment instead of simply relying on one or two examples from each side.</p><p>In conclusion, we feel that a review is required and that it should happen urgently.</p><p>If I did not do so at the beginning of my speech, I move amendment S3M-6169.1, to leave out from \"opposes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes that the existing locational approach to charging electricity generators for access and use of the GB grid system was first designed prior to the development of the UK public policy objectives and targets regarding carbon emissions and renewable energy; notes that the economics of transmission charging has a number of elements and involves a significant contribution from consumers, infrastructure costs of transmission and operating costs of transmission; believes that there should be an urgent review of transmission charging methodology, taking into <place-holder colnum=\"25489\"/> account all the existing public policy objectives, and further believes that a review should find a solution that does not disadvantage investment in Scotland.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763615", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transmission Charging"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You might regret saying that, Presiding Officer.

I believe that the proposal has broad cross-party support and support from industry, which the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee touched on briefly in a couple of evidence sessions. I have not noticed that many people have disagreed with the concept. That policy was announced almost a year ago by the First Minister at the Scottish Trades Union Congress. It was not a policy that the Government was considering as a good idea to try to accelerate recovery but one that was unveiled as something that the Government was going to do. However, 12 months on, we have seen little progress on the Scottish Investment Bank. The original idea was that it would comprise three funds that are currently distributed by Scottish Enterprise. It would attempt to get European funding and perhaps some extra private funding in order to create the bank. It appears to have been extremely tricky to come by the European funding but, if that is the case, why on earth was the policy announced before the homework was done?</p><p>The policy created a lot of excitement at the time, but it has patently failed to deliver. It is so bad that the last time I asked a question about it, the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism stated that the Scottish Investment Bank does exist and that it is distributing funds week in, week out. However, all that has been done is to encapsulate the three funds that already existed and were already delivering funds and call them the Scottish Investment Bank. I would like to hear from the cabinet secretary when he concludes the debate what is going to happen with the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"25256\"/> Investment Bank. Is it a flop or is the Government genuinely going to take it forward?</p><p>I turn to other issues in the recovery plan.

There would be reduced access to data for Scottish students, which would have expense <place-holder colnum=\"25203\"/> implications. There are also downsides for the oil and gas sector. The cores and records are used for exploration and development purposes, especially by some of the smaller oil and gas companies, as Lewis Macdonald mentioned. Anything that reduces the proximity between the cores and the sector must be a backward step.</p><p>There is one compelling argument for encouraging the British Geological Survey to change its position: that relating to potential transport damage. It is important to know that this material is invaluable and, in many cases, essentially irreplaceable. Any measure that jeopardises the integrity of the cores must be considered extremely seriously.</p><p>I do not argue purely on the basis of being a representative of the area. I looked carefully at the case that was put by the petroleum group committee of the Geological Society, which spent a great deal of time examining the issue in detail and promised to take a balanced and considered view. The committee weighed up the arguments on all sides, focusing especially on the potential for transport damage. Committee members' biggest concern, after considering the matter in detail, related to preservation of the material during transportation. Ultimately, having looked at all of the evidence, a majority of committee members were unwilling to support the planned move. The British Geological Survey must consider seriously the views of a group of experts who are not acting as representatives and who have looked at the case in detail. If they reach the conclusion that they cannot support the planned move, there is a strong argument for changing the decision. Again, they made the point that the material is essentially irreplaceable.</p><p>The British Geological Survey's reasons for going ahead with the move are set out in its press release. When it touched on the issue of transportation damage, I thought that it might put a counter-case&#8212;that it would say that it had considered all the evidence and come up with a scheme that it could guarantee would protect the integrity of the cores&#8212;but it did not do so. It said that it was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"engaging in a dialogue ... to ensure that all reasonable precautions are taken\"</p><p>and that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A full analysis will be carried out\",</p><p>but it was in no position to rebut the claims of the petroleum group committee. For that reason, there is a strong argument for the minister to agree to meet the British Geological Survey&#8212;I suspect that he may already have done so&#8212;to impress on it the strength of the committee's argument.</p><p>In the press release, the British Geological Survey makes the point that the new Keyworth <place-holder colnum=\"25204\"/> facility will be fit for purpose. I have no doubt that it will, but it is important to note that there is no suggestion that the current site is not fit for purpose. The press release also says that the new site will adhere to all health and safety regulations, but I understand that there has been no suggestion that the Gilmerton facility is unsafe. Questions must be asked about the savings that are claimed. The press release suggests that &#163;200,000 could be saved per year, but that must be set against proposed transport costs of &#163;300,000. We heard from Mike Pringle that, since then, the prediction has been revised upwards considerably; I have not seen the figure, but I take what he says at face value.</p><p>For all the reasons that I have given, I think that the wrong decision has been taken.

We need to streamline our public services and make them more efficient, not only for their own ends, but because we must do everything that we can to protect front-line services, given the tough times that will inevitably follow for Scotland. One of the best ways to protect those services is to make them more efficient, effective and streamlined.</p><p>John Swinney was correct when he said that the chamber did not agree on every issue during the course of the day. Indeed, that was perhaps something of an understatement. We think that the order-making power in part 2 is required, which is why we voted against various amendments from Mr Whitton. We think that the power is desirable and that it allows a more streamlined process than primary legislation. It allows faster, more nimble movement and we are satisfied that sufficient safeguards are contained in the provisions and that there has been sufficient movement from the Government to allow us to support it and, indeed, the bill as a whole.</p><p>In the amendments that my colleague Derek Brownlee lodged, he focused on the transparency of spending by Government and its agencies.

If the measure was truly about saving money and saving the public purse, they did not come back with any larger figure that they felt would be saved. Perhaps they could put that on their press release. The Liberal Democrats might also reflect on the fact that, when push came to shove, only 17 members supported amendment 78.

It is a dynamic and innovative sector, and anybody attending even one event at the Scottish thistle awards would see just how impressive an <place-holder colnum=\"24621\"/> industry it is. We all want it to succeed, which is why our party took an extremely consensual approach in the previous tourism debates in November 2007, September 2008 and January 2009.</p><p>The key question is how best to help this vital industry. Do we do that through the approach that the minister suggested in his opening speech, which is to talk only about the positives, but ignore the issues and difficulties, or would we best help it by examining, and trying to come up with solutions to, the difficulties and problems?</p><p>One of the difficulties is this: in 2005 the industry set a 10-year ambition, which was to grow the industry by 50 per cent by 2015. We are pretty close to the halfway stage of that flagship ambition, but growth simply has not happened. The industry was worth about &#163;4 billion when we set the target, and it is worth just over &#163;4 billion now. At this juncture, we need to hear from the Government how on earth it intends to proceed. We have not heard any new ideas from the minister today.</p><p>In the most recent economic plan, \"Accelerating Recovery\", to which I referred earlier, there was a paucity of ideas, with the statement saying simply that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland ... outperformed the rest of the world in 2009\".</p><p>The minister was not able to justify that statement in his opening speech. Perhaps he wishes to now, or perhaps he will later. The recovery plan document explains that the loss that took place in tourism here in 2009 was lower than the loss in the average country in the world. So, because our loss was slightly less than average, ministers decided to state that we</p><p class=\"indent\">\"outperformed the rest of the world\".</p><p>That is a bizarre statement. In our amendment, we deal with tourism statistics very carefully&#8212;and I will return to that.</p><p>The other issue that I wish to focus on is skills and training in the industry. That was a central part of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee's report on tourism revenue, and it has been politely but firmly ignored by the Government in the two years since its publication.</p><p>The bottom line is that Scotland is not going to compete on price, even with an undervalued pound. Therefore, in the medium and long term, we must compete on quality. If we are going to lift the quality of the sector, we need improvement in skills and training. Everybody who gave evidence to our committee made that clear. One complaint was that a lot of public money gets spent on tourism-related courses&#8212;there are more than 400 of them&#8212;but we heard about diminished practical training, about employers' criticism of students' <place-holder colnum=\"24622\"/> abilities, and about their criticism of the level of competence of those students when they get into the industry.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20699969", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We should all be extremely proud of the Scottish tourism industry.

This review group should make recommendations to the Minister on the type and number of education, skills and training courses for the future. A starting principle for such a review is a wholesale rationalisation into a model that suits Scottish needs\".</p><p>A group was set up seven or eight months after the report was published, but it had nothing to do with the format that the committee suggested. There was no obvious involvement from the tourism minister in the group&#8212;it was led, I think, by Fiona Hyslop&#8212;and, from what I can see, there were no evidence-taking sessions. The group was chaired not by an industry specialist but by a representative of the Scottish Government and, of the 22 people on the group, only three were from the tourism sector. As a consequence, the group concluded that the range of qualifications is not a problem, the industry is broadly happy and that, ultimately, no real change is required, which was in complete contrast to what the committee found. I call on the Government to set up urgently the group that the committee recommended and do what it should have done the best part of two years ago.</p><p>My final point concerns the tourism statistics. We have traded statistics so far. In his speech, the minister gave a balanced account of last summer's performance. I commend him for that, but it is in stark contrast to what he has said in press releases&#8212;Lewis Macdonald referred to that. The Scottish Government's headline said, \"Summer of <place-holder colnum=\"24623\"/> 2009 saw tourism boom\", but that is simply not correct. It was not as bad as it might have been&#8212;I am sure that the year of homecoming had an impact&#8212;and the sector did a lot better than we might have feared, but it was nowhere close to being a \"tourism boom\".</p><p>The minister accepted in his speech that there was a decrease last summer in numbers of tourists&#8212;granted it was a small decrease, but it was a decrease nonetheless&#8212;but he still claimed a couple of months ago that it was a \"tourism boom\". That press release included only figures for parts of the world from which visits had increased, which was wrong. The minister talked about big increases in visitors from North America, which were welcome. He also talked about big increases from other countries outside Europe and North America, which was also welcome. However, by ignoring the figures for tourists from Europe and the UK&#8212;which is where more than 80 per cent of our tourists come from&#8212;the press release gave a totally misleading impression of what happened last summer. None of us expected a boom summer, and the way in which the minister presented the figures today was perfectly acceptable. However, I call on the Government to ensure that, when it puts out its press releases and talks about what is happening to the industry, it tells us what is actually happening and does not simply selectively quote the figures for countries from which there has been an increase in tourists.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5962.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"further notes that in its 2008 report, <em>Growing Pains - can we achieve a 50% growth in tourist revenue by 2015?</em>, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee recommended unanimously that the Scottish Government should set up a review group of leading industry specialists to make recommendations on the type and number of tourism education, skills and training courses in the future; notes that the committee's report suggested that the starting point for the review group should be a wholesale rationalisation into a model that suits Scottish needs and has industry buy-in; calls on the Scottish Government to implement the committee recommendation as soon as possible, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that all press releases and announcements that it issues regarding tourism statistics paint a clear and wholly accurate picture of the industry.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20699969", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The report is approaching its second anniversary and it made a very clear recommendation.

It is fair to say that the fortnight has been bigger and better than ever before. What impresses me as much as anything is how innovative, cutting-edge and successful the organisation has been in embracing technology and using every possible means to get its message across to people of all ages throughout the United Kingdom. This year's big idea, as it were, is the big swap, the challenge behind which is to get 1,000,001 people across the UK to agree to swap for the whole fortnight one household product that they would typically buy for a fair trade product. That is just the initial objective, but we hope that people stick with the fair trade product when the two weeks are up.</p><p>Looking in advance of this debate at previous fair trade debates, I was interested to note that in the first debate there were many jibes and comments about the quality of the bananas, the tea, the coffee and the chocolate. However, that debate is well and truly dead. The quality of the product right across the spectrum has changed and is as good as one will find anywhere else. As <place-holder colnum=\"24205\"/> a result, I am hopeful that those who decide to take part in the big swap will continue to buy those products long after Fairtrade fortnight is over.</p><p>As I read through previous debates, I was also comforted to note that the sales of fair trade products have not been negatively affected by the economic downturn&#8212;those who have been loyal to the products have remained so. Indeed, according to the last figures that I looked at, there was 12 per cent growth in fair trade products in the UK. Bill Butler mentioned a UK-wide figure of &#163;700 million which, as he said, makes us the world's largest market for fair trade products. Purely out of interest, I would be interested to know the Scottish share of that &#163;700 million and whether we punch above our weight in the UK. I rather suspect that we punch well above our weight.</p><p>One of the reasons for the fair trade movement's continued success is that it is a genuinely grass-roots movement that has embraced everyone, including business and commerce, who has wanted to be part of it. Indeed, as Bill Butler said, Marks and Spencer and Cadbury have embraced various initiatives. Walking down the Royal Mile to work, I noticed that Starbucks is running a fair trade promotion and according the Fairtrade Foundation's website, Ben and Jerry's ice cream, which is designed to appeal to the younger consumer, has been signed up and is on board.</p><p>The movement clearly continues to make progress.

What matters most about our debate is what we are doing to help the lives of people throughout Scotland and what we will do in the medium and longer term to ensure that future policies succeed. We must recognise that the debate takes place not in a vacuum but in extremely difficult financial circumstances for the <place-holder colnum=\"24169\"/> budget that is about to come into force in April and&#8212;more important&#8212;probably for budgets in the next five years or so, according to independent experts.</p><p>The Scottish Government's website describes regeneration as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the lasting transformation of places to benefit those who live and work there.\"</p><p>The minister was right in his speech to add to that the point that while regeneration is, of course, about places, it is also&#8212;more important&#8212;about sustained employment and economic activity for people. If we are to improve the life chances of people throughout Scotland, we must consider increasing our economic activity all over the country.</p><p>That is why the business start-up rate in Scotland is critical. In the past 10 or 15 years&#8212;the years for which we have data&#8212;the rate has flatlined, despite the best efforts of politicians of all stripes. Our rate is behind that south of the border. Occasionally, being behind south of the border can be argued away by saying that business is great in London and that we are fairly similar to other parts of the UK, but that does not apply to start-up rates. The only region whose rate we are ahead of is Yorkshire and Humberside. It is a big ask, but if the minister has something to say in his closing speech about what the Government might do next on start-ups, it will be well received.</p><p>We have heard about the small business bonus scheme in the past couple of years. The fact that it could be open to holders of multiple properties whose rateable value is less than &#163;25,000 is a big step forward. Just last week, I had a conversation with a small businessman who is thinking seriously about opening a new shop in another part of town on the back of that policy. He obtained a rent reduction on a vacant and derelict property, because it was not hugely attractive, and he thinks that receiving a small business bonus on top of that will be the tipping point that pushes him into opening that shop.</p><p>We have heard much about the town centre regeneration fund, which was a Conservative manifesto commitment. We pushed for that in last year's budget and it has had a positive impact throughout Scotland, to the tune of &#163;60 million. I accept Ross Finnie's argument that there is a bigger problem; the minister said that demand for the fund outstripped supply. I note that there were 132 applications and 36 winners in round 1 and that there were 136 applications and only 30 winners in round 2, which was a ratio of 4:1. I am pretty certain that those figures are just the tip of the iceberg. Far more than 136 towns, villages and parts of cities could have been eligible and wanted <place-holder colnum=\"24170\"/> funding but simply did not get round to applying or could not do so in time. Far more must be done.</p><p>The key question is where the money will come from to continue the regeneration that has been undertaken for the past 30 or 40 years. Whichever way it is dressed up, this year's Scottish budget is static. As I said earlier, we know that less money will be available. We also know from what we have seen in the pre-budget report and subsequent analysis that the capital budget appears to have been hit disproportionately. Of course, that may change in the next budget. We will hear about that at a later stage. The best analysis thus far suggests that the capital budget will be hit. We will have to be innovative in how we leverage in funding from the private sector to ensure that regeneration can happen.</p><p>What is the Government's current view on tax increment financing, which local authorities can use to borrow on the strength of future council tax and business rates revenues to build developments? Recently, the Scottish Conservative leader, Annabel Goldie, proposed a business dividend fund that would allow local authorities that achieved above-target business rates revenue as a result of businesses being set up in their area to keep a proportion of that revenue.

Dr McKee gave a good indication of the number of bikes that the organisation has recycled over the past couple of years.</p><p>He mentioned the Bike Station's latest project&#8212;a &#163;750,000 project to encourage people to lead healthier lives by leaving their cars at home, using public transport and, ultimately, cycling or walking. There is a double benefit from what the organisation is trying to do. The first is the benefit to Edinburgh from a reduction in carbon emissions. The second is that people will lead healthier lives by taking more exercise, thereby getting fitter and living longer&#8212;a benefit that, as a former GP, Ian McKee is happy to bring to members' attention.</p><p>An impressive aspect of the organisation is the fact that it does not work alone. Dr McKee mentioned about a dozen partners with whom it works, including Lothian Buses, the City Car Club and Cycling Scotland. On looking through the Bike Station website, I noted that it is working with about 15 organisations to try to ensure that it achieves the pretty strenuous targets that it has set for the next 12-month period.<place-holder colnum=\"23718\"/></p><p>I was struck by quotations that I found both on the website and in interviews in the <em>Edinburgh Evening News</em>. First, given that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"People might be afraid to cycle down somewhere like Leith Walk\"&#8212;</p><p>which is a fairly busy road&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we find a quicker and quieter route.\"</p><p>The Bike Station not only encourages people to cycle but helps those who would have to travel from home to work and vice versa along routes that are not conducive to cycling to find the best route, one that makes cycling a feasible and safe option.</p><p>The second quotation that I was struck by is a simple one: \"We organise car shares.\" Car sharing may not be a particularly new idea, but the take-up of car sharing in Edinburgh and across Scotland is nowhere near as good as it could or should be. The fact that the Bike Station is going to go into 250 companies to organise car shares means that there is a fair chance that people will take up the offer. As soon as a critical mass of people become involved in car shares, the prospect of growth is pretty good.</p><p>The organisation has set some stringent targets. Aiming to get 12,500 people to fill out a survey is in itself a tough ask, as is the target of getting 10,000 people to reduce their car usage. Those targets lead on to tougher and more advanced measures: getting 5,000 people to use public transport or to walk or cycle to work one day a week, and getting 2,500 to walk or cycle to work three days a week. Ian McKee used the word \"weaning\", which is a nice term to use.</p><p>The Bike Station is an impressive project. Again, I congratulate Dr McKee on securing the debate.

That should be welcomed. Fifty per cent relief will be available for rateable values of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;12,000, and the threshold for those who receive 25 per cent relief will increase from &#163;15,000 to &#163;18,000.

Investment trusts were invented here; they are a Scottish success story and the origins go back all the way to the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>As has been said, the challenge that we face, and the reason for this urgent debate, is the draft alternative investment fund managers directive. That draft directive was rushed&#8212;always a bad start&#8212;and was not subject to the usual consultation procedures, which exist for good reasons. It is also based on a report that was prepared by a single member of the European Parliament. When we combine those three factors, we have an extremely blunt instrument.</p><p>It has been mentioned that the draft directive is nicknamed \"the hedge fund directive\". The nickname says it all. The objective and purpose was to be seen to be doing something about hedge funds. The directive certainly will attack hedge funds, but because of the wide definition that it uses, it also inadvertently captures the investment trust industry and could, as a consequence, cause serious damage to the Scottish economy. Bill Jamieson of <em>The Scotsman</em> put it rightly when he said that investment trusts were</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an innocent bystander to the events that rocked the banking system of America and Europe.\"</p><p>The negatives of the draft directive have been outlined already: the fact that it restricts investment trusts from investing in Asia, where the recovery is gaining momentum, which means that investors would miss out on potential gains there; the sheer cost of restructuring investment vehicles, which David Whitton put at billions of euros, with little benefit for investors, savers or <place-holder colnum=\"22705\"/> pension funds; the fact that it duplicates not just one, but several existing sets of regulations; and the fact that it could, in effect, prevent the sector from having any new product launches or expansion. That is bad news for the industry and, most important, for the customers&#8212;pension holders, pension funds and individual investors. It restricts choice and access to areas of investment growth.</p><p>We welcome the movement from the European Parliament thus far and we welcome the revisions that happened during the Swedish presidency, but we ask that the same direction of travel continue during the Spanish presidency. As other members have, I call on all MEPs across the spectrum to influence a rethink on the draft directive.</p><p>The origins of the financial crisis were complex, many and varied, but one of the key factors was a total lack of diligence by banks, regulators, companies and others.

First, I will examine whether the draft budget meets one of its stated key objectives of supporting economic recovery. Secondly, I will take a look at some of the medium and long-term implications of the Government's current and proposed policies.<place-holder colnum=\"22296\"/></p><p>As stated in the draft budget document, the budget has the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"key objectives of investing in frontline services and supporting economic recovery.\"</p><p>The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, on which I sit, looked mainly at the latter objective. That committee raised some serious questions about whether the economy is treated as a priority in the draft budget. Our numerous evidence sessions all suggested that that was not the case.</p><p>One need only look at the SPICe briefing \"Draft Budget 2010-11\" to see the cuts that the draft budget proposes to the various portfolios. While the finance and sustainable growth portfolio will undergo a 7 per cent real-terms cut and administration will take a 4 per cent real-terms cut, all the other portfolios will experience either a small increase or a small decrease. Finance and sustainable growth stands out on its own as the portfolio with the largest real-terms cut.</p><p>Simply looking at the finance and sustainable growth portfolio as a whole does not give the entire picture, so it is right that we should drill down to look at the various parts of that portfolio. However, the question for the Government is whether the draft budget will provide an increase for any budgets that relate to economic activity. To use the Government's words, have any of those budgets been \"prioritised\"? Those are the key questions in considering whether the draft budget's purported objective stands up to scrutiny.</p><p>If we drill down into the finance and sustainable growth portfolio, we see that tourism comes under that line. The annual tourism budget is to be decreased from &#163;49 million to &#163;44 million. Some of that decrease is explained by last year's one-off injection for the year of homecoming, but that explains less than half of the decrease. Even if we take away the homecoming figure, the tourism budget is still being cut by 6 or 7 per cent at a time when&#8212;according to the Government&#8212;the budget as a whole is supposedly being cut by 1 per cent. If the entire budget is being cut by 1 per cent and the tourism budget is being cut by 6 or 7 per cent, how can the Government say that tourism is a priority in its six-point plan?</p><p>The cut in the enterprise budget was highlighted by other speakers, including Mr Purvis, who talked about that in between talking about sadistic dentists. One's mind wanders occasionally during debates, and I was left wondering whether I would rather spend an hour with a sadistic dentist or an hour with Mr Purvis. I confess to not yet having reached a conclusion. Mr Purvis knows that I say that in jest.</p><p>The enterprise budget to which Mr Purvis referred will decrease. The cabinet secretary pointed out that that can be explained by the <place-holder colnum=\"22297\"/> reprofiling of capital and by items that have been removed from Scottish Enterprise, such as the central marketing of the business gateway, which I understand has been moved to local authorities. However, that does not explain the decrease in its entirety. Scottish Enterprise suggested in its evidence to the committee that, excluding all the items that had been removed, its budget had been cut in absolute terms by about &#163;10 million this year. Again, there has been no explanation of that. If enterprise is a priority, why is it receiving a cut greater than the average cut for the budget as a whole? I hope that the Government can provide some answers.</p><p>My colleague Mr Brownlee spent much of his speech talking about the medium and long-term impact of the budget and the decisions that we take. In my view, it is irresponsible to attempt to deliver new services to the public when we will have trouble delivering the current ones. Mr Brownlee referred to economic analyses that suggest that there might be a &#163;3 billion or &#163;4 billion real-terms cut to the Scottish budget over the next four or five years. If it is a cut of that magnitude, we will have serious problems delivering what we already deliver and it is ludicrous to attempt to deliver other policies. The Scottish Conservatives have already referred to free school meals and free prescriptions.</p><p>What about the legislation that has already been passed? The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 received royal assent earlier this year. There will be financial implications when the act comes into force. Has any cognisance been taken of that? What about single status and equal pay claims that are left hanging? Has any cognisance been taken of those?</p><p>I leave the Government with two thoughts.

Labour has got it badly wrong many times now. It constantly changes its predictions for debt; it constantly changes its predictions for borrowing; and it constantly changes its predictions for growth.</p><p>I start with growth. In the PBR last year, Labour predicted that the contraction to the economy would be 0.75 per cent. By the time we got to the budget in April, the growth figure was -3.5 per cent; on 9 December, we heard that it is -4.75 per cent. What a difference over the course of 12 months.</p><p>Labour said in the PBR last year that we would borrow &#163;118 billion this year. That was an eye-watering figure at the time. Now, we are told that it will be &#163;178 billion this year, which is 12.6 per cent of our GDP&#8212;the largest percentage for any country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p><p>The pre-budget report on 9 December should have been about three things: putting country before party, measures to aid the recovery and a credible plan to restore the state of our public finances. I believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer failed on all three of those measures. On the first, it is fairly apparent to most commentators that the pre-budget report was about the forthcoming election. It put party before country, with Labour desperately attempting to appeal to its core vote. One commentator described the PBR, generously, as a pre-election \"publicity stunt\". In its leader column last week, <em>The Economist </em>stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the pre-budget report ... was always likely to be more political than sensible. Even so it disappointed.\"</p><p>The PBR should also have been about measures to aid recovery. We are the last of the big G20 countries still to be mired in recession, yet what did we get? We got something that Labour members have not been terribly keen to talk about today: another national insurance increase, to go with the national insurance increase that was announced in last year's pre-budget report&#8212;a tax on employees, and a tax on jobs. The Government said that it will be a tax on employees who earn more than &#163;20,000 per year, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies says that it will be a tax on people who earn more than &#163;14,000 per year. I leave members to decide whose analysis they prefer: that of the chancellor, who has got it wrong so many times, or that of the IFS. I ask Labour members, what is fair about increasing tax for people who earn a mere &#163;14,000 a year?</p><p>Of course, national insurance contributions are a tax on not just employees but employers. The <place-holder colnum=\"22232\"/> increase is a disincentive on employers to create new jobs and takes money away from public services. The biggest employer in many regions is the national health service, which will have to make those employers' contributions. That is why the Confederation of British Industry Scotland was disappointed with the decision and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said that the increase</p><p class=\"indent\">\"could lead to damage to Scotland's skills base and competitiveness.\"</p><p>It is also why the Institute of Directors said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A further tax on jobs at a time like this is madness.\"</p><p>A number of Labour members talked about how Labour would protect core public services&#8212;health, education and policing. However, they all neglected to say for how long they were making that commitment&#8212;that is what I wanted to ask when I tried to intervene. If we look away from the press releases and the bluster and consider the small print, we learn that the commitment is to protect those core services for two years. It is a commitment that will last not too long after the general election.</p><p>The PBR should have offered a credible plan to restore the public finances. It failed pretty miserably to do that. An opportunity has been missed and lost. It is clear from the small print in the PBR that there will have to be cuts of about &#163;36 billion in departmental spending, but the chancellor and the Government failed to give us any indication of which departments will face cuts. That is bad news, for several reasons. First, it plays the people for fools. It tries to suggest to us, by delaying the pain that we must inevitably face, that the pain will not happen. It will happen, and the sooner the Government faces up to that and is honest with people about the choices that we face, the better it will be for everybody.</p><p>More important, we are clinging on to our AAA rating by our fingernails. If we lose that rating, the cost of the interest payments on our enormous debt will skyrocket upwards and our problems will be magnified significantly. The Labour Government should not have put the party first. It should have helped the recovery and it should have come up with a credible plan.

I thank the clerks to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, who were extremely helpful with the bill, and all those who gave evidence to the committee at stages 1 and 2.</p><p>The codification of arbitration is a useful exercise, as it helps to present a more modern and dynamic offering of Scottish arbitration law. There is also a good economic case for the bill. It will increase slightly the number of domestic consumer and commercial arbitrations, and there is potential for a greater number of international arbitrations to come to Scotland. It is important not <place-holder colnum=\"21273\"/> to overstate the case, as was done to begin with, although the initial claim has been withdrawn. However, we hope that the number of international arbitrations will increase, without putting bold figures on that hope.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of the bill depends on whether it can make arbitration faster and cheaper. Those two attributes are, of course, related. Rule 23 will impose a duty that the tribunal must</p><p class=\"indent\">\"conduct the arbitration ... without unnecessary delay\".</p><p>Therefore, the duty to conduct arbitration far faster than has happened in the past is in the bill. Also, removing the stated case procedure that existed in arbitrations, which was open to abuse, should help to take time off many commercial arbitrations.</p><p>On the stage 2 and stage 3 amendments, it is fair to say that the minister has been inclusive and open in his discussions and negotiations. He has listened to the experts and to the committee's stage 1 report, which is why all 60 stage 2 amendments and all 30 stage 3 amendments were passed unopposed.</p><p>The meetings with the consumer groups on 6 August and with legal experts on 18 August were very important. The meeting with the consumer groups was important because it thrashed out a couple of issues and helped us to put to bed the fear that the bill would negatively affect consumer arbitrations.</p><p>The meeting with the legal experts was vital to the progress of the bill. The bulk of the stage 2 and stage 3 amendments came about as a consequence of that meeting, at which the experts put their heads together and looked through some of the technical faults in the drafting, some of which had just been brought in from the 1996 English act.</p><p>In particular, I pick out the changes to rules 45 and 46. Rule 45, on damages, has become mandatory, so the arbitrator will be able to award damages, which is important. Rule 46, on interest, is also now mandatory, so the arbitrator will have the power to award interest in all arbitrations. The danger with those rules as they were before amendment was that weaker parties to a contract would have been at a big disadvantage to the larger parties, particularly in, for example, a construction contract, in which the main contractor has some sway over a subcontractor. Making those rules mandatory puts both parties on a more level playing field.</p><p>The commencement rules at section 33 and the transitional provisions at section 33A make it absolutely clear that the bill does not apply to current arbitrations but does apply to contracts with arbitration clauses that have not yet gone into <place-holder colnum=\"21274\"/> arbitration. However, it is important that the bill gives those parties the opportunity to opt out of the legislation, which is only fair.</p><p>Rule 50, on provisional awards, has become default and rule 51, on part awards, has become mandatory. I support those moves. There was a suggestion that, initially, the bill was simply presented the wrong way round, although that was disputed. In any event, it is absolutely right to have rule 50 as default and rule 51 as mandatory. I also welcome the attempts at stage 2 and today to strengthen and tighten the rules on confidentiality. The Government has got that right, too.</p><p>The bill's success rests on whether arbitration becomes faster and cheaper. If it does not, arbitration does not have a particularly bright future but, if it begins to become faster and cheaper, it can start to prosper domestically and internationally. The bill attempts to achieve that and it is the best that we could put together, but more important will be the culture shift among arbitrators, legal practitioners and the parties to arbitration. If the combination of the bill and the culture shift makes arbitration faster, the future can be positive.</p><p>The minister said in his opening remarks that it will probably be a long time before arbitration is on the legislative agenda again. I am sure that that is right. We will certainly support the bill at 5 o'clock, but I ask the minister to keep a watching brief on the issue. We might not return to it in a legislative sense any time soon, but it is important that the tools are not downed today or tomorrow. I hope that the minister personally agrees in his summation to keep a watching brief and to do everything that he can to ensure that arbitration becomes faster and cheaper.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20389327", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Arbitration (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by declaring that I used to be a practising solicitor conducting arbitration and that I am retained on the roll of solicitors, although I do not think that I stand to gain personally from the bill.

Despite underlying hope of a return to positive&#8212;albeit very small&#8212;growth, the recent figures make it clear that that has not happened yet. Although the decline was not as sharp as in previous quarters, it was a decline nonetheless. In quarter 2, the economy contracted by 0.6 per cent in the UK and by 0.8 per cent in Scotland, which means that the UK has experienced six successive quarters of negative growth. As has rightly been pointed out, countries such as France, Germany and Japan have moved into growth and are technically out of recession. However, I add a minor word of warning that growth from such a low base&#8212;and from such a desperate position&#8212;might not be particularly positive and could be extremely fragile. We need to be aware of that as we move forward.</p><p>As we have heard from all sides of the chamber, the unemployment statistics make for depressing reading. Some 192,000 people in Scotland are now unemployed, and it is quite likely that the number will continue to rise over the next couple of quarters. When I intervened on the cabinet secretary to voice my concern about the faster rate of increase in unemployment in Scotland, he retorted that the situation had improved slightly. However, the figures for quarter 2 show that the rate of increase in unemployment in Scotland was almost double the rate of increase in England. I accept that that relates only to one quarter, but if that trend were to continue, it would be deeply worrying, because Scotland's unemployment rate would then be in danger of overtaking that of the UK. I ask the Scottish Government to examine that issue closely as we move forward.</p><p>Other miscellaneous points arose during the debate, including Mr Kelly's claim that increased discretionary spending has been available to families throughout Scotland. However, it must be borne in mind that much of that increase could be due to the fact that interest rates are currently at 0.5 per cent. Although the statistic that Mr Kelly mentioned might sound nice, it is not one that I recognise. If interest rates were to increase to 3 or 4 per cent, there could be a dramatic decrease in the discretionary spend of families in Scotland.

First, as Derek Brownlee did well to point out, we need to start putting more emphasis on our business start-up rate and on growing our smaller businesses into medium-sized enterprises. I gently point out that the Scotland performs website indicates that we have made progress in that regard, but almost all of the recent increase&#8212;the rate was flat for about 10 years&#8212;could be attributed to the change in VAT law, which meant that many companies became eligible for VAT and were given a commercial reason for becoming so. It would be interesting to know whether the 2008 figures are available, given that the latest figures on the website relate to 2007.</p><p>The updated economic recovery plan also refers to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"reducing the business costs of regulation\",</p><p>which all Conservatives want to see. However, the document gives the impression that that has already happened. I would be interested to know from the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism or from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth&#8212;whichever of them will sum up today's debate&#8212;whether he feels that those costs have been reduced. Setting up the regulatory review body was a good piece of work, but it seems to me that not much of its work has been put into practice thus far. I do not think that I have yet seen a piece of legislation for which a business impact assessment has been produced.</p><p>On energy, the Council of Economic Advisers expressed a big concern, as did most of the business community, about the Government's energy policy. Now that the independent report has been produced, I ask the cabinet secretary whether we can see it so that we can produce our own analysis and determine whether the independent experts also had concerns about the policy.</p><p>The Scottish Investment Bank was announced in April.

However, the debate has been useful, and the main bonus has been that it indicates early intent from the Parliament to take the report seriously. Moreover, unless I have completely misread the debate, Parliament will be united at decision time in the view that the report must be taken forward as quickly as possible.</p><p>Two points struck me in Lord Gill's introduction to the report. The first is the sheer depth and strength of the sense that reform is required&#8212;several members produced some very good quotations from the introduction in that regard. The second point is the urgency that Lord Gill clearly attaches to reform taking place. The Government and the Parliament must keep both those points in mind as we move forward.<place-holder colnum=\"20492\"/></p><p>The first area for suggested reform involves the structure of our civil court system. I suppose that the biggest proposed change here&#8212;at first blush, anyway&#8212;is to have a third tier for civil justice, with district judges dealing with cases of lower value in cash terms.</p><p>Many speakers referred to that proposal in the debate. In an intervention, Margo MacDonald raised the interesting question whether there should be a pilot initiative first, because she was worried that there could be a diminution of justice over time, even leading to claims going to the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>I do not share those concerns so strongly for the simple reason that we are possibly alone among first-world countries in not having three tiers of civil justice. We have only two tiers that, to most intents and purposes, overlap. That has perhaps led to the number of blocks in the system that we have heard about. The proposal would be a big move for the Scottish legal system but, given all the other countries that have adopted a three-tier system, I do not think that the move would be as big as has been suggested.</p><p>Of course, the introduction of a third tier would mean far more sensible financial parameters: district judges would handle cases up to a value of &#163;5,000; sheriffs would deal with cases up to a value of &#163;50,000; and our most senior judges, in the Court of Session, would look at the big-ticket cases in cash terms as well as perhaps some lower-value cases that have a strong legal significance.</p><p>Specialisation is another issue that has been touched on, but the idea is not new to the legal profession. For several years now, the Law Society of Scotland has awarded accreditation to specialists within the profession. Most civil law firms already have specialists and are organised into departments. People are not considered simply as civil lawyers but as, for example, banking lawyers, property lawyers, corporate lawyers or insolvency lawyers.</p><p>As the Law Society recognises, the profession has already specialised, so the time has come for greater specialisation among the judiciary. Where such specialisation has been tried, it has been reasonably successful. Certainly, when I appeared a few times before the commercial court in Glasgow, I found the experience far better than when I had appeared before the civil court there.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20207535", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Civil Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I declare an interest in that I used to practise as a litigation solicitor, and I am retained on the roll of solicitors.

As Robert Brown will know, anyone who wants to enter the legal profession must first complete a traineeship, which involves spending a good amount of time working in several areas of law prior to any specialisation. Although such a tension might appear to exist, I do not think that both outcomes cannot be achieved.</p><p>Another specific proposal is about the speed of court judgments. The review proposes a three-month rule, under which any judgment that takes more than 12 weeks will need to appear on a register with a statement of the reason why the judgment has taken longer and when the decision is likely to be issued. An interesting point is that the consultation included no specific question on the speed of court judgments, but respondents decided to comment on the matter because they felt so strongly about it. Lord Gill refers to the \"indignation in the profession\" about the sheer length of time that judgments can take. Just this week, I spoke to a senior lawyer who told me of one Court of Session case in which it took more than two years from the time when the proof finished to the issuing of the decision. That is simply unacceptable. His client told him that he will never litigate in Scotland again.</p><p>Others have touched on the proposal for a docket system, which is the idea that a case should be given to one judge from start to finish. That might not be easy to achieve in practice, but the proposal has enormous merit. Such a system already operates in Australia. The idea was not pursued under the Woolf reforms in England, but I think that people regret that decision now and a potential for change now exists there. A docket system would mean that the judge could truly understand the case instead of passing it from pillar to post.</p><p>Time is upon me, so I will conclude by saying that the Government should, as soon as it can, provide a timetable and a process for making decisions on the proposals. In doing so, it should balance two principles. First, as Lord Gill said, the review provides an integrated solution whose recommendations should not simply be cherry picked, especially given the fact that they were all agreed unanimously. Secondly, balanced against that consideration is the fact some of the reforms will be far easier and quicker to implement than others and some, as Lord Gill has admitted, might have unintended consequences that will need to be bottomed out before they proceed. However, it is vital that we go forward with the proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20207535", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Civil Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes, I noted that recommendation, but I believe that both things are needed.

The Parliament seems to be united in its view that far too long has passed since 1999 for us still to be in this situation. We are also united in the view that we are in a complex situation that will not be resolved overnight or easily. However, the longer it goes on, the more complex it might become. Many members have mentioned the Bainbridge case, which adds confusion where there was already confusion. The committee's report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee is concerned that there appears to be no end in sight and that as soon as one set of problems is resolved, another set arises ... The Committee is of the view that if Single Status had been implemented earlier ... a number of these legal issues would not have arisen.\"</p><p>There is a danger that, for every month or year for which we delay, more complex legal issues will arise. There could be another Bainbridge-type case next month or next year.<place-holder colnum=\"20182\"/></p><p>I will focus my remarks for the next couple of minutes on an unresolved issue that has not been explored enough in this morning's debate: Scottish Government facilitation. One or two members have touched on that, and the committee made unanimous recommendations on it. Ten years on, there is a strong argument for the Scottish Government to show leadership in that capacity.</p><p>I was struck by COSLA's comment:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the level of caution is sky-high. Nobody wants to sign anything.\"</p><p>Duncan McNeil put it even more simply today when he said that no one is prepared to make the first move. Mr Swinney asked why the Government should get involved, but when we consider the sheer number of cases&#8212;we heard today that there are 35,000 cases, and that figure might rise&#8212;along with the potential financial liability and the length of time that it has taken so far, the argument for such involvement is particularly strong. Mr Swinney came back with some reasons, and some of the justifications that he gave are perfectly valid. He said that the Scottish Executive was not involved in the agreement in 1999. That is correct. He also made the perfectly fair point that in 2006, when the recommendation came forward from the Finance Committee, the previous Executive chose not to get involved. That is also true. However, there is an argument that that might have been a mistake by the previous Executive. It is not a justification for why the Government should not get involved today. Although progress has been made since 2006, six councils have still not implemented single status, 10 years on.</p><p>Mr Swinney also said that the Government does not want to micromanage. Of course, as a Conservative, I do not want to see the Government micromanaging, but given the sheer scale and volume of the issue, it would be difficult to argue that Government involvement would constitute micromanagement. There are plenty of examples of Government involvement in both public and private issues that are far smaller and less significant.</p><p>The question becomes how the Government should act. Mr Swinney is right to argue that it should not go in with heavy boots and come up with an arbitrary decision that forces councils to do this and that. As the report states, the emphasis should be on facilitation. That is where the Government could play a good role. By facilitating, it can get parties together. It is highly unlikely that parties would refuse to come to the table if the offer was put and the initiative was taken by Mr Swinney or somebody else in the Government. That would also help to set a timetable. Under the initial timetable, single status had to be implemented by 2002, but that drifted and it was <place-holder colnum=\"20183\"/> then delayed until 2004. There does not appear to be a timetable in train at the moment. The Government could help to push things along more quickly.</p><p>I reiterate that the entire committee, which has members from the four main parties, agreed that there is a role for Government to play. Mr Swinney's own back benchers, of whom he has three on the committee, agreed with that conclusion. There was no division on that.</p><p>There are things that the Government can do to try to push the implementation of single status by the remaining six councils, but it can also play a facilitative role in considering how councils ought to approach the strong cases, of which I am sure there are many among the 35,000. I am sure that there are cases without merit too, but there will be a number of strong cases in which the only point to be argued is one of quantum and the question is how much ought to be paid rather than whether there is liability. It seems wrong that, as a country, we should spend taxpayers' money to defend cases that we know are indefensible. In cases in which the only discussion to be had is about quantum, there is a strong role to be taken. Of course, there is a risk attached to Government action to do that, but the risks of inaction are slightly greater.</p><p>I join others in welcoming today's announcement about capitalisation, which represents progress and a good step forward. However, it is useful to repeat the question that my colleague David McLetchie asked. Is the amount equivalent to the &#163;500 million that will go to 37 councils in England, which was announced this week, or is it equivalent to the &#163;1.6 billion that David McLetchie mentioned? It is important for us to know the answer to that question.</p><p>I close by reiterating a point that a couple of members made about equality proofing. Duncan McNeil asked whether discrimination still exists. The unions have suggested that it does, but COSLA has suggested that it does not. Probably quite rightly, the committee did not feel able to investigate that in detail, but the fact that the question has been put represents a warning light that the matter is worthy of examination. The suggestion of an independent equality-proofing audit seems pretty sensible. It would probably mean that fewer cases were lodged in the future and it would provide a good defence to councils if cases were to arise, so I commend the suggestion.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200694", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Official Report 1 October 2009: \"Equal Pay in Local Government\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a good debate on the back of a good report.

All three are interlinked and they are all critical to policy. What is required more than ever is a balanced mix, so that we have a sensible and sustainable energy policy for the long term. In that vein, I agree with Lewis Macdonald that the Scottish Government's position in ruling out nuclear at this stage is a mistake; I hope that it will reverse that position over time.

It was suggested that no insulation was expected to be provided under the scheme before December this year. Will the minister comment on that in pulling together his closing remarks?</p><p>The committee heard about fuel poverty. I am grateful to the minister for clearing up the point about the target, but that must be set against the backdrop of where the statistics are going. In 2002, 13 per cent of households in Scotland were deemed to be fuel poor; in 2007, according to the most recent figures that I have been able to get hold of, 25 per cent of households were deemed to be fuel poor. It was clear to the committee that a sea change is required if we are to get anywhere near the 2016 target. In response, the minister said that the energy assistance package was that sea change. However, the evidence&#8212;and the reports that were around at the weekend&#8212;suggests that there has not yet been such a sea change. Indeed, it was indicated that only 173 installations have been carried out under the scheme in its first five months; I appreciate that installations will also be carried over from previous schemes. If installations continue at that rate, they will not represent the sea change that we hoped for.</p><p>We have the best potential marine energy resources in Europe, and possibly the second best in the world, but we are not the only ones in the game. We need only look across the water to Portugal to see that other countries are keen to get in on the action. Some fundamental points about that were put to us by industry representatives. What is being done to help prototype funding, which is where the blockage appears to occur? What support is there for the next 12 to 24 months? Industry feels that that period is critical. What is being done about <place-holder colnum=\"20089\"/> infrastructure? The ports, harbours, manufacturing space and installation capacity are simply not there yet. We have great potential, but we need to ensure that marine renewables can play their part and that we can get away from the stage of simply having potential.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Question Time &#8212; Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body: \"Determining and delivering on Scotland's energy future\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to learn that Patrick Harvie is a keen supporter of the Welsh Conservative party.

We must watch to see whether Sweden is achieving things that we are not. Nevertheless, reductions of 40 and 50 per cent are challenging targets. On the analysis of a number of motoring organisations, it seems that the bulk of the easy wins in road safety are over. There may be some easy wins still out there, but the bulk of them, I think, are over.</p><p>Mike Rumbles is absolutely right to say that any death on Scotland's roads is a tragedy and is one death too many. Over the past 30 or 40 years, <place-holder colnum=\"19791\"/> under Governments of all different stripes, enormous progress has been made. In the late 1960s, there were almost 900 deaths a year on the roads in Scotland. The latest figures that I have seen suggest that there are now around 270 to 280 such deaths a year. Given the increase in traffic over that period, that is no mean feat for various Governments to have achieved. Nevertheless, I agree with anyone who says that there is no room for complacency.</p><p>My colleague, Alex Johnstone, touched on several measures for which the Scottish Conservatives have been pushing for some time. We had black spot funding in our previous manifesto, and we reiterate today that the targeting of problem roads must be a priority. Although the global figures have come down, there are certain roads and parts of the country where there has not been a decrease in the number of fatalities or where the decrease has taken place far more slowly than on other roads.</p><p>Some areas need to be worked on. In his statement, the minister picked up on what the Institute of Advanced Motorists, I think, had noted in drawing out specific Scottish problems or issues. It pointed to the high fatality rate per crash, which was higher than in the UK in general. It also felt that child safety should be a higher priority here, and it mentioned the issues of new drivers and rural roads, which many members have touched on in the debate.</p><p>It is worth dwelling on the point that Charlie Gordon made about technology&#8212;or distractions, as he described them. At the weekend, I read a study compiled by Heriot-Watt University that addressed various distractions. Mr Gordon rightly talked about mobile phones; the study looked at more recent developments such as satellite navigation devices. A number of crashes have happened while people have been changing the co-ordinates in their sat navs, and some have happened&#8212;although not so many&#8212;when people have been flicking about with iPods. The issue needs to be addressed each year, rather than every 10 years, as technology advances quickly and there will be things to distract drivers in five years' time that we cannot think about today.</p><p>Seat belts are not a new subject, but I was struck by a comment that the minister made in evidence to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee. He said that he thought&#8212;he added that caveat&#8212;that 50 per cent of in-car injuries and fatalities could be traced to the non-wearing of seat belts. He was not 100 per cent sure whether that figure was correct; nevertheless, if it is anywhere near correct, it highlights an area in which there might be an easy win or a slightly quicker win in comparison with other areas.<place-holder colnum=\"19792\"/></p><p>A parliamentary question was asked about the collection of data on road safety black spots, and the answer was that the information is not held centrally.

The net loss of jobs will be smaller, but that does not take anything away from the fact that 900 families will be directly affected. Given the concentration of those jobs in relatively small geographical areas, there will be an effect on communities, on people who supply local businesses and on local shops. Even if local shops do not have direct links with Diageo, the company's employees will spend their money there. The net effect will be wide. There is also more than a tinge of sadness at the end of a 190-year link between Kilmarnock and Johnnie Walker. Willie Coffey made that point well.</p><p>I praise the work of the task force. I do not agree with everything that the Government did, but I think that the task force took a constructive and positive stance. There was a partnership approach, which involved all political parties. I got the impression that, around the table, sleeves were rolled up, numbers were crunched and an attempt was made to come up with a solution that the company might not have thought of. The task force was ultimately unsuccessful, and the company has said clearly that it considers the matter closed and that it is getting on with the consultation and taking matters forward. That is disappointing but, as Derek Brownlee said, we must deal with the reality on the ground.</p><p>What are the next steps? First, we need to see the UK Government and Scottish Government working together hand in hand, along with local councils and agencies, to ensure that we do whatever we can do for the communities that are directly affected. The cabinet secretary made positive comments about the role of SDI, Skills Development Scotland's seat at the table, the work of PACE and the on-going work of Scottish Enterprise to consider what it can do. Much of what he said in that regard was welcome.</p><p>Can we take action to reskill or upskill people who face redundancy? Can there be economic <place-holder colnum=\"19706\"/> regeneration in the communities that are directly affected, so that a hammer blow&#8212;as Margaret Mitchell described it&#8212;in the short term does not lead to long-term decline.

I raised the issue in the members' business debate on Diageo two weeks ago, and I make no apology for doing so again. The minimum pricing policy, which was announced in the Government's programme, has been considered purely through the prism of health; its economic impact on the whisky industry has not been considered in great detail.</p><p>Mr Mather will be well aware that, at the recent Scottish Council for Development and Industry conference, the industry and in particular the Scotch Whisky Association made it absolutely clear what it thinks of the proposal. I read in <em>The Herald </em>yesterday that the SWA predicts that minimum pricing could reduce the value of the industry by &#163;600 million. That would represent a 20 per cent cut in the industry&#8212;[<em>Interruption.</em>] If Mr Swinney wants to challenge that and give me his analysis of the impact, I will be happy to take an intervention.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Diageo"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that all members would have preferred this debate not to have been necessary.

The debate, too, has been pretty good. At times it has been thought provoking and it has looked at the broader and deeper issues that we will face, not only in this year's budget but in shaping public spending in Scotland for the rest of the decade.</p><p>I am still not entirely clear where the Scottish Government stands on the cuts that we will inevitably face in this budget and, if commentators are correct in their analysis, in budgets in the years ahead. The Government stated in the letter that it wrote to the committee as a formal response to the report that it thought that the report was good and that it had a contribution to make, but the letter did not address the specific conclusions that the committee reached.</p><p>The cabinet secretary made a strong speech today with a very good analysis of where things are, but there was no detail about the strategic decisions that the Government intends to make. We have heard many times in the chamber from the First Minister&#8212;probably every week&#8212;about the &#163;500 million of cuts and most members have referred to that today. That has gone on for months, but we have not heard the Government say what it intends to do about it and how it will shape future budgets. It is time that the Government does that.</p><p>After reading the report, I know more about Glasgow City Council's priorities than I do about <place-holder colnum=\"19557\"/> the Scottish Government's priorities. Glasgow City Council is clear that it does not believe in what it calls salami slicing&#8212;it is not going for cuts across the board but is looking at targeted cuts. Glasgow City Council probably has less information on its budget next year than the Scottish Government has on its budget next year. I did not expect a raft of figures from the cabinet secretary&#8212;especially if the budget will be published soon&#8212;but I think that the time has come for the Government to be clear about where it thinks that the cuts will fall. Is the Government, as was suggested in a newspaper article, going for a 5 per cent cut across the board? One does not believe everything that one reads in the press, but it is incumbent on the cabinet secretary to put his position in relation to that report on the record. Is the report untrue, or is it an option that is being actively considered? Is the Government going for a more targeted approach and are there areas that it deems to be absolutely protected? I did not expect to get a glut of figures, but the Scottish Government's strategic approach is important and ought to be put in front of the Parliament.</p><p>I turn to other issues that I think are important. The public finances are of course critical. I read in the newspapers, as others will, that the Treasury believes that its tax receipts are about 20 per cent down on what they were a year ago. Regardless of whether that figure is entirely accurate, it is at least a hint of where we think that the public finances are south of the border. I take on board entirely the point that the Parliament and the Government are funded largely by the block grant so it is more difficult to say what the figures are. However, in the areas where the Government has responsibility and can tell us the figures, there ought to be an obligation on it to do so. How are we doing with the collection of council tax throughout Scotland compared to where we thought we would be? Are we collecting as much as we thought we would?</p><p>What about non-domestic rates? Given the number of businesses that have been going bust, are we collecting the rates that we thought, and hoped, we would collect, or are we down there, too? Although council tax and non-domestic rates account for only a proportion of the Scottish budget, when we combine them we are talking about &#163;4 billion, which is not an insubstantial sum of money. How are we doing with that?</p><p>How are we doing with revenues in other Government or quasi-governmental departments? We read constantly that planning departments are making far less money than they did before. Other Government departments or agencies such as VisitScotland and Historic Scotland have commercial activities built into their budget plans, so their business plan does not add up if they do <place-holder colnum=\"19558\"/> not have the amount of commercial activity that they expected.</p><p>What about councils, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which rely to a substantial degree on asset sales for their business plans to work? The Government could be a lot more candid about telling the Parliament how we are doing in comparison with how we thought that we would be doing. We are now coming up to halfway through the financial year. The Government must have some idea&#8212;I hope that it does&#8212;about how it is getting on.</p><p>Other members have referred to a newspaper article; some have read out various quotations. I want to pick up two points that were made in the article that have not been dwelt on as much. It is important that the Government and the Parliament face up to the difficulties that we face in the short, medium and long term. However, any decisions that the Government and the Parliament make must be based on sound economics. The timing of the decisions must be based on what is best for the country, as opposed to what is good politically. I have concerns when I read reports in a newspaper that say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Tough decisions on spending may be politically more acceptable after a Tory Govt. elected\".</p><p>Another statement that I read was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There may be opportunities in the political timeline that allow us to take tough decisions. Have a think about when these might be?\"</p><p>The reports might not be true and the quotations might not be correct, but it is important not only that we make correct economic decisions for the good of the country but that we are seen to be doing so. I would be very interested to hear the cabinet secretary's response to those statements. Economic decisions must be taken in the broad national interest.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190813", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Question Time &#8212; Scottish Executive &#8212; Finance and Sustainable Growth: \"Strategic Budget Scrutiny\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Finance Committee has yet again produced a very good report, so credit is due to its convener, the committee members, the clerks and SPICe.

It is an obvious statement to say that 900 families will be directly affected, but the companies that directly supply the business will also see a loss of orders that could have big impacts on their incomes and jobs. Equally, their sub-contractors and the supply chain as a whole will be affected. In addition, shops and businesses in the affected areas will, although they do not have direct contractual links to Diageo, lose business if Diageo employees reduce their spending. Those shops and businesses are bound to be affected.</p><p>It is worth reflecting and focusing on the hard work that campaigners and the Diageo task force are undertaking. There is the work of the cross-party group of MSPs and MPs, local councils, trade unions and workers. Everyone has worked hard; people are pulling together to try to create some kind of positive future. We had a march that was attended by about 20,000 people and which left no one in any doubt about the strength, breadth and depth of feeling.

I am retained on the roll of solicitors by the Law Society of Scotland and I have been involved in a number of arbitrations, although I do not stand to benefit personally from the bill. Despite the many good points in the bill and the enthusiasm of the minister, I have no intention of returning to arbitration, in either the near or the distant future.</p><p>I thank the clerks to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, who did an excellent job in pulling together the stage 1 report under difficult time constraints.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives fully support the principles of the bill. There is much to be said for codifying arbitration law. Arbitration has been with us in Scotland for many hundreds of years. Some people suggest that it predates our court system. Despite the court system then coming into use, arbitration remained popular. Over a period of several hundred years, case law developed in a fairly piecemeal fashion, with a couple of statutes along the way. The benefit of the bill before us is that it pulls the law together, codifying it in one statute. It modernises and tidies up the law in various areas, and it produces a more dynamic offering. If arbitration is to be successful, a more dynamic offering is definitely required.</p><p>If the bill is truly to meet its goals, arbitration must become faster and cheaper, and those two factors are directly related. Arbitration was popular in the past as it was fast, cheap and confidential, and because parties were able to remit their dispute to a man of skill. Over the past couple of decades, arbitration has become very slow. As a consequence, it is now sometimes more expensive than going to court. In going to court, people do not have to pay directly for the services of the judge; they do have to pay directly for the services of an arbitrator, however.</p><p>Parts of the bill will make the process faster. I like rule 23 of the Scottish arbitration rules set out in schedule 1. It puts a positive obligation on the arbitrator; it imposes a duty to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"conduct the arbitration ... without unnecessary delay, and ... without incurring unnecessary expense.\"</p><p>That sets out how the arbitrator should go about their business.</p><p>The ending of the stated case procedure, which was brought into force in 1972, should unblock many arbitrations in future. The stated case procedure allows parties to go to the Court of Session on a point of law before the arbitration can proceed. It is a great idea in principle but, over the decades, many spurious applications have been made to the courts, thereby delaying arbitrations by months and, in some cases, years.<place-holder colnum=\"18965\"/></p><p>Those two measures, together with the fact that a bill is actually proceeding, might help to produce a culture change in arbitration in Scotland, which could itself speed the process up.</p><p>Despite all those things, I ask the minister and his team to do absolutely everything in their power between now and stage 3 to find anything else that they can to speed up arbitration. The bill, and arbitration in Scotland, will stand or fall on whether we can make the process faster and cheaper. If we can, arbitration could have a pretty bright future in Scotland, both domestically and in terms of bringing in international arbitration. If the bill does not do that, I will be seriously worried about the future of arbitration.</p><p>We have heard about the economic aspects. There is no doubt in my mind that the bill will bring economic benefit. It can save court time, and I think that there will be an increase in the uptake of arbitrations. At the moment, there are only 50 commercial arbitrations a year in Scotland, and about 250 consumer-related arbitrations. As well as the economic benefit, I am sure that there will be an increase in the number of international arbitrations that come here. The important point, which every member has touched on in the debate so far, is how big the economic bonus will be. I take the minister's point&#8212;he said that it is important not to overstate the case&#8212;but I think that it was overstated in the financial memorandum. There is obviously a big difference between &#163;3 billion, which arbitration was originally believed to be worth to the City of London, and the figure of &#163;250 million, which is probably what it is actually worth to the City. The 10 per cent figure is a nice easy way to calculate what arbitration might be worth to Scotland, but 10 per cent of the value of arbitrations conducted in London will not simply gravitate to Scotland. That will take a great deal of effort, time and, no doubt, investment, because London is a well-established international centre of arbitration. I am sure that we will get some arbitrations just by passing the bill, but a great deal of effort will be required if we are serious about getting anywhere near 10 per cent.</p><p>The minister mentioned the two additional meetings that need to be held. There were two blind spots in the Government's consultation process. Not enough work was done with consumers, especially on low-cost arbitrations, which function fairly well in practice at the moment. I am concerned about the impact of foisting 25 mandatory rules on such arbitrations. I am not sure that that issue was taken fully into account, because the bill looks as if it was drafted with commercial arbitrations in mind. I welcome the minister's commitment to pursue the matter and look forward to seeing the results of the meeting to which he referred.<place-holder colnum=\"18966\"/></p><p>There will also be a meeting with legal experts to examine the drafting and some unintended consequences of the proposals. For example, the bill will give the arbitrator a power akin to interdict. Breaching an interdict that is issued by a court of law is a criminal offence, but we do not know whether breaching an interdict-type measure handed down by an arbitrator will be an offence.</p><p>We see what the Government is trying to do in the confidentiality provisions. However, if after the arbitration there is a question of law to be determined by a court and the court breaches the confidentiality rule, either intentionally or unintentionally, what will the consequences be? What action can be taken against a judge if confidentiality is breached? Has the matter been thought through?</p><p>Various other rules have been mentioned. Rules 45 and 46 concern the power to award damages and the power to award interest from the due date. There is a disparity in bargaining power&#8212;especially in the world of construction, which is the source of many arbitrations&#8212;between the employer or person funding the project and the contractor, and between the contractor and the subcontractors. When projects go out to tender, it is easy for the stronger party to say to people that they have no chance of getting the job unless they agree to a default rule being scrubbed out completely. The Government recognises that unfair bargaining power in rule 50. Why does the same argument not apply to rules 45 and 46?</p><p>The issue of commencement is important. Clearly, the bill will not apply to arbitrations that are already under way. Will it apply to contracts that have been signed but for which no arbitration has begun? Under the bill as it stands, it appears that those contracts would be affected, which would be a retrospective application of the law. The general principle in Scots law is that retrospective application is undesirable. Where we apply the law retrospectively, we must have strong reasons for doing so. When the parties signed up to their contracts, they agreed an arbitration clause and a set of rules, but the bill would impose at least 25 mandatory rules on them.</p><p>We support the general principles of the bill, but there is work to be done.

It is unlikely to grab the headlines, but it is critical for restoring faith in democracy in Scotland. It will do so in two ways, I believe. First, it will reduce voter confusion and, as a consequence, the number of rejected ballot papers will reduce. Secondly, and just as important, the bill will strengthen local government and make it accountable to the people that it seeks to serve.</p><p>The policy now has overwhelming support. It has been policy for the Conservative party&#8212;and for Tricia Marwick&#8212;for quite a number of years. I think that the Greens, too, signed David Mundell's initial proposal for a member's bill. The decoupling of the elections was recommended in the McIntosh, Kerley, Arbuthnott and Gould reports. It is interesting to note that there have been no divisions at all on the bill, either at stage 1 or in the Local Government and Communities Committee. I am sure that members are listening to this debate, and I am also fairly sure that the bill will be passed this evening, also without division.</p><p>It is now important to focus on what the next steps might be. A number of speakers have touched on that, some in more detail than others. The Achilles' heel of the bill is the potential&#8212;I stress the word \"potential\"&#8212;for reduced voter turnout. It is important to note, however, that Ron Gould himself said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In essence, the local government elections are not simply about ensuring a reasonable number of voters show up at the polls on polling day. More important is that they engage with the campaign in a meaningful manner and make a knowledgeable decision on their ballot paper.\"</p><p>I do not believe that voter turnout is the only show in town, although it is clearly critical. Other members have alluded to the decline in the number of votes in local government elections. Turnout was about 51 per cent in 1974; it dropped <place-holder colnum=\"18474\"/> to about 45 per cent in 1995. It is a matter of fact that, in 1999&#8212;the first year in which the two sets of elections were coupled together&#8212;turnout rose from 45 to 58 per cent. However, it then dropped back to 49.8 per cent just four years later. It is fair to suggest that coupling the elections improved turnout, but it does not automatically follow that turnout will go down if we decouple them. There is the potential for that to happen, but if the right structures are put in place, it can be avoided.</p><p>Efforts need to be made instantly to ensure that turnout in local government elections remains as high as it is&#8212;or higher&#8212;so that local government is truly accountable. I have reflected on some of the comments that Bruce Crawford made. At least he already has some ideas on the table, such as better adverts, grass-roots campaigns, a better schools programme, making it easier to vote and voting over a number of days, which I suspect might be tiring for campaigners and candidates, although it would perhaps make things far easier for voters. I am not sure whether the ideas that are on the table are the right ones, but it is incumbent on all of us in the Parliament and in the wider Scottish electorate to try to ensure that voter turnout does not drop as a consequence of the bill.</p><p>The STV experiment was not the heralded success that the Liberals have portrayed. The rate of rejected papers trebled between 2003 and 2007.</p><p>We will support the bill, but further action will be required as we consider turnout and voter education.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "16669360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a strange debate, in a way, as nothing has really changed since the stage 1 debate on 14 May.

I mention the report not for party-political purposes but because one of its conclusions was interesting: we have seen a decline in our town centres over approximately 30 years and local and national Governments of all stripes must take some responsibility for that and take strong responsibility for turning the situation round.</p><p>I will throw in one fact: in Scotland approximately 200 small shops a year close down&#8212;in years that are not hit by an economic storm. Some of the difficulties behind that fact lie squarely at the door of local and national Governments: they are to blame. For example, taxes on many of our small shops are far too high, regulations are far too <place-holder colnum=\"18235\"/> burdensome&#8212;70 per cent of them come from Europe rather than from Westminster or from here&#8212;and parking is an enormous problem in many of our high streets. Of course local authorities want to bring in as much revenue as they can in order to spend it on local services, but there is a question to be asked about whether some of our local authorities have tried to bring in too much revenue at the expense of the local economy. Retail crime is another problem for our shops&#8212;it will be an even bigger problem during the downturn.</p><p>Many other difficulties are not necessarily to do with Government, but arise from consumer behaviour: people like to go to supermarkets and hypermarkets. That point was well made by Karen Gillon in what was a particularly thoughtful speech. There is also, of course, internet shopping, which has increased year on year over the past five years and looks set to accelerate. All our small shops face that challenge. The internet can be an opportunity, but it is more of a threat at the moment for many of our town centres and high streets.</p><p>What do Scottish Conservatives propose to do about the problem? First, we were very much in favour of the small business bonus, which will, by definition, help small businesses far more than it will help out-of-town centres. The bonus has helped approximately 146,000 businesses across Scotland. We pushed hard for the Government to accelerate that scheme from three years to two years, which it did. From 1 April this year, many small businesses do not pay any business rates. Secondly, we pushed hard in this year's budget for another policy in which we believe, which is the town centre regeneration fund, to which every speaker in the debate has referred. The &#163;60 million in the fund will go into two tranches: &#163;40 million for tranche 1, and &#163;20 million for tranche 2. We hugely approve of that fund and look forward to seeing its results.</p><p>I have two comments for the minister, which I hope he will be able to address in the short time he will no doubt have for his wind-up speech. First, there are restrictions on the town centre regeneration fund in relation to who can apply and what is classed as a town centre. I am sure that that was unintended, but it is clear that there are towns across Scotland that ought to be included. I am sure that they would be thought of as towns by the man walking the streets, but they are excluded because of the definitions. Obviously, my request is too late for tranche 1, but I wonder whether the criteria can be widened for tranche 2.</p><p>Secondly, and finally, will the minister not simply provide a cure for high streets that have serious problems, but undertake prevention as well? Some people may describe high streets in some <place-holder colnum=\"18236\"/> areas, such as Stockbridge and Morningside, as well-heeled, but high streets nonetheless need support if they are to continue to thrive. Some money should therefore go to preventing high streets from going downhill, as opposed to trying simply to cure high streets that have already gone downhill.</p><p>We supported the Government's policy on business rates and we look forward to seeing how the town centre regeneration fund works.

However, as I asked Mr Purvis in my intervention, we need to consider what size of scheme would be appropriate for Scotland. I do not think that he answered that. As I <place-holder colnum=\"17938\"/> understand it, the Welsh scheme is worth &#163;150 million, but only &#163;75 million of that comes from the EIB&#8212;about &#163;60 million comes from the Welsh Assembly Government. If a large sum would be required from the Scottish budget, we would need to think carefully whether the money would be available and where it would come from. Would the scheme involve more than &#163;150 million, given that Scotland is bigger than Wales?</p><p>Another important question is whether the proposed scheme&#8212;I asked the same question about the ProAct proposal last week&#8212;would actually make an impact. The Welsh JEREMIE fund was launched on 24 April, so it has been running for only three or four weeks. Do we know whether the scheme has made a difference thus far? Will helping 800 businesses and 15,000 jobs actually be realised, or is that merely aspirational?</p><p>Another legitimate question is how quickly the proposed scheme could be implemented. Whereas ProAct was implemented in about three months, the chairman of Finance Wales has said that the JEREMIE fund was planned for quite some time. Those legitimate questions need to be asked before deciding whether the proposal can or should go ahead.</p><p>We will support anything that we believe will genuinely help Scottish businesses. We pushed the Scottish Government to accelerate the small business bonus scheme, which is helping 146,000 businesses across Scotland. We argued strongly for a town centre regeneration fund to the tune of &#163;60 million, which will also be positive in helping many towns in Scotland.</p><p>I have one point that I hope the minister will pick up. The Scottish Government has increased the speed with which it pays contractors by introducing a 10-day rule, which the minister said is complied with in, I think, 91 per cent of cases. However, as the minister knows, every contract with the Scottish Government involves a supply chain that involves subcontractors and, very often, sub-subcontractors. What can be done&#8212;I suspect that legislating on the matter would be difficult&#8212;about the Government's contracts with its main contractors? Can clauses be inserted into any fresh contracts to make it clear that the 10-day rule applies all the way down the supply chain? That simple measure could be implemented quite quickly, at the stroke of a minister's pen, and applied to all future contracts. That would ensure that viable businesses did not go to the wall purely because of cash-flow issues. Those are the kinds of measures that we want to see.

The claimant count&#8212;another perfectly legitimate way of looking at unemployment&#8212;has increased by 54,000 in the past 12 months, which is even worse than the figure in the motion.</p><p>Derek Brownlee spoke about the UK position. A couple of months back, somebody suggested that 3 million people might become unemployed in the UK. That estimate was on the fringes of mainstream opinion, but it has moved into the mainstream over the past few months, and most commentators think that we will be staring in the face a figure of 3 million unemployed people over the next 12 months or so. A statistic of huge concern that I confess I had not heard before is that about 40 per cent of those 3 million people could be under the age of 25. That creates enormous problems for this country into the future.</p><p>The central plank of Mr Park's proposal is the ProAct scheme initiated by the Welsh Assembly. It came out of a meeting with various business groups in November last year; it was implemented in January this year and has been running for five months. There are clear benefits from the scheme, which is having an effect in parts of Wales, but my biggest concern is the number of companies that gain from it. The most recent figures that I could get hold of suggested that 53 Welsh companies have been helped so far and a further 106 are currently being assessed. Applications number around 30 a month. As I understand it, only one company a day is applying to the ProAct scheme. Fifty-three companies have been helped, which contrasts with about 4,000 companies that need help, as I read in the official reports of the Welsh Assembly debates. That is why it could be argued that the scheme is only scratching the surface of the problem in Wales.</p><p>BDO Stoy Hayward predicts that 5,000 companies in Scotland are in serious danger of failing this year, with the potential for another 5,500 companies failing next year. Potentially, greater numbers of companies will fail, but if we are looking at helping only 53 of them&#8212;or perhaps <place-holder colnum=\"17716\"/> more in Scotland&#8212;we must question seriously how big a difference such a scheme can make. The minister made a fair point in asking that question. One could contrast that scheme with the small business bonus, for which we pushed and which I understand has helped something in the region of 146,000 companies throughout Scotland.</p><p>We will certainly examine the ProAct scheme, but there are concerns at the outset. There are concerns about the bureaucracy, which can probably be taken care of with the benefit of hindsight. There is also the obvious question of where the money might come from. It is a &#163;48 million scheme in Wales. I have seen various estimates of the funding: some say that &#163;30 million has come from European structural funds while others say that that figure is &#163;38 million, with the rest made up by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p><p>From the tone of the minister's speech, it sounded to me as if the Government had made up its mind that the scheme was not a good idea, although I might have picked that up wrong. I am happy to be corrected on that, but that is the impression that I got. Any examination of the scheme has to be swift. If it is a good idea and it is going to work, the examination and the implementation have to be swift.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15014135", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "John Park and the Labour Party have come to the chamber this morning with an important debate and with what I would describe as a plausible and positive suggestion.

It would be nice to pass the bill with support from everyone in the Parliament.</p><p>We have heard about the benefits of decoupling. It will mean less voter confusion. We have heard the figures. Some 146,000 ballot papers were rejected in the Scottish Parliament elections, and more than 40,000 ballot papers were rejected in the local government elections. Let us not forget that, although the figure for the local government elections was not as disastrous as that for the Scottish Parliament elections, those 40,000 papers represented a three-fold increase in the number of rejected ballot papers.</p><p>Gould was clear about less voter confusion being a benefit of decoupling the elections. On page 36 of his report, he stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The combination of elections in Scotland added complexity to the voting process.\"</p><p>He also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Another problem with combining these elections has to do with the confusion it creates among the electorate ... it is clear that some voters were confused by the combined elections using two electoral systems and two ballot paper marking requirements.\"</p><p>It is clear that we can reduce voter confusion by decoupling the elections.</p><p>Several members have touched on another benefit of decoupling the elections&#8212;it would give local government greater prominence. The local government elections have been overshadowed by the Scottish Parliament elections. I would not <place-holder colnum=\"17467\"/> want to be a local government candidate in Kirkintilloch, for example, when a person such as David Whitton is running the show in the area. There would be no chance of getting any coverage when somebody like that was running their campaign. Similarly, I would not want to be a council candidate in the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency trying to compete with David McLetchie for headlines.</p><p>In all seriousness, it is critical that local issues are raised in local election campaigns. To pick up on a comment that Alasdair Allan made, the council administration's record has to be discussed during a local election campaign. I suspect that the national press will still focus on national issues&#8212;that point was reasonably made by Andy Kerr&#8212;but local newspapers in Edinburgh and Glasgow, for example, are more likely to focus on council administrations in those places if only local government elections are taking place. The profiles of candidates and councillors will be raised and the electorate will be engaged on a deeper level. Ultimately, our councils will be made more accountable.</p><p>Some disadvantages of decoupling have been pointed out. Of course, voter turnout is the potential Achilles' heel of decoupling. Most members have quite reasonably raised that issue. However, it is important not to focus only on the overall voter turnout figures. Gould made a point well when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In essence, the local government elections are not simply about ensuring a reasonable number of voters show up at the polls on polling day. More important is that they engage with the campaign in a meaningful manner and make a knowledgeable decision on their ballot paper.\"</p><p>That is important. It is also worth noting that voter confidence in the system is low, and if we do not go ahead with decoupling, we will risk a far bigger drop in voter turnout at the local government elections.</p><p>Decoupling the elections has been a Scottish Conservative policy for some time, and it has gained momentum. After 2007, the elections simply have to be decoupled. I am pleased that all the parties have indicated that that will happen. We need to decouple the elections as soon as possible, so that we can get the education systems in place well in advance of 2012 and so that the elections in 2011 and 2012 are a big success.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14980479", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There are things that we can remind Mr Kerr about, too.

It was regrettable that 2,500 post offices were closed UK-wide, but the Scottish Government made precious little attempt to save any by running extra services through them. Members should consider the example of Conservative-run Essex County Council, which managed to save a dozen post offices by running council services through them. One Conservative council saved more post offices than the entire Scottish Government.</p><p>Let us turn to the subject of the debate. The starting point was the Hooper review, which spelled out clearly the fact that there was a real danger of losing the universal postal service without urgent reform. So far, we have heard no sense of urgent reform from the Scottish National Party or the Labour Party.</p><p>The technological advance is unstoppable. The rise of e-mail and text messaging means that far fewer letters are sent. There are 5 million fewer sent today than only two years ago and the figure is due to fall by 8 per cent this year, which will cost the Royal Mail something in the region of &#163;560 million, so there are clear problems for it.</p><p>There are also inefficiencies within the system. There is little automation within the Royal Mail and all the local sorting is done by hand. That compares to something like 89 per cent of letters being sorted by Deutsche Post using machines. The Postal Services Commission and the Royal Mail's leaders acknowledge that it is somewhere between 25 per cent and 40 per cent less efficient than its competitors.</p><p>How on earth can the Royal Mail combat the slide if it is less efficient than its competitors and the mail services market as a whole is on the slide due to text messages and the rise of e-mail? We need solutions. I note that even the Scottish Government has accepted that the status quo is untenable, which Mr Hepburn did not seem prepared to do.</p><p>The starting point must be protection of the universal service obligation. The suggestion of bringing in some private expertise and capital is good in principle. We will want to see every clause in the bill so that we can ascertain whether things will be achieved, but we support the idea in principle. We must bring in the private expertise of those who have experience of change management through technological advances in <place-holder colnum=\"17318\"/> the sector and we need to bring in private capital because the Government simply does not have the capital.

We also had positive evidence from Scottish and Southern Energy and Northern Energy Developments, and in the Halcrow report. The British Gas research into the local authorities where measures had been implemented shows that 35 per cent of those interviewed said that they would not have taken energy efficiency measures without the council tax rebate, and that 60 per cent of those interviewed said that they would prefer a council tax rebate to other grants or incentives to take up measures.</p><p>The policy is strong. One of the reasons given by the Scottish Government for rejecting a rebate was that it was about to introduce a local income tax. That, of course, is not going to happen in the foreseeable future. Another reason given by the Government related to primary legislation, but that reason has been dealt with during the debate. There is no strong, tangible reason why the measure cannot be adopted. As I said, the committee agreed its recommendation without division. A rebate is popular with consumers, councils and energy companies, and it could provide a real step-change in the take-up of energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency measures are critical because, in the hierarchy of measures to reduce carbon emissions, they are the simplest and most important.</p><p>I turn now to sections 48 and 49 of the bill. At the moment, the language that is used on energy efficiency is neither groundbreaking nor world leading. Section 48(1) says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Ministers must prepare and publish a plan for the promotion of energy efficiency in Scotland.\"</p><p>Ministers then have up to 12 months from the point at which the section comes into force to produce the plan.</p><p>Consultations on energy efficiency have taken place over a number of years. Some of the evidence that we heard suggested that the plan is ready to go now. It is extremely important that the Government shows leadership in this area. The timing is also critical. If the Government has 12 months from the date on which the section comes into force, we could be at the end of 2010 before a plan is in place. We have carbon emissions targets from the beginning of 2010, but if we do not get any benefit from the target that is at the top of the hierarchy in year one, that will not be a very good start to the process.</p><p>The same applies to renewable heat, which is dealt with in section 51. I asked Jim Mather <place-holder colnum=\"17280\"/> whether he thought that the response in sections 48 and 49 is strong enough, but the response in section 51 is even weaker:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote the use of heat produced from renewable sources.\"</p><p>It does not ask even for a plan, and there is no timeframe whatever. Such provisions are absolutely vital, as heat makes an enormous contribution to carbon dioxide emissions&#8212;more so than electricity and transport. We need to see stronger action from the Government on renewable heat.</p><p>We will support the general principles of the bill. It is a good bill, but there is much work still to be done on it.

To be fair, good comments have been made by members of all parties and the standard of debate has been reasonably high.</p><p>The problem is clear. Our fuel is close to being the most expensive in the world. Almost 70 per cent of the cost is made up of tax&#8212;both fuel duty and VAT. The present weakness of sterling means that the drop in oil prices from $147 a barrel to approximately $50 a barrel has not resulted in a dramatic drop in prices at the pump. The drop in prices that we have seen has not been as dramatic as we might have hoped for because of <place-holder colnum=\"16946\"/> the weakness of sterling, against the dollar in particular.</p><p>As a number of members have said, costs in Scotland's islands and remote communities are particularly high. Some members have suggested that they are 10 to 12 per cent higher than in urban areas. Coupled with those higher costs is the greater reliance on the car of people who live in rural areas, which do not have the same public transport infrastructure as urban areas.</p><p>Last week's proposal by the chancellor to increase fuel duty by 2p a litre from September this year will put quite a big burden on our economy as we try to stem the tide of recession. It is worth noting that a few months later, in December of this year, VAT, which of course applies to fuel, will go back up to 17.5 per cent from 15 per cent. The AA described the proposal as \"highway robbery\" and the RAC said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It's time for the Government to stop treating motorists' pockets as a bottomless pit of money and recognise their right to drive at a fair, affordable price.\"</p><p>In addition, the road haulage industry believes that the lifeblood has been sucked out of the industry. Insolvencies among road haulage companies have doubled in a year and the number of drivers who are looking for work has quadrupled.</p><p>What should we do? What solutions should we adopt? Derogation has been the main subject of debate. As others have said, it is a measure that works in a number of other EU countries, such as France, the Azores and on the Greek islands, but in some of those cases, exceptions have been made. David Stewart told us about the position in France, and Greece was allowed to implement a derogation as part of its accession to the EU.</p><p>The proposal is worthy of consideration, but Alex Johnstone's amendment is slightly different from the motion because we think that there are genuine questions to be answered about the legality of derogation in parts of Scotland. That is why we have asked the Scottish Government to explain to Parliament why it thinks that such a measure is legal. Another critical question is what impact such a programme might have on the public finances, were it to be implemented. It is clear that it is more difficult to obtain a derogation on fuel duty than some SNP and Lib Dem members have suggested. If it were as easy as putting together a business plan and sending it off to the EU, I suggest that more than three countries in the EU would have been granted such a derogation.

I agreed with plenty of things in Mr McNulty's speech and thought that he made many perfectly sensible, straight and honest points. However, the Labour Party should be very wary of the credibility gap when it comes to transport infrastructure projects. After all, in its eight years in power, Labour was synonymous with delay after delay in transport projects; indeed, I find a small irony in the fact that this Labour debate on transport had to be delayed as Mr McNulty got his card from the clerks.</p><p>I was also interested to hear Mr McNulty say that the Glasgow subway has not been upgraded since 1990&#8212;when, of course, the Conservatives were in power. In the eight years that his Government was in power, nothing happened with the subway. However, since Labour lost power, its upgrading seems to have become an extremely urgent matter.</p><p>The other point about credibility is that even since becoming a party of opposition, Labour has been a little inconsistent on transport. On 29 January&#8212;just as today&#8212;Labour had a Thursday morning debate on transport. Labour had had a month and a half to reflect on the strategic transport projects review and to decide what it thought that the priorities were and which projects the document lacked. None of the projects to which Des McNulty referred today was mentioned <place-holder colnum=\"16678\"/> in the Labour Party debate a few months ago. In the previous Labour transport debate, in which Labour set out its priorities and where it thought that the gaps were in the STPR, no Labour member mentioned the Clyde fastlink, transport infrastructure in Lanarkshire or west of Scotland rail enhancements. The projects that are Labour's priorities today did not seem to be its priorities when it was in government, or even when we debated the issue a few months ago.</p><p>I turn to where the Scottish Conservatives stand and how we want to move the debate on. The first issue on which we want to make progress is prioritisation, which is relevant not only to west of Scotland transport projects but to all transport projects throughout Scotland. A number of months have passed since the STPR was announced. The next step has to be to determine in which order the projects will happen and, once the projects are ordered, what the target timescales and budgets will be. Of course, this debate has a specific focus on the west of Scotland. Therefore, in the context of the STPR, we are particularly interested to know about timescales and priorities in relation to Glasgow to Edinburgh rail improvements, west of Scotland rail enhancements, improved road journey times on the M8, M80, M74 and M77 and improvements to links between Glasgow and Oban and the west Highlands, including the A82.</p><p>The projects in the STPR are numbered, but not ordered. We need clear prioritisation now, and I hope that the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change will comment on that in his speech. We need prioritisation for two reasons. The first is that by prioritising, we make actions happen. If everything is a priority, the problem is that nothing becomes a priority. Secondly, it is important that we manage the expectations of communities and commuters. A project starting in 2012, at the beginning of the STPR, will be very different from a project starting in 2022, two and a half parliamentary sessions later. Prioritisation has to happen in early course. I hope that we can get some steer on that from the minister today, because, as he said in the debate on the STPR last year,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"vision and ambition are not enough.\" &#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2008-12-10.13201.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 10 December 2008; c 13201.]</citation></p><p>On the areas where we want action to be taken sooner rather than later, I turn first to the Glasgow to Edinburgh rail improvement programme, which we have advocated for some time&#8212;we have made commitments on it in several manifestos. Twenty-four individual improvements are suggested, and we want them all to happen so that the flagship Glasgow to Edinburgh route can truly encompass greater modal shift and help the economies of both the west and the east of Scotland. Of course, that includes the electrification of the flagship route <place-holder colnum=\"16679\"/> between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley; the possibility of six trains an hour from Queen Street to Waverley; and journey times for some trains as short as 37 minutes&#8212;there is a big economic benefit for both sides of the country from every single minute of time saved on that journey&#8212;coupled with the possibility of express services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley.</p><p>We will push hard for the upgrading of the M8, too. That vital project needs to be progressed, because, 10 years after devolution, Scotland's flagship motorway is still not of motorway standard throughout. The M8 was named as the worst commuter route in Britain for congestion in a survey by the traffic information service KeepMoving in spring 2007. It was named as Scotland's least popular road and the second poorest road in the United Kingdom in a survey by the insurers Cornhill Direct in February 2007.

It is critical that we have broad consensus on how we move forward because, as Patrick Harvie made clear, a project of this magnitude will outlive several sessions of Parliament and several Governments both north and south of the border. If there is one thing that the people and the businesses in this country hate, it is the stop-start approach that has <place-holder colnum=\"16636\"/> characterised certain transport projects in Scotland and the rest of the UK.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives are extremely positive about the prospect of high-speed rail services. Our 2007 manifesto contained a commitment to it and, more than six months ago, the shadow transport minister Theresa Villiers met the Scottish Government, showing our belief in and commitment to genuine partnership working on the matter. The UK party also has a firm date for construction to begin. It believes that things can start in 2015, after we get various consultations out of the way.</p><p>The project is different from many others because of the various economic and climate change benefits that members have strongly highlighted. The first benefit is faster travel and reduced journey times between London and Scotland. Speeds on UK railway lines are currently limited to 125mph but, with high-speed rail, trains could reach 200mph in some&#8212;but, of course, not all&#8212;parts of the line. As Tom McCabe has pointed out, we are far behind most European countries and many countries in the developed and developing parts of Asia in this work, so there is an urgency to get the project moving. Importantly, the prospect of a three-hour journey time between London and Scotland could achieve the modal shift that we all desire.</p><p>As for economic benefits, the project seems to have a high cost benefit ratio. The figures have not been confirmed but, from what I have seen, they look on balance to be very strong. The project will ensure that Scotland is not seen as being geographically peripheral and will lead to far better productivity north and south of the border. One simple example is that people on a three-hour train journey from London to Scotland will be able to do three hours of work while, if they travel door to door by air, they will be able to do only one to one and a half hours of work.</p><p>Many climate change benefits have been put forward. The 2M Group said in evidence to the committee that the energy consumption of high-speed rail travel is around a fifth of that of air travel&#8212;and it added the caveat that that is possibly an underestimate. Given that, UK-wide, more than a quarter of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions come from transport, there can be potentially enormous CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions savings. Around 80 per cent&#8212;some have said 85 per cent&#8212;of the journeys in the London to Scotland travel market are by air travel. I think that a member contrasted that with the position for Newcastle, which is within the three-hour travel limit from London. They said that less than 60 per cent of travel from Newcastle to London is by aviation.</p><p>There are challenges. We need clarity about costs&#8212;that point was well made by the committee. <place-holder colnum=\"16637\"/></p><p>An estimate of &#163;31 billion is bandied around, but if we peel underneath that, we can see clear differences in the costs per mile that various witnesses gave. There will be environmental challenges on the visual impact side and, of course, there is a debate about the tipping point for modal shift. We need a long-term strategy: we are enthusiastic and we will continue to be so.

Many members of the committee and many in industry believe that a range of funding methods ought to be available through PFI/PPP, the Scottish Futures Trust and conventional funding, and that the right funding model should be put forward for particular projects. That was the committee's view by decision and it has been the industry and the Scottish Conservatives' view for quite a time. We need to get rid of ideology in the debate and focus on best value over the lifetime of the project for taxpayers and service users.</p><p>The SNP's manifesto made it clear that public bodies and councils would have the choice of going for a PPP, PFI or Scottish Futures Trust approach. The theory was that the Scottish Futures Trust approach would be so good that every public body would want to go for it, but the manifesto was clear: it left the options open. It is therefore wrong that the Government has closed the door on PFI and PPP projects.</p><p>The committee struggled to find any real differences between PFI/PPP and what the Government wants to do. Once again, Mr Swinney talked about the amount of money that is coming out of the Scottish departmental expenditure limit budget each year that is made up of the unitary charges for all the PPP projects out there&#8212;I think that the figure is around 2.5 per cent at the moment&#8212;but he does not say, and the Government has not realised that NPD projects also have a unitary charge. Every single NPD project will have pretty much the same unitary charge as a PPP/PFI project. If that is the issue, surely the Scottish Government's default preferred option will create the same problems. Of course, we have also heard that the term \"non-profit-distributing\" is something of a misnomer because&#8212;SNP back benchers may wish to close <place-holder colnum=\"16379\"/> their ears at this point&#8212;there is a profit to the private sector, but it is simply a capped profit as opposed to an uncapped profit. In many cases, the profits will not be dissimilar.</p><p>The committee's report provided a bit of balance by fairly criticising some of the downsides of PPP/PFI, but it also mentioned some of its benefits and some areas in which it has been successful. Some 80 per cent of PPP/PFI projects have been on time and on budget. They have provided incentives to the construction process, and discipline, because, at the end of the day, the contractor will be paid only when the product and service are delivered. Audit Scotland said that such projects have been successful in many areas in respect of the project management, risk transfer and financial control that they have involved.</p><p>Many unanswered questions remain about the Scottish Futures Trust. We have again heard that there is still not an operating plan. This must be the only time in history when someone has predicted &#163;150 million-worth of savings before they have any kind of operating plan. Surely something must have come from a Jim Mather brainstorming session alone.</p><p>We firmly believe that a range of options should be available, as per the SNP manifesto, and that the test must be the best value over the lifetime of the project to taxpayers and service users.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14909325", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Capital Investment Projects (Funding)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the Finance Committee's report and pay tribute to that committee's convener, clerks and all its members for producing it.

It is important to note that the consumer prices index, which is the primary way in which the Government measures inflation, is up; it is up to 3.2 per cent according to the figures that were released yesterday. That presents difficulties to many people in Scotland. Every major food group has gone up in price over the past couple of months, the price of gas is up, the price of electricity is up and the price of clothing is up, so to say that there are conflicting messages is not strictly correct.

If the Parliament were not to agree to the motion, councils would need to increase council tax by 3.2 per cent to raise the same amount of money. Such an increase would not be popular in Scotland at the moment and would not go down well with householders in any local authority area or constituency. The council tax freeze represents a break to the hard-pressed taxpayer and a tiny piece of good news at a time of general gloom about the nation's finances and fiscal abilities.</p><p>That said, we need to look at the system of local taxation, as my colleague Derek Brownlee pointed out. It is not good enough simply to kick the issue into the long grass of 2011.

The concept involves giving householders who invest in energy efficiency measures or renewable heat a discount or a rebate on their council tax.

Rockstar North is certainly Dundee's loss and Edinburgh's gain. Joe FitzPatrick's speech was good; he raised a number of interesting points, such as that more computer games have been sold than DVDs over the past year. He was quite right to highlight some of the very impressive work that is being done at the University of Abertay and, in particular, in the school of computing and creative technologies. I was disappointed that, because I was in committee all morning and in the chamber all afternoon, I did not get a chance to enjoy the games demonstration in Parliament earlier today.</p><p>The games industry is important to Scotland and to the UK as a whole. There are particularly strong studio clusters in Dundee and Edinburgh. Joe FitzPatrick rightly stated that about 30,000 people in the UK are employed in the industry. It is worth saying that 10,000 of those jobs are in what is called the studio sector, which means that they are extremely well-paid and highly skilled jobs. They are good jobs and we want to keep them in Scotland and to try to bring even more here.<place-holder colnum=\"15926\"/></p><p>Joe FitzPatrick talked about the size of the industry in terms of gross domestic product, but it is also worth noting that it is worth more than 200 million US dollars to the UK's balance of trade&#8212;it allows money to flow into the UK. Even in tough times, it has the potential for growth. Between 2006 and 2008, the UK games development industry grew by 8 per cent. Traditionally, we were the third-largest producer in the world. We fell to fourth, but are apparently back up to third. However, I am told that we are in danger of falling down to fifth, so we certainly cannot rest on our laurels.</p><p>Another critical point, which the convener of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee made recently when he reported back to the committee on his visit to the industry in Dundee&#8212;I will try not to steal his thunder&#8212;is that gaming is not just about playing games; a lot of high-powered mathematics and physics are involved in the technology. More important, there are applications for it outside the games industry&#8212;perhaps in the medical industry. We are talking about the cutting edge of computer technology.</p><p>The industry faces several challenges, some of which have been outlined. I commend to everybody the recent report that was commissioned by NESTA but produced by Games Investor Consulting. The report, which was produced in December 2008, is a thorough 50-page analysis of the position in the UK. It compared us to our main competitors and other countries in Europe and outlined the main challenges that we face, which are: increasing the flow of original and new ideas; exploiting the massive potential of online gaming; exploiting synergies between converging media; protecting UK creative jobs; increasing the calibre of our graduates, which some members have mentioned; increasing the diversity in development teams; and increasing support from public funds.</p><p>I would add to that that we must ensure that a positive perception of games is promoted, instead of the negative perception that some games might have attracted. Gaming is extremely popular, but only 3 per cent of games sold have a \"mature\" or \"18\" rating and more than 50 per cent of them are suitable for the under-7s. It is important for us to emphasise the positive aspects of gaming.</p><p>I will finish on the point that Mr FitzPatrick made in relation to tax. Of course, tax is important, but the NESTA report pointed out that tax is not the be-all and end-all. It said that the Canadians have had success, which he was right to highlight. However the French, to whom he also referred, have had a disastrous time with their tax policy. The report says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Following an exodus of studios to Quebec, France's studio sector has remained stagnant, despite such large-scale <place-holder colnum=\"15927\"/> injections of capital. It is too early to assess the impact of a new national games development tax credit, but it seems unlikely that the French development sector will become a global leader in the near future.\"</p><p>Tax is important, but all the issues in the report to which I referred need to be addressed equally.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14855786", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Computer Games"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Joe FitzPatrick on securing the debate on a topic that is dear to the area that he represents, and to the area that I represent.

We agree with the Justice Committee's conclusion that it is appropriate to create new statutory aggravations to protect victims of crime who are targeted as a result of hatred of their actual or presumed sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.</p><p>The debate that took up most of the committee's time at stage 1 of the bill was whether there should be a statutory aggravation or whether we can rely on the common law. A couple of other speakers have already made the point that one of the strengths of the common law in Scotland is its flexibility to adapt to circumstances that arise. To an extent, therefore, it already allows aggravating factors to be taken into account. However, the committee heard persuasive evidence that a statutory aggravation would improve the current position. There are three reasons for that.</p><p>First, the common law is not being used in practice. In its evidence to the committee, the Equality Network said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is theoretically possible to deal with the kind of aggravations that we are concerned with under the common law, but that is not happening. Nobody has reported to us that an offence against them has been dealt with in that way.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice Committee</em>, 13 January 2009; c 1484.]</p><p>A similar point was made by Capability Scotland, which said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have spoken to lots of disabled people about their experiences, and we are not aware of any cases of aggravated crimes being prosecuted. Although the common law is available, it is perhaps not being used in a way that really deals with the issue.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice Committee</em>, 13 January 2009; c 1499.]</p><p>The common law exists, but it is clear from the evidence that was presented that it is not being used in practice to deal with the issue.</p><p>The second reason why a statutory aggravation is helpful and required is that it will send out a clear message and direction to society at large, and particularly to those people to whom it needs to be sent out. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland stated in its written submission:<place-holder colnum=\"15883\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The successful introduction and approval of such a bill will increase the public perception and awareness of prejudice/hate crime in addition to the racist and religiously motivated issues which are at the forefront of such crimes.\"</p><p>The third reason, which is not an argument in itself but is helpful, is that the bill will create consistency with the remainder of the United Kingdom. It will bring into play laws that are similar to ones that are already in place in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. On that point, ACPOS stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Similar legislation currently exists in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, therefore in terms of progression under the direction of the Scottish Government this overt enhancement of our approach would be a welcome addition to the Scottish Police Service in line with the rest of the UK.\"</p><p>There are clear benefits in having the statutory aggravation, and I can see why the Justice Committee reached its conclusion.</p><p>As members have already pointed out, the bill has a number of other benefits, particularly with regard to the reporting of crimes. As statistics that have already been highlighted demonstrate, there is a general perception that this type of crime is underreported. I believe that all types of crime are underreported, but I think that a specific case can be made in this respect.</p><p>It is bad news for any crime to go underreported, so I hope that the bill will encourage victims to come forward. After all, that is their only hope of achieving justice. I add in passing that I hope that victims of this type of crime do not feel that they have to wait until stage 3 or the bill's enactment to come forward. Even though the bill's provisions are not yet in force, I hope that even this stage 1 debate will encourage people to do so.</p><p>Another very serious issue is the recording of crime, and sections 1(5) and 2(5) make the recording of the aggravation a statutory duty. The fact is that we need accurate recording from the initial reporting of the offence through prosecution and conviction to sentencing. As Bill Aitken made clear, these crimes are reported simply as breaches of the peace or assaults, without any reference to the hate element of the crime.

The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee took evidence from the Federation of Small Businesses Scotland, which said that only 45 per cent of planning applications in Scotland are turned round within two months, although the target is to turn round 80 per cent of applications in that time. Members should contrast that record with the position south of the border, where approximately 70 per cent of planning applications are turned round within two months. Much more needs to be done and NPF 2 is an important part of moving the process forward.</p><p>In the Conservative amendment, we fully endorse the position that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee took in relation to national energy developments.

Mr Smith listened to three hours of testimony from representatives of CBI Scotland, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Trades Union Congress, all of whom said the same thing about the technology-specific references in NPF 2. What the committee voted to put in its report reflected the evidence that it heard.

I commend the Government for setting up the council and I urge it to listen to what the experts say. They are an extremely impressive bunch of people, who have experience in industry and academia&#8212;some are world renowned in some quarters. The council made it clear in its annual report in December 2008 that a full, independent review of energy options is required. The council had called for such a review last June, but the Government sat on its hands for seven months before announcing in January that it would commission the review. If the Government had listened to the council last June, we might already have a report on energy and we might be capable of making a balanced decision. I ask the Government not to prejudge the review, which was suggested by serious business and economic advisers. It is ludicrous to include technology-specific references in relation to projects 8 and 9 before we have the result of the independent review; if that is done, the review is in effect redundant.

The difference might seem small to some members, but it is important. The acquisition of borrowing powers has the potential to lead to better accountability but would not necessarily do so.</p><p>A number of members said that, given that councils can borrow money and the Northern Ireland Assembly has borrowing powers&#8212;albeit that there are the caveats that members mentioned&#8212;the Scottish Parliament's inability to borrow money is an anomaly.

The Liberal Democrats have made a fair point in raising the issue.</p><p>The timing is apposite, as I think that Mr Scott said during an intervention. We had double-digit growth for quite a long time after the devolution settlement and the budget doubled over eight years, to the extent that the Scottish Executive was unable to spend &#163;900 million. We are in different times now. The financial settlement is tighter and is likely to remain so for some time. There is also the important matter of the replacement Forth road bridge, which is the most important economic infrastructure project for Scotland.

Perhaps Mr Swinney will agree to a meeting when he speaks later in the debate.</p><p>I offer a word of caution. We are in the middle of a debt-fuelled crisis, so piling on more debt cannot be the entire answer. The UK Government is facing national debt of &#163;1 trillion. Therefore, the word \"could\" in our amendment is important. The acquisition of borrowing powers might well lead to more autonomy and accountability, but it might well not do so&#8212;it would depend entirely on how the borrowing powers were exercised. We need only consider the Audit Scotland report \"Review of major capital projects in Scotland: How government works\", in which 43 infrastructure projects over a seven-year period were considered. Almost all the projects were delivered late and about two thirds of them went over budget. If we are to borrow money to fund infrastructure projects, we must do so very sensibly indeed, just as a consumer must consider carefully an offer of a credit card that would give them short-term flexibility on spending but perhaps less flexibility in the medium and long term&#8212;I appreciate that that is a crude analogy.</p><p>We have no great ideological objection to the acquisition of borrowing powers.

It has been apparent in the past seven days that the mood in Scotland is clear: people want not risky games and brinkmanship but action and delivery.

We pick out the town centre regeneration fund, which we welcomed last week, to the tune of &#163;60 million. We have campaigned for that for a number of years&#8212;we started back in January 2007.

The cabinet secretary acknowledged last week that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In their input to the budget process, the Conservatives have set out the arguments for a new fund to support town centres.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-01-28.14406.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 28 January 2009; c 14406.]</citation></p><p>As he said today, the Conservative party has championed such a fund.</p><p>Town and village centres are the life-blood of communities. Many have been at a competitive disadvantage for several years and some have been on a downward spiral. The fund will be a shot in the arm. It has been described&#8212;rightly&#8212;as new money that can build momentum for regenerating our towns and put them back on an upward spiral in the next couple of years.</p><p>That success builds on several successes that the Scottish Conservatives obtained last year&#8212;1,000 extra police to go on our streets, an acceleration of the small business rates cut and an emphasis in the drugs strategy on recovery instead of damage limitation or maintenance.</p><p>If the bill is passed, the small business bonus will increase again from 1 April. More than 150,000 businesses, in every constituency, stand to gain. Of those, 120,000 will pay no business rates at all from 1 April. The other 30,000 or so will receive a meaningful discount.</p><p>Best of all, the small business bonus comes with no strings attached. Businesses decide how best to use the saving, perhaps by creating a new display, installing a new shopfront or employing a new member of staff. In the current climate, the saving might make the difference between keeping and losing a member of staff. It is clear to all Scottish Conservatives that business owners know best how to spend that money, which is why it should not be tied. They know far better than me, the Government, any Opposition politician or any trade union how to spend their money. In these difficult times, such a measure could be the difference between profit and loss or the difference between trading and not trading.</p><p>I turn to the other Opposition parties. We have seen the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party attempting to run the four-minute mile along the road to Damascus. Both parties have expressed a belated desire to appear positive, but what did they get that made it all worth it? David McLetchie offered a good analysis of what the Liberal Democrats got.

The key point in our amendment is prioritisation. Six weeks ago, we welcomed the STPR in broad terms, but we said then&#8212;and it is crucial to repeat it now&#8212;that now that there is a list of 29 projects, the process must move forward quickly to prioritise which projects will go ahead when. Which projects are planned for the early part of the period after 2012? Which ones will go forward in the middle period, if we can call it that, and which ones are more likely to fit in at the tail-end of the period covered by the review?</p><p>The minister said that the projects will be funded by successive spending reviews. Of course, spending reviews take place every three years or so, so the Government must have some idea&#8212;or if it does not, it must develop one fairly quickly&#8212;of which projects will be put forward at the next spending review and at the one after that. It is important for the credibility of the Government and, indeed, the Parliament that expectations throughout the country are managed properly, because for people in affected communities there is an enormous difference between a project that gets on track in 2012 and one that gets on track 10 or 15 years later.</p><p>It has been said that the projects in the STPR are numbered but not ordered. That might be acceptable for the review document, which is not, as Mr Tolson said, a \"thin\" document. If only it were; I am afraid that it is in excess of 800 pages, much to the chagrin of some spokespeople. We are looking to receive information swiftly&#8212;I hope that we can get some guidance today, if not full answers&#8212;on the likely costs of the projects, because we currently have only indicative costs from similar projects. Will we get some idea of timescales and perhaps even the funding mechanisms for taking the projects forward? Currently, of the 29 projects, apart from the Forth road bridge, which is clearly the number 1 priority, the other 28 all appear to be equal priorities. The danger is that if everything is a priority, nothing is a priority.</p><p>I do not want to be overly critical of the previous Administration, but a similar lack of focus was typical of it, too. For an example of that, we need only look at an answer that was given to transport oracle David Davidson, a former member of this Parliament, in March 2007. The question was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish a list, in priority order, of its announced transport infrastructure schemes.\"</p><p>The answer from Tavish Scott, the then Minister for Transport, was:<place-holder colnum=\"14524\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The planned programme of transport infrastructure schemes may be found on the Scottish Executive and the Transport Scotland websites ... All these projects are considered as a priority, which is why they have been included in the programme of committed projects.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-03-23.S2W-32430.h\">[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Written Answers</em>, 23 March 2007; S2W-32430.]</citation></p><p>That was the settled position after eight years of the Administration.</p><p>We will have to move far faster and far more effectively if the strategic transport projects review is to come to fruition. That will be important to underpin our economy, especially at the present time, but also in the medium and longer term. It is important that we get it right because, as the Audit Scotland \"Review of major capital projects in Scotland\" showed, too many projects have not been on time or on budget: only two fifths of projects were on budget and only one third were on time.

It is fair enough to flag the issue up, but I am not sure that it hits the nail on the head.</p><p>The debate has been interesting. I thank Professor Christopher Harvie for acknowledging several fabulous achievements of previous Conservative Governments and for going four and a half minutes without once mentioning Germany, although he fell away a bit in his final minute and a half.</p><p>Some members may have described Alison McInnes's speech as slightly off piste, but it was possibly the most commendable and far-sighted attempt ever by the Liberal Democrats to keep their deposit in Moray at the next Scottish Parliament election.</p><p>I will move on to some more serious aspects of the debate. Iain Smith was first to ask what the Council of Economic Advisers could do in the short term. It has quarterly meetings and has rightly said that it does not intend to be blown off course from considering the long-term Scottish economy, but perhaps there could have been more ad hoc meetings, particularly given some of the serious announcements and drastic days that we have had in Scotland. It may not be possible to get all the advisers together at the same time, but the Scottish Government could have emergency meetings of the council as and when necessary. I ask the minister to respond to that point.</p><p>The Government has accepted most of the recommendations&#8212;I take John Park's point that some of them were accepted in part&#8212;but it would be good to hear from the minister approximately when each will be implemented and some idea of the priorities. It may or may not be possible to implement 22 recommendations at the same time, and it would be good to hear which the Government considers to be priorities.</p><p>There are a lot of good ideas in the report. I will pick out one that the CBI has talked about for a long time: the possibility of tax increment financing, which is worth reviewing. We need to hear more on the 10-day payment terms that the Government has proposed. We are interested to find out whether they are being introduced by all public services across the board or only the Government itself. Will they be widened out to help our smaller businesses, for which cash flow is king?</p><p>The main point of the Conservative amendment is the energy review. We have pushed for it for some time, the council recommended it and the Government will now undertake it. However, I point out that the Government has taken its time over that. Although the Council of Economic Advisers' annual report came out in December and the Government responded in January, an <place-holder colnum=\"14291\"/> energy review was discussed in detail at the June meeting, which was described as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A lively and comprehensive debate\".</p><p>I would love to have been a fly on the wall for that and to have seen what \"lively and comprehensive\" meant. The council made a clear recommendation on the need for an energy review then, but seven months passed before the Government agreed to undertake one. We would like to know when exactly the independent review will begin and what details we can have on it. David McLetchie made the point that it is important that the national planning framework not prejudge the review. Therefore, it may be sensible for the Government to remove the term \"non-nuclear\" from project 9 in the framework. Let us see what the review says before hard and fast decisions are taken.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives are keen for as many initiatives as possible to be implemented to help the Scottish economy in the short term and the medium term. We fought hard for business rate cuts and the council tax freeze. We want town-centre regeneration to happen. That was a Conservative idea for a long time and it appeared&#8212;as David Whitton knows&#8212;in the Conservative manifesto before the Labour one.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621968", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill: Stage 3: \"First Annual Report of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers: December 2008\" (Scottish Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is true to some extent.

That is important because the Scottish Parliament has an opportunity through responsible negotiations to secure a sensible budget for the people of Scotland.</p><p>Our discussions have two main aims: to push for Conservative policies to be included; and to push for other measures that will help the economy and mitigate the effects of the recession that we face. Any concessions from last year are utterly non-negotiable and any breaking of those promises will result in a vote against the budget at stage 3. Between now and then, a failure to support our proposals to help hard-pressed families and businesses will mean that we will not support the budget at stage 3.</p><p>I will discuss some of the comments that have been made in the debate. Mr Kerr talked about the successful VAT cuts that have been made by the chancellor and the Prime Minister. Is Mr Kerr the only person who has not read recent reports about retail? Has he not seen the report from the British Retail Consortium that retail sales since the VAT cut have been the worst in 14 years? The figures are only the worst in 14 years because the survey has been operating for only 14 years. On a life-for-like basis, sales are down 3.3 per cent, which is bad enough, but when we add into the mix the fact that many retailers were offering 50, 60 and 70 per cent discounts, the news is very bad indeed.</p><p>Although they did not mention it today, we have heard many times from Labour members that the VAT cut is worth &#163;270 to the average Scottish family over the course of 13 months. The only problem is that a family wishing to take advantage of that &#163;270 must spend &#163;10,000 in order to do so and, in the current climate, not many families are capable of doing that.</p><p>Let us turn to what the Liberal Democrats had to say. I feel slightly guilty about saying anything about the Liberal Democrats after the savage kicking that they have taken from members of all parties; were I to comment on their position, it would be a bit like swatting a butterfly. However, there is a point that it is important to make about their proposed 2p cut in income tax. It is not 100 per cent clear whether they still want the 2p cut in Scotland as well as the cut in the rest of the UK&#8212;they seem particularly cagey about that. The proposal to cut income tax in Scotland by 2p might well have been ditched. When I asked Liam McArthur whether he could name one Scottish business organisation that was in favour of the proposal, he cited the example of Next which, the last time I checked, was not a Scottish business organisation.<place-holder colnum=\"13973\"/></p><p>The reason why cutting income tax by 2p is such a bad idea is that, by definition, it would mean that &#163;800 million would be cut from public services. The Liberal Democrats do not have a clue where any of the money would come from, other than from the Scottish Futures Trust.

There are 101 official events and, almost as exciting, there are many unofficial events. I had a brief conversation yesterday with the Rev Sam Torrens, whose church in Edinburgh has arranged a completely unofficial event to which a group of parishioners from Maryland will come to try to find their roots in Edinburgh. If there are 101 official events, goodness knows how many unofficial ones will take place the length and breadth of Scotland over the year.</p><p>There are some new and exciting events. The gathering is one of the showpieces of the year; it will take place within a stone's throw of this building.

Although 2009 will be a tough year, we have at least the possibility of bringing more tourists to Scotland to spend more money here because of the unique selling point of homecoming. It is critical that that happens, because 218,000 people in Scotland rely on tourism for their income and livelihood.</p><p>The main issue on which I will focus today is the subject of the Conservative amendment. The diaspora has enormous long-term potential. Homecoming 2009 is a big prize, but a far bigger prize will be won if Scotland can reconnect with the 25 million or so people of Scottish descent around the world. If we can connect properly and engage with them in the longer term, it will be excellent news for Scotland, good news for our economy and even better news for our tourism trade. It is important that homecoming is seen not just as a series of events but as a process of re-engaging far better and deeper over time with the 25 million or so people of the diaspora around the world. Homecoming cannot be just a one-off; it would be a great pity if it were.</p><p>We have heard the minister speak about what the Government is trying to do; I would be grateful for a bit more detail about how it intends to capture details about people who are coming here or who are interested in coming here. For many years, one of the weaknesses in the system&#8212;I include all Governments of all stripes going back 20 or 30 years in this criticism&#8212;has been that the level of detail that we capture about our tourists is not anywhere near as good as it could be. We could have far better information that could help our marketing efforts in the future. We need to know people's contact details and what their connection is with Scotland. Are there connections with particular parts of Scotland that we ought to know about? Are such people considering coming back and, if so, why? If they are not going to come back, why not? Do they know anybody else who might be interested? Who are the 25 per cent of people who registered on the homecoming website but are not interested in coming to Scotland? Why are they not interested? How do we get more of the 25 million people of the diaspora to come to Scotland over a long period?</p><p>We will support the Liberal Democrat amendment but not the Labour amendment at decision time. The world is watching and we have to look at the bigger picture.

It is staggering that the transport minister who completed that contract did not include a single term about how the extension process should work or a single criterion for operating an extension. The transport minister of that time must therefore accept some culpability.</p><p>There is another reason why the previous Administration has to accept that it is to a degree culpable, but which has not been raised in the debate thus far. We heard criticism that the franchise was extended by means of a PowerPoint presentation and that it was done at the click of a mouse, but if one reads the Audit Scotland report&#8212;I question how many members have done so&#8212;one finds that the first moves for reviewing the contract were taken by the previous Administration.</p><p>In October 2006, external consultants were engaged to provide advice and to review the Transport Scotland analysis. In November 2006, Transport Scotland acknowledged the need to review the contract. In December 2006, the Liberal Democrat Minister for Transport of the time agreed to a formal review of the existing agreement. The previous Administration is on quite shaky ground on this.</p><p>As my colleague Alex Johnstone said, we are pretty supportive of the franchise extension, albeit that we are not 100 per cent happy with the means by which it was done.

If First ScotRail had <place-holder colnum=\"13298\"/> reached over 100 per cent of its target revenue, 80 per cent was to flow back to the public purse, so there was a real disincentive for First ScotRail to invest or to improve performance. For every pound that it invested, it would have had to make &#163;5 just to break even, which had not been anticipated at the outset of the contract. I do not criticise the former Administration for that; indeed, I applaud it for moving on the review in December 2006 once it appreciated the bizarre situation in which it found itself.

For as long as performance remained above target, First ScotRail would have incurred no penalty for reducing performance, so there was a clear need to reset performance targets. We were absolutely behind the Government decision to do that.</p><p>My criticism of the Government is on the means by which the extension was made&#8212;the process could have been more open and transparent. I take seriously the comments that Bruce Crawford made only this week that the Scottish Government is \"more open than ever\" and that it is \"leading the way\" in promoting openness and transparency. Mr Crawford also made the point that one has to \"go beyond\" what is in contract and statute. I hope that the Government will in the future be more open and transparent when it is considering franchises.</p><p>Although the review is a good thing in itself, there have been one or two missed opportunities. The chamber has heard about the &#163;73 million of additional moneys but, as Audit Scotland pointed out, at least &#163;1.5 million of that will have to go over three years on CCTV in Strathclyde. Although that was the only cost that Audit Scotland mentioned in its report, it would be useful to know whether the minister will agree to look quickly at the matter. It is important for Parliament to know that the &#163;73 million figure stands up, or whether it will be eaten into even more than Audit Scotland has suggested.</p><p>Another missed opportunity is that some performance measures in the contract were not made subject to review. For example, toilet facilities, which are extremely important in passengers' minds, are low on the list of penalties against First ScotRail. There is also no requirement for a routine or reliable assessment of overcrowding&#8212;one that could establish the extent of the problem.</p><p>We could have taken other opportunities and some of those that were taken could have been <place-holder colnum=\"13299\"/> better done.

In saying that, I think back to what was said in the chamber in the ferries debate only a couple of months ago.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives are supportive of the end&#8212;it is the right one.

The Scottish Conservatives focused heavily on the matter in our two most recent manifestos, in which we called for increased investment in our transport infrastructure, whether that was the Forth crossing, the A9, the A96 or high-speed rail links between Edinburgh and Glasgow and Scotland and London.</p><p>It is worth reflecting on statistics that were published recently by the British Chambers of Commerce, to which I think that Rob Gibson was referring when he said that 70 per cent of businesses in Scotland had said that the current transport infrastructure limits inward investment. Rob Gibson did not give two other statistics that the chambers published: 43 per cent of companies said that their ability to expand their business is limited and 70 per cent claimed that the transport network is not meeting their needs. Therefore, the review is timely. We need more detail, as <place-holder colnum=\"13248\"/> members of all parties have quite fairly said, but it is important that we learn lessons and make progress as quickly as possible.</p><p>If we take a broad-brush perspective on the announcements, the main issue is priorities. Before the debate, I heard someone say that the projects are numbered but not ordered, which is an important point. We need quickly to get a handle on how the Government intends to prioritise the 29 projects. As the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change said,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"vision and ambition are not enough\",</p><p>so it is important that we get information on priorities sooner rather than later. The previous Administration was criticised&#8212;some people would say fairly; others might disagree&#8212;for saying that everything was a priority. The consequence of such an approach is that nothing becomes a priority and there is gridlock, which means that progress is not made on transport projects. Choices&#8212;positive and negative&#8212;have to be made.</p><p>When Audit Scotland was preparing its report, \"Review of major capital projects in Scotland: How government works\", it considered 43 infrastructure projects during a five-year period and concluded that only two fifths of projects were on budget and only a third were on time. The minister will need to tell us the order of priority of the 29 projects and give us the approximate timetable for them. I emphasise the word \"approximate\", because we are not holding the minister to a precise week or month. However, it is important to get a rough idea of what year we are talking about, because a project that starts in 2012 might be quite different for a community from a project that will last until 2022 and span two and a half parliamentary sessions. The approximate timetable for projects is important.</p><p>The approximate cost of projects is also important, as members of various parties said. Approximate costs for each of the 29 projects are given in the review, but the fair criticism was made&#8212;I think by Jeremy Purvis&#8212;that they are indicative costs. If we are talking about a single project, the difference between &#163;100 million and &#163;250 million is big and the difference between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;3 billion is enormous, as Derek Brownlee pointed out. When we add up the costs of all 29 projects, the difference between the higher and lower estimates is astronomical. We need far better projected costs than figures that are simply based on the costs of similar projects. I hope that such work is forthcoming sooner rather than later.</p><p>There has been much talk about the Forth bridge, which affects the whole of Scotland and <place-holder colnum=\"13249\"/> the Lothians and Fife in particular. Like my colleague Derek Brownlee, I welcome the reduced projected cost range of between &#163;1.72 billion and &#163;2.34 billion. Whether or not previous costs were inflated, as has been alleged, their reduction is a bonus. However, we must carefully consider how the money has been saved. Are the reduced estimates purely to do with the narrower design, or are the specifications weaker? Margaret Smith asked a fair question about that and it is important that we have detail on the matter as soon as possible.</p><p>Alex Johnstone's point is valid: if the answer is positive and if the savings have come from sterling and impressive work by the project team to cut costs significantly, the same principles ought to be applied to the other 28 projects. If we can get similar results by investing far less money, we need to examine that seriously. Are the savings simply on paper, or will they be real?</p><p>Of the other points that were made in the debate, I will pick out the comments by the minister and others on the Edinburgh airport train station. That station relies entirely on there being an Edinburgh tram system, so I hope that we will hear far less criticism from SNP members about the trams project. Without the trams, they do not have an Edinburgh airport train station.</p><p>As my colleague Derek Brownlee said, we will reserve full judgment until we have a chance to review the plans properly. At least five documents that are outlined in the headline document need to be considered.</p><p>There needs to be, if not full consensus, at least a degree of consensus about transport projects. Business and communities as a whole hate nothing more than the stop-start mentality that we have sometimes seen with transport and infrastructure projects. There needs to be a degree of consensus, because the lifetime of many projects will outlast the lifetime of a Government or a session of Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14299233", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Transport Projects Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will focus squarely on the economic importance of our transport infrastructure in Scotland.

Will Mr Purvis capitulate or will John Swinney give up, desperate to secure the votes of the Liberal Democrats so that this discredited tax can be implemented?

The report that Atkins produced in 2004 focused heavily on potential use&#8212;I will come on to the numbers that were predicted in that report and in the Halcrow report that was produced earlier this year.</p><p>Let us look at the infrastructure that is in place. I am sure that the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change is hit regularly by requests for transport projects throughout Scotland, but the south sub has particular benefits that other projects may lack. The bulk of the infrastructure&#8212;although not all of it&#8212;is already in place. The tracks are there, and passenger trains ran on the line until 1962. Even today, approximately 50 freight trains a day use it, although one or two upgrades may be required. The station locations are also there, although they will need to be converted back into stations. Because the bulk of the infrastructure is in place, costs are more modest than is the case in many transport projects. I argue that the south sub starts from a strong base.<place-holder colnum=\"13020\"/></p><p>I commend the work that E-Rail has done thus far on the funding mechanism for the project. E-Rail has looked at securing capital contributions from the private sector. It states that having an</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Innovative financial mechanism, with private funds captured through increases in development land values\"</p><p>gives the project a much better chance of going ahead, which makes the point neatly. At the last time of asking, E-Rail had secured pledges of approximately &#163;8 million from the private sector, including contributions from Cameron Toll, Kinnaird Park and the University of Edinburgh. Money from the private sector is potentially available to help meet the capital costs of the project. E-Rail has suggested an innovative way forward that definitely merits further consideration.</p><p>I want to counter one or two comments in the Halcrow report, which was not wholly positive about the south sub. It contained no benefit-cost analysis. Previous reports included such analyses, which proved positive&#8212;the figure was 1.2 under one model and 1.64 under the best model. By failing to provide a benefit-cost analysis, the writers of the Halcrow report ignored the benefits that would come from less congestion, a lower rate of accidents and a decrease in journey times. A previous report put numbers on those benefits, suggesting that there would be time savings of &#163;1.2 million, decongestion savings of &#163;1.4 million and accident savings of &#163;0.5 million.</p><p>The Halcrow report reckons that the line would be used by 822,000 passengers a year, but the Atkins report suggests a figure of 1.5 million. Those estimates are based on marginally different routes, but the disparity between the figures&#8212;one is almost double the other&#8212;suggests that further investigation is needed. If 1.5 million, rather than 800,000, is correct, it would have a massive effect on the amount of revenue that can be brought into the south sub.</p><p>The people of south Edinburgh and groups who are promoting the south sub have certainly waited their turn. The first campaign started probably a couple of weeks after the line was closed in 1962. In 1993, Lothian Regional Council recognised formally that reopening the line might be a good idea. Something is required, and it is fairly clear that little or no benefit will come to south Edinburgh from the tram system&#8212;certainly not in the short term and probably not in the medium term.</p><p>There are key plus points for the south sub: quicker journey times; much of the infrastructure is in place; an innovative funding mechanism exists; cutting congestion has environmental benefits. The scheme has popular support, and we strongly urge the City of Edinburgh Council and the <place-holder colnum=\"13021\"/> Government to work together to overcome the obstacles and get the south sub back on track.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14283000", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: South Edinburgh Suburban Railway"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As most members will know, the project is at a slightly less advanced stage than the tram project.

A constituent&#8212;who may be related to one of the people who wrote to Alex Johnstone&#8212;said to me recently that energy efficiency is just</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a load of eco bling\".</p><p>Although it tickled me slightly, I am sure that members would disagree strongly with that statement.</p><p>There are long-term benefits from energy efficiency and microgeneration not just for the environment but for householders. Cavity wall insulation, for example, pays for itself over several <place-holder colnum=\"12330\"/> years. It gives a householder a warmer house and at the same time cuts down on carbon dioxide emissions. As a whole, it has grown well in recent years. In last night's members' business debate, we heard about actions taken by Community Energy Scotland, which is based primarily in the Highlands but is moving south as we speak. CES has grown well because of the actions of a number of people.</p><p>We have pretty close to a cross-party consensus but, as the Energy Saving Trust has pointed out, it is frustrating that while we consider the great progress that has been made over a 10 or 15-year period on the energy efficiency of certain household appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, it is possible in the space of a matter of months to invent a television that consumes double the power and has a standby button so that is never switched off. Despite all the progress that has been made, with one or two small inventions we can easily go backwards and depart from the trajectory that we have been on.</p><p>What gives me hope, though, is that the technology is adapting quickly and constantly. A couple of weeks ago, I had a flick through <em>TIME</em> magazine. Of its 50 top inventions of the year, three related to microgeneration. I am still struggling to get my head around one of them, which is described as airborne wind power. Another is a biochemical energy harvester. However, the one that impressed me most, and which should be coming to our shores soon, is Nanosolar's thin-film solar panel, which is much lighter and cheaper than previous solar panels. It can practically roll off the assembly line, which addresses one of the problems with solar power in the past.</p><p>I was struck by a comment in the consultation prior to Sarah Boyack's bill:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Micro-generation will not become mainstream technology until they are easily accessible by householders across Scotland.\"</p><p>That hits the nail on the head. We must consider carefully the financial burdens and the start-up costs. That is a large part of the reasoning behind the Conservatives' eco bonus scheme for householders and small businesses, which Alex Johnstone referred to.</p><p>We must consider not only the regulatory issues but education&#8212;showing people, first, why energy efficiency is so important and, secondly, how it can be done. Most people are probably persuaded of the why but do not know as much about the how.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives support energy efficiency measures and microgeneration for households and businesses. They have the potential to reduce the cost of energy bills; they create warmer households and offices; they are <place-holder colnum=\"12331\"/> sustainable; and, most important, they reduce Scotland's carbon emissions.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14227020", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Efficiency"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a fairly good and consensual debate.

There are many obstacles, but a great benefit of Community Energy Scotland is that because of the breadth and depth of projects in which it has been involved during the past six years, it has enormous experience. It has learned from each project and can help communities to pass on their knowledge to other communities. I hope that that expertise will eventually spread outside the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>At any one time, Community Energy Scotland has more than 100 active projects, and over the piece at least 200 projects have been completed and are functioning. The organisation has been active in many communities, particularly in the mainland Highlands and Argyll, although the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland appear to have a number of projects. I am told that there is even a small office in Glasgow, so the organisation's operations appear to be moving south. I hope that the Lothians, too, will benefit from its experience in the months and years to come.</p><p>I like that Community Energy Scotland does not focus on one type of renewable energy, such as wind farms, an excellent example of which was mentioned by Dave Thompson. The organisation works on projects that involve air-source heat pumps, biomass, solar energy, water-source heat pumps, micro-hydroelectric energy, photovoltaic energy and automated wood-fuel heating. It has <place-holder colnum=\"12300\"/> dealt with projects of various sizes, from initiatives to secure microgenerators for community halls to projects that affect entire communities.</p><p>We heard this morning about some of the issues and obstacles on which we need to focus. Distribution is a particular problem. Transmission difficulties are well known throughout the industry and Community Energy Scotland could play a role in highlighting distribution problems. We heard that one project is on hold because it would cost &#163;1.8 million to get it onto the network.</p><p>I am sure that there will be more projects, and I hope that some of them will be in the Lothians. I look forward to seeing the database of projects that the organisation says it will put together, so that we can ascertain how it is performing in practice.</p><p>Community Energy Scotland's work will reduce energy costs for communities, empower communities to shape their future and reduce carbon emissions.

What started off as a financial issue in the finance and banking sector quickly migrated to what is known as the real economy and is affecting citizens up and down the country. Entire countries such as Iceland, Hungary and the Ukraine have had to be bailed out in the past few weeks. There are serious concerns worldwide that the IMF could <place-holder colnum=\"12276\"/> run out of firepower in a couple of years, and then we really would have a serious global situation.</p><p>Therefore, it is not entirely fair to put all the blame on Messrs Brown and Darling, although, as Derek Brownlee pointed out, they were happy to take the credit when the economy was going well; they even said that they had got rid of boom and bust. However, they must accept a significant part of the blame for the downturn. As David McLetchie rightly pointed out, there was far too much borrowing over a long period of time. There was the punishing of savers; the spending of money that was not ours; an increase in the structural deficit; and enormous levels of personal debt throughout the UK. We Conservatives are not prepared to take the lessons that Labour front-bench members such as John Park have tried to give us.</p><p>One reason why we say that is that the UK economy is predicted to shrink more than any other major economy. That was said a couple of weeks ago, when the UK economy was predicted to shrink by 1.3 per cent over the next year. This morning, the Bank of England predicted that the UK economy would shrink by 2 per cent, which puts us even further ahead of other countries.</p><p>To add insult to injury, and to show how badly we are doing in comparison to other countries, the pound has fallen to an 11-year low against a basket of other currencies. I hope that the Labour spokesperson will, in summing up today, accept at least part of the blame on behalf of the Westminster Government for some of the problems that we face.</p><p>There is, of course, a global downturn, but it is important that Labour acknowledges the role that it has played in that. One of the ideas that the Westminster Government put forward in passing was the stamp duty holiday, which Mr Park mentioned in his speech. Labour members might want to have a look at today's <em>Financial Times</em>, which completely rubbishes the stamp duty holiday as a gimmick that has made no difference of any consequence in the several months since it was put forward. The problem needs far better than that&#8212;in fact, we all need far better than that&#8212;because the economic position is treacherous.</p><p>As we heard from several members, unemployment in Scotland has increased by 13,000 in the past three months. I think that that statistic came from the Fraser of Allander institute. At the same time, the cost of living has increased. There has been a 25 per cent increase in the cost of food and drink in the past year. The cabinet secretary rightly said that prices are falling at the moment, but they are falling from such a high base compared with a year ago that no one regards it as a fall.<place-holder colnum=\"12277\"/></p><p>The number of business start-ups has fallen from 8,000 a quarter last year to 5,000 a quarter. There are also concerns about payment times; Iain Smith and one or two other members gave examples of companies that are not being paid quickly enough. When the Federation of Small Businesses surveyed its members, 40 per cent said that payment times had increased in the previous three months and only 8 per cent said that they had decreased.</p><p>The Conservatives and the Scottish Conservatives, working together, have come up with a number of solutions. In last year's budget process, we not only pushed for the small business bonus but pushed for it to be accelerated. That move was accepted, which means that from April next year tens of thousands of businesses will pay no business rates at all. We also supported the council tax freeze, which keeps money in people's pockets. Through my colleague Derek Brownlee, we have proposed a council tax cut. Based on the savings that the Government says that it can find for the local income tax, we could put &#163;150 back into the pockets of every family in Scotland. That would certainly help them in the next couple of months.</p><p>South of the border, we have talked about a corporation tax cut and about deferring VAT for six months to help companies with cash flow. We also propose a permanent increase in the stamp duty threshold rather than just a holiday, and we propose that an independent office of budget responsibility be set up to ensure that there is fiscal responsibility every year rather than the overborrowing that has occurred. Just yesterday, David Cameron announced that we propose tax cuts for companies that take on new employees. All those proposals are fully funded. That is the difference between our proposals and some of the proposals that we have heard from the Liberal Democrats, for example.</p><p>In closing, I mention a plea that was made by every small business organisation that came before the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. This is not a purely political point. Every business organisation and business that came to us pleaded with the committee to seriously delay or abolish the concept of the local income tax. I hope that the Government will listen to that with open ears. That would take a budget line of &#163;20 million straight out of next year's budget. I hope that the Government will take the wishes of every business organisation seriously.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14225053", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Almost every speaker in this debate has rightly acknowledged the sheer size and scale of the global downturn.

However, 24 hours later, we were told that it would cost &#163;800 million. The Liberal Democrats excused the mistake by saying that Tavish Scott had been standing in front of the sea in a bad light and had been short of time. There we have it. Tavish Scott got away with his mistake only because it was overshadowed a day later when Nick Clegg said that he thought that the state pension is approximately &#163;30 per week.</p><p>The policy does not even have the support of Vince Cable, the man who most Liberal Democrat members of the Scottish Parliament wish was the leader of the Liberal Democrats. When he was asked what he thought of the policy, he said that he was not sure how it would operate, as he had been in India and had not had a chance to check the fine print. A day later, when he had had a <place-holder colnum=\"11867\"/> chance to check the fine print&#8212;I presume that that did not take long&#8212;he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"They would only be able to cut taxes in Scotland if they found cuts in public expenditure.\"</p><p>That is the clear UK Liberal Democrat position and that is where the problem lies. In general, Conservatives favour tax cuts&#8212;of course we do; we always have done. We will seriously consider any fully costed proposal for a tax cut. Mr Purvis said that our council tax discount is not costed, but it has been clearly costed at &#163;281 million and is based on efficiency savings that the Government claimed that it could find. Although he does not realise it, Mr Purvis implicitly accepts that figure because, if he does not, there is a serious gap in his local income tax plans. Our policies are costed; the Liberal Democrats' policies are not.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat proposal would lead to cuts in services, but we do not know what they would be. We have heard the proposal about the Scottish Futures Trust, which would save about &#163;14 million. We have heard about the skills body that suddenly the Liberal Democrats do not like and think is unnecessary. The problem is that the cost of the skills body is almost identical to the cost if it were located in Scottish Enterprise. It was moved out for strategic reasons, but returning it to Scottish Enterprise, as I presume the Liberal Democrats want to do, would not save a huge amount of money. The big, rabbit-out-of-the-hat idea is that the rest of the money would be found from unexpected extra Barnett consequentials, according to a Lib Dem press release.

There are more than 400 co-ops in Scotland, employing more than 22,000 people, with a turnover of about &#163;4 billion. To put that into perspective, it is about the same turnover as that of the entire tourism industry in Scotland. It is a pretty sizeable chunk and, as Elaine Murray stated, it is about 4.25 per cent of Scottish GDP.</p><p>Elaine Murray neatly outlined the range of companies in Scotland that are co-operatives, from household names down to micro-businesses. Household names include John Lewis, Dunfermline Building Society, Loch Fyne Oysters and the Scottish Association of Farmers Markets. A particularly strong example in the Lothians is the Edinburgh Bicycle Co-operative. It started in 1977 as a small bicycle repair shop, employing three people. It now has branches in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle and Leeds, a payroll of more than 70 and an online shop. Most important is the ethos in that organisation. Every full-time worker becomes an equal member after a probationary period of one year. He or she becomes an equal owner of the business, entitled for instance to an equal share of the annual profits.</p><p>There is no debate to be had about the contribution of co-ops to Scottish life.

First, what has it achieved so far? Secondly&#8212;and probably more important&#8212;what is it likely to achieve in future? So far, there has been some pretty good stuff. Without question, it has raised the profile of co-operatives. If we consider the number of column inches that have been achieved, or what is described as equivalent media spend, the figures are impressive. CDS has started and developed businesses, and improved the research into co-operatives. The previous figures were hazy, and there is still a lot more research to be done on co-operatives.</p><p>CDS has an advisory board of considerable experience and it has the potential to offer a truly niche service, particularly in looking at the management, legal and tax implications of having a co-operative as opposed to another type of business.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14183884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Co-operative Development Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Elaine Murray on securing the debate.

All members of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee learned a great deal about the history of tartan and the debates about it. The bill was very good to begin with but, as Mr McGrigor said, it has become even better during its passage.</p><p>The debate has been interesting so far. We seem to have brought together the modernists and the wovenists, which is no mean feat. We have had a couple of new book references from the minister, which always goes down well. I sense <place-holder colnum=\"11742\"/> that this is the beginning of a blossoming friendship between Jamie McGrigor and David Whitton, which may continue long after the day is finished. It is possibly the best example of cross-party co-operation and the bringing together of two sides that I have seen since I saw James Douglas-Hamilton walking down the Royal Mile with Tommy Sheridan a number of years ago.</p><p>I will focus on a number of things that the bill can do for Scotland. First, there are the tourism possibilities that it creates. The study of family history has been popular for some time and is growing more popular by the year. The bill presents us with a great opportunity to accelerate that process. We heard from the minister that in the region of 100 million people around the world may have some claim to Scottish ancestry. It is important that we get them to Scotland: an officially sanctioned register of tartans could help enormously with that. Tartan is very popular and iconic across the world, particularly in countries where large numbers of our tourists come from. If we discount tourists from south of the border, more tourists come to Scotland from the United States than from any other country. The bill presents us with an opportunity at a great time. It is apposite that it is being passed this year, given that next year is the year of homecoming 2009.</p><p>We had an interesting debate at stage 2, when Mr McGrigor, quite rightly, made changes to the definition of tartan. Although it was probably implicit before, adding the phrase \"capable of being woven\" sent to the industry and others who were watching the right message about what we were doing. The committee appreciated that, because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>The amendment that was passed today without division strengthens the bill, without adding in the element of compulsion, with which one or two committee members had difficulties.</p><p>A broad analysis shows that 20 per cent of the industry is non-woven. Therefore, the suggestion that Mr Whitton made today was right and it will satisfy both groups.</p><p>The bill gives us great opportunities from a tourism point of view. There are also great economic opportunities and ideas for what the sub-sector of tartan can do. At least 200 businesses in Scotland are what we might call tartan-oriented businesses and a whole lot more are involved in the supply chain.</p><p>Tartan is probably worth in the region of &#163;500 million to the Scottish economy, which I think equates to about 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The bill will give the industry a boost. It will help us lift it to the higher end of the spectrum. It can be an excellent marketing tool for the <place-holder colnum=\"11743\"/> industry in Scotland and outside Scotland.

The convener gave a good account of the report in a measured and practical speech.</p><p>A number of particularly good issues come out of the report, but I want to draw two useful minor issues to members' attention. The first is Ron Gould's oral evidence. He gave us an excellent report in November last year, but the committee report is particularly useful because the committee had the chance to quiz and question him to get further and better particulars.</p><p>I think that the chamber would unite in saying that it is deeply regrettable that DRS Data <place-holder colnum=\"11670\"/> Services did not give oral evidence to the committee. A written statement is not as useful to the committee as allowing it to probe and ask about what went wrong. It was a case not of finding someone to blame but of establishing what went wrong and what can be done in future to ensure that it does not happen again.</p><p>The Conservatives have a number of substantive issues to raise. The first is something that we have believed in for a long time: the decoupling of Scottish Parliament elections from local government elections. We have been saying that since 2002. A member's bill was introduced in 2004. We predicted that serious issues would result from the 2007 election, although we did not predict their scale. I am pleased to note that other parties now agree with us.</p><p>For two reasons, it is good news for us all that the Government has decided to introduce a decoupling bill. First, it will allow us to focus more closely on the local government elections instead of them being overshadowed by the Scottish Parliament elections; it will allow voters to consider what the different parties are saying within their respective areas; and it will allow candidates in those areas to put forward their policies and proposals without being overshadowed by national policies and proposals. As a result, voters in local government elections will be able to make a far more informed choice based on local policies. For that reason, decoupling the elections is a positive move. Secondly, it will prevent a lot of the confusion that we saw in May 2007. The Gould report makes at least four references to confusion, and we can prevent it by decoupling the elections.</p><p>There is certainly the potential for a lower turnout initially, although that is not definite. We will have to put in extra effort to ensure that voters are aware of what is going on, but focusing on local government elections alone might get over that potential problem.</p><p>I hope that Mr McNulty had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he proposed that Scottish Parliament elections be coupled with European elections, and that he is not desperately in favour of that. The coupling of those elections would create even greater problems, and the excitement might be too much to handle in a single day.</p><p>I return to the use of the STV system for local government elections, which was not the big success that the Liberal Democrats like to portray it as. Under normal circumstances, the use of STV would have been described as disastrous, given that it resulted in a trebling of the voting failure rate from 0.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent. That compares favourably with the failure rate for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, which was 4 per cent, but it compares very badly indeed with what <place-holder colnum=\"11671\"/> has happened in any other Scottish election in living memory.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "With the Liberal Democrats' share of the UK vote at a mighty 12 per cent, every party in the Parliament is frightened of taking them on at the ballot box.

It is important to note that, although it is convenient to blame the spivs and the short sellers, the facts have not borne out that they are to blame. I will return to that shortly.</p><p>I will concentrate on the overriding principles that we want to put forward. As I said, we appreciate the Government's objectives, and of course we want as many HBOS and Lloyds TSB jobs as possible to remain in Scotland. We want a headquarters option in Scotland that is as strong as possible, we want as big an influence as possible, and we want the brands to remain strong, growing over time.</p><p>It is important to explore further the short-selling blame game. Evidence from Data Explorer, the market leader, shows that, at most, 3 per cent of HBOS's shares were available for short selling last week. That is 3 per cent as an absolute maximum, which means that the shares sold during the week, including on Wednesday, were not part of short selling: people who genuinely held shares in HBOS got rid of them.</p><p>That ties in with what happened in the rights issue&#8212;a &#163;4 billion rights issue in which there was only an 8 or 9 per cent take-up by HBOS shareholders. It is not for us to say whether the business plan was good or bad&#8212;I certainly do not have that technological knowledge&#8212;but the shareholders clearly made their judgment about the rights issue, and another judgment was made on Wednesday. It is convenient, and it might suit certain people's purposes, to blame the short sellers but if we blame the wrong people, we do not learn the right lessons for the future. That is why it is important to have a more careful analysis of what happened on Wednesday.</p><p>That is also why, as Annabel Goldie outlined, we have grave reservations about the First Minister making comments about how he would have saved the bank had the situation arisen in an independent Scotland. It is all well and good for him to say today in the Parliament that that is not what he said or meant, but that is the first time that I have heard any utterance from him trying to backtrack on what he said; it is certainly the first time that he has said that it was not what he meant. I am sure all will agree that the First Minister is a perfectly clear communicator and that it seems highly unlikely that it was not what he meant.</p><p>Annabel Goldie put forward some of the wider Conservative propositions. In a disorderly market, the temporary ban on short selling&#8212;as long as it is <place-holder colnum=\"11113\"/> temporary&#8212;might calm things down. We want more effective regulation, as opposed to more regulation. We also want to increase protection for savers, guaranteeing deposits of up to &#163;50,000. As David Cameron has suggested, we may have to re-examine the Basel II agreement, which has a global impact on reforms within the banking industry. We also need to examine how the credit rating agencies operate: they sold off derivatives and credit default swaps with AAA or AA ratings, which meant that many organisations purchased them believing that they were a good bet.</p><p>HBOS can have a great long-term future in Scotland, as can financial services as a whole, but the First Minister will be judged on what he does, not on what he says he would have done.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035851", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hbos"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will not take any more interventions from Alex Neil, although we are still no closer to an answer on how much liquidity needed to be put in.

My understanding of what we heard from VisitScotland and the minister is that those tourist information centres are safe and they will play an important part in the future.</p><p>I also highlight the fact that everyone on the committee thought that the bed tax as proposed for Edinburgh is a bad idea and should, quite literally, be put to bed as soon as possible. I hope that the Liberal Democrat members will follow Tavish Scott's lead on that and say to their City of Edinburgh Council councillors that it is a terrible idea. I hope that the Scottish National Party members will do the same with the SNP councillors in Edinburgh. It is a bad idea for Edinburgh and, if it was replicated throughout Scotland, it would be bad for Scottish tourism.</p><p>The reality is that Scottish tourism is marginally down since 2005, when the target was set. Back then, the figure was &#163;4.2 billion. The most recent figure for 2007 is &#163;4.179 billion, so there has been a small decline. However, if our target is a 50 per cent real-terms increase by 2015, we have some distance to go, and the starting point has to be for the Government to acknowledge where we are.

The Scottish Conservative party has made it clear that we agree with that, but according to Cathie Craigie's statistics it would reduce the number of prisoners by 13, on average. It would not make a big difference. It would not reduce the number from 8,000 to 5,000.</p><p>We heard from the cabinet secretary the age-old argument that we lock up many more people than any of our counterparts. Let us examine that for a moment, because it is not strictly true. We lock up fewer people per head of population than Spain, England and Wales, New Zealand and Luxembourg. The position is not as the cabinet secretary described. He tried to say that we are almost heading in the same direction as the United States of America and he gave some frightening statistics about that.</p><p>We lock up 141 people per 100,000 of the population and the United States locks up 750 people per 100,000, so there is no comparison. Our figure is closer to that of the Netherlands, which is 128 people per 100,000. Let us not exaggerate how many people we lock up compared with other countries. As my colleague Mr Aitken pointed out, a more important statistic is the number of people whom we lock up compared with the number of crimes that are committed. It is much better to use that statistic than purely to consider population.</p><p>However, let us come up with a solution. I was particularly disappointed with the McLeish report and some of the things that the cabinet secretary said because they present a false dichotomy between the current situation and the adoption of all 23 recommendations, which would mean that no one ever went to jail for six months or less.<place-holder colnum=\"10789\"/></p><p>The commission did not consider rehabilitation within the prison system. I used to volunteer at Edinburgh prison, where I worked for half a day a fortnight with people who were hoping to get out of prison. I saw some remarkable things being done&#8212;not by me, but by some of the people who work in that prison. They set up a scheme whereby, if a prisoner could read or write and they agreed to teach another prisoner to read or write, they got additional privileges. That system did not cost the taxpayer a single penny, so all the arguments that the cabinet secretary threw in about schools and hospitals are taken to one side. I met men in their 50s who had been in and out of prison for 20 years but who left prison and were able to find jobs because they could read and write.</p><p>Why not consider rehabilitation within the prison system? We still punish people; communities are still satisfied because they do not present a danger to the public; and such schemes are successful. The problem is that the Government does not have the political will to examine what is already going on and to replicate it throughout the prison system.

First, the minister said that 13 timetabling changes had taken place following a meeting with the main board of David MacBrayne Ltd. Those changes are to be applauded, and I am sure that they will make a difference. However, the important point about inflexibility is that we should not need a nine-month, 300-page committee report and a ministerial meeting to get timetable changes for our ferries. I hope that that lesson is learned, so that we have a much less strict approach in which changes can be made in a much simpler fashion.<place-holder colnum=\"10651\"/></p><p>Alison McInnes spoke, from the Liberal Democrat point of view, about keeping ferry structures together&#8212;or, in effect, keeping them nationalised&#8212;because she was concerned about the danger of communities being left isolated if the private sector was allowed in. Although I empathise with her position, we have to consider areas in which the private sector has been allowed in, to which my colleague Mary Scanlon referred. Liam McArthur praised the private sector service in his constituency. We do not need to be as worried as Alison McInnes suggests.</p><p>Alison McInnes said that ferries are not like buses in that there are no ferry operators waiting in the wings, but there might well be, as we are an extremely entrepreneurial country. The Clyde and Hebrides tender was somewhat botched but, at the beginning of the process, before there was any political interference, there were nine expressions of interest.

For example, with the Clyde and Hebrides services, we propose the creation of a number of different contracts. More profitable routes should be bundled together with some routes that are not as profitable. Were that to happen, we envisage that CalMac would win some of the contracts but not others.

We certainly look forward to seeing what is in the strategic roads review, but perhaps the minister can provide a sweetener, or at least an inkling of what will be in that review.</p><p>Why is the A92 upgrade important? There are several reasons, but the overriding one is that the road is dangerous and busy. There are numerous reports about speeds and there are anecdotal reports of people driving at more than 100mph when the speed limit is 60mph. As Ted Brocklebank said, there have been 23 fatalities in five years and more than 600 accidents in a five-year period. There were not 23 fatalities in one year and zero in other years; there were fatalities in them all&#8212;five in 2003, seven in 2004, seven in 2005 and four in 2006. We do not want to have a similar debate in the next session of Parliament with similar or worse figures to look back on.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank set out clearly the specific measures for which the Scottish Conservatives are asking: a dual carriageway around Glenrothes on the 3 miles between the Preston roundabout and the Balfarg junction, with the added idea that the dualling should continue until Melville Lodges. Priority should be given to upgrading the Parbroath junction, which is a particularly dangerous part of the road where accidents occurred at regular intervals in the past five years and, no doubt, for a long period before that.</p><p>As I said, the Conservative party has a good track record on the issue. In 1996 we had plans for upgrades and dualling. At the most recent election, we had clear and strong manifesto commitments on transport. The transport budget would have had an extra &#163;30 million per annum and, on top of that, we would have set aside an extra &#163;15 million per annum for black-spot funding. A combination of those two funds would have been applied to the A92, which would have helped to make the road far safer.

I agree with some of them pretty strongly, but I disagree at least mildly with one or two others. The first crucial point that she made was about the need to get to the bottom of the discrepancy between the official reasons that have been given for removing services first from Glasgow, and those that were given in a parliamentary answer. I understand that the official reason is to do with processing capabilities in the Glasgow office, but the number of passports that were thought to be produced, which I think was 350,000, seems to be in stark contrast to the figures that were given in a House of Commons written answer. Sandra White's suggestion&#8212;although she did not mention the size or capabilities of other offices&#8212;that other offices have fewer capabilities than Glasgow, is <place-holder colnum=\"10077\"/> also worthy of further investigation and is an important point.</p><p>I agree strongly with the final part of Sandra White's motion, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"information as to the effect of these changes should be issued immediately in order to remove the doubt and uncertainty surrounding the plans.\"</p><p>The loss of 100 jobs or more obviously affects 100 families and 100 breadwinners within their families.</p><p>Sandra White's suggestion that the issue could be raised at the next joint ministerial committee meeting is constructive and might shed some light on the issue. I am in tune with all those points.</p><p>Although Pauline McNeill was right to say that the issue is reserved, debates such as this one focus the minds of all who are involved in the process. I hope that it can have a positive impact. If the proposals are passed and jobs are to be lost, the Conservatives want as many jobs as possible to be retained within the identity of the passport service in Glasgow, whether it involves moving people to other departments or people retraining and moving to different functions. It is important that employees are treated as fairly as possible and are given the notice and the information to which they are entitled.</p><p>I note in passing that it was suggested that Glasgow passport office may increase its fraud prevention role. If that is the case, perhaps jobs will be available in that function. Although that would probably not counteract the loss of 100 jobs, it would at least go part of the way.</p><p>The point on which I am in slight disagreement with Sandra White is that it is very important not to overstate the case and not to elaborate on or exaggerate the arguments. From what I can see, this is about the loss of potentially more than 100 jobs, but I have not seen any evidence to suggest that it is about closing down emergency passport services. I was, unfortunately, unable to attend today's information session, but I sent a researcher who asked specifically whether, if the proposals go ahead, emergency passports will still be available. PCS was candid in its answer, which was \"Yes&#8212;they will still be available.\" It is important to make that point and the point that the office will remain open.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, which I agree is a bad case, a quarter of the present jobs will remain in the office.

I, too, congratulate Jamie McGrigor on introducing this extremely important bill.</p><p>There is a strong economic case for the bill, and a strong cultural case. On the economic case, most of the statistics that we heard come from the ECOTEC report, which was commissioned last year by Scottish Enterprise's Scottish textiles team. In Scotland, there are 17,000 jobs in textiles, 7,000 of which it is estimated come from tartan. As we heard, tartan contributes about &#163;350 million to the economy each year, or about 0.5 per cent of GDP.</p><p>The Scottish Register of Tartans Bill presents an opportunity to lift the industry to the next level. The textiles industry in Scotland is trying to reposition itself to an even higher end of the global market. We cannot compete on price, so we have to compete on value and quality. The register will give businesses a marketing tool to do that and a springboard to promote their wares. Further, it is a chance for the tartan industry as a whole to take a more joined-up approach to worldwide marketing, as the cashmere subsector has done. The register will be good for individual businesses, for the tartan industry, and for the textiles industry as a whole. Those are the direct benefits.</p><p>Indirectly, because there has been a lot of interest in tartan, particularly with the year of homecoming 2009, there are massive potential tourism gains the length and breadth of Scotland. The study of family history could be boosted even further by an officially sanctioned register, and there will be a boost to other industries in the supply chain. Most of the 7,000 jobs, or at least a healthy proportion of them, are indirectly related to the tartan industry.</p><p>On the cultural case, having an official register will help with the authenticity of tartan and of Scotland's image. Having a definitive national repository will give tartan an even higher place than it already has. The register will be public, it will be easily accessible and it will be safely preserved in public hands, we hope for ever. The danger with private registers is that if the organisations that hold them fold, a lot of the information goes with them. That danger was pointed out clearly to the committee.</p><p>The register will enable us to claim tartan as our own, or at least to ensure that it remains claimed as our own. Evidence was led that Canada might <place-holder colnum=\"10057\"/> have considered creating a register of tartans, and one person who gave evidence voiced concern that Australia might be thinking about doing it as well. A Scottish register of tartans will make it crystal clear that tartan belongs to Scotland and will continue to do so.</p><p>The debate between modernists and wovenists was raised in the committee and again today. Rather than go into one camp or the other, I will try to look one step beyond. The important thing is to ensure that the definition of tartan and the process in the bill do not stifle innovation but protect the brand in the long term. The bill must not allow tartan to become diluted. There is a danger of that, and if it happened we could have a problem with tartan in the long term. It is important to get the right balance, but we do not necessarily need to jump into one camp or the other.</p><p>The classification issues that we heard about are better dealt with by the keeper, who can issue guidance, than in the bill.</p><p>There are strong economic and cultural reasons for the bill.

Scottish Conservatives welcome the debate that the Labour Party has brought to the chamber today.</p><p>Before I move on to address some issues that have cropped up in the debate, I will dwell for a minute or two on the response that we made to the former Scottish Executive's inquiry into bus <place-holder colnum=\"9640\"/> transport in 2005, \"Bus Policy: Scotland's National Transport Strategy Consultation\". I understand that the Scottish Conservatives were the only parliamentary group to submit a response.</p><p>I turn to gaps in provision that have resulted from deregulation. Deregulation has been hugely successful, but I accept that there are gaps and that we need to address them. One idea that we referred to in our response in 2005, but which has not been raised in the debate thus far, is stakeholder boards. That ambitious alternative is based on the model that the Oxford Bus Company has put in place south of the border. Its stakeholder board sits separate from the company board and is tasked with a monitoring and advisory role. Membership of the stakeholder board includes employees, customers, local business and transport user groups. Crucially, although it sits to the side of the company board, it is chaired by the company's managing director. The stakeholder board is not simply a talking shop; it is an integral part of the company's operations. If that model can operate successfully south of the border in Oxford, perhaps something like it can be part of the solution north of the border, too.</p><p>It is also worth looking at the fact that voluntary partnerships between bus companies, local authorities and transport groups have been more successful than the statutory partnerships. Des McNulty made the point that no statutory partnerships were set up as a result of the legislation. We have to ask why. Perhaps too much red tape was involved or the costs were too high. By comparison, voluntary partnerships such as the one between Stagecoach and Perth and Kinross Council have been relatively successful. In its evidence in 2005, the former National Federation of Bus Users&#8212;now Bus Users UK&#8212;stated that bus users are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"best served where there are voluntary partnerships\".</p><p>If the voluntary approach is deemed to have been more successful that the statutory approach has been, instead of simply harking back to the 1980s and saying that regulation is the answer, we need to learn that lesson.</p><p>I was looking forward to hearing what Patrick Harvie would say in the debate on regulation. His amendment is intriguing: it suggests that he was going to tell the chamber about lots of \"countries and cities\" where regulation is extremely successful. He made two speeches in the debate, but said not a jot on that subject. He simply stated that regulation would be successful, but gave no examples. Certainly, he gave no example of where a country or city has successfully gone from deregulation to regulation. It was a pity that Parliament did not hear about that&#8212;perhaps there are no such examples.<place-holder colnum=\"9641\"/></p><p>We welcome the review of the bus service operators grant, albeit that the process should be speeded up. Of course, the additional &#163;4 million was welcome at the time, but I accept the point that various groups have made that it covered only a shortfall and that it leaves Scottish bus companies at a relative disadvantage to companies south of the border, particularly since the 2p increase came into effect in October 2007.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives do not want to turn the clock back; we want to move forward with the ideas that we have proposed. We welcome the concessionary scheme review that is to commence next week. I reiterate the point that we made earlier that we cannot ignore the fact that the former Executive did not open up the scheme to other categories of disability: the Labour Party is wrong in what it said on that.

Up to 116,000 small businesses and 38,000 medium-sized businesses are already benefiting or will benefit in the very near future. So great was our belief in the policy that we fought tooth and nail during the spending review and budget process to ensure that the rates relief programme was accelerated to two years.</p><p>One of the big Conservative successes in this year's budget was to ensure that small businesses up to a rateable value of &#163;8,000 would benefit, with an 80 per cent cut this year and a 100 per cent cut from April 2009. As we have heard a number of times during the debate, that means that a business's rates bill will decrease by thousands of pounds, with the acceleration alone being worth more than &#163;1,000 this year for some businesses. In difficult trading times, that can mean the difference between profit and loss, or between success and failure&#8212;or, in extreme cases, between trading and not trading the following year. That is why we have supported the scheme and will continue to do so.</p><p>I have a degree of sympathy with some of the Labour Party's arguments&#8212;I even concur with some of them&#8212;but there are two main reasons why I think that Labour's approach is flawed. First, the promise was made as a no-strings-attached cut in both our and the SNP's manifestos. It would be utterly wrong to promise a no-strings cut but then to add in a couple of strings, just to get through some sort of process and buy in a couple of favours.</p><p>It is a fundamental truth that businesses can spend their money far more efficiently and effectively than can politicians of any party, including my own. Businesses can be far more innovative and have a far greater interest in running their affairs successfully, not just for the following month or year, but for the long term.</p><p>We have heard examples of what businesses have done so far. Some of them want to take on new staff, for example one full-time or a couple of part-time staff. Some of them want to refurbish <place-holder colnum=\"9545\"/> their premises, while some want to buy additional stock. We heard about one business that wants to put extra money into supporting a community initiative that it has already supported for quite some time. None of those examples comes within the training, research and development or energy-efficiency straitjackets that the Labour Party wants to place on such businesses.

When we arrive at the cumulative total, the sum will have allowed them to refurbish their shop. In the case of a community initiative, I suspect that the community that benefits is grateful for any money coming from the business.</p><p>Our starting principle on implementation is that no entitled business should miss out on a hard-fought-for concession. We have heard anecdotally that take-up is good, but I hope that the minister will listen to and take on board three points. First, it is critical for retrospective effect to apply to businesses that apply this week, next week or over the next couple of months. The scheme should apply from 1 April. Most councils to whose representatives we have spoken seem to agree with that principle, but one or two are still saying over the phone that cases will be considered individually. We argue that every business deserves to get the benefit from 1 April.</p><p>Secondly, we want there to be a continued proactive approach. National Government and many local authorities have been proactive in sending out the forms to councils. I heard that West Lothian Council and Angus Council even sent out reminder letters to companies that had not yet got back to them. We hope that such a proactive approach continues.</p><p>Thirdly, we hope that the Government will at least consider automatic application. There are potential dangers in that, but I am advised that <place-holder colnum=\"9546\"/> several councils, including Glasgow City Council and East Renfrewshire Council, have applied automatically the small business bonus to companies that already had rates relief. If automatic application can be done in one council, there ought to be scope for it in other councils.

There was little else in his speech with which I agreed, although I probably agreed with more of it than the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change did, judging from the puzzled looks he gave me.</p><p>I will pick up on one important point that the minister made in his statement. He said that we will soon receive the figures for the 2006 carbon emissions and that, unfortunately, it is thought that they will show an increase. This is not a criticism aimed at the Government, but it worries me slightly that only now will we receive figures for 2006. If we are to get a serious handle on climate change&#8212;to be fleet of foot and make the necessary adjustments to help us hit our targets and avert global warming&#8212;we need to invest serious energy in ensuring that we get our figures far quicker than that. I am sure that we do not ever get instantaneous figures by sticking our hands in the air, but we need to consider how we can get much more up-to-date figures so that we can change course when we need to.</p><p>I will comment on a number of issues that have cropped up. One is the question of the gases that <place-holder colnum=\"9050\"/> are to be included in the Scottish climate change bill. I offer no great answer, but I have a couple of observations. I have learned that 20 per cent of Scottish greenhouse gas emissions are not carbon dioxide. Most people who read the literature on climate change would be wise to assume that carbon dioxide is the only gas with which we must concern ourselves. However, in Scotland at least, 20 per cent of the problem is not CO<sub>2</sub>&#8212;it is other gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur. That is important, because if we are going to ignore 20 per cent of emissions completely, then we have a problem, given that the overall objective of the bill is to try to avert climate change. I have also been told&#8212;although I have not had a chance to examine this properly&#8212;that pound for pound, methane is a lot more damaging than CO<sub>2</sub>. If that is the case, we need to examine the matter very seriously, because methane is the largest non-CO<sub>2</sub> gas emission. It would be unwise to exclude the basket of other greenhouse gases.</p><p>Annual targets have been discussed a lot today, and of course the Government has been beaten with its commitment on page 29 of its manifesto. I will not dwell on that too much, other than to say that we need to get the right figures and take the right decisions for the whole 42-year period and more, instead of putting something in place just because it was in the manifesto. It would be prudent of the Government to admit what was in the manifesto and say that it has taken advice on it since then and decided not to run with it, instead of trying to hide from the issue&#8212;that would probably put the matter to bed.</p><p>Mandatory annual targets are important if we are to make serious progress towards the 80 per cent figure. I draw a comparison with the tourism target that was set in 2005, which was a 50 per cent increase in tourism over a 10-year period. No annual targets were put up and no review mechanisms were in place; and now, three years into the process, we have gone slightly backwards, and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee is examining ways of addressing the issue. If that can happen over a 10-year period, members should consider the potential for drift over a 42-year period. That is why the targets are so important.</p><p>Anyone in business probably has quarterly targets, and certainly annual targets. There is a real danger of slippage if we do not meet our annual targets in one particular year. In relation to any form of finance, debt is a lot easier to pay off with regular instalments, which is why some form of annual target&#8212;without saying today exactly what, and how rigid it must be&#8212;is important. Without such a mechanism, there is a serious danger that we will not achieve our end result.<place-holder colnum=\"9051\"/></p><p>It is important to have proper scrutiny of the results each year. Laying things before Parliament is important but, in their alternative bill, the Conservatives south of the border proposed an environmental commission. Made up of experts and scientific bodies, it would be independent of political parties and would examine the figures rigorously so that we would know that they were absolutely correct. It would take away the danger of the issue being used as a political football and would force political parties and everyone else to acknowledge any bad news, reach a consensus and come up with clear strategies for progress.</p><p>The other important issue, which Alex Johnstone raised and which we must take seriously, is whether we measure consumption or production. We must not simply go for the one that will enable us to hit the target most easily or the one that suits Scotland the best. Ultimately, a global perspective is needed if we are to be successful. We want every country in the world to cycle on the same side of the path on this issue. Every country must either go for consumption or for production, or else large areas of emissions will be completely missed out and we will still have a problem with climate change, even though every country will say that they hit their targets. We might have to consider what China, India and the United States of America are most likely to accept and work hard to ensure that we get global consensus on that.</p><p>Stern said that if we act now and act internationally, we have a good chance of averting climate change.

In the time that is available, I will consider various parts of the bill and comment on areas in which it could be strengthened and improved at stages 2 and 3.</p><p>Most members mentioned part 1. There is no debate about judicial independence, as all members support that important constitutional principle. The debate hinged on whether the inclusion of a guarantee of judicial independence will enhance that fundamental principle. The Justice Committee considered the matter carefully and came to the right decision, which was that distilling common law and convention into statute will send a powerful message and have the added benefit of bringing our approach into line with that of other countries and making it consistent with the approach in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p>I add two caveats, one of which was mentioned by Nigel Don. First, the bill confers the duty to uphold judicial independence on a select number of people: the First Minister, the Lord Advocate, the Scottish ministers and one or two others. It is worth reflecting on whether the list should be extended, perhaps to include members of the Scottish Parliament. As we consider one of the first bills to be introduced in the third session of the Parliament, it might be worth making crystal clear the relationships in and functions of government.</p><p>Secondly, the examples of what might constitute an attempt to influence judges have been drawn quite narrowly. I think that Lord McCluskey suggested that the insertion of the words \"in <place-holder colnum=\"8577\"/> particular\" into section 1 might make clear that we do not want to exclude a number of ways in which people might seek to influence judges. The cabinet secretary has hinted that he will consider the issue and ensure that the provision is tight.</p><p>On part 2, we support the principle of unification of the judiciary. As members said, a heavy burden of functions will fall on the shoulders of the Lord President, although a degree of delegation will be allowed for most of them. The Lord President said that he would be able to deal with his workload. His view, which was based on consideration of the Irish system, was that the workload would probably be about two days per month. I have not investigated the details of the Irish system but, on the face of it, that seems not to be a large workload. I welcome part 2 of the Osler review, which will consider the burden that will be placed not just on the Lord President but on other members of the judiciary as a result of the transfer of the Scottish Court Service. In evidence, a witness&#8212;I cannot remember where I read this&#8212;suggested that some 200 days per year of judicial time might be lost to administrative and management functions. If that were to happen, we would have to question seriously the transfer of the SCS. I am sure that the review will come up with the best, most accurate picture.</p><p>Much has been said about the Judicial Appointments Board, and the issue has not been contentious. However, I want to add a couple of comments. Schedule 1 says that a member of the Judicial Appointments Board can be removed on conviction of \"any offence\". The Law Society made a good submission to the Justice Committee, explaining that the provision is a touch draconian and that the wording could be tightened up. Perhaps the wording could be \"any serious offence\". I am sure that more appropriate wording could be found, but \"any offence\" seems to me, too, to be a little draconian.</p><p>Section 11 describes what happens if the cabinet secretary does not agree with a decision of the Judicial Appointments Board. The cabinet secretary can say no to a decision and send it back to the board for reconsideration. However, the bill stops there; it does not describe any procedure for what should happen if a stand-off occurs between the Judicial Appointments Board and the cabinet secretary. South of the border, the Judicial Appointments Commission can ultimately force its decisions through but, in Scotland, we have left the stand-off in the air, perhaps in the hope that common sense will prevail. However, common sense does not always prevail in a stand-off. We are legislating anyway, so it might be better if the bill catered for such situations.</p><p>The biggest disagreements relate to the judicial complaints reviewer. Under sections 26 and 27, <place-holder colnum=\"8578\"/> the Lord President will present a process for looking into the conduct of judges. Under section 27, he has a range of disposals available for dealing with judges who are found to have behaved inappropriately. In my view, the judicial complaints reviewer would therefore be a toothless tiger with no real powers. As I suggested to Mr Martin when I intervened on him, if the judicial complaints reviewer finds that the process was not followed, the only power that he has is to go back to the Lord President, who gave him the case in the first place, and say that he does not think that the process was followed. We are therefore not persuaded that the reviewer would add anything to the process.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13658477", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My colleague John Lamont said that the Scottish Conservatives fully agree with the principles of the bill and will support it at decision time.

We all agree that reductions in duplication, bureaucracy and overlaps are a good idea and that having a degree of focus and alignment is positive. I am grateful to Mr Crawford for outlining some of the progress that has been made since January, but he dedicated only about one minute of an eight-minute speech to it. I would be grateful if, in his longer summing-up speech, the cabinet secretary could address that matter and tell us a little more about what will happen during the next couple of months. It is important that we have that information.</p><p>The Conservatives' amendment highlights two things. First, talking about effective public services is not an event but a continual process.

It is important to consider end results rather than simply what we put in.</p><p>We broadly support the Government's attempts to produce more effective public services, but we are not yet convinced about a couple of aspects. First, what genuine savings will the Scottish taxpayer gain from the exercise? A couple of figures have been bandied about, but in the grand scheme of things they are not hugely significant. It does not appear that they will allow a huge amount of money to be ploughed into front-line services.

I note that it increased from about 444,000 in 1999 to about 488,000 in 2007. If the changes to the so-called cluttered landscape are to be effective and meaningful, they must result in savings for the taxpayer. Ultimately, that means reducing the size of the public sector. If we do not do that, the 26 per cent reduction in the number of public bodies will be much less significant.</p><p>A point about whether we have something to fear from losing public sector jobs was well made by Margo MacDonald&#8212;and extremely well answered by Tom McCabe. Perhaps there is something to fear, but if we create a more dynamic, more mobile and fresher economy, we will have much greater economic growth as a whole. We should take that approach rather than have the stagnation that we have had for the past eight years or so.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13648967", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Effective Public Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion is relatively inoffensive.

First, I will reiterate the point that my colleague Ted Brocklebank made in both his amendment and his speech about the importance of relying on UK resources in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Secondly, I will touch on the positive aspects of the international framework, which includes some good work. Thirdly, I will highlight areas in the framework where there are gaps and where more could be done. When summing up the debate, the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism may want to take on board one or two of the issues that I raise.</p><p>Fourthly, I will comment briefly on the monitoring and tracking that must take place in the future, because a document, framework and policy is only as good as its delivery in practice. Clear monitoring arrangements must be in place. In her opening speech, the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture stated that Scotland week had been a big success and that we knew categorically <place-holder colnum=\"8326\"/> that it had delivered good value, but it would be interesting for us to hear exactly what analysis of the event has been done. Obviously, the Government can tell us how much was spent on Scotland week, but it would be much more useful for us to know exactly what its short, medium and long-term benefits for the whole of Scotland are.</p><p>It is important that we work carefully in tandem with the UK Government and use existing resources carefully. Mr Brocklebank mentioned the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council, which have offices and experience across the globe. They have an impeccable track record of delivering for Scotland and the UK, and it is important that we rely on that. The difference between the positions of Mr Brocklebank and Linda Fabiani is one of emphasis. It is true that our amendment reiterates a point that is included in the document, but the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the point is emphasised properly and made a priority. At the moment, it is tucked away on page 6 of the document and not highlighted as a genuine priority to be taken forward. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council can help us to create business, cultural and educational benefits in the future.</p><p>There is not much in the document with which we disagree. It contains a lot of good stuff and tells a positive story about Scotland. It talks about our educational establishments. Although we will have disagreements about the funding of those establishments, the bottom line is that they punch well above their weight internationally. We should be proud of what they do now and of what they can do in the future.</p><p>The document also talks about the businesses that we have. We should be proud of our businesses, especially financial services, food and drink, life sciences and a host of others that punch well above their weight.</p><p>The document discusses the potential for tourism. Every party represented in the chamber supports the target of 50 per cent growth in tourism by 2015. The document also talks about events that we know that we will host. I make a personal plea for us to bid for a good football event in the future, possibly the European championship, but it remains to be seen whether that will happen.</p><p>I turn to the gaps in the document. Mr Mather will understand that the people who are most likely to give us business in the future are people who have given us business in the past. The countries from which we are most likely to get tourists in the future are countries that have provided us with tourists in the past. It is right that we should go after new markets and seize opportunities, but we <place-holder colnum=\"8327\"/> cannot give away ground in areas where we are already strong.</p><p>I will focus for a moment on tourism, as I have some knowledge of the issue. The countries from which most tourists to Scotland come are the USA, Germany, France, Ireland, Canada, Spain, Australia, Italy and the Netherlands, in that order; I cannot remember the other country in the top 10. Only three of those nine countries are mentioned in the international framework document. It talks about having relations with EU institutions and better relationships with Finland, Norway and Iceland&#8212;I have forgotten the collective term for those countries&#8212;but there is no mention of the countries with which we need to have stronger bilateral relationships. We are much more likely to get future tourists and business from Germany, France and Spain than from some of the other countries that have been mentioned. That is a gap in the document.</p><p>The document touches briefly on events south of the border. We must be mindful that we are more likely to do business with businesses and people south of the border than with the European countries that I mentioned. People south of the border are those most likely to move to Scotland and help us to create a better future. English tourists provide &#163;1.7 billion a year to the Scottish economy; the rest of the world provides &#163;1.4 billion. An international framework document should reflect the countries with which we already do business and the ones with which we are most likely to do business in future. Monitoring and tracking will be key. It will be good to hear about any monitoring of the USA visit and Highland 2007, so that we can apply the lessons learned from them to homecoming 2009.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13642948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In summing up for the Scottish Conservatives, I want to touch on four main issues.

Although they have been around since the 1960s in Canada, BIDs are an entirely new concept in Scotland, and we will have to monitor the results of the BID in Bathgate and the other five pilot areas to see whether they do what they say on the tin. I certainly wish the Bathgate BID team, who seem to have built up a good degree of momentum in the area, the very best of luck in what they do between 2008 and 2013. Anything that genuinely helps businesses, local communities and the local economy has to be welcomed, which is indeed why this side of the chamber fought so hard for the reduction in business rates that was introduced at the start of April.</p><p>It is no secret that the Scottish Conservatives voted against the BID proposal during the passage of the Planning (Scotland) Act 2006. We opposed it for two reasons. First, we were against the imposition of a mandatory levy on businesses. Given that businesses can vote for or against the introduction of a BID&#8212;or, indeed, not vote at all&#8212;we found it difficult to accept that all businesses, particularly those that had voted against the concept, should be forced to pay the associated levy. Indeed, in the current economic climate, some businesses will find it difficult to sustain the levy.</p><p>Our second difficulty was that we felt that there was a danger that some services that should be provided by local government would be provided by the BID. Deep down, I hope that both objections turn out to be wrong. If they do, we will be happy to support the concept. The key will be serious monitoring of what happens over the next five years. I know that the BID team has a strong <place-holder colnum=\"7852\"/> annual monitoring system to put in place, the robustness of which is impressive.</p><p>According to the figures in the Bathgate BID's business plan, it is thought that the BID levy will generate about &#163;75,000 a year, certainly in year 1. It could be argued that some of the services that that sum will go towards providing should be provided by local government. The BID will contribute &#163;20,000 towards closed-circuit television monitoring and &#163;3,000 towards lighting, which should surely be funded by the local authority, and &#163;6,000 will be spent on information boards for the town plan, which, again, the council ought to provide. The collection of the levy will cost &#163;3,000 and legal and auditing costs will account for &#163;2,000. That shows that some of our concerns were justified.</p><p>Although some of the BID's proposals for expenditure are extremely good, such as those that relate to shop-front improvements and improvements to vennels, including better vennel signage, and will be welcomed by all businesses, I would strongly argue that some of the proposed expenditure should be met by the local authority. Monitoring what happens in Bathgate and in the other BID areas will be crucial. If BIDs provide additionality and do what people hoped they would at the outset, they will make a positive contribution to Scottish business&#8212;but they must do that. If they do not succeed in doing that over the five-year period, I strongly believe that the BID concept must be reviewed.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402665", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bathgate Business Improvement District"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Mary Mulligan on securing this important debate.

To say that the sector makes a vital contribution is almost to do it a disservice; it is critical to the future of service delivery in Scotland.</p><p>I will pick up on a couple of important points that have been made. Derek Brownlee talked about the burden of red tape that the third sector bears, which is the subject of the amendment in his name. It is important that we invest time and energy in resolving the problem. He said, quite correctly, that the third sector should focus heavily on the delivery of front-line services and should not have to spend time in the back room worrying about administration. It is important that we secure a commitment on that. I have no simple solution, but I think that all voluntary organisations and their workers would appreciate it if something akin to the regulatory review group, which considers business regulation, could consider the third sector.</p><p>We strongly welcome the commitment on water service charges that is in the amendment in Jim Mather's name and was reiterated by Mr Mather in his speech. A number of parties and organisations have campaigned on the issue for a long time and the Scottish Conservatives have been heavily involved in the campaign. We have lodged motions and tried to bring communities together. It is good news for everybody that the exemption will be taken forward. It is right that the exemption for churches, village halls and smaller voluntary organisations should continue beyond 2010.</p><p>We probably differ slightly from the Labour Party in our thinking on where the blame lies for shortfalls that might be experienced. In broad <place-holder colnum=\"7670\"/> terms, we welcome the reduction in ring fencing. It is right that local councils should make decisions about what happens locally. It is worth pointing out that, as Brian Adam said, considerably more than &#163;100 million that could have come to Scotland via the lottery has ended up being directed to the London Olympics.

We have heard that it will penalise hard-working families, especially those with two earners in a household.

Currently, local authorities raise 20 per cent of their income. Under the Government's proposal, that would go down to zero. Do we want local government or do we simply want local administration? The national income tax will lead to local administration.</p><p>We have heard about the additional costs.

To that extent, we welcome the &#163;30 million cap on Scottish Borders Council, the City of Edinburgh Council and Midlothian Council that was announced previously, because we were concerned about that spending in the past. It is worth mentioning that, although the debate is about what has been called the Borders railway, there will be big benefits to the city of Edinburgh and to Midlothian, where four of the seven stations will be situated.</p><p>Where do we want to go with the project and what are our priorities? First, we want answers from the minister on timing. My colleagues Derek Brownlee and John Lamont raised the timing issues last week. However, given the history that Elaine Murray has just told us about&#8212;the eight years of dither and delay and the nine months that it took from royal assent for the Government to order the start of the due diligence process&#8212;it is important that we get more definitive timescales from the minister and the Government. To be specific, when will construction begin? I read the <place-holder colnum=\"6904\"/> minister's statement last week, and he made it clear at least five times that construction would begin at some point</p><p class=\"indent\">\"before the end of the life of this Parliament.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2008-03-05.6588.4\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 5 March 2008; c 6588.]</citation></p><p>That is not exact enough. The people of the Borders and the Lothians&#8212;the people of Scotland&#8212;deserve something more concrete. We do not expect an exact day or week, but I am pretty sure that the minister, in his closing speech, will be able to tell us something more exact than that.</p><p>Another important question to which we need to know the answer is when construction is scheduled to finish. The critical date for the people of the Borders and Midlothian is the one when the trains will start to run, as opposed to when construction starts. However, given the project's history and circumstances, we need dates for when construction will start and when it is due to finish. That should be possible. The minister also mentioned in his statement that a critical path was in place. He stated that some items were part of it and others were not. If a critical path is in place, the minister must be able to give us an indication of when construction will start and finish.</p><p>The other priority on which we need to focus is funding for the railway. We have heard a little bit about the NPD model, which sounds fairly similar to a rebadged PPP model, but we would like more detail on it; I hope that the minister will be able to tell us that soon. As Derek Brownlee pointed out last week, there is a shortfall of &#163;50 million to &#163;100 million between what the Government said that it was putting into the project and the total cost of between &#163;235 million and &#163;295 million that it announced. From where will that shortfall be made up and how will the gap be closed? Will the minister guarantee that using the proposed funding mechanism will not slow down the process? It has been far too slow for far too long. What is the total sum of money that the Government is physically committing? The minister said that the people of the Borders do not care too much about the functions, but the Scottish taxpayer does, so who will repay what and when will it be repaid?</p><p>Another issue that was raised last week is freight. We welcome the minister's statement that the Government would be delighted to have freight on the track. We take that as a positive signal, but we are looking for something a bit more concrete than that. How will the minister actively pursue the line's freight potential? If it is not pursued actively, it will probably not happen, which would be a loss to the Borders, the Lothians and Scotland as a whole.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400389", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Borders Railway"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Conservative position is that we must ensure that the project is completed as quickly and cost effectively as possible.

It raises an important issue. There are clearly many benefits to having trains stop at Edinburgh Park, but there are many questions to be asked, such as the one that I asked her in my intervention. David Whitton put forward a fairly similar idea in his intervention.</p><p>I suspect that there is clear agreement across the parties on the earlier parts of the motion. It is absolutely right to commend the economic contribution that Edinburgh Park has made to Edinburgh and Scotland. Margaret Smith mentioned a range of companies that are based there, and I suspect that there will be many more in the future. Members will also all commend the green initiatives that Edinburgh Park has put in place.</p><p>I am sure that we are also all agreed that trying to connect Edinburgh and Glasgow better is an excellent idea. Better connectivity could create a powerhouse economy for Scotland, but the question on which we must focus is whether what the motion proposes will create better connectivity between Edinburgh and Glasgow. That is at the heart of the issue.<place-holder colnum=\"6068\"/></p><p>The most important point is to look hard at what effects the proposal would have on the Edinburgh to Glasgow line, which is the flagship line for First ScotRail. It is the most important line connecting our two largest cities, so it is important that we bottom out exactly what effect adding a stop would have on it. I have not read the Faber Maunsell report to which Margaret Smith referred, but I have seen a pr&#233;cis of it, which suggested that journey times would be increased by 30 seconds in one direction and not at all in the other. I would like to look into that a lot more deeply.</p><p>I am no expert in physics, but it seems to me that it makes no sense to suggest that it would make no difference to slow down a train for minutes, stop at a platform while passengers get off and others get on and then try to get up to speed again after that. That defies logic and physics. To say that it would only be 30 seconds seems to me to be fairly tight. The journey time for a Glasgow train that stops at Croy and Lenzie seems to be about five minutes longer than that for a train that does not stop at either. Therefore, without getting into the science of it, I think that the suggestion that the difference would be perhaps two or three minutes makes sense. That is an important point to bear in mind.</p><p>That said, if adding the stop increases the journey time by two or three minutes, there could still be a compelling case for stopping some of the trains between Edinburgh and Glasgow at Edinburgh Park. The purpose of my intervention was to find out whether Margaret Smith had a fixed view on that. From what I heard in response, I suspect that she does not.</p><p>I am particularly interested to hear about the additional 900 passengers a day that we think would take advantage of the service. It would be really interesting to find out at what times of the day they are most likely to travel. My guess is that 890 of them would probably travel in rush hour in the mornings and evenings, so there is a pretty strong case for stopping one or two services at Edinburgh Park over that one-and-a-half-hour period in the morning and the evening. That would cut down congestion and would be a worthwhile service. The few times that I have been to Edinburgh Park station, I have been the only person there and felt pretty lonely on the platform, so my guess is that there is probably no point in stopping the trains there during most of the rest of the day and that the service ought to resume as normal then.</p><p>The motion is good and it is a good debate to have.

Can we please stop using the words \"tight spending round\"? In relation to previous budgets, it is not true. I challenge any SNP member to stand up and tell me that it is true. I will take an intervention at any point in my speech from any SNP member who takes up that challenge.</p><p>There are still one or two manifesto commitments of the Scottish Conservatives that have not yet been implemented. I shall mention some of our manifesto commitments on local government. We felt that there should be a commission on local government in Scotland to consider where we can pass power down from Holyrood to councils&#8212;what we call localism&#8212;where it is far more appropriate. In addition, we said that we should consider those areas in which local authorities can allocate power down to community councils, to try to reinvigorate the community council movement and to ensure that more decisions are taken on the ground, where they are implemented. We hope that the cabinet secretary will take cognisance of that.</p><p>We have talked for some time about the Gould report proposal to decouple the local government and Scottish Parliament elections. That would help with some of the issues that arose at the election but, just as important, it would give local issues their day in the sun. Voters would be able to analyse properly how their councils had performed and vote on that basis, while issues could be thrashed out in full view of the electorate instead of being subsumed by the Scottish Parliament elections. I know that the Government is keen to decouple the elections as well, but we hope that we will get a final decision on that sooner rather than later.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives support the reduction in ring fencing in the local government finance settlement. That was in our manifestos in 2003 and 2007, and I note in passing that it was also mentioned in an amendment in Derek Brownlee's name in the equivalent debate last year when, once again, we called for a reduction in the amount of ring-fenced money. The facts appear to be that we are moving from about &#163;2.7 billion of ring fencing down to about &#163;500 million. The previous regime was too rigid and resulted in 50 separate reports on 50 separate ring-fenced funds. The changes that have been outlined can give councils flexibility and allow local solutions to local problems.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398295", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2008"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I politely ask Kenneth Gibson and Bob Doris to tone down the compliments just a bit or, come the next election, Derek Brownlee, David McLetchie and I may have some trouble with our membership.

We must also remember that councillors have the same democratic mandate that we have, and that less ring fencing provides greater accountability.

The idea of piloting a scheme to match experience with skills shortages is excellent.</p><p>I am slightly sceptical about the idea of the Edinburgh airport welcome centre, for the simple reason that I am not convinced that it goes anywhere near far enough towards what we need to be competitive.

We need positive net migration to fill our shortages at all skill levels&#8212;I emphasise that they are at all levels. We have a lower birth rate, although it is not as low as it was a couple of years ago, and an ageing population&#8212;that has not changed&#8212;so we need to strengthen the country through human talent. An important part of that is getting in migrants from eastern Europe.</p><p>After a recent survey of its members in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, the Confederation of British Industry said that the influx in recent years of migrant workers had contributed to massive growth and to positive experiences at almost every company that was spoken to. One interesting statistic was that migrant workers generate 10 per cent of the UK's gross domestic product, despite forming only 8 per cent of the workforce. That results in better businesses and more money for public services. Migration offers good economic gains and, at the same time, good cultural gains for Scotland.</p><p>The idea of helping somebody whose skill level is higher than that which is needed for the job that they do is good&#8212;Margo MacDonald referred to her contact with Monika. Productivity is one of the weakest points of our economy. We need to improve our productivity in all areas, and encouraging good people to be more productive is the key to success.</p><p>The global context is that we face worldwide competition for good talent. According to <em>The Economist</em> recently, other countries are actively luring highly qualified people. France has established a scientist visa to attract people, and Singapore's Ministry of Manpower has an international talent division that seeks out talented people.</p><p>The CBI has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"By welcoming their people, we are in effect building <place-holder colnum=\"5640\"/> relationships with other countries&#8212;in effect setting out our stall, as it happens, in some of the world's fastest growing marketplaces.\"</p><p>I note that, although the figures are a little patchy, we have probably attracted fewer young central Europeans than most English regions have, so there is more for us to do.</p><p>The Scottish Conservative perspective is that people are more likely to come to a country if it has more economic freedom and if we create the minimum of fuss for employers in giving migrants the jobs that they want and deserve.</p><p>My personal view is that we should go further than an office at Edinburgh airport and that we should pilot going into cities overseas to fix arrangements in people's home towns. We could establish an office in Warsaw, for example, so that people can sort out employment, training, housing and support networks before they catch the plane, instead of waiting until they arrive in Scotland.

I will focus on one key area of the budget: the abolition of business rates for many small businesses and the reduction in business rates for many others. I will also say why, for Scottish Conservatives, it is so important that the reductions are accelerated as quickly as possible.</p><p>We welcome the reductions that are detailed in the spending review. In addition, we welcome the decision of the Parliament on 21 November to prioritise the acceleration of the implementation of the rates cuts and the Finance Committee amendment that states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an acceleration in the implementation of the cuts in business rates for small businesses\"</p><p>is critical and should happen as soon as possible. The Conservative and SNP members on the Finance Committee voted in favour of that amendment, whereas the Labour and Liberal Democrat members, whose parties claim to be keen on competitiveness, abstained. From what we have heard today from the Labour Party, it seems to be against business rate cuts and not to understand how they can possibly help to stimulate our economy. Elaine Murray made the curious comment that if we give rate cuts to businesses, there is no guarantee that the money will be reinvested back into the businesses. The question that I throw out to any Labour member is what on earth they think small business owners <place-holder colnum=\"5351\"/> and directors will do with the money other than put it back into their businesses. The simple fact is that a director or business owner knows far better than any politician of any stripe what to do with their business and how the money ought to be invested.</p><p>I will focus on the benefits of accelerating the business rate cuts. We appeal to the cabinet secretary to take the issue seriously. Several businesses in Scotland are on the cusp at the moment because of the financial climate. For some businesses, the business rate cuts that they get this year&#8212;if they get them&#8212;will be the difference between profit and loss; for others, they will be the difference between trading and not trading next year. The plans could help about 116,000 businesses throughout Scotland by abolishing their rates and another 37,000 medium-sized enterprises would benefit from having their rates reduced.</p><p>Members should listen to the comments that Scottish business organisations have made. Scottish Chambers of Commerce has pointed out the rising cost pressures that are eating into margins and profits and has said that smaller firms are feeling the pinch most acutely. For the first time in several years, Scottish Chambers of Commerce has found negative trends in its business survey, which must be worrying for all of us. The cabinet secretary should listen to the Confederation of British Industry Scotland, which yesterday pointed out that activity in manufacturing has been stagnant for the past few months. It stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"if Ministers want to provide an effective shot in the arm to our smaller companies then they should accelerate the implementation of the tax cut, so that it is introduced as quickly as possible and not phased in over three years as currently envisaged.\"</p><p>The Federation of Small Businesses and the Institute of Directors have made similar comments.</p><p>From the GDP figures that were published just this week, we see that, in quarter 3 last year, Scotland still lagged behind, for that quarter and for the year as a whole. Therefore, it is important that action on rate cuts is taken now, rather than over three years. That is also important because of the message that it would send out to the business community&#8212;it would show that the Parliament is listening to the problems that we face and taking swift action to try to help. Instead of just talking about being a business-friendly Parliament, we can actually be one.</p><p>It is also important to take action now because of the way in which the policy was promoted prior to the election. It was never mentioned that the rate cuts would be introduced over three years. There was an understanding in the business community that the cuts would be introduced in <place-holder colnum=\"5352\"/> April when the first budget was implemented. The SNP clearly had the policy, not just in its manifesto but in its \"A new approach: Our first steps\" document, which contained the absolute priorities on which it intended to make progress as a Government. It is critical that we get the rate cuts as quickly as possible, and certainly far faster than has been envisaged so far. If sustainable economic growth is priority number 1, we must have the cuts quickly. The cabinet secretary asked whether we can afford to accelerate the cuts. The question on the Scottish Conservative benches is whether we can afford not to implement the cuts quickly.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13396350", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Given the timings that the Presiding Officers have set and my comment earlier in the debate, I had better get straight to the point.

It is worth noting at the start of the debate that we need an energy policy, not just an electricity policy, of the sort that the Scottish Government set out today. Depending on who one speaks to, between 20 and 25 per cent of our CO <sub>2</sub> emissions come from electricity generation, whereas the rest comes from transport, domestic heating, industrial heating and a number of other sources. If we are to have any chance of reducing emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, we cannot focus only on electricity policy. Half of the minister's speech focused only on nuclear electricity policy.</p><p>Let us look at the national context. Our oil supplies are decreasing. Our coal power stations and, ultimately, our gas power station are fairly close to the end of their lifespans, to the extent that decisions about them need to be made today. Our nuclear power stations are also reaching the end of their lifespans. At the same time, we want to grow our economy. The Scottish Conservatives, at least, also want us to remain a net exporter of energy. Currently, we export about 20 per cent of the electricity that we generate to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p><p>The geopolitical context is that many gas and oil supplies are in unstable and unfriendly countries. Most important, global warming is hanging over the entire world. We must get this right&#8212;no ifs, buts or maybes. Based on what we have heard today and on what we heard leading up to the debate from Mr Swinney and Mr Salmond, Scottish Conservative members do not believe that the Scottish Government's approach achieves that. We will not support the Government motion today.<place-holder colnum=\"5136\"/></p><p>The Labour Party has lodged a robust and sensible amendment that we are happy to back. Our amendment to the Labour amendment strengthens it, making the point that solving our energy issues and meeting our targets needs a broad range of measures and that nothing can be ruled out. The specific point that we want to make&#8212;a point made well by David Cameron just last month&#8212;is that energy decentralisation can play an important part in enabling us to achieve our goals. It is not the whole solution, just one component of it, but if some people and communities generate their own electricity, they will become far more conscious of how they use it. In addition, many microgenerators offer the opportunity to capture heat, which can then be used for domestic or commercial purposes, reducing many of the inefficiencies and losses from transmission that Patrick Harvie mentioned in his intervention during Jim Mather's speech.</p><p>Let us look at what the Government said. It claimed to want a renewables revolution that will turn us into a global renewables powerhouse. Conservative members and, I suspect, every other member of the Parliament support that objective. However, the figures do not match up. Funding in the energy and climate change line of the Scottish Government's draft budget will rise from &#163;19 million a year to &#163;33 million a year. With a mere additional &#163;14 million a year in that line, the Government hopes to achieve a renewables revolution and to make Scotland an energy powerhouse. Of course, such a revolution will not be created by Government spending alone&#8212;the private and public sectors will drive it together. However, a Government that claims to be taking the lead with a mere additional &#163;14 million, while at the same time completely ruling out a proven, mature technology such as nuclear power, is simply flapping in the wind.</p><p>The Government claims to have bold long-term targets, but it has quietly ditched its manifesto commitment to an annual mandatory emissions reduction target of 3 per cent.

Instead of a different model being used for every design, designs are transported across, which cuts costs by 30 to 40 <place-holder colnum=\"5137\"/> per cent. We are comfortable that third-generation nuclear power stations are economic. Once such a facility is up and running, electricity is produced far more cheaply than with other methods. Even according to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, nuclear power produces 5 per cent of the carbon emissions of a gas or coal-fired power station.</p><p>I have asked Mr Mather, in committee and in the chamber, what the renewables mix will look like, but the Government does not seem to have any concept of it. It reels off a shopping list of ideas, but there is no plan A for what that mix might look like, and not even a plan B for what we will do if it does not work. If renewables do not work, if we do not get them to market quickly enough, or if unforeseen problems arise, and we have completely ruled out nuclear power, we will be left with an energy gap. The Scottish Conservatives are terrified of the energy gap, and we are sick of hearing the disingenuous use of statistics by the Government. We hear that the installed capacity of renewables is already larger than nuclear, but installed capacity is not the important point; what is important is the amount of electricity that is generated that can actually be used.

In the chamber, Wendy Alexander proposed that the business rate cut should be tied to a promise by companies to spend the money investing in something else, such as research and development. However, that would not allow businesses to decide what they do with the money. If Labour Party members are genuinely concerned about economic growth, I suggest that they pick up the phone to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and enterprise ministers down south and explain to them that increasing corporation tax on small businesses by 3p in the pound is not good for economic growth. Perhaps they could also explain to them that the end of taper relief without any consultation with business is not good for business growth&#8212;whether in small, medium or large businesses.</p><p>We have heard a lot about ring fencing this morning. The Scottish Conservatives strongly support what the Government is trying to do. The reality is that there will be a reduction in the amount of ring-fenced money&#8212;it is not an all-or-nothing situation. We are moving from a situation in which about &#163;2.7 billion is ring fenced to a situation in which &#163;0.5 billion is ring fenced. It is a question of degree, as opposed to the absolutes suggested by Labour Party members in press reports and again today. The previous system has been described by local authorities as too rigid. It results in their having to report in 50 separate ways how the ring-fenced money has been spent. That is a waste of time and effort, and it does not help to progress anyone or anything.</p><p>In our 2003 and 2007 manifestos, we supported a move to a reduction in ring fencing. It is a good idea. It gives flexibility to councils and allows them to find local solutions to local problems. They can spend the money as they see fit. MSPs sometimes forget that councillors have the same strength of democratic mandate as they do. The electorate put councillors into their positions, and it is right and proper that they should be judged on how they perform. A reduction in ring fencing will give them much greater accountability and could renew and reinvigorate local democracy.</p><p>The counter-arguments that we have heard do not hold up. The idea that councillors do not care as much about the vulnerable as MSPs do is wrong.

Step 2 is implementing that act in practice, starting next week and going forward to March and April next year. However, step 3, which is just as important as steps 1 and 2, is the continual clear and careful review of what happens on the ground. It is vital that the legislation that the Parliament passed in January results in effective, efficient and proper justice on the ground, as was intended. The cabinet secretary mentioned the statistic that the vast majority of criminal cases&#8212;more than 90 per cent&#8212;are summary cases. That is why it is critical that we get the system right.</p><p>There are positive aspects in the latest instalment of the process, which is described as the summary justice system model. One or two of those aspects have been mentioned, but others have not. The first thing that is good about the model is the clear aim of reducing the time between charge and first calling at court. In the past, there has been far too big a gap between a person being charged and them ending up in court <place-holder colnum=\"4256\"/> in front of a sheriff. The clear indication that the time will be cut dramatically is to be welcomed. Let us hope that that truly works in practice.</p><p>Another important aspect is the positive emphasis that the model puts on proper investigation by both sides&#8212;the Crown and the defence&#8212;at a much earlier stage of the proceedings. Far too many cases drift on and on without either party really looking into the facts, when much of the narrative could be agreed earlier. That could result in guilty pleas and cases being taken out of the system. When I was at law school, I remember hearing that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"An incompetent lawyer can delay a trial for months or years. A competent lawyer can delay one even longer.\"</p><p>There is a nub of truth in that statement.</p><p>A third good thing about the summary justice system model is the idea of holding the intermediate diet four weeks, rather than two weeks, before the trial. That will give a crucial extra two weeks in which to resolve difficulties and to ensure that statements are agreed, sorted out and passed round the various parties, thereby decreasing the chances of a trial being stopped, which is to be welcomed.</p><p>All the measures will be underpinned by a more proactive judicial approach&#8212;asking probing questions, demanding information and ensuring that cases stay on track. There is to be more of an inquisitorial style, rather than the purely adversarial style that we have at present.</p><p>Before I talk about our amendment and what we see as the important issues, I will pick up on two issues that have been raised. Nigel Don, in a very good speech, talked about the high number of people in the country as a whole who are unable to read or write. When I volunteered in Saughton prison, it was estimated that about 50 per cent of people there were unable to read or write. Sending letters and using the written word for everything can put people at a major disadvantage. However, I point out to Mr Don that it is not only people who cannot read or write who do not read political leaflets&#8212;I am told that one or two people who can read and write also put them straight in the bin.</p><p>Stuart McMillan made a point about a mandatory time target for summary justice. I am not sure, in the end, whether he called for such a target&#8212;I think that he put both sides of the argument. It is perfectly acceptable to have an aim or a target, but I would have deep concerns if we were to make the target mandatory to the extent that an accused could be released purely because the courts were busy. I hope that the Minister for Community Safety will address that in his speech and rule out such a target.<place-holder colnum=\"4257\"/></p><p>The Scottish Conservatives want to raise three issues. One is the collection of fines, which my colleague Bill Aitken discussed ably. Fines are often tacked on to the end of the list of disposals, but they are extremely important because, in 64 per cent of convictions, the disposal is a fine. Fines are the most common disposal anywhere in the criminal justice system, but they are particularly common in summary cases. The most recent figures that I have are those for 2003, which were published in 2006. In 2003, sheriff courts set fines of about &#163;15 million, of which &#163;3 million was left unpaid that year. That is the average sum that is left unpaid, so there is an issue about fines not being paid.</p><p>The new fines enforcement officers could be part of the solution. They have teeth: they have the power to apply to the court for deductions of benefits, for the arrestment of earnings and for the power to seize vehicles. However, we must assess how sharp those teeth turn out to be in practice. We are keen to review that area closely. It is all well and good giving the powers to the officers, but if the officer has to go back to the court to apply for a deduction of benefit or for the arrestment of earnings, that is something of a circuitous route. We might need to examine and tighten up those arrangements.</p><p>We have concerns about how community service orders have worked out in practice. In 2005-06, 32 per cent of community service orders had a breach application&#8212;that is 1,892 orders out of 5,937. I do not doubt for a second that there have been some good community service orders, nor that there have been some very appropriate ones, but if so many orders have been breached, the option must be examined extremely carefully. Community service orders cannot be seen as a soft option, but if 32 per cent of them are being breached, the bucket is very leaky. The system needs to prove itself far beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p>No mention was made in the Government's motion or in the cabinet secretary's speech of some of the rhetoric that we have heard about abolishing prison sentences of six months or less. I hope that the cabinet secretary does not want to pursue that. The disposal of a short-term custodial sentence needs to be on the table for all judges to use. A range of disposals is needed, of which the short-term sentence ought to be one that is reserved for appropriate circumstances. In practice, it is used most often as a last resort, except for persistent or serious offenders, but the option must be kept on the table.</p><p>The idea of rehabilitation in prison has not been talked about; that is something to debate another day. We talk about prison not working and about trying to rehabilitate people out of prison, but some excellent work is being done in Saughton prison, <place-holder colnum=\"4258\"/> where staff are trying very hard to rehabilitate prisoners. That includes prisoners who can read and write teaching those who cannot.</p><p>We accept the terms of the Government's motion, and we have lodged an amendment that we think is sensible and right.

When he held up his postcard earlier, it was the only time that I have seen Robert Brown silenced for more than a couple of minutes.</p><p>In the past week or two, we have read in the press a couple of articles in which people have tried to say that St Andrew's day will be a failure, that nobody is excited about it and that nobody will take the day off. I hope that they are wrong. I understand that 85 per cent of respondents to the consultation on Dennis Canavan's St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill supported the holiday and that a MORI poll that was issued shortly after the bill was introduced said that 75 per cent of people in Scotland felt that the day should be a holiday and supported what he had done. I hope that the nay-sayers are wrong.</p><p>We can hear and read about many positives, some of which have been mentioned. Sixty historic sites and monuments throughout Scotland will open free on the day, which is an excellent initiative. I hope that the number is far more than 60 next year. I understand that tomorrow the world's largest Dashing White Sergeant will take place&#8212;I might go along to that; it might be quite a lot of fun. A whole load of dinners, events and ceilidhs will take place. I am not sure whether it is true that a couple of aqua-ceilidhs will take place for the first time ever&#8212;I do not know whether the journalist who reported that was just having a laugh, but apparently they involve the splashing white sergeant and drip the willow&#8212;those are not my words, but those of the journalist. I cannot decide between the world's largest Dashing White Sergeant and the aqua-ceilidhs. Many great things are going on tomorrow.</p><p>The idea of a winter festival is excellent. If the first festival is not the massive success that we hope it will be, I hope that we will persevere with it, because two months is a long time, so getting the festival perfect first time is probably unlikely. In the period between St Andrew's day and Christmas, keeping people going for the first two weeks in December might not be easy, but I hope that we will persevere, because the festival could be extremely good for tourism and the economy as a whole.</p><p>I have a small point. We heard the minister talk about a new website that will be established to promote Scotland in China. That is a great <place-holder colnum=\"3989\"/> initiative, but we need joined-up thinking. Last night I looked at visitscotland.com just to see what it does and says. Lots of good stuff is on there, and it mentions a hotline to telephone to make bookings and find out what is going on. Unfortunately, that hotline's working hours were reduced last month to winter hours, so it is now open only from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock, Monday to Friday. If we are trying to attract international visitors from the United States and south-east Asia, we need to be open not only from 9 to 5 United Kingdom time. I am sure that the minister will mention that to Mr Mather.</p><p>We must review how events have gone after St Andrew's day and how the winter festival has gone. We need ingenious or creative ways of building up the critical mass for St Andrew's day. If, as predicted, not everybody takes the day as a holiday this year, we should try to think of imaginative ways to encourage people to take the holiday next year, so that we get it right for the year of homecoming in 2009. My colleague Mr Brocklebank made a couple of suggestions to encourage schools to get on board. If children are off for the day, it is more likely that parents will take the day off. Parliament has set the right tone and the right example. I do not know whether it is true&#8212;someone can correct me if it is not&#8212;but I have read that Angus Council has decided that its staff will have the day off.</p><p>The economic benefits could be massive. We have heard how St Patrick's day works for Ireland&#8212;that one-day celebration is thought to be worth &#8364;80 million just for Dublin&#8212;so it is worth persevering for economic benefits. The initiative will be good for tourism, especially if we get the winter festival right. We have 28 million people throughout the world who claim some Scottish ancestry, so an enormous market exists for tourism, for wider economic benefits and for retailers from bringing us all under one strong identity.

I recently attended the VisitScotland award ceremony at the Edinburgh international conference centre and was impressed by an industry that is in buoyant mood and is hungry for the future.</p><p>We welcome the debate and support much of the Government's approach, but there are two areas that we want to highlight in our amendment. The first relates to what might be called localism. We had concerns about the abolition of the area tourist boards and we think that the situation needs to be considered for the future. Certainly, any moves to centralise the industry further need to be resisted. It is important that local opportunities are given at local levels, so I was encouraged to hear the minister say last week that we need to improve engagement at a local level. I was further encouraged yesterday to hear VisitScotland say that the vast bulk of the 109 tourist information centres are safe. It is important that we stand up for them.</p><p>Tourism initiatives in Scotland are often best marketed by local tourism areas. That is particularly true in Edinburgh, which has capital city status and should be looked at again as an exception. VisitScotland talks about a national dish with local flavours, but it is important that we can taste those local flavours. The Government should commit to localism as far as possible.</p><p>The second part of our amendment refers to the aspiration to achieve 50 per cent growth and <place-holder colnum=\"3887\"/> makes it clear that we need a plan to do that. The tourism framework, which is a largely positive document, and the 50 per cent figure that came out of it were produced in March 2006&#8212;a year and a half ago&#8212;yet there is still no clear plan for delivery. That is one thing that prompted the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, with all-party support, to decide to look into the issue and come up with some suggestions and answers. That is important because, only last week, the chief executive of VisitScotland said that we need to quantify activity in key areas, allocate responsibility and measure progress on the 50 per cent growth ambition. If we do not do that, there is little chance that we will meet our aspiration.</p><p>Between 2005 and 2006, the overall position of tourism in Scotland deteriorated. The number of passenger trips decreased by 7.2 per cent and visitor spend decreased by 1.3 per cent. That is not good news and we need to reverse that trend as quickly as possible. The situation last year was excellent for international tourism. Visitor trips increased by 14.2 per cent and spend increased by more than 19 per cent. That is particularly impressive given the strength of the pound last year. There were impressive gains from the United States of America, France and Ireland. However, it was a bad year for domestic tourism, which affects the overall figures. We saw big decreases in the numbers of UK and Scottish tourists&#8212;people from the east travelling west, and people from the west and east travelling north and south. That is important and it is another reason why we favour localism. Between 2005 and 2006, the number of overnight stays in Scotland by Scottish people dropped sharply by 3 million, from 22 million to 19 million. That is why our amendment focuses on localism and getting a plan behind the 50 per cent growth figure.</p><p>We have many positive ideas. We must move as quickly as possible to year-round tourism, which will be good for the industry. It will mean that we will be much more likely to hit our targets and that we will have much more stability, which will improve the career paths and skills of those working in the industry. We need great initiatives such as the Cambo snowdrops campaign, which tries to bring tourists to Fife in February and March when it is traditionally quiet. We want increases in business tourism and, in particular, in wildlife tourism. We already have a strong reputation throughout Europe in wildlife tourism, but we can make it even stronger.</p><p>We are optimistic for the industry. We want greater control locally and a clear plan in place as quickly as possible to meet the growth aspiration. I note in passing that, according to the Scottish Government website, in 1996&#8212;the last full year of a Conservative Government&#8212;the Scottish tourism <place-holder colnum=\"3888\"/> industry was worth &#163;5 billion a year. Last year, it was worth &#163;4.1 billion.

We have issues with it, which I will deal with in due course, but, in general, we think that it is positive and that the strategic priorities are good. Most members can agree that we want stronger and more impressive growth in Scotland. Growth has not been good enough since devolution and it is important that we get that right. It is not good enough for Iain Gray and David Whitton to say that there were 13 quarters in which we were ahead; what is important is the annual growth rate over the piece. I only hope that Iain Gray and David Whitton never become football managers because, when they have lost every game over the season, they will say, \"But we were ahead at half time in 13 of the games!\" We accept the Government's strategy, in broad terms.

Derek Brownlee has talked about our point on business rates, so I will focus on the lack of accountability in the targets that the Government has set. We do not want a box-ticking exercise or a plethora of targets that are rigidly looked at every week of the year, but we are disappointed&#8212;I tried to make this point to the cabinet secretary&#8212;that only two targets have been set for 2011. This Government's term of office ends in 2011&#8212;there will be an election&#8212;so it is important that we set targets on that basis.<place-holder colnum=\"3607\"/></p><p>There are only two targets. The first&#8212;increasing the GDP growth rate to match the UK level&#8212;is bold but, as Iain Gray rightly pointed out, there is a danger that if the UK economy as a whole goes down, Scotland will overtake it purely because it is not doing very well. The second is simply to reduce emissions, but the small print states that the basis for emissions targets has yet to be decided.</p><p>There are only two targets and they are the only basis on which the Government wants us to judge it from an economic perspective in 2011. There are six targets for 2017. There is even a target for 2050. Some targets are not just being kicked into the long grass&#8212;we are practically booting them out of the stadium and asking to be judged on only two very simple targets in 2011.</p><p>We commend to the Government that Scotland comes up with some better and more strategic targets for 2011. Where does the Government think our GDP growth rate can be by 2011, compared with other EU countries of a similar size? Where does the Government see our productivity moving by 2011, as compared with our OECD trading partners? The employment rate in Scotland is higher than that in the UK yet our GDP is lower, so our productivity must be significantly down.</p><p>Where does the Government see Scotland's labour market participation being by 2011?

As a result, I do not stand either to gain or to lose from the introduction of ADR.</p><p>As the correct resolution method for any dispute depends entirely on the desired result and the complexity of the case in question, a range of options is needed to deal with disputes. As far as formality is concerned, at the top of the chain is, of course, court procedure. Pretty much everything below that is referred to as ADR. The most formal form of ADR is arbitration; slightly less formal is adjudication, which I will focus on in my speech; and less formal again is mediation, about which we have heard a great deal this morning. In fact, my colleague John Lamont will tell us more about what has happened with mediation south of the border. Another less formal method is negotiation.</p><p>In his opening speech, the cabinet secretary referred to the introduction of an arbitration bill, <place-holder colnum=\"2940\"/> which is to be recommended and applauded. I intervened twice in his speech. I thought that his answer to my first question was good, but his response to my second, on his view of the Scottish arbitration code, left me wanting just a little bit more. In 2000 or thereabouts, fed up with the fact that the Parliament had not yet introduced an arbitration bill, all the experts&#8212;industry and legal profession experts, surveyors, engineers and consultants&#8212;got together and produced the Scottish arbitration code. The cabinet secretary is wrong to say that it is outdated; indeed, I commend it to him as an excellent piece of work that could form the cornerstone of any arbitration bill. It is vital that we consider the code before we start the process from scratch.</p><p>Although arbitration can be an excellent course of action, I should highlight some of my reservations, as certain comments that have been made about it have been a little bit wide of the mark. It is, for example, a myth that arbitration is always cheaper. Its biggest benefit is that a man or woman of skill is brought in to decide on the technical issues in question. However, lawyers are involved for most of the time and, unlike judges, who are paid by the state, the arbiter needs to be paid by the parties involved in the dispute. Moreover, because the arbiter is not always a legal expert, he or she will, most of the time, require the help of clerks, who, as fully qualified lawyers, will also need to be paid by the parties.</p><p>Because it is confidential, arbitration can be good, for example, for parties who do not want matters to get into the public domain. It can be faster, but it can also be just as time-consuming as other methods. It has its benefits, but we need to go into it with our eyes wide open.</p><p>Bill Aitken referred to certain low-value cases that take up an inordinate amount of time in the courts and cost a lot of money. It is important that we prioritise how we deal with such cases. The complexity of some low-value cases means that they must be decided in the sheriff court, but there must be some way of getting into mediation cases in which only value or quantum is under debate or discussion. As Mr Aitken was commenting on such low-value cases, I noticed his fat, juicy wallet stuffed with bank notes, and I had to wonder what he actually meant by low-value cases. However, we will skip over that question.</p><p>My main experience as a solicitor was in adjudication, which has not really been discussed this morning and which, in terms of formality, sits somewhere between mediation and arbitration. The only form of adjudication in Scotland was introduced under the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and applies to construction contracts. After all, in the construction industry there are almost always <place-holder colnum=\"2941\"/> disputes about time, money or&#8212;most commonly&#8212;time and money.</p><p>Because they involve a web of parties, construction contracts can be pretty complex and, after much lobbying from the industry, the Westminster Government at the time&#8212;a Conservative Government, I should point out&#8212;introduced adjudication to deal with disputes. It has certainly helped the construction industry a lot. Now every party in a construction contract has a statutory right to go to adjudication.

In 90 per cent of adjudication cases a result is delivered within 42 days, and in 60 per cent of cases within 28 days. The decision is binding, which means that the parties still have to pay up in the interim, but it is not final and can be appealed in a court of law if a mistake has been made or if, ultimately, the parties are unhappy with it. The fact that payment has to be made has been very important in an industry in which small firms can easily go to the wall if someone decides to delay payments for years and years. Now they have to cough up within a very short time of the decision being made. In considering the various methods of taking forward civil justice, we could learn a lot from the nine years' worth of positive and negative experiences with adjudication, and I commend the system to the cabinet secretary.</p><p>I will leave it to my colleague John Lamont to talk more about mediation. The Woolf reforms resulted in the civil procedure rules that tightened up mediation and made it an integral part of civil dispute resolution south of the border. I apologise to Christine Grahame, but there is no longer any need for us to go to the United States to learn about mediation. Mr Lamont, who qualified and worked south of the border, will tell us more about it. We are way behind England and Wales.</p><p>I asked the cabinet secretary my initial question because I wanted to make it clear that, in order for mediation to succeed, if we are going to follow what has happened south of the border, we need either strong judicial encouragement for it or legislative, governmental encouragement for it. One way in which the Government could take the <place-holder colnum=\"2942\"/> lead without having to pass any legislation and without any judges having to say anything would be to declare that mediation will be used as a first resort. The cabinet secretary gave a good answer when he said that it is important that the courts are still used for interim interdicts, but the Government could say that mediation should be used as a first resort.</p><p>Although I have not seen any details, I am certain that there are cases in which the Government will be involved that are just lying about in the rolls of court somewhere and are not being processed at all.

I reiterate what my colleagues Derek Brownlee and Jackson Carlaw said in commending the previous Administration for commissioning the report and the current Administration for giving us the chance to debate it. The review sheds light on the fairly complex web of scrutiny bodies throughout Scotland and neatly describes the situation as \"scrutiny creep\"&#8212;in the eight years since devolution, we have had 11 completely new bodies and, in the past three years, costs have <place-holder colnum=\"2367\"/> increased by about 55 per cent to more than &#163;92 million. Now is probably as good a time as any to take stock.</p><p>I agree that scrutiny is important&#8212;there is no debate about that. Our public services need to be well managed, safe and fit for purpose. Derek Brownlee added the point that, with public services, unlike with the private sector, the public cannot just walk away. It is important to have scrutiny, but we argue that balance is the key factor that we must seek to achieve in future. As I think Elaine Murray said, the scrutiny process ultimately diverts resources away from the front-line delivery of public services and, as Jackson Carlaw said, it also diverts people away from that.</p><p>The indirect costs of scrutiny have not been talked about much. We can measure the direct costs in many ways, but the indirect costs are much harder to measure and may be far greater: a press article last week said that a recent social work inspection for Glasgow City Council cost the equivalent of &#163;155,000 in staff time&#8212;for just one social work inspection.</p><p>As we have heard, there has been an outbreak of consensus today: the Conservative party supports the motion; the SNP, which is obviously the driver behind the motion, wants the system to be simplified and proportionate; Labour wants to proceed with vigour and caution; and the Liberal Democrats quite rightly support the motion too. I am pretty sure that the consensus in the chamber will not last past tomorrow morning, when we will have a slightly more contentious motion to debate.</p><p>We endorse the report of the Crerar review, with just a couple of caveats. We like very much the idea of the five guiding principles&#8212;accountability, proportionality, transparency, independence and public focus. As we have heard, some of the bodies that have been set up would not have been set up if those principles had been applied. One of the benefits of all the parties agreeing on the principles is that when events occur&#8212;as they inevitably will&#8212;we will have a very clear set of principles by which to decide what to do. Perhaps some of the mistakes of the past will not be made in the future.</p><p>We like the idea of there being more public involvement, because the ultimate beneficiary of scrutiny ought to be the service user and the general public. We also commend the idea of slightly more power shifting from the Government to the Parliament and to the committees, so that we all have a chance to look at reports and so that it is more difficult for any reports or any information to be hidden.</p><p>One idea that has not come up but which the Conservatives also favour is some form of sunset clause being used for the regulatory body or <place-holder colnum=\"2368\"/> programme that is being set up. A response might be right at the time but, within a year or two, it might be inappropriate. Whichever programme is set up must continue to make public services safer and fit for purpose. A sunset clause could help with that.</p><p>We have already heard that there should be more amalgamation where appropriate and that there should be no new organisations. We also agree with various miscellaneous points that have been made. We all agree that simpler language should be used and we might all agree with the idea of an internet portal so that different bodies can see what other bodies are doing.</p><p>We have two reservations, which have been outlined already. The idea of a single body for scrutiny has been mentioned many times. On the basis of our research, we do not consider that appropriate; we do not think that one monolithic structure for scrutiny&#8212;a super-regulator with 43 departments&#8212;would be a good idea.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crerar Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the chance to debate the Crerar review.

We must listen to what councillors are saying about how unworkable the pledge to reduce class sizes is on the ground.</p><p>We also heard about parental choice. The SNP will deny parents the chance to send their children to the school of their choice, purely because of the inflexible limit of 18, which is based on ideology and not on proven educational benefits.</p><p>The SNP needs to trust headteachers a bit more. On page 48 of its manifesto, on education, the SNP said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We recognise and respect the crucial role of educational professionals in this vital task.\"</p><p>It said that it believed firmly that headteachers should be allowed to decide class sizes for P4 to P7, but not P1 to P3. Why does the cabinet secretary trust headteachers to decide class sizes for P4 to P7, but not for P1 to P3?</p><p>Another danger of focusing so heavily on this flagship policy is that we ignore much greater priorities that need to be dealt with. My colleague Elizabeth Smith talked a lot about school discipline. There has been a large increase in the number of attacks on teachers over the past 10 years or so. We do not know the precise figures, but we have a pretty good estimate. It is utterly unacceptable that any teacher is attacked in school. We really need to nip that problem in the bud and adopt a zero tolerance policy to it.</p><p>We need to work far harder on, and give greater priority to, literacy and numeracy. We have heard numerous statistics, but most people seem to agree that at least one in five of our children leaving school cannot read or write properly. Why is addressing that issue not a higher priority than reducing class sizes, which we have heard so much about?</p><p>Yesterday, my colleague Derek Brownlee spoke at length about the success of the West Dunbartonshire Council project, which Des McNulty spoke about in even more detail this morning. On the face of it, we have a project that works. Why are we not implementing it across the board right away instead of focusing on class sizes?</p><p>The policy has not worked in Edinburgh, where the SNP and the Liberals voted to try to close down 22 busy and popular schools; those schools had lower rolls and would have met the policy, but they wanted to close them down because of the low rolls. One of the consequences of the SNP changing its mind over a two-week period was that 62 children in Edinburgh were uprooted and moved to different schools because their parents thought that their school was closing down.

In the interim, will it commit to supporting us in giving pensioners a 50 per cent discount?</p><p>We welcome the debate for a number of reasons. Almost everything that we do in this country depends on the economy. We must not forget that jobs, the fulfilment of our people and the money that we spend on public services such as our schools, hospitals and police forces depend on the wealth that is created by our small, medium and large businesses.</p><p>We often see in the newspapers politicians visiting places where the money is spent, but we rarely see politicians visiting the places where the wealth is created. There needs to be much more integration between the Parliament and the businesses that create the wealth day in, day out.</p><p>Another reason, which has not been mentioned, why the economy is so crucial is the global competition that we face, which will only get fiercer. Other powerhouses across Europe and the rest of the world are investing in education and are making it easier to do business in their country. <place-holder colnum=\"237\"/></p><p>We must follow suit, otherwise not only will we not keep up, but we will fall further and further behind.</p><p>I will address a couple of points that have been made with which I disagree. I was disappointed to hear that Labour thinks that when we cut business rates the money that is saved ought to be tied into some sort of research and development fund. It ought to be up to the companies to decide what they do when their business rates are cut. We should not impose on them how they ought to spend any money that is saved, because businesses can spend money far more wisely than we can.</p><p>I also disagree with a comment made by Mr Tavish Scott. He outlined an excellent innovation at the University of Dundee, but I find it difficult to accept that such innovation could not happen in the future simply because two areas are in different portfolios. There ought to be some kind of moratorium on discussing the size of John Swinney's portfolio&#8212;at least for the next couple of weeks. We should see how things develop before we comment on the matter further.</p><p>On the specific proposals, we agree entirely with the cut in business rates, which could help at least 120,000 companies throughout Scotland. As John Lamont said, it could help to get back into business some of the empty shops in the high street. We are very much in favour of that proposal.</p><p>As Derek Brownlee said, we are also in favour of cutting red tape and having fewer regulations. I appreciated the intervention on Mr Brownlee and what was said about consideration being given to such mechanisms as sunset clauses on regulations. We should also have a presumption against the gold plating of European regulations. We should ask every time whether a regulation makes it easier or more difficult to do business in Scotland.</p><p>We do not like the transport policies that we have heard so far. No matter how strong our economy is and no matter how developed we have become technologically, goods, services and people have to move from A to B. We need to have a clear and consistent transport policy in place. I think that the issue was debated at length in the previous session. One of the biggest gripes of business in Scotland and the rest of the UK is the stop-start mentality of funding for public transport projects. We need to end that mentality.</p><p>My colleague Liz Smith talked about the investment that we need to make in education to compete on a global level, which John Park and Jeremy Purvis also mentioned. There is a lack of alignment between people's educational experiences and the skills that they need when <place-holder colnum=\"238\"/> they get into the workplace to try to make a contribution.</p><p>All that is underpinned by the need for a slight culture shift to a more positive attitude towards business and making life easier for business. Not only does that need to happen at the Executive level, it needs to cascade down to local government and other agencies. It is time to champion the values of enterprise and for us all to say that Scotland is open for business.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wealthier and Fairer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am afraid that the video camera does not lie.

I am interested to know why the Howat report was not published earlier. We asked about that several times without receiving a satisfactory answer. Was it not published because Mr McCabe disliked its findings, because it was in Tavish Scott's bedroom all the time or because the initial part of the report was eaten by the hungry caterpillar about which we have heard?</p><p>I will echo some of the comments that we came up with earlier and I will ask the cabinet secretary for a bit more detail on the ideas of smaller and more efficient government. Of course, we agree with much of the rhetoric that we have heard about a tight focus on efficiency; enabling people and businesses to increase their wealth; the maximum value from the public purse; spending money wisely and to the best effect; and a small and strategic Government. We agree with all that rhetoric, but we would like very much to see the details. A previous Administration that talked about small government said that it would do less, better, but we did not see much evidence of that.</p><p>On specific details, Conservative party leader Annabel Goldie has asked for several answers, which I hope we will receive sooner rather than later. What will the Administration do with the number of quangos? What will it do to reduce administration costs, which have risen year after year? What will it do with the car pool, which has grown year after year? What will it do with the number of special advisers and spin doctors, and with the spend on advertising, which has increased year after year? Once we have answers to those questions, it will be clearer where we can support the Administration. On some matters, such as business, we can support the Administration.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary to closely examine the implementation of programmes. Will his department report back to us regularly on what savings have been made against budget? Will he commit to having some form of regular, independent, Howat-style review&#8212;perhaps not 181 pages every time&#8212;so that we can see the commitment to smaller and more efficient government?</p><p>Will the cabinet secretary also agree to dispense with some of the SNP manifesto commitments that do not favour smaller and more efficient government? I will give a couple of examples. We agree entirely with widening small and medium-sized enterprises' access to public sector contracts, but the manifesto states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will set a minimum target of 20% of public sector contracts by value to be sourced from small and medium sized enterprises.\"</p><p>We question where that 20 per cent will come from and how the Government will enforce that target. <place-holder colnum=\"154\"/></p><p>Is it going to force public sector agencies not to give contracts to the best companies purely on the basis that they are not SMEs?</p><p>Another commitment that I am concerned about, which appears later in the manifesto, talks about flexi-working. In principle, one can support that, but the commitment states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every public sector body will be required within 6 months of our taking office to explain what its policy is and what has been preventing it from doing more, and to provide an action plan of measures.\"</p><p>That will be a requirement of every public sector body. Some of the comments in the finance and sustainable growth part of the manifesto would not lead to leaner and more efficient government, and I hope that the cabinet secretary will agree to dispense with them.</p><p>An issue that is not directly related to finance and sustainable growth but that was put forward by the Scottish Conservatives throughout the election campaign is the concept of localism. In general, will the Administration agree to give more powers back to local government and give more powers to local community councils so that we have real local democracy and an end to, or at least a significant reduction in, the ring fencing that the previous Executive placed around local council spending throughout Scotland?</p><p>I agree with my colleague Derek Brownlee and, under protest, with Roseanna Cunningham that we ought to have a full debate on the Howat report.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary to review his comments about Scottish Water. To quote the First Minister, the strength of parliamentary debate ought to determine what happens on that issue. Mutualising Scottish Water will give us a great chance to take it forward to a brighter future. The rhetoric from the cabinet secretary was very good, but we need to see the reality sooner rather than later.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383622", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Approach to Government"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The next leader&#8212;exactly, Mr McLetchie.
