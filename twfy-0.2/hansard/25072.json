There is the important fact that the Government will deliver free school meals to all primary 1 to primary 3 children and expand childcare. The Government will spend &#163;55 million over two years to expand the provision of free school meals. It will spend &#163;59 million over two years to provide additional childcare places, taking the total additional funding for childcare to about &#163;250 million over two years.</p><p>From August 2014, all two-year-olds in workless households will be entitled to 600 hours of free nursery education. That will benefit 8,400 children&#8212;15 per cent of all two-year-olds. From August 2015, that entitlement will be extended to two-year-olds from the hardest pressed families who are in receipt of a range of benefits. That will benefit 15,400 children&#8212;27 per cent of all two-year-olds. That is about making a difference in people&#8217;s lives and the budget shows that the Scottish Government is achieving that.</p><p>From January 2015, all children in P1 to P3 will be entitled to free school meals, which will save families at least &#163;330 per child per year. The childcare commitment means that from August 2015, Scotland will be delivering more than 80 million hours of free childcare for two, three and four-year-olds every single year. That is 6.5 per cent more hours than if we had implemented the English system.</p><p>However, to get to the next level&#8212;to make that leap to move Scotland forward&#8212;we can transform childcare only with independence. An SNP Government in an independent Scotland will introduce a universal system of high-quality learning and childcare for children from the age of one. The &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; document sets out on page 194 how we will transform childcare.</p><p>By the end of our budget, we will be providing 600 hours of childcare for approximately half of Scotland&#8217;s two-year-olds. Those whose parents receive working tax credits or child tax credits will benefit. By the end of the first session of Parliament, we will ensure that all three and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds will be entitled to 1,140 hours of childcare, which is the same number of hours that children currently spend at primary school. By the end of the second session of Parliament, we will ensure that all children from the age of one to school age will be entitled to the same number of hours of childcare per year</p><p>I mentioned earlier that the budget will support economic recovery and create jobs and opportunities for the people of Scotland. The Scottish Government is already investing in our young people&#8212;indeed, Scotland is the only country in the EU to have a dedicated Minister for Youth Employment. Since December 2011, Angela Constance has been in charge of that portfolio and the youth unemployment rate has fallen from approximately 25.4 per cent&#8212;approximately 113,000 young people&#8212;to 19.6 per cent, or 79,000 young people, which can be compared with a rate of 20.4 per cent in the UK overall.</p><p>The Scottish Government has invested an additional &#163;125 million from 2012 to 2014-15 to support young people towards and into work. There is &#163;88 million, including &#163;25 million in cash, for recruitment incentives to help small companies to recruit young people by paying half their wage for the first six months of a new job. There is &#163;30 million of funding for the opportunities for all programme to support our commitment that all 16 to 19-year-olds in Scotland who are not already in work, education or training will be offered a learning or training opportunity. There is also &#163;5 million to support up to 2,500 young people into opportunities that are linked to major cultural and sporting events.</p><p>I welcome all those commitments from the Scottish Government and the cabinet secretary, but we must look at other ways to ensure that Scotland can take the next step to make a difference. I do not doubt for a minute that every one of us in the chamber has the best interests of our constituents and the people of Scotland at heart, but we must look at how we deal with the challenges ahead. I believe that independence offers us a future for our children and young people; in my view, that is the most important element, given my motivation as a parent and as an elected representative for the people in my constituency.</p><p>I welcome the budget, which focuses on and helps towards Scotland&#8217;s future, but I look forward to future budgets when we will sit in the Parliament of an independent country and talk about Scotland&#8217;s future.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What I will do, Mr Henry, is praise the work of the Parliament and praise the parties for working together to represent the people of Scotland and find a solution to the bedroom tax at this stage.

As the convener, Dave Stewart, and Angus MacDonald said, if one child is helped because of the inquiry, we have surely done something. As almost every member who has spoken has said, the subject is a difficult one. John Wilson talked about how challenging the inquiry was for the committee. To see that, members need only look at the case studies in annex A of the report and read about the young people who were involved. That is not just print on paper&#8212;we can see that they are real young people whose real lives and real issues are happening in the world. It is harrowing, horrific and difficult reading for us all but, as the convener rightly said&#8212;this might be paraphrasing&#8212;we need to know these things and investigate the issues, because the exploitation cannot be allowed to continue.</p><p>Jamie Hepburn said that, as a father, it is difficult to comprehend the situation. I agree, because child sexual exploitation repulses us all when we hear about it. That is why the work that the committee undertook was so difficult. Jamie Hepburn also mentioned that parents have a responsibility. We must ensure that we know what our role is with our children and how we can help. Although the education system plays an important part, we all have a responsibility on that.</p><p>The minister said that we all felt</p><p>&#8220;a mixture of horror, anger and sadness&#8221;</p><p>at the news from Rotherham and Rochdale and at the on-going Jimmy Savile stories. It is extremely difficult for us to comprehend, especially in the high-profile Jimmy Savile case, how people can be such vile individuals.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s ministerial working group on child sexual exploitation, which involves experts and those in local authorities, the Crown Office, the police and key children&#8217;s organisations who work closely with victims of exploitation. The group is the best way to share best practice&#8212;as Angus MacDonald said, there is quite a bit of good practice out there&#8212;and ensure that organisations work together.</p><p>David Torrance mentioned data collection, which is an important part of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. We have received evidence on the difficulty of being able to get information backwards and forwards. One of the key points of the bill is that we will get that opportunity to share information through the named person.</p><p>David Torrance also mentioned the vulnerable young people operational group in Renfrewshire. It has representatives from the police, social work, education, health and the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration on a case-by-case basis, meets regularly and gives people the opportunity to get information about CSE. It is an example of best practice and is mentioned on page 13 of the report.</p><p>The working group is correct to say that child sexual exploitation is not a stand-alone issue. We need to ensure that we all know what is going on and that we do all that we can to work together. We need to ensure that we have the strongest approach on child protection.</p><p>One thing that I need not mention, because it has been mentioned on numerous occasions, is that the central pillar of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill is the getting it right for every child approach. That is one of the main reasons why the bill is going through the parliamentary process.</p><p>The policy of giving young people access to a named person until they are 18 will make a difference, help with some of the cases mentioned in the report and highlight issues. We cannot legislate for bad people, as I have said before, but when child sexual exploitation cases happen, we can try to ensure that everyone gets all the information that they possibly can to give the young people help and support and, potentially, to identify the problem. The child&#8217;s plan and access to it will also make a difference and help.</p><p>Schools play a vital role in identifying and preventing child sexual exploitation by ensuring that, as the minister stated, children and young people are educated about topics such as appropriate relationships, protection from abuse and keeping themselves safe from harm from early on in their education right until they leave school.</p><p>The Government already invests in some programmes. The respectme service and ChildLine are Government funded and are working hard with others to help people to tackle bullying in all forms and to give advice to schools on how to encourage safe, responsible use of personal mobile technology in school and beyond. One of the main issues that came up in the report is the fact that we have an issue with cyber-bullying and bullying in general among young people.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to ensure that fast, effective protection is in place for children who are at risk of abuse and neglect. It has already set up the ministerial working group on child sexual exploitation. The group has reported back and I wait to hear what the Government says on that report and what further it will do in light of the committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>One of the messages that has been highlighted is that child protection is everyone&#8217;s responsibility. I mentioned that earlier. We all have to take responsibility and ensure that we talk about the matter openly. Many of us will have had difficulty when we saw the subject of the debate but, if we do not talk about it, who will talk about it and how can we ensure that horror stories like those in the report do not happen?</p><p>We must remember that the case studies in the report are not just part of the report to be filed away and forgotten about; they are the lives of young people. We must ensure that what we do in the Parliament makes a difference in their lives.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank the committee for the difficult work that it undertook in its inquiry.

That is, of course, supported by children&#8217;s charities throughout the country and welcomed by many. The budget confirms funding for 2014-15 of &#163;55 million over two years to expand the provision of free school meals, and &#163;59 million over two years to provide additional childcare places, all of which takes the total additional funding for children to approximately &#163;250 million over two years. From August 2014, all two-year-olds in workless households will be entitled to 600 hours of free nursery education. That will benefit 8,800 children, or 15 per cent of two-year-olds.</p><p>That is all being done against the backdrop of the limitations of the devolved settlement, and shows that the Scottish Government is committed to helping families to be able to work, train, and help our economy.</p><p>From January 2015, all children in primary 1 to 3 will be entitled to free school meals, which will save families &#163;330 per child per year. That commitment means that, from August 2015, Scotland will provide 6.5 per cent more hours of free childcare than we would have done if we had implemented the English system.</p><p>It is good to see that the Labour Party will get it right tonight by supporting the budget and backing free school meals and childcare at this stage. However, its earlier lack of support was disappointing and it will probably be remembered by the public.</p><p>We can only transform childcare in Scotland with independence. It is the next step. An SNP Government in an independent Scotland will introduce a universal system of high-quality learning and childcare for children from the age of one. The white paper, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221;, sets out how we can transform childcare. By the end of the Scottish Government&#8217;s first budget, we will provide 600 hours of childcare to around half of Scotland&#8217;s two-year-olds. Those whose parents receive working tax credit and child tax credit will benefit. By the end of the first parliamentary session, we will ensure that all vulnerable two-year-olds and three and four-year-olds will be entitled to 1,140 hours of childcare per year, which is the same number of hours that children spend at primary school.</p><p>By the end of the second parliamentary session, we will ensure that children will receive that support from the age of one to school age. We will continue to invest and improve the life chances of all our young people and all the people of Scotland.</p><p>The Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill is going through Parliament. It will strengthen children&#8217;s rights and set in statute key elements of the getting it right for every child approach to ensure that every child and family gets the support and help that they need when they need it. It also includes elements that will ensure better permanence planning for looked-after children. The Education and Culture Committee recently agreed an amendment to the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill at stage 2 that means that the Scottish Parliament is leading the way, because there will be added support for young people when they leave care.</p><p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the death of Derek Mackay&#8217;s and my political father, Councillor Jim Mitchell. When he was a young man, he was split from his family and was in care. He often talked about the lack of support that he received when he left care. Obviously, that was a long time ago, but we have the opportunity to be a world leader and show that we will support and help the next generation of young people who come through that system. At one stage, Renfrewshire Council talked about naming one of its care homes after Councillor Mitchell, and I hope that it will keep that promise, because it could be an inspiration to the generation of young people who are coming through.</p><p>I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to having 25,000 modern apprenticeships per year. Continuing to focus the employability fund on young people and maintaining financial support for employers will enable them to recruit and train young people and give them the skills that employers need.</p><p>In 2014-15 and 2015-16, the Scottish Government will implement the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Act 2013. The main opportunity that that will provide is widening access for all to our universities, ensuring that people who come from parts of my constituency, such as Ferguslie Park, get the chances in life that others do. That is about ensuring that it is people&#8217;s ability to learn, not their parents ability to earn that gets them their place in university.</p><p>Part of the act covers the principles of good governance for the university sector, with significant changes in how colleges are governed. West College Scotland has welcomed those changes. Principal Audrey Cumberford said:</p><p>&#8220;It is exciting times in the college sector and our new College provides a unique opportunity to enhance education provision in the West in an ever changing economic environment. Our commitment as always is to change people&#8217;s lives, create opportunities for our students, strive for excellence in everything we do&#8221;.</p><p>That is a perfect example. Principal Cumberford is in tandem with the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach.</p><p>The further education sector in general is ambitious about its future. John Henderson, the chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government made a commitment to maintain colleges&#8217; cash funding earlier this year and we are very pleased that this has been incorporated into the draft Budget for 2014-15.</p><p>We also welcome the additional resources that are being allocated to the college sector for 2015-16.&#8221;</p><p>That shows what the Scottish Government can achieve with this budget, even with the limited powers of devolution.

That is a typical example of what they do. One hundred thousand children will end up in poverty because of their party&#8217;s cuts.</p><p>The Child Poverty Action Group has estimated that the number of children in poverty in Scotland will increase by between 50,000 and 100,000 by 2020. That is with a no vote. A yes vote will make a difference and ensure that we move in the right direction. The only certainty of a no vote is that there will be more cuts.</p><p>We are talking about free school meals, which will make a major difference in a lot of the communities and families throughout the whole of Scotland, but yet again we have Opposition parties that seem to want to vote against it. They talk about one thing: they talk about how they want to help people and move things forward, but they will not deal with the issues. Free school meals will help to tackle child poverty and promote child welfare. Why would Opposition parties play politics with that, like they do with everything else? This is not some student debate in a university debating society; this is real people and real lives.</p><p>We can talk about Labour Party members and their idea of reality. As I keep saying, their reality is like an alternate universe. They do not seem to live in the real world; they just want to talk constantly about the negativities and they do not want to work with us to build.</p><p>On spending commitments, Labour members have offered to spend on and purchase just about everything from the Glasgow airport rail link in Renfrewshire to bringing in childcare now&#8212;which we have done. They have asked us to do more, but they do not look at the costs. They do not look at how they would balance the books.

One reason why I wanted to have the debate is that that report represents such an improvement on the previous report on our national youth work provider that was produced in 2007.</p><p>I have seen the difference that YouthLink Scotland can make to young people&#8217;s lives at local level. By working with many vulnerable young people and groups in my area, it gives them opportunities for the future. As well as helping uniformed groups to do some great work in my area, it has worked with various other partner organisations. For example, in the voluntary sector in Paisley there is the street stuff project, which is run by Renfrewshire Council, the YMCA, St Mirren Football Club and McGill&#8217;s Buses. That project&#8212;which we have discussed previously in the Parliament&#8212;goes into areas where there are meant to be police hotspots and puts on street football, among a range of other things. The important thing is that the project works with young people in the area and gives them an opportunity to avoid misbehaviour by giving them something to do and somewhere to go. I have witnessed how getting the opportunity to participate in activities such as street football can make a difference to young people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>We need more work like that. In my area, the project has brought antisocial behaviour by young people down to 25 per cent. A lot of it has been about talking to and working with young people and doing good old-fashioned youth work. As our national provider, YouthLink Scotland has played quite an important role in that.</p><p>As the national agency for youth work, YouthLink Scotland has the role of supporting the youth work sector and playing its part in young people&#8217;s rights and wellbeing. The vision of YLS is to have a youth work sector that can help young people to become successful learners, confident individuals and effective contributors. That is one of the most important aspects of the project that I mentioned&#8212;the young people get the opportunity to design it and to ensure that it provides something that they want to do, instead of it being something that a bunch of older people such as ourselves thought that we would like to have done when we were younger.</p><p>Funding for YouthLink Scotland is obtained from an annual grant from the Scottish Government and through bids to other Government and charitable funding providers. In addition, YLS administers funding programmes such as cashback for communities and directs funds to local areas. This year, it has received funding of &#163;258,420 from the Big Lottery Fund. In the past year, YLS has managed to increase its geographic reach and its ability to deliver programmes throughout Scotland.</p><p>I will give some key examples of work that YouthLink Scotland has been involved in. Girlguiding Scotland has developed a range of initiatives in relation to young women and mental health and wellbeing. The Scotland Yard Adventure Centre is an Edinburgh-based centre that is accessed by more than 1,500 children and young people with a range of additional support needs every year. It provides care, support, fun and friendship for all the young people involved.</p><p>There is also the Prince&#8217;s Trust Scotland young ambassadors programme, which empowers young people actively to work in the Prince&#8217;s Trust, engage with public decision making and inspire other young people. Such projects are extremely important. When we talk about young people not engaging in the political process, my answer is always that it is up to us to make ourselves relevant to young people and to make sure that they want to get involved. However, such programmes give them an opportunity and show what civic Scotland can do and what they can do to help and represent it.</p><p>One of the high-profile projects in which YouthLink Scotland has been involved nationally is the no knives, better lives education and engagement programme. I have seen how that has worked locally. It is not that every debate that I have goes back to Paisley or to St Mirren FC but, on this occasion, it is relevant. Working as part of the street stuff programme, St Mirren played a major part in the no knives, better lives campaign with YouthLink Scotland and many of the local student associations in Paisley. Because of the pull of St Mirren being a partner organisation, the campaign has been able to attract young people from diverse backgrounds.</p><p>When we are dealing with young people in general, we must think about credibility. YouthLink Scotland does that. We must ensure that we have something to which they can relate and which they want to be a part of. We must remember that all the time.</p><p>The Education Scotland report says a lot of good things about YouthLink Scotland. It concluded that the national agency for youth work is making a real difference in young people&#8217;s lives in Scotland. It praised YouthLink Scotland&#8217;s consistency, strong leadership and direction within and beyond the sector, which resulted in a high level of successful engagement with national and local government.</p><p>The report also put across how YouthLink has been able to strengthen its position, being the national agency in Scotland, putting it in a unique position. It is the only organisation that represents the needs, views and aspirations of youth work organisations at a national level in the whole United Kingdom.</p><p>The highlights of the Education Scotland report are that there has been considerable improvement in YouthLink Scotland since the previous review in 2007; staff morale is high and has improved considerably; and the organisation</p><p>&#8220;delivers on an increasing number of Government priorities in relation to young people.&#8221;</p><p>The idea of having a national organisation is to deliver great ideas nationally. When we debate youth work in Scotland, many MSPs get up and talk about programmes that are specific to their local areas. I mentioned street stuff in Renfrewshire and someone else will mention something that has happened in Edinburgh. However, the good thing about YouthLink Scotland is that it should be able to engage in all of that, tap into it and ensure that approaches that work in one area can be used in others as well. That is the benefit of having a national agency.</p><p>I congratulate YouthLink Scotland on all the good work that it has done and wish it further success in the future as it works in all of our communities with our children and young people.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22798561", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: YouthLink Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate comes on the back of Education Scotland&#8217;s very positive inspection report on YouthLink Scotland.

As the convener, Stewart Maxwell, rightly said, it is powerful when a young person in his 20s tells the committee as a witness that he and his brother should have been taken into care a lot sooner. As I have said before and I will say again, that brings a reality to the debate and the issues that we are discussing.</p><p>Many children&#8217;s charities engaged in the process and they mentioned some of the difficulties. One of those, which has been mentioned by Jayne Baxter and other members, is to do with consistency and the fact that local authorities have different guidelines on how to proceed. For example, Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland said that it is</p><p>&#8220;concerned that there is not always consistency in the focus given to the rights of the child.&#8221;</p><p>It continued:</p><p>&#8220;We have witnessed some local authorities becoming too optimistic about the outcomes of maintaining the child in the family setting, at the expense of the needs of the child.&#8221;</p><p>That point also came across strongly when we spoke to young people. Like that young man I mentioned, when they explained their experience, they agreed that, at the time they probably wanted to stay with their family but, in retrospect, they saw that being taken into care made a difference to their life. I am not saying that that applies to every child, but the Scottish Government&#8217;s ideal of early intervention and a preventative approach is the way forward.</p><p>We have to consider some of the things that young people told the committee. A perfect example was another person in his mid-20s who also had a younger brother, who was a teenager. When we saw the two of them, the older brother felt guilty about the fact that he had not been there to support and look after his family and deal with the issues.</p><p>The younger brother had been taken into care earlier and he was, to use a local parochialism, quite gallus about the whole situation. That was a perfect example of how to make things work, given the difference between the two brothers. The younger sibling dealt with the situation a lot better because he was taken into care a lot quicker; the older sibling felt guilty and took it upon himself to deal with the situation.</p><p>I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment to improving outcomes for children and young people. The GIRFEC principles in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill can make a difference. If we use those principles and they are legislated for at local authority level, that might ensure that in future young men like the older brother we met do not feel the way that he did. I am glad that he was able to open up to us, because it made it obvious to us how he felt and what a difference his situation had made to his life.</p><p>Another issue that came up was the fact that social work professionals are often promoted and taken away from the front line or leave to go into other roles with children&#8217;s charities or other projects. They are still doing good work, but their expertise is taken away from the front-line jobs that we really need people of their experience to do. The Scottish Government and local authorities have to work together to ensure that we retain such staff, because we cannot afford to lose that expertise.</p><p>In my days in the motor industry we used to say, &#8220;You never promote your best salesman, or salesperson; you always ensure that they are out there doing the job.&#8221; It should be almost the same in social work. We must have a way to ensure that good social workers stay at the front line in the profession and continue to do good work. We must give them the support that they need as well.</p><p>I mentioned early intervention and prevention. For me, the important aspect of the bill is that there is scope for early intervention and prevention. I said last week that I had been at the Polmont young offenders institution to find out about the Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland outside in project, which has made a big difference to the young people there. Many of them were there because they had come from broken homes, were in care and a violent situation had inevitably arisen at some point. When we started talking about things and discussing their issues, they thought that what is in the bill could have made a difference, not to every child, but to some of them. That is the way to go, because if we are to get it right for every child in Scotland and ensure that Scotland is the best place in the world to grow up, we have to make sure that everyone gets an opportunity, regardless of their background.</p><p>I agree with Jayne Baxter that there has to be a change of national attitude when it comes to looked-after children. We have to get away from the idea that they are other people&#8217;s problems. It is almost like the corporate parenting thing again; we are the ones who have to take on the responsibility.</p><p>We must also think differently. The Government needs to work in partnership with local authorities and find solutions to the problems and challenges that we face.</p><p>I welcome a lot of the work that we have done. One of the things that I really liked about the inquiry was meeting the young people who have gone through the system; listening to their evidence made it real. I hope that, having listened to it, we will move forward and make things better for children in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate comes on the back of the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s extensive inquiry into decision making on whether to take young children into care.

I often hear stories from my mother and father about where they were at the time.</p><p>Why would someone of my generation be inspired by the legacy of John F Kennedy? His Administration was indeed glamorous and it was different. It was younger. Kennedy was the first person to hold office in the White House to have been born in the 20th century. Much has been said about the Camelot legend, too. Kennedy&#8217;s Administration actually believed that it could change the world. With that youthfulness came an ideal of trying to change the world and make it a better place.</p><p>Tavish Scott is quite right: his words are extremely important. These are the things that inspire us. I saw one quote earlier today:</p><p>&#8220;The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things that never were.&#8221;</p><p>Nowadays, we would also say &#8220;and women&#8221;. When we hear that as a young man or woman, it inspires us, especially if we are a politician, to want to be involved in the process and to try and change the world. Who in my generation would not have been interested? Who would not have wanted to get involved in all that and to see what it was all about? Was it the glamour? Yes, there was glamour involved. The important part, however, is what Kennedy said and many of the things that he did.</p><p>When I define myself and my politics, I think about another quote:</p><p>&#8220;Economic growth without social progress lets the great majority of people remain in poverty, while a privileged few reap the benefits of rising abundance.&#8221;</p><p>Those are relevant words for debates that we have in this chamber here and now. President Kennedy said that in the 1960s.</p><p>In my constituency office, my constituency manager, David McCartney, loves Bobby Kennedy&#8212;that is his hero. He sees Bobby as the one he would aspire to be like.</p><p>A constituent came up to me and my wife Stacey after the election and said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the first lady of Paisley.&#8221; She was thinking about Jackie Kennedy, not any other first lady whose husband was in office after that.</p><p>In referring to some of the things that John F Kennedy did during his short time in office, people have mentioned the Cuban missile crisis, when the world was on the brink. I have a personal or constituency connection there. Ken McGinley, a campaigning nuclear veteran, was on Christmas Island&#8212;he was one of the soldiers who was experimented on by the British Army. He wrote to Mrs Kennedy after that. He was inspired when John F Kennedy had the nuclear test ban brought in a year after the Cuban missile crisis. Ken McGinley wrote because of that and he got a letter and a picture back from Mrs Kennedy, which said that she thanked him for his support and everything else. Those are the things that make a difference to people&#8217;s lives. There is a man who is now in the later years of his life and he is still talking about it&#8212;that remains a major part of what he did.</p><p>Kennedy was a man of change. He believed in changing things. During his time in power, women in the federal Government were paid the same amount of money as men. That was radical in the 1960s. In some places, that is quite radical now in the private sector. That was something that the Kennedy Administration pushed for. Another thing in the 1960s was that only 0.0035 per cent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a Government body, were African American&#8212;and they were nearly all chauffeurs. The Kennedy Administration tried to ensure that that part of the population of America could get that opportunity&#8212;that they could aspire to be members of the FBI or get involved in other things.</p><p>Kennedy&#8217;s death came as a great shock to everyone. We only had to look through the Andy Warhol exhibition that we had in the Parliament to see how much of an effect it had on him.</p><p>How can we sum up Kennedy&#8217;s legacy? Oliver Stone&#8217;s &#8220;Nixon&#8221; movie has a line where Nixon looks at a picture of Kennedy on the wall. This probably never actually happened, but he says that Kennedy reminds people of</p><p>&#8220;what they want to be&#8221;,</p><p>whereas he reminds them of</p><p>&#8220;who they really are.&#8221;</p><p>That was the difference. Whether he was good, bad or indifferent, because of the difference in the legacy of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, he inspires us to be what we want to be and to achieve everything that we can.

I met a lot of young people who were in that secure unit because of various things that had happened in their life. Barnardo&#8217;s had a programme to help educate younger people in the system. We talked about the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill and when the young people explained some of the things that had happened in their lives, they started to come round to the idea that the provisions in the bill might have been a way&#8212;although not in every case&#8212;to help them not get into the position of being in a secure unit.</p><p>That is the most important thing that we have to take from this. We live in challenging times and young people have challenging lives. We have to look at that and do what we can for those people.</p><p>When I was on that visit, I had instant credibility. One of my constituents was there and when I told him that I came from Seedhill in Paisley, he said to one of his colleagues, &#8220;George is one of us, so we can listen to him.&#8221;</p><p>The whole point of the bill is to put children and young people at the centre of decision making, empower them and give them opportunities.</p><p>Much has been said about the UNCRC but my view is that its principles actually inform GIRFEC. Indeed, the great work that has been done in Highland Council has clearly made a difference. When we took evidence on that project, we heard that, in many cases, problems arose when parents did not have a named person; once they understood what the named person did, they wanted to engage with them. With my constituency in mind, I certainly see how that approach can work in areas of deprivation and areas where there are various challenges.</p><p>We are here to get something that deals with the various issues. We can of course discuss at stages 2 and 3 how we might further develop the legislation, and I am glad that the Labour Party has decided to work with us and move things forward. As the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning made clear at question time, this Parliament is at its best when, as in last night&#8217;s debate, it looks at how problems might be dealt with and solved and when members do not simply play the political game. The exciting thing about this bill is that it gives us an opportunity to make a difference in every young person&#8217;s life. That is not hyperbole or exaggeration; if we get this right, we can ensure that young men and women do not end up in places such as Polmont or in care.</p><p>I know from my time as a councillor in Renfrewshire that issues can arise when young people in care become adults and move out into adult life. Of course, going out into the big bad world is challenging for those of us with the best of lives&#8212;after all, the world is not an easy place to live in&#8212;but while I was at Renfrewshire Council we worked with one of the local housing associations to provide housing to these young people and support them in that respect. However, as a social housing provider, the council found that within two or so years of giving a young person the keys to their new home it was trying to evict them from it. We have to find a way of looking after these young people, and there are other ways of doing that than through legislation. We can, for example, work with other partners and organisations to offer support.</p><p>Today is about the vision; it is about the idea that we can make Scotland the best place for young people to grow up in. As long as we all work together and stay focused, we can make that difference.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We often talk about wanting Scotland to be the best place in the world to grow up in.

I want to bring about change, to make a difference and to make people&#8217;s lives better. That is why I support independence.</p><p>I believe in having a vision. Vision has been lacking in the speeches of Opposition members. Where is their vision? What is their idea for tackling head on the challenges that we face? Why do they not want us to take on more responsibility and see what we can do? Any daring to hope for a better future has been glaringly absent from their speeches. Is it wrong to work towards making the country better? Is it wrong to offer people in our communities something that can make a difference, instead of having academic debates, as Labour members continue to have in Westminster, when they can be bothered to turn up to vote? We need to do something that will make a difference to real people in the real world. Everything that I talk about relates to the people I represent. Members should believe that that is the way we have to go.</p><p>Like Jamie Hepburn, my motivation is to make a better life for our children and our nation. When I look at my own children, apart from feeling old I realise how much I want for them. I want them to have the ambition to be everything that they can be. I want them to look to the future without the Scottish cringe, and I want them to believe that they can achieve anything that they want to achieve. That is what I want.</p><p>I think that some Opposition members should start to feel more confident about themselves. We can all do that. It is a question of having the confidence to take on the powers of independence and to have meaningful debates in Parliament. I do not want to have debates such as the one that we are having now, in which members at opposite ends of the chamber are arguing about whether we should be part of a union that is well past its sell-by date, or part of new dynamic Scotland. I want us to debate what we are going to do. We need the powers of independence. The sooner Opposition members think that way and start to have discussions along those lines, the sooner we will be able to move our nation forward. That is what the public want. They want us to discuss Scotland&#8217;s future and to move things forward, rather than to sit here having academic debates.</p><p>What is the cost of Westminster? The cost to us of Westminster is more austerity: 76 per cent of Scottish MPs voted against further austerity cuts in the Finance Bill in 2010, but those cuts were imposed anyway. That is the cost of the union. The real-terms cut in the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget of 11 per cent over five years and the cut of 26 per cent in capital expenditure are what the union offers Scotland. It does not offer us ambition, nor does it offer us the future that we all want for our children and the children of others. What it offers us is Trident on the Clyde, at a cost of &#163;163&#160;million per year, which alone could pay for 4,500 teachers, 1,500 consultants, 33 primary schools, seven secondary schools&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22742673", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not on the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, but I commend it for its hard work on the bill.

It is an issue that people have had complaints about in the past, and this is a good way to ensure that we address that.

What he raises is more a procurement issue than an issue about the person-centred approach that we are debating today. This debate is about the individual and about making sure that we can deliver the approach that they want. I suggest that he brings his issue up at a later date when we talk about procurement.</p><p>In talking about person-centred healthcare, members will not be surprised if I mention multiple sclerosis, because everyone will be aware that my wife Stacey has MS. In Scotland, the incidence of MS per head of population is greater than it is anywhere else in the world. This year the Multiple Sclerosis Society published the report, &#8220;A lottery of treatment and care&#8212;MS services across the UK&#8221;, which we discussed in the chamber during MS awareness week. The report showed that there are things in Scotland that we are particularly good at, but also things that we still need to work on.</p><p>The positive thing is that after the debate, the Multiple Sclerosis Society wanted to work with us to create a cross-party group on MS for the first time in Parliament&#8217;s history, so that it could work with the Parliament, the Government and everyone else to see what we could do to make things better. We do not want to come along with a list of complaints every MS awareness week, but instead to work with the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and people in the medical profession to make a difference, so that we are not just shouting from the sidelines but are taking an active approach. MS is a condition that is specific to the individual. Every patient is individual. A person-centred policy is perfect for someone who suffers with MS, because, as the minister said, it means that we are dealing with the person, rather than the condition. We have to make sure that we listen to the individual and not just look at their diagnosis or condition.</p><p>Regardless of the conditions, there are so many things that we can do. Keeping people healthy within their communities is really quite important. Earlier in the year, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and eventually died. During that period we considered giving her the opportunity to be at home&#8212;at one stage it was to be for a year or two years. Her plan was to make sure that she was with her family and within the community in order to make things better. Things did not work out for us, because her health got worse during that period. That is where the person-centred approach comes in. Of course, in that situation we have to consider the family and make sure that patients are with their families and in their communities at those difficult times. It is not just financially prudent; it is the right thing for us to do.</p><p>As a number of people have said, we face challenges with regard to our ageing population. The integration of health and social care for adults will help with that. Siobhan McMahon mentioned situations where there was not joined-up communication when an elderly person was coming out of hospital to return home, which meant that care was not available. The integration of health and social care will give us the opportunity to make sure that we can provide a complete rounded service for people and their families. There have been times in the past when we as politicians have had to intervene. That should never happen. Things should never get to that stage; it should always be part of the service.</p><p>The Scottish Government has protected health budgets. I was listening to some of the things that Mr Findlay said, and what he described is not the NHS that I recognise; it is not the NHS that is out there. The way he talked about some workers in the NHS in Scotland was negative. My wife has MS&#8212;a long-term condition. Other people who are genuinely engaged with the NHS on a regular basis do not recognise Mr Findlay&#8217;s belief about what the NHS is. The Scottish Government is to be commended for making investment in the NHS a priority.

The Scottish Government says that it wants Scotland to be the best place in the world to grow up in, which is a bold and ambitious statement. However, as the minister correctly said, we should never shy away from being ambitious about our children, because we must ensure that we can build everything that we can for them as they are our future.</p><p>After listening to Jayne Baxter&#8217;s speech, I think that her family is similar to mine. She said that her grandchildren go and play and learn to fight, which is similar to my family&#8217;s get-togethers at times. How many times have our children come in with a grazed knee or having fallen out with someone? However, that is all part of growing up; it is about learning life skills and what the big, bad world is all about. Playing helps young children to move on in their lives.</p><p>Some people might say that I have never lost my ability to play, and that might be confirmed by one look at my office in the Parliament or my constituency office, which some constituents have said looks like a 13-year-old boy&#8217;s bedroom. I add that it is all football stuff, in case anyone thinks anything else. What George Bernard Shaw said might not be true of me.</p><p>The action plan sets out how we can deliver on Scotland&#8217;s first play strategy, which was published in June and is the most progressive of its kind in the UK. The first of the three principles behind the strategy is that we should value all children and young people, and the tone of this debate shows that members throughout the chamber do that.</p><p>The second principle is that we should enable all children and young people to realise their right to play. The minister mentioned signs saying &#8220;No ball games&#8221;. I remember seeing those when I was younger, but we did not think that it was a rule; we kept playing until someone came out and chased us. Now, people in society are not quite as tolerant as they were in the past. Politicians, be they local councillors or elected members here in the Parliament, get people complaining about young people playing in some of the open spaces that we have. We seriously need to address the issue, because we have to ensure that children and young people have opportunities to express themselves, and part of that is having the time and space to play.</p><p>I have grown quite tall as the years have gone on, but the world seemed an awful lot bigger when I used to play in the Gleniffer braes on the long summer days. We know we are getting old when we start talking about such things in our childhoods, but that is the kind of thing that I want for young people now. I want them, when they are older, to remember their childhood in that way as well, because that is what makes the difference.</p><p>The action plan is structured around four domains. The first is the home, and the plan states that homes should be</p><p>&#8220;places where children ... enjoy plentiful play opportunities&#8221;.</p><p>Some of the points that were made earlier are quite correct. When I was younger it was the case that, at family get-togethers, we all played together as a family, whether it was the board games at Christmas, when we would all fall out and the fighting would start again, or other games. When we look at the success of the Nintendo Wii, we see that all that it did was to modernise the whole thing. It meant that maw, paw and the weans could play together around the computer and engage together in a game that they were all interested in.</p><p>In our family, it was a question of who was the bigger kid, because my father was incorrigible. We used to play with a balloon in the room&#8212;with the whole family playing. It was like before association football rules, when everybody just kept running about. My mum always worried about the crystal in the living room. These are the things that we remember as we get older. They develop us and make us closer to our families.</p><p>We have to ensure that there are high-quality play opportunities at nursery schools, and that there is outdoor free play as well. We may not have the weather for that, but there have to be opportunities for everyone to access nature and see what is out there in the world. As has already been said, young people now tend to spend more time in their homes using computers and the internet. Let us not Google nature; let us go out there and see what is happening in the real world.</p><p>There also has to be sufficient space for play in the community. Much has been said about that so far. It is up to local authorities to ensure that that space is available. When I was a councillor, we decided that we would find a way to find money for play areas. I was the chair of the local area committee in Paisley south, and we set aside moneys to make sure that we could get over the cross-generational boundaries and reclaim our parks. We invested in multi-use play areas. Not all the money came from the council, as we managed to find money from various other sources as well.</p><p>We ensured that we spent money, and eventually we renovated some of the tennis courts. If we had not done that, they would have gone. As Liz Smith said, it is important to ensure that people of all ages can play sports, but the political will has to exist locally. There were times when I thought that it was an impossible task, but we just have to say that we can find the money for that investment and push towards getting it. Other members who were councillors will probably speak in the debate, and they will probably tell their stories as well. It is a case of actually going out there to make sure that we give young people space.</p><p>Another thing that we spoke about then was teaching kids to play some of the older, traditional games that we all played when we were younger. We now have that in one of our parks, and the kids love it. Play is something that crosses the generations.</p><p>We have to be bold and ambitious, but we also have to remember our inner child when we make decisions. We have to make sure that, as well as talking about play in the chamber, we try our best to engage across the parties to deliver as well.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this debate and the Government&#8217;s play strategy action plan.

He came to the committee yesterday and was excited about the named person. He said that it was an important part of the GIRFEC approach. He said that the council does not get complaints about the named person role being implemented; it gets complaints from parents who believe that it has not been. Those are individuals, parents and families that have seen the approach working and that it can make a difference.</p><p>The approach was implemented by Highland Council in 2010 and has been a great success. It means that there is now a clear process to ensure that information about the child is passed to the right person. Some of the other members said that they felt as if information would go back and forward and no one would know about it, but the named person would be the conduit for all the concerns. Previously, concerns were often referred to the wrong agencies, resulting in the children&#8217;s hearings system being swamped with inappropriate referrals, but that is now less of an issue.

As Margaret McCulloch said, we have moved very far on such matters through the work that has been done since the publication of the 2000 strategy. The event showcased a very powerful drama about someone with learning disabilities living in the community, which will tour schools in Renfrewshire to get the message out. It showed how a 24-year-old man had difficulties with dealing with autism, and with the fact that some people were not quite so understanding about his learning disabilities. The drama was powerful and the ending was happier because the mechanisms were in place for that individual to get out of the difficulty they were in.</p><p>As I watched the play, I wondered whether the ending would have been the same before 2000 and the strategies that we have put in place since then. Would those mechanisms have been available for that individual? I think that it would probably have been difficult for him. &#8220;The same as you?&#8221; started everything off in 2000 and the strategy was successful in shifting the balance of care to support more people to live in their communities. That is exactly what the play discussed.</p><p>It is important that we encourage local authorities to review their day care centres. As a councillor, I had to go through the difficult process of reviewing day care centres and look at providing a new model because some individuals prefer a form of day centre care. In the Mirin at the Lagoon leisure centre in Paisley, we now have a modern and different facility, but the individuals involved at the time and their parents did not want to move because they were comfortable where they were. However, things have moved on and worked out. Although it is not easy, sometimes politicians have to make the decision to look at new ways of delivering services. That was an example of making progress by identifying the needs of individuals and seeing how we could make things better for them.</p><p>The flexibility that I like was mentioned by the minister when he talked about the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013. That gives the individual the flexibility to be, live and work within their community and run their life on their own instead of people telling them how they should be receiving support. They, or their family members working with them, are the ones who decide and can tell everyone exactly what they are looking for. That is an extremely important part of this debate. We can sit here and talk about what we think is best, but we have to engage with the families and people who have learning disabilities themselves.</p><p>Mention has been made of the unfair Westminster welfare reforms that will affect some families who will have great difficulty in dealing with things like the bedroom tax, although the Scottish Government has given &#163;20&#160;million to support them. However, we have to look at ways in which we can continue to support such families.

That can be an extremely difficult time for members of families as well.</p><p>In Renfrewshire, we are served by two hospices&#8212;the Accord hospice in Paisley and St Vincent&#8217;s hospice in Johnstone&#8212;both of which offer care and support for families at times of death. The support that they offer is fantastic. As a politician, I talk about palliative care, the Accord hospice and the work that it does, and I regularly congratulate it, but when people go through that hospice, they see it for what it really is.</p><p>When my mum was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year&#8212;she died in August&#8212;the Accord hospice was absolutely incredible. She got the opportunity to be there and was lucky to be there. When the hospice discussed palliative care with her at the early stages of her diagnosis, she panicked. She had a taboo as the individual who was dealing with it, and she would not have the conversation with us. I spent hours talking to her, as other family members have done with their families. I said, &#8220;No. This is about getting you home and making sure you can have palliative care in the home.&#8221; That was the original plan, but things moved on and things got worse.</p><p>I agree with the report&#8217;s four recommendations. I would have agreed with it beforehand, but things are reinforced when you go through such an experience yourself. Patients with life-threatening illnesses should take every opportunity to raise and plan their future care according to their own wishes, but we have to get over the taboo. We must get the idea over to people that family members and individuals should be able to talk to one other about that. The matter is difficult for all of us to deal with, and the taboo is still there.</p><p>I know that the Government has the good life, good death, good grief initiative. We need to ensure that more people know about that initiative so that, when other families are in that type of position, they do not have to go through the same difficulties. We have to ensure that all such families get the opportunity to say that there is something more, because someone could give up at that stage and think that palliative care means that they are heading straight for a hospice. It is clear that that is not the case in many situations.</p><p>I will talk again about my personal care. I want to take the opportunity to say how the Accord hospice in Paisley was fantastic with my mother. The palliative care is simply incredible. When families are moved there, there can be quite a shock. People go full circle with their family: they go from their mother feeding and looking after them to their doing the same for her. Families are asked whether they want to do that, and it can be awkward. They do not want to say no, but they feel awkward because they want to look after their mother or father in their last days.</p><p>I thank Nanette Milne for bringing this debate to the Parliament and for giving me an opportunity to talk about the issue.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Palliative Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Nanette Milne for bringing this debate to the Parliament and Marie Curie Cancer Care for the report that has been provided entitled &#8220;How good is primary care at identifying patients who need palliative care?&#8221; I welcome that report and what it brings to the debate, because palliative care offers support to patients and their families at a time when they really need it.

I speak as the co-convener, along with James Kelly, of the cross-party group on fair trade, which single-handedly secured Fairtrade nation status for Scotland&#8212;we decided that we would take the full credit after all the meetings that we convened during that year when we were working towards gaining Fairtrade nation status.</p><p>Nine out of 10 people in Scotland are now aware of fair trade. That is quite incredible, given that even 10 years ago walking into a store and being able to buy fair trade coffee was next to impossible. People had to go to a church-based store or a specialist store such as the Rainbow Turtle shop in Paisley, which has been going for 10 years. The Rainbow Turtle used to be the only shop that stocked all fair trade goods&#8212;in fact, it stocks quite a lot of stuff that goes into my constituency office.</p><p>Another point to remember is that, although people are aware of the Fairtrade brand, it is not just a brand, like a brand of soap powder or something else, but something that can make a difference to people&#8217;s lives. Fairtrade nation status is a declaration of intent: it says that we want to live in a world where we can make a difference to other people&#8212;we need to remember that. It is great that people know what the brand is, but we cannot finish just at Fairtrade nation status.</p><p>I remember that, way back when I was a councillor on Renfrewshire Council, Liz Cotton of Paisley&#8217;s Rainbow Turtle shop was concerned that we would not move any further once we had achieved Fairtrade county status for Renfrewshire. Since that day, I have remembered that point. Getting the plaque or sign is not the destination; the reason why we want to achieve it is to make a difference in the lives of the people we are talking about.</p><p>As the minister will be aware, this year and last year we had some people over from a Malawi co-operative that makes rice. Their produce is not technically Fairtrade as it has not been given the Fairtrade brand&#8212;that is another debate, because it is actually quite expensive for people to go through that process&#8212;but the way in which the co-operative works together makes a big difference in their community. At our meeting with those people, both the minister and I were shocked that, when they talked about something as simple as mechanisation, they were talking about basically getting oxen to help with the field&#8212;they were not talking about some state-of-the-art equipment. One of the gentlemen, who had seen some abandoned farming equipment when they drove through Scotland, said that they would use such equipment in a second. To them, that would have made an unbelievable difference to their lifestyle and to what they were trying to achieve.</p><p>In today&#8217;s debate, we need to remember that although things have gone really well, this is only the beginning. We need to keep moving. As I said, Fairtrade nation status is a declaration of intent and a statement of the values that we have as a nation&#8212;we want to work with fellow nations in the world to make a difference. Young people get involved in such campaigns because they can see that they make a difference. There is not the cynicism involved in other types of politics; young people know that they can work hard to make a difference, and their idealism is attracted to that.</p><p>Some of us have probably got a wee bit cynical as we have got older and the years have gone on, but I want to hold on to that part of my idealism. I want to think that Scotland can stand on its own and be important for fair trade.</p><p>As I said, achieving Fairtrade nation status is not the end and the campaign continues.

I understand how difficult it can be to talk about something that is so hugely personal. Normally, when I am in this room discussing these things, I am talking about Stacey and multiple sclerosis. It is hard for us to talk about such subjects, as we are aware of everything that goes on, and we feel the pressure to deliver on behalf of the organisation that we are highlighting.</p><p>My first run-in with MND was when I was a child and my gran&#8217;s sister deteriorated quite quickly. I did not understand how this woman, who used to work in the mill in Paisley, could no longer speak&#8212;how, all of a sudden, she just could not function any more.</p><p>People have always motivated me in my politics. I am aware of and understand Christina McKelvie&#8217;s family involvement with MND. Working to support families in Paisley has been a major part of my life. Eileen Clark, the mother of a good friend of mine, Councillor Lorraine Cameron in Renfrewshire Council, was diagnosed with MND when I was on the council, too. I saw her change from a bright woman, who was involved in the community, to a person who was dying&#8212;it is, effectively, a death sentence.</p><p>I spoke to Lorraine Cameron today and asked whether she would mind if I spoke about her experience. She said, &#8220;No, George. I want people to know about it.&#8221; I also made a joke involving the mental health problems that Lorraine had during that period, because of the strain and pressure that she was under. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not tell them about the time you went aff yer heid,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;No, tell them. That&#8217;s an important part of it. The families feel the strain. I don&#8217;t know anyone in MND Renfrewshire who isn&#8217;t on antidepressants&#8212;they are the family members who are dealing with the situation.&#8221; Lorraine told me about the times when she would sit there at night and listen to her mother breathing in the next room. Had she stopped breathing? Was she okay? People deal with that for years, knowing what the outcome will be.</p><p>As Christina McKelvie said, according to MND Scotland, a person&#8217;s life expectancy from diagnosis is about 14 months. That is 14 months for families to watch their loved one deteriorate at an alarming rate in front of them and be unable to do anything. On top of that, families have to get their loved one&#8217;s housing situation sorted out and arrange any adaptations. By its very nature, the disease is difficult for local authorities and Government organisations to assess. A person can be okay at one point, then deteriorate so much that their house is adapted for them, and then it is too late.</p><p>In addition, there are the benefit reforms, which will be a dramatic change. In &#8220;Time to benefit people with MND&#8221;, MND Scotland has done an excellent piece of work, in which it raises issues that we take for granted. I agree with MND Scotland when it says that</p><p>&#8220;the last months of a person&#8217;s life should be spent in the loving care and support of their family&#8221;.</p><p>That is how it should be. People should not be worrying about assessments and whether they can get DLA or PIP, as it is now.</p><p>Christina McKelvie could not mention PIP, so I will go on about it. From October, anyone who receives a diagnosis of MND will be assessed for PIP. Those who currently receive DLA and report a change to their illness will be reassessed. Under PIP, due to the loss of a lower rate of benefit, many people in the early stages of their illness will lose out financially. As Christina McKelvie mentioned, people will have the financial burden as well as their illness. They will feel as if they are a burden on the family. Eileen Clark felt the same way. She got to the stage at which she felt that she was holding her family back.</p><p>I stress that we are literally dealing with people&#8217;s lives and with families. The last thing that people need is worry about going through assessments for various benefits. We need to show some humanity and ask the Westminster Government to think again on the issue.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693503", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: MND Scotland Welfare Reform Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christina McKelvie for bringing this debate to the chamber.

I would find out that that was not what happened or what caused the situation. As Linda Fabiani has said&#8212;I paraphrase her when I say this&#8212;those young people are not bad people; they have just had bad luck in life. They need the support that we can offer to help them move on.</p><p>Mary Fee mentioned Yvette Hutcheson&#8217;s account. Some of the things that she said were quite interesting:</p><p>&#8220;If there is a family breakdown&#8212;especially if it is caused by addiction or mental health issues&#8212;the young person cannot really speak to anyone about it, so they take it on their shoulders and a bad situation just becomes worse until they end up in the system.</p><p>Some people might have moved out and managed to get their own tenancy and a flat, but they do not have the knowledge to keep it.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 29 November 2011; c 128.]</p><p>That small extract alone articulates the problems and issues that we are dealing with. For too long we have had a situation in which social landlords have flung a set of keys at vulnerable young adults and said, &#8220;There you go. There&#8217;s the key for your new tenancy. You&#8217;re now a tenant in a house. Away you go.&#8221; They then wonder why two or three years later there are problems with antisocial behaviour and rent arrears.</p><p>Linda Fabiani was quite right when she mentioned the young man from Motherwell who said, &#8220;They gave me a house but they didnae tell me how to work it.&#8221; To me, that sums up many of the cases that I had to deal with over the years.</p><p>The tenancies that young people are offered by the social landlord are normally in areas where nobody else really wants to live. They are in areas where the local authority or the social landlord cannot get rid of the stock as it is. It becomes a never-ending circle and an on-going problem. The young people are trying to do their best, but at the same time they are having to deal with the council to get repairs done. They are all things that are brand new to those young people. I like to believe that I had a reasonably steady childhood, but I have to say that when I was 16 or 17 I would have had difficulties dealing with that kind of situation.</p><p>As has been mentioned, people often end up going to the private sector, paying private rents. That makes things even more difficult, as there might be unscrupulous landlords who do not give their tenants the support that they need, and the rents can be phenomenally high. Support is definitely needed.</p><p>I am aware that Renfrewshire Council and a local housing association in Paisley are building supported accommodation in the south end of the town. That development is receiving funding from the Scottish Government, and it is welcome. That shows that we can support young people through housing. It is not just a case of throwing a set of keys at a young person and saying to them, &#8220;That&#8217;s you. You&#8217;ve got your own house now.&#8221;</p><p>We must consider education, ensuring that not just young people from difficult backgrounds but all young people understand what it is like to have financial responsibility. I have a 19-year-old daughter, and financial responsibility is not one of the things that come to mind when I think about her. I will probably get a phone call on Friday because she has worked out when pay day is. That shows how she has been able to deal with situations.</p><p>Education Scotland has provided a range of teaching support material for financial education, which the minister outlined in responding to the committee. We have to take the requirement seriously, and we must ensure that we provide the support.</p><p>Mention has been made of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. The Scottish Government is seeking to strengthen the legislation on throughcare and aftercare to ensure that vulnerable children are prepared and supported in relation to their transition. As I have said, it is not just those who come from a more challenging background; anyone of that age has to deal with the responsibilities of life, and it can be difficult.</p><p>As Linda Fabiani and others have said, welfare reform will have a massive effect on the situation. There are 165,000 one-bedroom properties in the social rented sector in Scotland, and only 20,000 will be available in the next year. Alex Johnstone said that we should consider whether the housing stock is suitable for the demand. That is not the issue, however. For years, councils have ensured that people wanting two-bedroom or three-bedroom houses get them. I remember that, during my time at Renfrewshire Council, we got rid of some one-bedroom houses because they were not what the sector wanted&#8212;two or three-bedroom houses were wanted.</p><p>Westminster&#8217;s welfare cuts are showing themselves again. It is the tale of two Governments: one that wants to do something for the people it represents, and one that does not.</p><p>We must support young people so that they can thrive in their new homes and so that they are no longer just an ever-changing statistic, moving from one set of stats to another&#8212;for example, a looked-after young person going into their own house might later end up being thrown out of their home. We have to deal with such situations appropriately, as the committee report has set out.</p><p>As Richard Lyle says, we can take it from the debate that we all agree that we should take responsibility in doing all that we can do for young people in Scotland and in giving them the opportunity that they need. For someone to have a roof over their head is one of the most fundamental things in their life, and we should all strive to support young people in that respect.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Having and Keeping a Home"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome this debate, and I thank the Equal Opportunities Committee for the work that it has done on the matter.

We have to ensure that we debate in such a way that people want to put their crosses down, whatever part of the democratic process they are in.</p><p>I thank the committee for its work. The idea of votes for 16 and 17-year-olds has been part of my political life since I was 16. Unlike Richard Lyle, that was not in 1966&#8212;it was quite a while after that. I will not say when it was because I would embarrass the Deputy First Minister: there is just a year&#8217;s difference in our ages, so that would not be polite. She has obviously done a lot better over the years&#8212;she did not have the hard paper round that I had.</p><p>I remember how I felt during those two years between 16 and 18&#8212;I can just about remember that far back. At that age, someone is an adult but is not thought responsible enough to vote. I was involved in the political process but I never had the opportunity to make a decision on the future of my own community or on anything in the country. I was politically active but, at the same time, politically powerless.</p><p>Some of the debates that we had then were probably very similar to the debates that we are having now. During that period, it was not Trident on the Clyde, but Polaris on the Clyde&#8212;I am showing my age now&#8212;and people were talking about the replacement for Polaris. A similar debate is still going on. Instead of the bedroom tax, we had the poll tax. That shows that Westminster does not change&#8212;there is no difference. We are still having these debates, and lots of young people are involved and want to discuss and vote on the issues because they want to see what can happen in the future.</p><p>We have difficulty engaging the public in political processes partly because by the time that some people get to a certain age, they become very cynical about politics as they have not seen any progress. For me, independence offers all of us in the chamber the opportunity to show what we can do and to talk about Scotland. We ask for an opportunity to tackle child poverty&#8212;another issue that we discussed way back then&#8212;and to ensure that we do not get dragged into illegal wars.</p><p>Young people have opinions on all those issues and it is important that 16 and 17-year-olds get the franchise and the opportunity to be involved in the ambitious new Scotland that we all want. All this has been brought about by the Scottish Government negotiating with the Westminster Government. Incidentally, I look forward to the Scottish Government continuing to negotiate over the next couple of years and to the Deputy First Minister continuing her good work on that&#8212;that is what we have to do to ensure that we get the Scotland that we are all looking for.</p><p>I turn to some of the groups that have told the committee what they want. As has been said, Robin Parker of NUS Scotland is extremely positive about the fact that the Scottish Government and the Westminster Government have agreed that we should extend the franchise for the referendum. The Scottish Youth Parliament has campaigned for votes for 16-year-olds for more than a decade. Those people desperately want to ensure that everyone can be involved in the debate.</p><p>I am pleased that the cabinet secretary said that the electoral roll will be dealt with in such a way as to ensure that 16 and 17-year-olds are treated with respect. My colleague Linda Fabiani asked about the electoral roll, and it is important to ensure that access to the register of young voters will be strictly limited, as has been said. We have to ensure that people who will be 15 years old when they register are protected.</p><p>The Educational Institute of Scotland has strongly supported extending the franchise for all future elections to 16 and 17-year-olds, and I agree with it. As I said, we have to ensure that we enthuse young people when they first start to get involved in the political process so that they remain involved and continue to take an active part in public life in Scotland.</p><p>As members know, the long-standing policy position of Unite, which is my union, is to allow young people to vote at 16.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with John Pentland that we have to inspire young people to vote.

They will also be aware that my wife Stacey has MS, and I welcome everyone to what is effectively her debate. If I think for one minute that the debate has anything to do with me, I am surely kidding myself on, because, like a lot of people, I did not know much about multiple sclerosis until I knew Stacey and we were married. There are quite a lot of things about the condition that a lot of people do not know.</p><p>Stacey is here today with her mum and dad. Incidentally, her dad is 75 years old today&#8212;[Applause.] Part of his birthday present was to work for me as a volunteer in the office for the past couple of days, and he is currently the oldest intern in the Parliament.</p><p>Stacey&#8217;s family is one of many who are dealing with this indiscriminate disease. Stacey was diagnosed at 16 years old. I said earlier that people can misunderstand MS, and Stacey&#8217;s family is a perfect example of that. Tom, Stacey&#8217;s dad, just told me this story last night. Stacey&#8217;s mum, Rosemary, was a nurse&#8212;a health professional&#8212;when she was working and she understood what MS was. When Tom went to see the consultant, Rosemary asked him to ask specifically about multiple sclerosis. He came back that night and said, &#8220;Yes, Rosemary, you&#8217;re correct. It&#8217;s multiple sclerosis.&#8221; Tom had no idea what MS entailed or what it was&#8212;he just gave Rosemary the message. Rosemary, who is a very strong woman, broke into tears and started hugging Tom. From then on, Tom knew exactly what they had ahead of them.</p><p>Lots of people misunderstand MS, which can be very difficult for people with the disease. There are various versions of it: benign, relapsing and remitting, secondary progressive and progressive. Stacey has gone from having relapsing and remitting MS to secondary progressive.</p><p>MS makes a difference to people&#8217;s lives, and their families. Most people who are diagnosed with MS are between the ages of 20 and 40, at the peak of their life and a time when they are looking to the future, thinking about their careers and thinking about family. Being diagnosed with such a devastating, complex condition can really change the course of someone&#8217;s life and what they want to do. However, I have always found that the people with MS whom I have met do not mope and say, &#8220;Woe is me,&#8221; or complain about their situation. They all seem to be very positive. They say, &#8220;Yes, I have this incurable condition, but I will grab life and make the most of it.&#8221;</p><p>When I first met Stacey, one of the reasons why I was attracted to her was her sheer lust for life&#8212;members thought that I was going to say &#8220;for me&#8221; there, did they not? [Laughter.] Her sheer lust for life was the main reason that I found her so attractive; she lived every day as if it were her last.</p><p>MS is an incurable condition. It is the result of damage to the myelin&#8212;the protective sheath that surrounds the nerve fibres of the central nervous system&#8212;which interferes with messages between the brain and the body.</p><p>There are a couple of interesting women&#8217;s Facebook groups&#8212;more women than men get MS&#8212;with names almost about those women&#8217;s sisterhood. I will not mention them here, because that would probably not be polite in this company, but members should check them out at a later date.</p><p>The symptoms of MS can include intense pain, problems with mobility and co-ordination, severe depression, deadening fatigue, incontinence and loss of vision. No two people have the same type of MS; every person can have different symptoms.</p><p>The statistics are difficult for anyone to comprehend. Scotland is among the countries with the highest prevalence of MS in the world. An estimated 10,500 people with MS live in Scotland, but MS does not just affect the individual. As I have mentioned, it affects their family, friends and colleagues, so the actual figure of people affected by MS in Scotland is more than 63,000&#8212;only 10,000 fewer than the population of the great historic town of Paisley.</p><p>Members: Oh!</p><p>It is quite a lot of people.</p><p>There is some dark humour around MS and there are some funny stories about how people deal with it. People can have a positive outlook. Not long after Stacey was diagnosed, before the family built their extension, Stacey and her mum fell down the stairs and landed on top of each other. Instead of lying there in a heap, crying, they just looked at each other and started laughing, because it was such a bizarre situation for the two of them to be in.</p><p>Stacey once left for high school for a higher exam, wearing a patch on her eye because she had double vision, and wanting to be independent and do it on her own. Her mum watched from the highest point in the house to try to see her get to school and be sure that she was okay, while remembering that she was a young, independent woman who wanted to live her own life.</p><p>Two weeks after we got married, Stacey turned round to me and said, &#8220;George, I&#8217;ve got double vision. I&#8217;m seeing two of you.&#8221; How lucky can a girl get? During the first 10 years of our marriage, because of Stacey&#8217;s short-term memory loss, I won every argument. I said, &#8220;I told you that. That&#8217;s what I said.&#8221; These are some of the things that happen. In Liam McArthur&#8217;s MS debate, I mentioned a rather personal way in which the condition affects Stacey. I think that I got away with it, although other people may say otherwise. I will not go down that route now.</p><p>In October, the MS Society conducted the &#8220;My MS, My Needs&#8221; survey, which went out to 10,000 members throughout the United Kingdom. Some of the figures that were reported from that survey were interesting. Fifty-three per cent of respondents had been offered the opportunity to attend a self-management course in Scotland&#8212;that is one of the questions on which we scored highest. However, a quarter of people said that they could not see their neurologist when they needed to, only 9 per cent of people who wanted to be involved in clinical trials had been given that opportunity and only 36 per cent were eligible to take medicines that alter the course of MS.</p><p>Those are the facts and figures, but below them are the kind of stories that I have been talking about, involving real people&#8217;s real lives and real issues. We must look at the challenges that will come up in the next couple of years. Welfare reform will have a massive effect on people with MS because people do not understand that the symptoms are different for everyone and because there is a lack of understanding and belief regarding the condition and a lack of expertise in its assessment. There is also the fluctuation of multiple sclerosis in individuals. We are talking about a disease that can change not just from week to week or from month to month, but from hour to hour. That is one of the big things about MS.</p><p>Positive work is going on out there. Revive MS Support, which is based in Maryhill, in Glasgow, is doing some great outreach work in Paisley, Cathcart, Hamilton and Douglas. I absolutely love the work that it does because it works with individuals, talking to them about how they are dealing with their MS. A lot of the time, some tea and sympathy make a big difference to people who are dealing with the condition on an on-going basis.</p><p>I will stop at this point, Presiding Officer. You have been more than kind with the time that you have given me.</p><p>We must remember the real families behind the statistics&#8212;real people dealing with real issues. Working with the public sector, charitable organisations and health professionals, we can start to make things better for those who are dealing with the challenges of multiple sclerosis.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690004", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis Week 2013"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members will be aware of my involvement with the Multiple Sclerosis Society; I am a member of the Paisley and district branch.

I admit that I have a bit of emotional baggage when it comes to that issue: it is very close to my heart. I am a member of the Paisley and district branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland and know many of the individuals who will be affected by the so-called reforms.</p><p>As members will be aware, MS is the most common disabling neurological condition that affects young adults. More than 10,500 people in Scotland have it. The majority of people who are diagnosed with MS are between the ages of 20 and 40, so the targeted changes to welfare will be felt almost exclusively by people of working age. People with MS in Scotland are already concerned about their ability to make ends meet, and many will face losing substantial amounts of benefit under the welfare reforms.</p><p>The changes to the disability living allowance are, of course, what the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland fears most. The Welfare Reform Committee&#8217;s report states that 55,000 individuals will be affected by those changes, with an estimated loss to the economy of &#163;165 million per annum. The report states that, in my county of Renfrewshire, 2,100 people will be affected, with a loss to the economy will be &#163;6 million a year.</p><p>MS is a condition that can fluctuate. It is different in different individuals. That is part of the concern when it comes to the disability living allowance and the potential PIP changes. As a result of the condition&#8217;s fluctuations, people can be okay one week and have difficulty the next. Many of the so-called independent experts involved do not understand such long-term conditions. PIPs will be assessed very soon, with the key changes designed to focus on those with the greatest needs. A new, objective, points-based assessment will be brought in that is likely to involve a face-to-face meeting with an independent healthcare professional. Again, the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland has concerns that those individuals may not have the expertise to deal with such situations.</p><p>More than 7,000 people with MS in Scotland currently receive disability living allowance, and every single one of them will be affected. People with MS rely on those benefits to manage a wide range of costs, including those for aids and adaptations, and to pay for care and support.</p><p>At this stage, I want to let members hear some of the voices of people with MS, because some interesting facts will come out of that.</p><p>One person said:</p><p>&#8220;For a person like me, DLA means the difference between surviving and living. It&#8217;s the difference between having a life and not having a life.&#8221;</p><p>That is quite a strong statement in itself.</p><p>Another person said:</p><p>&#8220;DLA is spent on ready meals, pre-chopped vegetables and fruit and salad, sandwiches, hair and nail appointments&#8221;</p><p>and &#8220;waxing&#8221;. That sounds like a benefit is being used for something that it should not be used for, but that individual with MS states:</p><p>&#8220;I can no longer dry my hair, cut my nails or shave my legs, I wish I could&#8221;.</p><p>That individual has stated that she cannot do those things and that she needs the benefit money to get them done.</p><p>Another individual said:</p><p>&#8220;My needs change not just weekly or daily but often hourly. DLA gives me the freedom to pay for help as and when I need it, in a much more cost efficient, flexible and responsive way.&#8221;</p><p>For every one of those individuals, the situation will get slowly but surely worse.</p><p>Losing one form of benefit can have far-reaching consequences. For example, one lady with MS knows that she could be moved on to a lower rate of mobility payment that will not only involve a reduction in her benefit but remove her right to a disabled parking badge, which will cause her difficulty in getting around in her daily life.</p><p>As I have said, the assessments fail to take into account the full range of barriers and costs that people with MS face, and they particularly fail to take into account properly the fluctuations in the condition. The current approach assesses whether individuals can undertake activities on the majority of days, but the position changes daily for the majority of people with MS. The criteria mean that those who can walk only slightly further than 20m, even using sticks, will not qualify for the enhanced rate of mobility payment, although the current distance criterion is 50m. Again, that will have an effect on someone with MS.</p><p>Those with MS are only one group among many that the welfare reforms will affect. The 7,000 people with MS who receive DLA and the 10,500 Scots and their families who are already dealing with MS are asking us what future we are looking for and what we can offer.

I will talk about the issues on which we should all agree. We should agree on the principles of the bill. Some members have mentioned that we agree on certain parts, so we should work towards making the bill everything that it possibly can be. We agree on more than we disagree on, so let us not let personal politics get in the way of progress.</p><p>For me, access to higher and further education is one of the main issues. The exciting provisions in the bill are those about ensuring that, regardless of financial or social background, young people in Scotland have the opportunity to be all that they can be. To illustrate that, I will tell a short story about my grandparents, who worked in a cotton mill in Ferguslie Park in Paisley all their lives, which was not unusual for people from Paisley. I use them as an example of how things have changed and why we must adapt and work differently in the FE and HE sectors today, which is the important point.</p><p>When my dad eventually came along and went to school in Ferguslie, in what was junior modern secondary in those days, like many of his generation he was deemed at a very young age to be not clever enough to have a more complex formal education. When he was 15, he left school and was told by my gran to get himself a trade. He was lucky that, at that time, there were opportunities in the town, educationally and through apprenticeships with companies. He managed to get an apprenticeship with a local engineering firm and trained as an armature winder. He served his time and was extremely happy in his work.</p><p>He met my mum and eventually my grandfather and mother persuaded him that he would probably be better off if he worked for himself. My grandfather, being a Paisley man who was clever and shrewd when it came to money, had stashed away quite a bit. That was the fork in the road that changed my family&#8217;s future and changed their life. It was my father&#8217;s vocational training that made the difference and that made that opportunity available to him in the 1960s.</p><p>The reason for the story is that the cotton mills are no longer in Paisley and the place where my dad served his apprenticeship is now a private housing estate. That is why I support the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to further and higher education and why I feel that it and the bill are important. The bill supports the premise of providing education and vocational opportunities for all our young people in today&#8217;s competitive and challenging times. The world that we live in is literally a lifetime away from the world that I spoke of earlier. I support the bill because of what it will provide for my children&#8217;s future and for the current generation of young people who are trying to make their way in the world.</p><p>That is why, for me, widening access to higher education is the most important part of the bill and something that we must strive to achieve. It is one issue on which, allegedly, we all agree. It has been said in the Education and Culture Committee that we agree on that. However, the status quo is clearly not delivering wider access. Research that was published last year by the NUS in Scotland predicted that, at the current rate of progress, it will take 40 years to achieve a fair balance of rich and poor students at Scottish universities.</p><p>Robin Parker, the president of the NUS, told the Education and Culture Committee that &#8220;The legislation must happen.&#8221; He continued:</p><p>&#8220;There are examples of good practice on widening access; they just need to be stepped up and done on a wider scale. Every university needs to do more.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 19 February 2013; c 1985.]</p><p>In my area, the University of the West of Scotland, which I have used as an example on numerous occasions, has continued to do extremely well on access but, as Mr Findlay mentioned, we have to ensure that universities retain those students. Until now, progress on ensuring that more students from poorer backgrounds attend university has been slow. Participation among those from the most disadvantaged areas has increased by just 1 per cent in the past nine years, but some would lead us to believe that we do not need legislation to make a difference on that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687947", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is important that we ask what we want from the bill.

That shows us that, in the kind of Scotland that we want, we need to have people we can aspire to be like.</p><p>I welcome this debate and share the minister&#8217;s ambition for our children and young people. Who would disagree with the minister when she says that she wants Scotland to be the best place to grow up? Jamie Hepburn has already highlighted the importance of the issue. As parents, our children&#8217;s future is one of the most important things to us. When I make a decision as a corporate parent, I always think about the decision that I would make for my own child.</p><p>Our children give us many sleepless nights and difficulties&#8212;sorry, strike that; I mean challenges&#8212;over the years, and there are good days and bad days for every family. I have two children, James, who is 21, and Jessica, who is 19. One of our happier days will be this Sunday, at the Scottish communities league cup final, when we all go the national stadium to see St Mirren. However, in that stadium will be people from Paisley&#8217;s Ferguslie Park, which is one of the areas in Scotland with multiple deprivation and issues with child poverty.</p><p>We have been talking about child poverty for as long as I have been involved in politics. It is one of the things that I believe can be dealt with only with the full powers of independence. It has been debated for a long time. Although, as has been mentioned, child poverty levels have fallen substantially since devolution&#8212;they are at 17 per cent&#8212;we still need to do much more.</p><p>That can happen only with the powers of independence. Westminster is pushing through welfare reforms that will put 50,000 children in Scotland into poverty by 2020. The Scottish Government is trying to do things at one end, but the Westminster Government is making things even more difficult. For me, that is the difference.</p><p>The reduction in benefits will take away more than &#163;2.5 billion from Scottish households. That will have an effect not only on those families but on the economies of towns throughout Scotland. In my area, people are saying that welfare reform will make a big difference in the retail sector on the local high street.</p><p>Only the full responsibilities of independence will make a difference in relation to child poverty. The Scottish Government is working hard to ensure that Scotland is the best place in the world to grow up in but, as I said, Westminster hampers those efforts. Eight out of 10 Scottish members of the Westminster Parliament voted against the Government&#8217;s benefit cuts, but the Government went ahead with them anyway.</p><p>The Westminster democratic deficit is having an effect on all the young children in Scotland. The Scottish Government is taking forward the preventative spend agenda, and it is improving childcare provision throughout Scotland. Much more could be achieved if only Westminster&#8217;s disastrous welfare reforms did not keep hampering that progress.</p><p>Only last week, the Deputy First Minister said that our argument is that</p><p>&#8220;instead of looking to the Scottish Government just to soften the blow, we need a Scottish Government and a Parliament with the powers to stop the blows in the first place.&#8221;</p><p>Who would disagree with that? Who would disagree that we need those powers and responsibilities to make a difference?</p><p>We all know that the Scottish Government has proven on numerous occasions that it is more progressive than its Westminster counterpart. When we are looking at the Scotland that we want to build in the future for our children, therefore, the only way forward is with the powers of independence. Otherwise, we will be sitting here having the same debate in 20 years, talking about child poverty and asking what we are going to do about it. I, for one, am not going to be sitting here doing that, because I take my role as a corporate parent seriously.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s proposed children and young people bill will take the ambition to make Scotland the best place to grow up and make it real. The Scottish Government will legislate for a rise in early learning and childcare provision from 475 hours per year to a minimum of 600 hours per year. It will strengthen how we support children and put their rights at the heart of everything that we do. That is important in relation to empowering families and making sure that they see a benefit to the political process, with politicians who listen to them and give them opportunities to express themselves.</p><p>Parents are always extremely ambitious for their children. I am ambitious about what my children can achieve and I am also ambitious about what this Scottish Government can do for the children of Scotland. Every time we make a decision in this chamber, we must remember the families in areas such as Ferguslie Park in Paisley&#8212;families that we represent. We have to make sure that we make their life choices and their life chances a lot better in the future.</p><p>Independence is the only option if young people in Scotland are to have the future that we all want them to have. We all agree on many of the issues. How we get there&#8212;how we create the Scotland that we want&#8212;seems to be the main difference. The only way to do it that I can see is through independence.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is ironic that I find myself speaking after Dennis Robertson because, when he was at the Royal Blind School yesterday, he met a young man from Renfrewshire, Harrison Lovett, who sees Dennis as a role model&#8212;a hero, if you will.

The subject is too important for us not to treat it with such respect.</p><p>I welcome the proposed bill, given the need for the integration of health and social care. I believe that a society is judged on how it cares for, helps and supports its older people, the vulnerable and those with long-term conditions. The bill focuses on that.</p><p>I appreciate the cabinet secretary&#8217;s explanation of the lengths to which the Scottish Government has gone regarding engagement with health and social care professionals and users, given that we must get the bill on this important issue correct first time.</p><p>The changing shape of Scotland&#8217;s society, with an ageing population, is a challenge that we have all had to face for a number of years. When I was a member of the scrutiny board on Renfrewshire Council, one of the first things that we discussed was the challenge of demographic change and how we could deliver services. I know that other local authorities have looked at that as well.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary quite rightly said, many councils and other organisations are working together towards the joint goal of ensuring that they can deliver for people in our communities.</p><p>The most important part of the bill is the focus on improving outcomes for families and carers in our community. At the end of the day, we are dealing with people&#8217;s lives. As elected members, we have all heard stories of situations in which the system has not worked. We have to make sure that the system is seamless.</p><p>The cabinet secretary is correct that public agencies and organisations must share the challenge, work together and move away from silos in their management ideas. I have experienced that in relation to my wife with her long-term conditions and in relation to constituents who have had difficulties accessing the services that they need.</p><p>During my time in local government, I developed a great belief in the work that social workers do in our communities. As a councillor, I saw what social workers did, particularly with older people, but also with the other groups that they deal with.</p><p>One of the stories that I was involved with simply involved an older man who was, in effect, going home to die. He and his wife were both in their 80s. We could not get the care package in place to get the elderly gentleman home and his wife was extremely worried about that. It took a phone call from me to the social work services to get that done. For me, that is the difference with social work at a local level. As an elected member, I can contact the council&#8217;s social work department and get something done, whereas it can be rather difficult to get the health boards to do something similar. If I asked the local health board, things would be even more difficult.</p><p>One in 12 people uses social work services at some point in their life. The social work departments in our councils protect children and support people with mental health issues, addictions and learning disabilities. Let us not forget the role of social work departments and their accountability to local communities. The successes of the services that social care staff offer and their commitment in working in very challenging situations must be recognised. Many social care staff are driven to help and work beyond the call of duty to protect and care for vulnerable people in our communities. Integration must take all that into account. Front-line staff will be the key to making integrated services a practical reality and it is the skilled staff in health and social care who will deliver the results that we all want.</p><p>Leadership and management will be needed. Effective, robust and innovative leadership at all levels will be central to the success of the transformation programme. In particular, it will be crucial to have a clear focus on putting leadership by social workers, care professionals and clinicians at the heart of all integrated health service delivery.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, we must move away from organisational silos, but we must retain the services that work. I welcome the idea that the bill will deliver outcomes for the individual, the family or the client. The local delivery of integration is extremely important, and ensuring that there is accountability is equally important&#8212;a jointly accountable officer will help that. Obviously, they will work with the health board and social work services in local councils and bridge the gap between the health board and the local authority. NHS and social care staff have to deliver the integration, and we must ensure that they buy in and work with us on that, and that we use all their talents.</p><p>Change is not new to people in local government and social work. Social work services have operated in an integrated manner across the range of needs in our communities, and integration has been a particular strength for Scottish social services over the past 40 years. We need to tap into the practical professionalism and expertise that exist. The integration of health and social care is a radical new way of working for our health and social care professionals, but we need to ensure that the expertise of local social work departments and health experts across Scotland is not forgotten. As the cabinet secretary said, many partner organisations are working in that way already. We must ensure that they continue to work in that way.</p><p>Let us hope, as Iain Gray has said, that we do not come back here in 20 years&#8217; time and have the same conversation.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adult Health and Social Care (Integration)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this debate and the serious, constructive tone of the speeches so far.

I know that you have been involved with the MS Society Scotland for some time, Presiding Officer. I declare my interest; the subject affects me very personally.</p><p>Liam McArthur has framed the debate around Orkney, and I am aware of the situation there because of a documentary by Elizabeth Quigley a number of years ago, which discussed the fact that more of us seem to have MS in Scotland compared with anywhere else per head of population.</p><p>This is one of those issues on which I will talk from a personal point of view. MS is a strange condition and something that I did not know much about before I met Stacey. Like a lot of people, I had a misunderstanding of the condition. People get the idea that, as Liam McArthur said, sufferers end up in a wheelchair or not able to work. However, the opposite is true. Most of the people whom I have met are very motivated. I do not know whether the condition has made them that way, but they all seem very motivated. It is almost like the Frank Sinatra song &#8220;That&#8217;s Life&#8221;&#8212;they think, &#8220;I fall down, I get back up and I just keep moving on.&#8221; That is, literally, the way that a lot of people with MS deal with life. We do not know why we have such a high rate of MS here in Scotland.</p><p>I recently had a situation with my wife. Stacey will probably kill me for talking about personal stuff but, last week, we had that conversation when she said, &#8220;That&#8217;s me, George&#8212;it&#8217;s getting worse.&#8221; More or less, she was saying, &#8220;This is me checking out, George&#8212;time&#8217;s run out.&#8221; When we got married, she promised me that she would be gone by the time she was 30. I am now 44, and she is still hanging in there, but she was genuinely worried. For people with MS, their mood, the way they feel or not having the support of their family can mean that they end up feeling that way. I laugh it off and joke with her, and that way probably works for the two of us, but members will never have seen a woman so happy as she was when the doctor told her that her back pain and all the other problems were because of a urinary infection. She will be really pleased that that is now in the Official Report.</p><p>The first hustings that I went to during the election in 2011 was run by the MS Society in Paisley and district. There was a lot of pressure on me, because it was my first hustings, it was in Paisley and it was on MS&#8212;it was almost like a home game for me. However, one of the candidates took the pressure off when he announced to everyone that he was an economist and had absolutely no idea about multiple sclerosis and even less idea about how the national health service worked. Suffice it to say that that kind of helped me, and it might be one reason why I am standing here today. He had a total misunderstanding of multiple sclerosis. He did not understand the issues that people have to deal with or that the condition affects every sufferer differently.</p><p>One issue that the MS Society raised recently is about the serious problems that are coming its way because of welfare reform. A lot of people with MS can be okay one week and bad the next. The situation with disability living allowance, the personal independence payment and, in particular, the bedroom tax could lead to issues for some MS sufferers.</p><p>I received a letter from a constituent that I was told I had to read out. It states:</p><p>&#8220;I was diagnosed in 1989 (23 yrs ago) and no-one seemed to know anything.</p><p>I was at Uni and I thought it important to tell the campus GP, he called me a liar as I was too young.&#8221;</p><p>That person was Stacey Adam, now aged 40.

Paisley is, obviously, Scotland&#8217;s largest town. During the industrial period, the Clark and Coats families were cotton mill barons. They had a competition to see which family could build the most buildings, which was better and which could give more to the town. Many of their buildings are still standing. The Paisley town hall was, in fact, originally the Clark hall. The Clark family set up a competition to design a hall that they could give to the town. Renfrewshire Council&#8212;the previous Scottish National Party Administration of which I was a part&#8212;recently invested &#163;1.7 million to ensure that that building was upgraded slightly. More work still needs to be done in such buildings.</p><p>The Coats were staunch Baptists and they decided that they would build the largest Baptist church in Europe&#8212;they were millionaires and at that time everyone went to church. The Coats memorial church is still the largest Baptist church in Europe. However, the problem is that, as the legacy fund goes down and the Coats family are no longer part of Paisley, only six trustees are looking after that historic building. They can no longer afford building insurance and they have recently had some thefts, including the lead off the roof, which is something that happens throughout Scotland these days.</p><p>The church has about 30 parishioners, whose average age is between 60 and 65. They are talking about an exit strategy and what they should do with the building. There are many buildings throughout the country that are in that position. They are such an important part of our history and heritage. What will our discussion about that be?</p><p>Paisley abbey was built 850 years ago for Cluniac monks&#8212;it is the only Cluny abbey that is still in one piece. I had the pleasure of addressing the Cluny federation when it came to Paisley. Its members were speaking French and German; I was speaking Paisley. There may have been a slight translation problem. My good friend and colleague Derek Mackay decided that he would trump me by doing his presentation in French. That is an example of the competitive element that is always between us.</p><p>The town of Paisley was built around Paisley abbey&#8212;there would be no Paisley if that abbey had not been built there 850 years ago. Even the minister in the Church of Scotland has been asking what we should do and what the building&#8217;s future is. It is difficult for them to look at the abbey as a stand-alone place of worship. During my time as a councillor, the council used it for various conferences and other events because it is right next to the town hall.</p><p>We must look at old buildings and find new and different ways of using them. We should retain them as part of our heritage, but we should use them for things that they were not originally intended for. The problem is that the many members of the public who walk by such buildings every single day of their life never go in and see what happens in them, but they are the first to complain should anything happen to them.</p><p>We must, in a mature manner, have the debate on historic buildings and decide what we will do with our industrial heritage and our past.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684604", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Buildings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Chic Brodie for securing the debate and raising issues that relate to Seafield house.

This is about real people and real lives.</p><p>The SNP Government has consistently taken action to make full use of its limited powers over the economy to try to mitigate the impact of Westminster&#8217;s austerity agenda. Our continued commitment to the social wage will deliver benefits to everyone in Scotland. I am talking not just about the social wage but about people&#8217;s families&#8212;mums, dads and children. We are maintaining the council tax freeze, keeping higher education and prescriptions free, and supporting concessionary travel. Those are important issues to the public. They are issues that we should remember when we are having debates such as this, even given our limited powers and the attacks made by the dark cloud of Westminster.</p><p>There is a better way. The better way is independence. Opposition members can laugh all they like. If we have independence, we can make decisions here, in this Parliament. With the moneys available to us, we can make things better. On the back of what Mr Swinney has delivered over the past five or six years, we can see that the SNP offers the dynamic future that the unionist parties do not.</p><p>What is Labour&#8217;s future? It talks about its cuts commission and the something-for-nothing society. It does not want to talk about people and their lives and how we can make a difference. Where is the ambition? Where is the idealism? Where is Labour&#8217;s belief in the people of Scotland? It is no longer there. Labour&#8217;s cynicism has got so much that it is just a political game for Labour.</p><p>Much has been said about college numbers and education. Again, the SNP Government keeps delivering: 10,000 young people could benefit from support for jobs; the 2013-14 education and lifelong learning budget includes &#163;50 million for the early years change fund; there is continued investment to raise attainment through curriculum for excellence; and there is the delivery of 67 new or refurbished schools. The early years fund is giving families an opportunity to find out the support that they need in order for us to help them in future. Again, the Government is listening to the public as opposed to telling them what they should expect.</p><p>A number of comments have been made while the debate has been going on.

I went every Monday night to Glenburn, which was an area that the police had identified as a hotspot for antisocial behaviour. Much to the annoyance of my wife, I went every Monday night to see how the project worked.</p><p>Dealing with young people is not exactly rocket science&#8212;it has been done for decades by church groups, faith groups, the Boys Brigade, the cubs and scouts and the YMCA&#8212;but the big difference with this project is credibility. The coaches sit with their St Mirren tracksuits on talking to the young people. Those coaches may have the same sports qualification as a social worker or someone who works in education or leisure, but they have the credibility with the young people that others do not.</p><p>The first time I was at the project was quite interesting. A group of young men were drinking alcohol in the play park. They decided to come across and talk to us. Right away they said to me, &#8220;Big man,&#8221;&#8212;that seems to be the term that people used when speaking to me, not &#8220;Councillor&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;If I&#8217;d known this was here, I wouldnae have had a drink.&#8221; The gentleman who spoke to me was 14. At the time, I had just turned 40, so I turned to him and said, &#8220;I like a beer as well, but the difference is that I&#8217;m 40 and you&#8217;re 14.&#8221;</p><p>We need to move away from that situation. The football project made the boy engage. It took him and his friends away from antisocial behaviour and, on that evening, stopped them drinking. They came back week after week.</p><p>The work is challenging for the coaches because there have been various times when young people have turned up after taking drugs. Let us not kid ourselves: the social issues are still there, regardless of how good the scheme is. The coaches must deal with those social issues and the challenges that they present. The good thing about the project is that the coaches and the people who run the buses are trained to deal with young people in those scenarios. In some cases, they have got some of the young people to become volunteers, got them involved in the project and given them an opportunity to access a different way of enjoying themselves locally.</p><p>When the project was set up, it was basically a case of Derek Mackay, the then leader of Renfrewshire Council, banging a few heads together. The ideas were there; what was needed was to get everybody in the one room to discuss them. Arriva had talked about providing buses, and St Mirren wanted to do more work in the community. They were all talking about what they could do, but without talking to each other. The fact that they have got together has made such a difference&#8212;my council ward has seen a dramatic 25 per cent reduction in antisocial behaviour.</p><p>Mr Bibby is correct to say that the local area committees were the prime funders during that time. I was a chair of one of them. There was cross-party support&#8212;I assure members that that was radical for Renfrewshire, but everybody agreed and could see the progress that we were making.</p><p>Eddie Devine and I shared a council ward. Both of us were big St Mirren fans, and we saw the project as a way of getting a new generation of buddies involved in football. Stevie Gallacher, who runs the street football project for St Mirren, is a legend. He is brilliant with the children and young people, who love him. One thing that people involved in the street stuff programme constantly say to St Mirren is that they have won more silverware and more prizes than the premier league football team has. However, in Paisley, we believe that that can change and, come 17 March, St Mirren could have a trophy to go along with those of street stuff.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683848", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Street Stuff"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I also thank Annabel Goldie for bringing the debate to Parliament.

That is not likely, but when such a policy comes from another place, we have no ability to change it and we must accept it. That is the human cost of the union. We must remember that, when we have debates such as this. As I have said before, it is the women, children, fathers, daughters, mothers and families of Scotland whom we represent. We must ensure that we do it to the best of our ability.</p><p>Why not use the tax system to reduce the deficit that the unionist Governments created? Why not target those who have money and are deliberately avoiding tax, whether that is the rich or the multimillion pound companies that we hear about every week? The Tories seem to think that it is somehow more effective to create an administrative system that will reduce child benefit for a family of two by &#163;1,100 a year and remove a family from child benefit if one member of the family earns &#163;50,000, but to keep paying out to families that earn &#163;98,000.

What we do and the decisions that we make affect people and their families.</p><p>Today, I was at Jimmy McIntosh&#8217;s funeral in Paisley. He was a 90-year-old lifelong St Mirren man who ran supporters clubs for decades. He was a Paisley man to the core. Generations of St Mirren fans, Paisley people and members of his family attended the funeral. The place was a sea of black and white&#8212;the colours of St Mirren. During that highly emotional funeral, it occurred to me why we are involved in politics. All the people whom I saw today entrust us with their futures and the futures of their families. That is why I agree with Angela Constance that we must all&#8212;local councillors, Opposition members, members of the Government and SNP back benchers&#8212;play our part in tackling youth unemployment.</p><p>I also agree with Angela Constance that we must ensure that young people retain hope and ambition for the future, because they are, indeed, our greatest asset. I lived through the 1980s as a young man&#8212;I know that it does not show and that members will all be extremely surprised to hear that&#8212;and I experienced the devastation that was caused by the Thatcher Westminster Government. That is the cardinal difference between the position that Scotland is in now and the position that it was in then.</p><p>Scotland needs more powers; we need the levers and powers of independence, because there is only so much that we can do for Scotland and our future with the limited powers of devolution. When I looked at the people at the funeral, I realised that that is why I am involved in politics; that is what motivates me to come here every day to argue on behalf of the people of Paisley and the people of Scotland in general. We must stay focused and grounded.</p><p>If we look at the Government&#8217;s plans for the future, we find a number of measures that will make a difference to many of the people whom we represent. College reform will ensure that the FE sector better suits the needs of our young people, focuses on jobs and careers and provides high-quality futures for generations of young people. That is what the business sector wants, and that it is exactly what it said when the Education and Culture Committee discussed the issue. It wants young people to be able to work in the sector and to be all that they can be without intervention.</p><p>At local level, the previous SNP administration in Renfrewshire invested in our young people&#8212;it invested &#163;2.5&#160;million to create 800 to 1,000 jobs for 16 to 24-year-olds in Renfrewshire. That included a six-figure sum from Angela Constance&#8217;s department. I agree with the minister that we must all take responsibility for tackling youth unemployment and delivering for our people. That is why the Scottish Government will not adopt the heartless approach that previous Westminster Governments have taken to youth employment.</p><p>I mentioned that, for me, politics is about people&#8212;representing their needs and protecting their futures. Scotland needs the full levers and powers of independence if we are to deliver all that for our country. The Scottish Government has shown its continued support for our young people, and I back it in that endeavour. The issue is too important for us to play petty politics with and constantly to hit each other over the head with a metaphorical hammer. We must ensure that we get things right for our young people, because we do not want to go down the route that was taken by previous Administrations at Westminster.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681238", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I ask Mr Macintosh to let me move on.

He repaired the electric motors in generators and was a proud tradesman who had learned his trade on a very practical level. He eventually became self-employed, then employed people who came from more academic and scientific engineering backgrounds and was able to open up to other markets and compete in the sector by taking their advice. He tried to get his son to be an engineer, but that did not go quite so well because I found out that there was a connection with physics, which was never a strong subject of mine. I also managed to burn out one of the electric motors in his coil-winding machine when we were working an all-nighter during an emergency so&#8212;obviously&#8212;he gave me the keys to the van and I became a salesperson for him instead.</p><p>My dad might well be looking down and laughing at my attempt to debate science and engineering advice, but one thing that he told me was that Scotland&#8217;s record on scientific innovation is among the best in the world. A report that was compiled in 2009 confirms that Scotland&#8217;s research is cited by other researchers around the world more often than research from any other country, relative to gross domestic product. I mention that because Labour&#8217;s amendment states that it will make a difference if there is a constitutional question on independence, but I believe that Scotland&#8217;s record in science throughout the world would probably just continue nonetheless. That report found that Scotland was first in terms of citations relative to gross domestic product, second in terms of the impact of its research as measured by citations and fourth in terms of the impact of the most highly cited papers in the area.</p><p>New research by the Institute of Physics that was published in October shows that the contribution of physics-based business to the economy has gone up by &#163;1&#160;billion to &#163;8.5&#160;billion since 2005. The sector contributes 9.8 per cent gross value added to the economy, in comparison with the total UK average of 8.5 per cent. Professor Sir Peter Knight said:</p><p>&#8220;Physics drives the economy of Scotland, and Scotland leads the UK: physics-based businesses contribute a greater share of the economy of Scotland than their counterparts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Now is the time to build on this advantage.&#8221;</p><p>It just comes down Scotland&#8217;s endeavours in science and engineering being highly regarded throughout the world.</p><p>Labour also mentioned the potential for women to be employed in the sciences. The science and engineering education advisory group&#8217;s report was published in February this year, and following that, the Scottish Government launched the careerwise Scotland initiative at the first women&#8217;s employment summit, which was held in September this year. That initiative will encourage young women to consider careers in science and engineering.</p><p>There is also a three-year commitment to Government funding of Scottish science education research, with ring-fenced funding for new work with primary teachers; there is three-year funding for Scottish science centres and festivals, as the cabinet secretary said; and there is continued development of Education Scotland&#8217;s STEM support.</p><p>Although Scotland leads the world in the sector&#8212;we would like to continue to do so&#8212;I want to take members to the centre of the universe. Back in Paisley, the school of science at the University of the West of Scotland&#8217;s environmental initiatives research group is tackling waste and pollution management, climate change and human health. There is also mathematics and statistics research there. The university&#8217;s research covers all areas from pure mathematics to applied mathematics, and it has a molecular and health sciences research group and a sport, health and exercise research group. All that goes to prove that much is happening&#8212;even within one university in Scotland.</p><p>As Mr Findlay did, other members will, no doubt, talk about famous scientists. Although he was not a scientist, Mr David Stow created the science of teacher training. He was from Paisley and went to Paisley grammar school. He began in 1811 to work with the Port-Eglinton Spinning Company and he published his first book, &#8220;Teacher Training&#8221;, in 1828. He is remembered to this day through the name of Stow College in Glasgow, at Kelvingrove museum, and through Stow Street in Paisley&#8212;which, incidentally, is quite close to my parliamentary office.</p><p>John Witherspoon was not a scientist; he was a preacher who went to America. He signed the declaration of independence and became the president of Princeton University. At a time when things were difficult for the new American colonies, he set up one of the greatest places of learning in the world. That just goes to show that the Americans did not have a problem with the idea of independence, but were always looking outward to see what they could do. Scotland will be the same, come independence.</p><p>It is important to encourage all our young people to take up science subjects. I have mentioned some of the issues around that today. We need also to ensure that they retain their passion for it throughout their careers. Paisley and&#8212;yes; I admit it&#8212;the whole of Scotland, have given the world so much in this field and we must ensure that we continue to provide the world with more Scottish scientific and engineering breakthroughs.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of Science in Public Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My dad was an armature winder and engineer.

I believe that the proposals before us are the right way to go and are a way in which we can get things right.</p><p>It has already been mentioned that the days of a one-size-fits-all careers service are over and that the heart of the new careers service is the view that the individual is the most important factor. The claim that the new careers service does not meet the needs of young people is unfounded, and the new approach that was rolled out in September is progressing well.</p><p>As I said, the days of a one-size-fits-all careers service are over. Like Mr Findlay, I remember standing in the careers office&#8212;it was in the historic town of Paisley a long time ago, probably before Mr Findlay had his meeting&#8212;and having my 10-minute interview with the guidance teacher. At that time, saying that I wanted to be an astronaut was probably a wee bit ambitious and caused the teacher to lose interest, but I was a rather headstrong and stroppy teenager. I see that Mr Stevenson is nodding in agreement&#8212;he remembers me from then.</p><p>Three years ago, a strong-willed young woman from Paisley&#8212;Jessica Adam, my daughter&#8212;went into the careers service and she, too, had difficulty engaging with the service and ensuring that she could move things forward. Luckily, things worked out for Jessica, but that shows us how important this subject is.</p><p>Much has been said about the traffic-light system. It is important that we do not leave anyone behind, regardless of their background. It is naive to say that everyone should follow the same path through the system, because there are people from difficult backgrounds who, if we do not catch them through the curriculum for excellence, will end up not having the fulfilled career that they deserve.</p><p>Careers guidance is now much more tailored to the needs of the individual. Any young person&#8212;I repeat, any young person&#8212;who wants a face-to-face appointment with a careers guidance professional can get one. In Scotland, we are fortunate that we have professional careers information and advice guidance staff. However, given how young people interact with the world these days, using a web page is a lot easier for a lot them than a face-to-face meeting&#8212;between their phones and the web, many of them can get access to absolutely anything in that way. We have to ensure that we go down that route.</p><p>As has been said with regard to the traffic-light system, some young people need extra-intensive support. The system provides an opportunity for that to be delivered to those who need it. That is the most important thing. Most of us in the chamber agree that we want to do what is best for Scotland&#8217;s young people and ensure that they have fulfilled lives, but I think that we have to agree on making systems such as this one work. That is important.</p><p>The fact is that the service needs to be tailored to individuals. As the minister said, the workplace has changed dramatically over the past few years, and flexibility needs to be part of the service. The system needs to ensure that all Scotland&#8217;s people have an opportunity&#8212;I almost said &#8220;opporchancity&#8221;, which is like something from Francie and Josie&#8212;to access a universal careers service. Integrated into the curriculum for excellence, that can and will make a dramatic difference.</p><p>Let us put the scare tactics away and have a mature, open debate. Young people are falling through the net. As has been said, any young person who wants an appointment with a careers adviser can get one. At the Education and Culture Committee, SDS&#8217;s Malcolm Barron said:</p><p>&#8220;The group is not fixed.

It will produce the high-quality courses that we need. That must be the primary aim, but there are other benefits: duplication will be reduced and merged colleges will be able to concentrate more on strengthening the courses that they offer and tackling drop-out rates. Duplication within relatively local areas will be removed. Each region will be able to offer the best courses that are available, reflecting local need. Support for regionalisation is widespread in the college sector. In a recent meeting, Audrey Cumberford of Reid Kerr College suggested to me that regionalisation was the only way to go and that it was the way forward for her college.</p><p>The facts speak for themselves. In the coming financial year, further investment will be available to support our students and to protect those who attend colleges. That record is impressive when it is compared with that of the previous Administration, which in its two terms provided 39 per cent less in cash terms. The Westminster Tories and their friends are to cut investment in further education by &#163;1.1 billion.</p><p>It is important that we protect student numbers in FE. In 2013-14, there will be provision for more than 116,000 FTE students&#8212;the same number as in 2011-12 and 2012-13. We must look strategically at how the regions are organised and at the employment requirements of each region.

That people in the industry are taking such action must have worrying consequences for us in Scotland.</p><p>Another major problem that affects Glasgow airport is that APD has a greater effect on low-cost airlines because their business model means that APD makes up a greater proportion of their fares. That is another way in which Glasgow airport suffers at the hands of Westminster. Let me give an example. EasyJet is a major user of Glasgow airport and a major part of its business. It recently sponsored the Renfrewshire Chamber of Commerce annual business awards&#8212;the ROCCOs&#8212;and it wants to be involved in the local economy. It was also represented at the recent cross-party group meeting. We must ensure that we do not get into a situation in which such companies struggle because of APD. However, such a possibility does not stop Westminster. Oh no&#8212;Scotland suffers, but Westminster continues with APD.</p><p>Despite Westminster&#8217;s continued disregard for Scottish tourism, the sector continues to grow. It is an important sector for Scotland that we must build on. Tourism employs 200,000 people in 15,000 businesses in Scotland. Scotland took around 22.3 per cent of the UK&#8217;s total tourism spend in 2011, although it has only 8.4 per cent of the UK&#8217;s population. When we go out and sell Scotland abroad, we must ensure that we make it easier not only for companies to come to Scotland but for people to come here and see us, despite the obvious economic challenges that exist not just in Scotland but all over the world.</p><p>Mr Baker and Mr Rennie said that APD on its own is not the be-all and end-all, and I agree with that. For me, the issue is about our having full power over the economic levers and a basket of economic solutions. The devolution to Northern Ireland of APD for long-haul flights shows what can be done with increased financial responsibility. What could we do with more powers? As Brian Adam quite rightly asked, will we have business leaders coming to this Parliament to demand that we have full economic powers in Scotland? That is not as daft an idea as it sounds, because they keep asking for more economic powers for the Scottish Government for its proposals for Scottish business.</p><p>PO, our airports are an important part of Scotland&#8217;s economy, not only as gateways to other destinations but as employers that work in our communities to ensure that they give something back. We need the Scottish Parliament to have powers over APD because we need to ensure that the aviation industry in Scotland thrives. This is another example of why Scotland&#8217;s Parliament needs the full range of economic levers to support our economy, because some chancellor in Westminster has no interest in investing in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677319", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The industry representative to whom I referred was looking at ways in which to grow his business and ensure that the economy of places such as Paisley could grow.

The Scottish Government will continue to offer education to everyone, no matter their financial background; it is providing opportunities for all, not just for those who can afford them, which is what is happening down south.

We must remember that fact when we engage in debates on these matters and discuss the issues in the media. The issue is complex and, if it were easy to fix, we would have fixed it a long time ago and would not still be trying to find ways to sort things out.</p><p>In May 2008, the Parliament agreed that Scotland&#8217;s national drugs strategy, the road to recovery, was the way forward and took the right approach to supporting individuals into sustained recovery from problem drug use. The fact that the Scottish Government is investing &#163;28.6 million in frontline drug treatment and recovery services in 2012-13, which is an increase of 20 per cent, is to be welcomed.</p><p>The executive summary of the document that contains the strategy says:</p><p>&#8220;Central to the strategy is a new approach to tackling problem drug use based firmly on the concept of recovery. Recovery is a process through which an individual is enabled to move-on from their problem drug use towards a drug-free life and become an active and contributing member of society.&#8221;</p><p>For me, that is the most important issue in this debate.</p><p>In April 2012, the Scottish Government, along with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the NHS, issued alcohol and drug planning and reporting guidance in order to ensure that things could work at a local level and that people could feed issues into local single outcome agreements, because what might work in certain areas might not work in other areas. There will be scope for local involvement in that way.</p><p>I have heard complaints from constituents about methadone users in pharmacies&#8212;I have even complained about them myself, as my wife has a long-term condition, through no fault of her own, and has been getting medication from pharmacies. When I mentioned the complaints to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, it invited me to a new pharmacy in Paisley&#8212;the Abbey Chemist pharmacy&#8212;where I was told how the issue is being dealt with in a more modern, thoughtful way, so that all the customers are looked after in a professional manner. During my visit, I met a constituent who was on the methadone programme. He was happy to see me&#8212;quite rightly, as he had a number of complaints about things that were happening in the area. That made it real, to return to Willie Rennie&#8217;s point. When you meet the people who are involved in this issue, you do not see just the stigma or the fact that they are drug users; you see them as human beings, and that makes a difference.</p><p>One of the store managers with whom I visited various pharmacies that day was surprised that one of the pharmacies had a treatment room. She assumed that it would be a room for treating people&#8217;s nails or some other cosmetic purpose. The owner of the pharmacy had to explain what it was for and said that one of the biggest complaints from users of the pharmacy was about people taking methadone.</p><p>The Royal Pharmaceutical Society&#8217;s briefing says:</p><p>&#8220;Treatment with methadone is not a cure for addiction but as an oral treatment it reduces the harm associated with the use of illegal drugs and can help to stabilise drug misusers and promote recovery.&#8221;</p><p>For me, that has to be the most important issue and the way forward.</p><p>When I speak in the Parliament, I tend to talk about things at a local level, in Paisley and Renfrewshire. I will do so again today because I must mention Renfrewshire&#8217;s alcohol and drug partnership. It is involved in lots of community groups in the area, particularly in Paisley&#8217;s west end, which includes Ferguslie Park. The partnership is working with the west end is safer and healthier&#8212;WISH&#8212;group, to which it has given money. That group is taking an holistic attitude to working with people who live in areas with the highest rates of deprivation in the whole of Scotland and is looking for ways in which they can make life better for themselves. That includes working with families who have family members with drug and alcohol problems.</p><p>The director of social work in Renfrewshire publicly says that we may have third-generation drug users in families. In that situation, we must find a way of working with those families. Therefore, I am glad that the Renfrewshire alcohol and drug partnership has provided funding for activities involving kinship carers, in particular. When families break down because of drug misuse or anything else, other family members tend to pick up the pieces. I have had to deal with that issue over the years, whether as a councillor or as a member of the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>The debate is not about methadone or the pharmacies that administer it; neither is it about the drug users with sometimes tragically chaotic lifestyles who find themselves on the road to recovery. It is about people and how we, as a society, can work together to ensure that all our citizens are given an opportunity to thrive and live life to the full. We could sit here all day discussing negative factors, but we have to do something. As I said earlier, if this was an easy problem to solve we would have solved it by now.

It is only when we look at the issue as a corporate parent that we truly understand our role in looking after those children.</p><p>We will all have heard the term &#8220;corporate parent&#8221; as we went through our normal lives before becoming elected members, but it is only when we become councillors in local authorities that we understand what it means.

I am pleased that the minister, Aileen Campbell, has reaffirmed that position this afternoon.</p><p>We must ensure that we all work towards the goal of making Scotland the best place in which to grow up, and that we take up our role as a corporate parent. It is important that looked-after children gain a permanent home quickly, and I welcome the fact that the child will be at the centre of the process.</p><p>Joan McAlpine and other members have mentioned that the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration published a report on care and permanence planning for looked-after children. The thing that stood out for me in that report was that it takes over two years, in most cases, for children to find some form of permanence. That is a worry, because the sooner that we can help those looked-after children, the easier life will be for them.</p><p>Other situations have been mentioned during the debate. For example, there are challenges when we try to leave children with their birth parents. That can sometimes lead to tragic circumstances, as has happened in various areas, but in the majority of cases it works out.</p><p>Those are issues that we must think about. I understand why the timescales can be quite difficult. We have to ensure that we get everything correct and above board.</p><p>This is national adoption week, and many people will be completely unaware of the idea behind the rule yourself in campaign, thinking that they are too old, too young or have too different a lifestyle to be accepted as an adoptive parent. We must promote the campaign and ensure that people know that the option is available to them.</p><p>The minister is correct that we need to ensure uniformity across local authorities. When I was a councillor, I heard many stories from other authorities where the situation was different from my authority. That causes more problems in what is a difficult situation to begin with.</p><p>Local authorities need to make it simpler for families to access support. I welcome the Government&#8217;s support for kinship carers, because it is natural for grandparents and other members of the family to help out in difficult situations. We have been doing that for generations, but we have to say that there are more older people doing that now. In my constituency, I can name a couple of cases. We need to support those families, because they have already gone through some difficult situations. We have to ensure that we make it easier for them to access support.</p><p>Once again, we are debating a subject that we all agree on. This decision will make a difference for all our children and young people and can change the pathway that a young person might take. I take my corporate parenting role seriously and will, therefore, continue to support the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambitious ideas in this area.</p><p>Recently, a family member came to me to ask about adoption. I gave him the details but, although I take my corporate parenting role seriously, I went home to my wife and said, &#8220;What do they want to do that for? Why are they asking these questions?&#8221; That attitude is part of the problem and we all have to get over that feeling and ensure that we support people who are going for adoption, because the future of our children is the most important thing for everyone in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate on permanence and adoption.

There was an ideal in those days, as Iain Gray said, that was all about looking at the big idea and the big picture, reaching for the stars and trying to be all that we could be. At that time, the first Concorde test flight took place and the Boeing 747 made its maiden flight.</p><p>There were big issues in 1969, and we must ask ourselves, &#8220;Where have we gone?&#8221; As children of the 1970s, we grew up wanting to be astronauts. My mother&#8217;s friends would say to her, &#8220;What does George want to be this week?&#8221; and she would say, &#8220;George wants to be an astronaut.&#8221;</p><p>As members can see, that did not work out&#8212;although some people might say that we in the Parliament are wired to the moon sometimes. I obviously had political ambitions, and when I found out that Neil Armstrong was an aerospace engineer as well as an astronaut, I realised that that was probably a wee bit too much for me to try to take on at that stage.</p><p>In the 1970s, space exploration was one of the most important things for us as children growing up. It was constantly there in literature and on television, and absolutely everywhere that we went.</p><p>I was looking at some of the information on Neil Armstrong, and it was interesting to read that he started off in 1958 in the US air force&#8217;s man in space soonest programme. That does not sound like the sexiest of titles for a space programme, but its aim was to design a space plane that would go up and deliver satellites and come back down again. It is funny how some of the ideas from the past end up coming full circle; we are still talking about some of those things and developing them now.</p><p>The funny thing was that the programme was cancelled only just before the plane went into full production, and Neil Armstrong was one of only two of the pilots in the programme who actually went to space in the end.</p><p>As other members have said, on April 12 1961 Yuri Gagarin officially started the space race by being the first man in space. Kennedy made his speech at Rice University on September 12, 1962, in which he said those famous words:</p><p>&#8220;We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard&#8221;.</p><p>Those lines alone define that era and exactly what everyone was trying to achieve.</p><p>It was a case not of, &#8220;We cannot do that&#8221;, but of &#8220;We cannot do it, but let&#8217;s try and achieve it anyway.&#8221; That is a lesson that we have to learn, because we have lost our vision as politicians and as a community. We have lost the idea of looking at the big issues and the big world-changing ideals. As my colleague Stewart Stevenson said, so many practical things came out of the Apollo missions.</p><p>I and some of my younger members of staff have often talked about getting one of the Apollo 11 models and putting it in my office, just to remind us that we can achieve the impossible. Everyone, including the engineers, was told that there was no way that they could do it, and that it was not achievable with the technology that they had then, but they achieved it and showed the world. To this day, we are still talking about those things.</p><p>Much of what I was thinking about saying has already been said, but I will finish by saying that Neil Armstrong had a profound effect on my life. It sounds pretty incredible that a young boy from Paisley could be motivated by the first man on the moon, but his actions in July 1969 taught me that we can look at the stars and dream, or we can work hard, set targets for ourselves and achieve what is perceived to be the impossible.

My time on that committee was oh so short. I was a member for only two meetings, one of which was about this inquiry. I was there when Duncan McNeil heard about walking football for older people. I have been told that I have had that style of play for a number of years. It might be something to do with age.</p><p>I have been quite interested in getting hard-to-reach people engaged in sport in my constituency. This year, I played football with Brian Thomson, who is a constituent of mine and who has played football with St Mirren and the acquired brain injury group in Paisley. People can therefore talk to one other about all their issues and problems, get involved in sport and enjoy playing football. Seeing them progress has been extremely good. The group has got to the stage at which it is developing its own football club further; in fact, it is talking to the Scottish Football Association about having an acquired brain injury football league so that it can play other teams in a mini-SPL five-a-side league. I played for those players for an hour and a half and was very sore the next day. They played at a very good level and enjoyed the football. It showed the difference that such a project could make to their lives.</p><p>Another good example is the Renfrewshire street stuff project. Working with St Mirren, that project manages to take football, other sports and a rugby coach out to certain communities in which the police say that there are hotspots. The project can get people involved and see whether anyone has the ability and talent for sport. Indeed, simply being involved makes a massive difference to many younger people. I have gone to see things many times, and some of the stories would make members&#8217; hair curl. The work is extremely challenging, but it makes a big difference. In some areas, it has brought down antisocial behaviour by around 25 per cent, so it obviously works.</p><p>The minister was correct when she said that one of the biggest things in the Olympic games was the volunteers. It has already been mentioned that there are 150,000 volunteers in sport. They do not see themselves as volunteers, as they are involved with their clubs.</p><p>One of the biggest issues that came out was that the rugby organisations, particularly the Scottish Rugby Union, said that the club structure is the most important thing that they develop. The more established clubs have a community feel about them. I know that we are aiming for that with the hubs, but it is difficult and challenging for us to get all the clubs together in hubs. In the same evidence session, I think that it was said that a whole stack of clubs from different sports were working together in Broxburn.</p><p>In my area, the traditional Kelburne Hockey Club&#8212;which, incidentally, gave us Emily Maguire, who was a hockey bronze medallist this year&#8212;has always excelled as a club and a sporting organisation because they have had generation after generation of talent and the involvement of generations of parents. We must find a way of ensuring that we get everyone together so that all the hubs are like that. In Paisley, we have reached the stage at which even the amateur boxing club is involved in one of the hubs. That means that it is engaging all the time. People talk to one another and know exactly what is happening with everything else.</p><p>Money is always a major issue, of course.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673083", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Sport Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome this debate on the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s inquiry into support for community sport.

My wife Stacey suffers from multiple sclerosis, and seeing her on-going struggle with it I have experienced what it is like for someone who has had to access services as the years have passed.</p><p>Stacey is quite lucky compared with others with whom I have worked as an elected member in seeing what difference the bill could make to their lives. As Dennis Robertson said, the bill is about people, and that is the most important thing.</p><p>Part of the evidence that the committee received involved a dialogue between Bob Doris and Margaret Cassidy, who has been a user of social work services in the past. He said to her:</p><p>&#8220;Your prepared statement mentions that you now do things like go dancing and go swimming, not when you are told to go swimming, but at a time of your choosing&#8221;.</p><p>She agreed:</p><p>&#8220;They told me to do things when they wanted.&#8221;</p><p>Bob Doris then said:</p><p>&#8220;I suppose that I am trying to give you the opportunity to put on the record whether you thought that enough choice was previously offered to you&#8221;.</p><p>Margaret then told an interesting story that is a perfect example of why the bill is so important:</p><p>&#8220;It was so-so. I will tell you a wee thing. One time I wanted milk and the woman who was helping me said that that was not her job. I was only asking for a pint of milk, but she said, &#8216;By the way, that&#8217;s not my job.&#8217; I said to her, &#8216;What is your job?&#8217; We had a falling out and I told her, &#8216;There&#8217;s the door. Don&#8217;t come back.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 29 May 2012; c 2358.]</p><p>The bill gives people such as Margaret Cassidy the power to do that and take control of their own lives. That is an important point to take on board.</p><p>As the minister and Duncan McNeil have said, the bill should be seen not as an agenda for cuts but as a vision of the independence that it offers families across our nation. I support the core values of the 2010 strategy&#8212;respect, fairness, independence and freedom&#8212;and I see those values in the bill and in its ensuring that supported people have the independence to lead a fulfilled life.</p><p>As others have said, it is important to acknowledge the 650,000 unpaid carers in Scotland. The extension of direct payments to carers is proof that the Scottish Government acknowledges them. The Scottish Government is also providing other investments of more than &#163;24 million over three years in direct support to carers, plus &#163;46 million to support the carers of older people, because we live in a society that is getting older.</p><p>Another great addition, which has been mentioned, is the carers parliament. I have already booked my place and look forward to the first carers parliament. It is important that we in this chamber engage with everyone across society. Hearing their stories in that forum, and not just at our surgeries, brings the importance of the issue home and makes this place relevant to the people whom we serve.</p><p>The issue is close to my heart because I am, technically, a carer. My wife might say otherwise but, technically, I care for her. I am lucky because I have the support and help of my mother-in-law and father-in-law. Without their support, I would not be able to do the job that I do as well. I have that support, but there are other families who need further support. We must never forget the contribution that those 650,000 unpaid carers make. We must strive to provide as much support as possible, which is one of the reasons why I support the bill.</p><p>The most important support that the bill offers is choice. I would like the minister to look at the potential for making the application process for direct payments a wee bit easier at local authority level. I know from various cases that I have dealt with that the process can be quite difficult and that payments can take a long time to go through. Although people who have taken up the idea of self-directed support have done extremely well and have enjoyed it, there is still the traditional local authority arranged service, directing the available budget and a combination of eligible options.</p><p>I am particularly looking forward to the clarification of the existing laws on direct payments as they are haphazard and something of a mishmash at present. The minister spoke about family members being in receipt of direct payments&#8212;I welcome that flexibility. That is something that we have to look at because it is a natural process for families to look after individuals.</p><p>I add my voice to support for the bill. It carries forward the legacy of the Christie commission and ensures practical support for people and families throughout Scotland. I have mentioned Scotland&#8217;s 650,000 unpaid carers and their contribution to our communities. They and their families must be supported and assured of a quality, independent life. This is a strong bill, and I agree with the minister that it can make a difference to people&#8217;s lives throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the bill and the debate.

I know a community activist&#8212;I will not mention his name&#8212;who is an elderly gentleman living in the south end of Paisley. At every meeting that he attends&#8212;the community council meeting, the tenants and residents association meeting, or the local area committee&#8212;he asks what they will do about the Neilston Road shops, which are covered in graffiti.</p><p>That leads us into an interesting debate about how we might keep a whole area clean and tidy&#8212;which, as Graeme Dey has pointed out, is not just the responsibility of the local authority or the kids who pick up rubbish after school. Everyone has to be involved, including local businesses. For too long now, many retailers and those running businesses in the streets of our towns and cities, who take money from our pockets, seem to forget that, although they might not live in the town that they serve, they actually gain from being part of the community and should work along with it to ensure that the town is clean. After all, such an approach could make a massive difference in many different areas. Not only is rubbish in our town centres unsightly and wrong, but who will invest in a town centre that has rubbish all over its streets? No one will spend thousands of pounds on setting up a new business if there is rubbish everywhere, bin bags lying uncollected and so on. These things make a difference.</p><p>We have all seen pictures of housing estates throughout the country that show how lovely the estates were in the 1950s and 1960s. If those in certain areas or streets simply allow rubbish to go everywhere, everyone simply gives up and leaves it lying. As a result, such behaviour becomes the norm. Graeme Dey does us a favour by highlighting this issue and reminding us that this is not just about some on-going campaign but something that should always be part of our lives.</p><p>When the Scottish National Party was the administration in Renfrewshire, it introduced the clean Renfrewshire campaign; although we offered community clean-ups, we focused on the ownership of the idea and on getting people to realise that it was our problem and that we had to deal with it. I think that that is the most important issue. We also gave the warden service the powers to book people for littering and the like in the town; the move was not very popular initially, but it made a difference in the area and helped to change the culture. As Graeme Dey pointed out, we have to make it clear that fly-tipping is totally unacceptable. Once it happens in one area, it quickly starts to happen non-stop.</p><p>I thank Graeme Dey for securing the debate. We have to work together on this issue; indeed, the message of the local campaigns in which I was involved was that every one of us was responsible and that we needed to clean Renfrewshire together.

I say to all members who expressed some doubt about the consultation and where we are going with it that when Derek Mackay, the Minister for Local Government and Planning, says that potentially the bill represents the biggest transfer of power since devolution, assuredly he means it. I say that not because I am the minister&#8217;s pal on the back benches, but because I have worked with him for years and I know that Derek Mackay is an individual who believes in getting the facts right and ensuring that we get results. He does not generally deal in hyperbole.</p><p>My own time in local government showed me how important community empowerment was. In Renfrewshire Council, we created local area committees. As one of the conveners, I had to ensure that the community was involved and wanted to turn up to the meetings. Sitting for three hours in what is effectively a council meeting can be a dry experience, but we had to ensure that there was a vision and that people were involved.</p><p>We had the general fund, the common good fund and various legacy funds. However, without vision and ideas from the community, we had nothing. Once the money was gone, nobody would turn up to the meetings; &#8220;Eastenders&#8221; and &#8220;Coronation Street&#8221; would win and you would be sitting in an empty council chamber with no one else to talk to. We had to ensure that we had a vision and could get a programme together.</p><p>As I have said before, we created a &#163;20,000 outdoor gym and pensioners playpark. It seemed silly at the start, but it is now used constantly. The park had a tennis court that had not received investment for some time, but we managed to get &#163;220,000 from Tennis Scotland to ensure that young people in the south end of Paisley could play a sport that they did not have access to previously.</p><p>That is what community empowerment is about. It is not just about the councillors, the council or politicians in general telling the public what to do. As Margo MacDonald hinted at earlier, if we do not encourage the public and use their ideas, they will walk away and will not get involved. Therefore, it is about members of the public gaining empowerment and thriving. That is one of the things that I have always tried to push forward.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome this debate on the consultation on the bill.

That was my idea for stage 2. If we get the bill correct, I think that it would help to further that project. That is one of the things that I would be looking at as well.</p><p>Community planning was one of the most important things that I found out about during my time on the council. It is important that we ensure that there is further involvement with communities and the public and private sectors to find common ground and work towards the greater good.</p><p>My members&#8217; business debate last week on the Renfrewshire witch hunt 1697 project was essentially about community cultural planning. The community developed an idea and led the project, and everyone got involved, including the actors who were part of it, and supported it. That model has been extremely successful and it could be used as a tool to regenerate towns and other areas. However, it is extremely important to ensure that everyone is involved in community planning.</p><p>One of the other things that excites me about the bill is the possibility of community compulsory purchase, which I believe could empower many groups in our communities, as Sandra White said.</p><p>In many constituencies, there are buildings and areas that we could make better use of and which have lain there for years with nothing happening. In many cases, they are owned not by the local authority, but by private investors who, because of the economy or other reasons, have left them or possibly stripped them to the bone. There are a number of examples of that in Paisley, such as the Territorial Army building in the university district and the part-time school that was part of the old Ferguslie cotton mill. All those buildings could be considered for development. Another project is the Paisley Development Trust&#8217;s on-going work with the Russell institute, a building that was provided to the people of Paisley by Agnes Russell and eventually given to Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS board, which has now pulled out.

Rest assured that although Dr Who might be back on the television, he did not drop off our visitors tonight. Steven Moffat, who writes that show, is from Paisley, but our visitors are not to do with him; they are involved with Paisley Development Trust&#8217;s Renfrewshire witch hunt 1697 project.</p><p>The project was unusual for me, because it dealt with cultural planning, which was a new issue for me and something that I was fairly cynical about. Everyone in Paisley hears the story of the witches in 1697 but, until this year, very few of us would have been able to give the full story and say what actually happened and when. My father told me that the final resting place of the witches was at Maxwellton Cross in Paisley. A horseshoe was put in the middle of the road, which we were always told was where the witches were buried. As a child, that captures the imagination. To this day, when children are told the story, they want to know more. However, my father was a story teller so, as I became an adult, I started to doubt many of the things that he said. In fact, we had a similar relationship to the one in the book &#8220;Big Fish&#8221; by Daniel Wallace, which is about a father and son as they get older. When we watched the movie version of that, the two of us grat all the way through it, but that is another thing entirely&#8212;west of Scotland men bubbling, as usual.</p><p>When I found out that the story of the witches was true and learned about it, I could see the benefits of cultural planning and how we could use the story as a lever to develop our economy locally in Paisley. There are similar stories throughout Scotland that members will no doubt tell us about and that can be used in a similar way.</p><p>The festival was a new one for Paisley, with 1,000 people attending on the day. It was a fantastic event and we were lucky with the weather. There were almost as many people as were at another famous Paisley event, sma shot day, which has been going for a long time. Liz Gardiner of Fablevision Studios always talks about community planning and how we can use community-led projects to regenerate our town. That is the thing that really got me as the project moved forward. Initially, I was supportive and said that I would help, although I was slightly cynical, but then I saw what happened when the actors got together and started the road show. They went to museums in Paisley and to Renfrewshire schools.</p><p>Claire Cassidy, a young teacher from Renfrewshire, has made a pack as a teaching aid for Renfrewshire Council education department. That will be used as part of the curriculum for excellence for primary and secondary school children. The pack goes into the story in great detail. Christian Shaw was an 11-year-old young woman who accused people of witchcraft. The children are asked to think about whether she had a mental health condition or was actually possessed, which gives them a chance to debate the whole history and the ideas. For young people in particular, that lights their imagination and makes them want to learn more about what happened in their area.</p><p>The project can also lead to cultural tourism. The 1697 events happened five years after the events in Salem in America, which are a lot more famous than the events in Paisley. Salem has a whole tourism strategy based around the events there. My family on my paternal side have been in Paisley since at least 1759&#8212;that is when records began, so they might have been there during that witch hunt period. We have opportunities throughout Scotland to get people to come home to seek out their past&#8212;that is cultural tourism. The Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs has talked about that a lot in the past year or so.</p><p>The cast are in the public gallery, so I hope to do the story some justice. In 1697 a young girl, Christian Shaw, the daughter of the laird of Bargarran, complained about being tormented by a number of local witches. On 17 August 1696 she caught Catherine Campbell, one of the family&#8217;s servants, stealing some milk. When Christian reported the theft to her mother, Catherine Campbell wished the devil to take her soul to hell&#8212;I think that what she says is even more brutal than that when it is done in old Scots, but I will not do that. The actors in the public gallery would probably do it a lot better, and once they get the funding for next year members will be able to see the story in its entirety if they come to Paisley on about the 9 or 10 June next year.</p><p>The story went on and over the weeks, as things progressed, the family believed that Christian Shaw was possessed. They took her to a doctor in Glasgow, who said that nothing could be done. The whole presbytery arrived in Paisley and decided that it was witchcraft. It is worth bearing it in mind that the events took place in 1697, so only 10 years before the act of union we were killing people for being witches. Maybe we were not in a good frame of mind to go for the act of union in 1707.</p><p>Seven people&#8212;Margaret Lang, John Lindsay, James Lindsay, John Reid, Catherine Campbell, Margaret Fulton and Agnes Naismith&#8212;were found guilty of having bewitched Shaw and were condemned to death. One subsequently committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell, while the other six were hanged and then burned on the Gallow Green in Paisley on 10 June 1697. It was the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe.</p><p>It was great to watch the story unfold as the actors showed us what happened. They did such a great job that although young people initially looked on the re-enactment as a pantomime and shouted &#8220;Burn the witches, burn the witches!&#8221;, when the court scene was re-enacted outside Paisley abbey children shouted words such as &#8220;Mercy, mercy.&#8221; They became involved in the story because it was local to them and they understood it. It was a fantastic achievement on the part of every actor who took part on the day. Such re-enactments are something that we could do in a greater way in Paisley and in other places in Scotland. We have so many stories to tell and such events enable our young people to become involved in and proud of their local heritage. It is about not only Scotland&#8217;s heritage, but local heritage.</p><p>The project has created another great festival for Paisley. Community planning is a fantastic lever and provides an opportunity for us to regenerate towns throughout Scotland. As I say, Scotland has many stories to tell. Such stories can lead to tourism opportunities and to educational opportunities for our young people. They give us the chance to embrace our past&#8212;the good and the bad.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671224", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renfrewshire Witch Hunt 1697"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members might not be aware that we have some visitors in the public gallery who are slightly different from the normal visitors.

Reform of empty property rates will revitalise our town centres and provide that incentive. It will work alongside other regeneration strategies and groups in our communities.

I have said before in the chamber&#8212;as recently as in my members&#8217; business debate on multiple sclerosis&#8212;and I repeat, that we need reform, but not the reform that is proposed. We are dealing with the lives of vulnerable people and with families who have enough to deal with daily without having to face the financial problems that the UK Government is going to leave on their doorsteps.</p><p>The UK Government has yet again reduced the Scottish budgetary allocation. It is to reduce by &#163;2.5&#160;billion because of welfare reform, which will hit Scotland&#8217;s vulnerable people in the pocket. That is a major issue for Scotland and our people.</p><p>Earlier today, I met people with acquired brain injury whom Quarriers had brought to Parliament. Those people will have a problem because of welfare reform. It is difficult to diagnose and deal with issues that relate to acquired brain injury and sufferers have problems with short-term memory loss, so when they have an issue with the disability living allowance or the PIP, they might be unable to recall conversations or other things that have happened. Such benefits are to be cut from the top, as 20 per cent is to be cut from their budget.</p><p>In other debates, I have mentioned people with multiple sclerosis. Such people can look as if they are healthy, because they are not having an attack and are living their life as normal.

Mary Scanlon has just highlighted the major difference between us and her party.</p><p>Welfare reform will have an impact on people in our communities: there has been much talk about the difference that people will experience. When I was a member of Renfrewshire Council, its scrutiny and petitions board investigated the impact on Renfrewshire of the economic downturn. The local chambers of commerce said that welfare reform would cost Renfrewshire and the town of Paisley &#163;1&#160;million a year, because people who are on lower incomes tend to use high streets rather than to go to out-of-town shopping centres. That alone could have a major effect on Scotland&#8217;s towns and high streets.</p><p>The impact on people worries me most. When I have hosted debates on MS and dealt with people who have MS, I have heard tragic stories. Luckily, my wife, Stacey, does not have some of the problems that others have. Would we as a Parliament put people through such experiences? I am proud that we have a cabinet secretary who will, along with the Government, stand up for such people.</p><p>In Scotland, 346,620 people claim disability living allowance. That is 346,620 people whose lives will change dramatically. Of those people, 308,000&#8212;89 per cent&#8212;receive the mobility component.</p><p>The reform could also have a major effect on how we deal with services locally, as its impact will be not just on high street retailers, but on the services that local authorities deliver.</p><p>Today, we are debating a major difference between the Scottish Parliament and its Westminster counterpart. I became involved in politics to help my community, but it was only when I married a woman who has a long-term condition that I began to understand the many issues involved. As an elected member&#8212;here and previously on Renfrewshire Council&#8212;I have worked with many groups that will be affected by the reform. Every time we make a decision, we must measure its success by its impact on the people of Scotland. This is another example, of which I am proud, of the Scottish Government&#8217;s having Scotland&#8217;s people at its heart.

Like Christine Grahame, I will start by asking why we need a single service. Unlike Alison McInnes, it seems, I feel that we have a great opportunity to modernise and make a generational change in these vital services. Although I agree with John Finnie that we find ourselves in this position partly because of the Westminster cuts, I have to say that it is often when people are faced with the biggest challenges that they get the best returns.</p><p>Every other western European country has a single police force. Although Finland introduced the regional model that some have advocated for Scotland, it returned to the national model years later. At this point, I must welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to maintain the 1,000 extra police officers, because they are particularly valued at a local level. Indeed, that very factor, which has been mentioned quite a lot this morning, will become more important as we move on with this debate.</p><p>A lot has changed since 1975, when the current structure was introduced. I was only six years old and, as members will see, I have changed slightly since then. Christine Grahame mentioned some of the equipment that was used in those days. As a member of the Strathclyde fire and rescue board, I was invited to Paisley&#8217;s festival of fire and recognised a fire engine from the late 1960s that was being used when I was a small child. The fact that it had a wooden frame shows how much the equipment has changed since that time.</p><p>We need flexibility in the deployment of resources; after all, where organisations can work together and make a difference, such resources can be deployed and shared across the country. For example, Strathclyde Police&#8217;s helicopter is valued by just about every other police force and there is a lot of debate and argument over who gets to use it. Strathclyde fire and rescue board had many debates about aerial rescue pumps, which basically bring together two different bits of machinery and can help to cut costs. I do not want to bring up any old debates that I had with Mr Malik on the fire and rescue board, but the board itself discussed whether those pumps represented the right way forward. Strathclyde Fire and Rescue had aerial rescue pumps, whereas Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service had had them but did not order any more. The proposed reforms might give us a uniformity of service. The scale of the new service will give us much greater opportunity to make such purchases.</p><p>As a member of Strathclyde fire and rescue board, I welcomed the focus on the local, which the cabinet secretary talked about, because scrutiny and local accountability are extremely important. I have seen the value of that. Even at a Strathclyde level, there could have been more devolution. I welcome the part of the bill that provides for that. I suggest that, in my area, Renfrewshire Council, Inverclyde Council and East Renfrewshire Council, which have come together on the civil contingencies group, could work together on a joint police and fire board. No one else has discussed the idea and, as I am no longer a councillor, it is nothing to do with me, but it might be a good way of providing access to officers.</p><p>It is important that fire and rescue services continue to be involved in community planning. In Renfrewshire, we have ensured that they have been involved in their local area committees and various other council committees. That is something that the public want. There is a huge difference between how the police were perceived locally in Strathclyde in 1974 or 1975 and how they are perceived now. There is a difference in the way in which they talk. I remember that, when I was convener of Paisley South local area committee, the most exciting part of the evening was when the fire and rescue service and the police reported back&#8212;that was the part of the meeting that the public valued and wanted to have some form of interaction with. There needs to be more flexibility and engagement on how services are delivered throughout Scotland. We need to ensure that we take the public with us and that there is local accountability.</p><p>We have an opportunity to change for the better the present valued services. We have the potential to create dynamic organisations that can deliver for the whole country. It is important that we discuss the bill&#8217;s proposals and arrive at a logical and workable conclusion.

I am pleased that you are in the chair, Presiding Officer. That is no slight to your colleagues, but I know about and appreciate the work that you have done with the MS Society throughout the years and which is on-going.</p><p>Most of the people who have known me for years will know that Stacey and I have been married for a long time&#8212;if I can call 16 years a long time. When I first met Stacey, like most people, I was totally unaware of what multiple sclerosis was. The only people who I knew had it were Tiger Tim Stevens and Stuart Henry. Both were DJs&#8212;one with Radio 1 and the other with Radio Clyde&#8212;and in the 1980s, there was all kinds of publicity in the media when they started to slur their words and various other things happened. They had to say publicly at the time that they had MS. Stuart Henry was a bad example, because the form of MS that he had meant that, eventually, he died, in 1995. I assumed that that happened to everyone who had MS. A lot of the public are ignorant of the issues.</p><p>I will mention Renfrewshire Council, so, as usual, I declare that I am a councillor with that council. I also declare that I am slightly emotionally compromised, as I dearly love my wife. The support of my wife and her family is probably one of the reasons why I am standing here today.</p><p>There is a lack of understanding of MS, partly because there are four basic versions of the condition. There is benign MS, where people can have a small relapse followed by complete recovery. There is relapsing-remitting MS, which Stacey initially had when we first met. There is also secondary progressive MS, which Stacey has progressed to. I keep mentioning my own circumstances and Stacey, because this is about the people who are suffering with MS. I also keep getting told not to use the word &#8220;suffer&#8221;, but it is difficult to watch someone I love suffer day in, day out without using that word. There is also primary progressive MS.</p><p>In Scotland, 10,500 people live with MS. We have one of the highest rates of MS in the world. The minister will be aware that there has been much talk about vitamin D deficiency in Scotland. There has been the shine on Scotland campaign on the issue, with Ryan McLaughlin talking about his mother&#8217;s MS. I am no expert on the matter, but research in Australia indicates that the incidence of MS is higher among people who were born in November and December, whose mothers were pregnant during the winter months in Australia. There might be something in the idea of giving women the opportunity to take vitamin D supplements during pregnancy and of giving vitamin D supplements to younger children. In Canada, some states give vitamin D to younger people and pregnant women.</p><p>Two new cases of MS are diagnosed in Scotland every 24 hours. I would like us to look at providing vitamin D as a preventative measure. If we could prevent families like Stacey&#8217;s from having to learn that, at the age of 16, their child has the disease that would make things a lot better.</p><p>The Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill can make a big difference to the day-to-day lives of people with MS. As a member of Renfrewshire Council, I know the difficulties that are faced by people who go through the process of getting direct payments and who then try to find out what is available for them. The idea behind the bill is to offer flexibility. MS requires that flexibility because of the condition&#8217;s unpredictability and fluctuation. It is right to provide such support, through which we can help people to remain in work for longer and to live independently for as long as possible.</p><p>I have said previously that self-directed support must be flexible and available consistently throughout Scotland. As a local councillor&#8212;until tomorrow&#8212;I know that there may be problems in some areas. Although we can discuss the issue in Parliament, nine times out of 10 it is the local authority that will deliver the care or the service that the individuals needs. For me, that is a problem&#8212;and, as the minister and the Presiding Officer will be aware, I am a great one for breenging in and trying to solve problems. I think that there is a large &#8220;S&#8221; on my chest&#8212;sometimes I have to admit that there is not and that we have to look at the issues, but sometimes we can say, &#8220;We can solve this.&#8221; On Renfrewshire Council, I became the councillor everyone came to about MS, because they knew that I understood the condition, what they were going through and how to help them. However, it should not have to be like that. It should be a lot easier for people to access services through the systems that are in place in local authorities.</p><p>The Westminster Government&#8217;s changes to the welfare system will also affect people with MS. I believe that all the individuals involved should be offered some flexibility, and I do not believe that Westminster is going about it the right way.</p><p>One of the biggest issues is the change to the disability living allowance, which is becoming the personal independence payment. In the United Kingdom, 69,000 people who have MS receive some form of DLA. They will have to go through a whole process to reassess their situation. For some people with MS, worry and fear can trigger an attack. The last thing that we need is for people to go through the process and have that kind of problem.</p><p>Westminster is looking for a 20 per cent cut in DLA. This is about people&#8217;s lives and their condition, yet the UK Government is effectively looking not at the individual but at the number that it has to cut. There must be a better way. I know for a fact that, for a lot of people who suffer from MS, the mobility element alone can make a huge difference to their lives and to their ability to get about. Westminster should think again on the issue.</p><p>I have said previously that one person in three cannot name a single symptom of MS.</p><p>The Paisley and district branch of the MS Society is very good at supporting people with MS. Its convener, Angela Stirling, is in the public gallery tonight with her colleague June Pratt, who is the social secretary. They take their roles, including the social side, extremely seriously. They ensure that everybody gets not only all the information that they need regarding the latest developments on MS but the opportunity just to sit down and have a chat. Stacey has constantly told me that Revive MS Support in Maryhill is very popular with people who have MS, mainly because of the tea and sympathy that it provides. People there listen and talk to people with MS.</p><p>The Presiding Officer is indicating to me that I should wind up&#8212;I am sorry.</p><p>Provost Celia Lawson of Renfrewshire Council held an event that raised more than &#163;20,000. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth was at it. The council got Revive MS Support to come in and do some outreach work in the Ralston sports hub.</p><p>I could say, &#8220;My name is George Adam and my wife has MS,&#8221; but that would be to do an injustice to my wife and other people who have the disease. It is important to see the people behind the condition. We must remember that when we make decisions.</p><p>I want every member who is present to tell the world that they will join the MS Society and fight back against multiple sclerosis.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666310", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Multiple Sclerosis Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am extremely pleased to bring this debate to the Parliament because, as members all know, the issue is very close to my heart.

Now, two weeks before a council election, they come here to complain about the situation while offering very little.</p><p>Mr Harvie and Ms Dugdale are right to say that it is about the people who use the bus services&#8212;the older people, the disabled people and the mothers with the prams. Part of the idea of the quality bus partnership is that we can ensure that we have a certain stock of buses that they can use. In Paisley, the older buses will be phased out after a time and all the buses will have low floors. We must think about how we can work within the existing constraints. We can talk and debate non-stop but achieve nothing; it is what we deliver that is important, and that is what we are focusing on in Renfrewshire. We have cleaner buses with a lower level of emissions and we are working in partnership with the bus operators on timetabling in various areas.</p><p>That brings me to another issue. It is Strathclyde partnership for transport in the Labour-controlled Strathclyde region that operates the subsidy in the local areas. Our area is subsidising Labour-controlled areas, supporting bus services in rural Lanarkshire and in some places in Glasgow as well. I feel that SPT needs a radical overhaul, as it has a &#163;10 million corporate budget that is being spent just on salaries for its chief executives and it is a &#163;50 million organisation. That cannot be the correct way forward.</p><p>As the minister asked, what is Labour&#8217;s current position? What would Labour do with buses nationally? Is it talking about reregulation at a cost of &#163;1 billion? Is that its position? Would it do anything? I am waiting for a Labour member to respond to those questions.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Sorry, Presiding Officer.

We are dealing with real people, who have real problems, and the reforms will have a dramatic and devastating effect on their lives.</p><p>I listened to Alex Johnstone&#8217;s speech&#8212;or rather, his turn, as I think he put it. It was indeed a turn, which would probably have gone down better at Blackpool pleasure beach than anywhere else. I am still waiting for the detail. Where is the hope for people who suffer from long-term conditions? How can we maximise the use of the existing housing stock, as he says that we should do?</p><p>The problem is that many local authorities are still suffering from the Conservatives&#8217; previous housing ideas, which is why local authorities no longer have the good housing stock. Thankfully, the Scottish Government has managed to take the situation forward and to ensure that we retain some social housing stock. We hear nothing about that from the Conservatives.</p><p>Alex Johnstone mentioned flexibility in the system but said absolutely nothing about it. I am still waiting to hear what that flexibility is and what I should tell the people whom I met last night. There is just fear and a complete lack of detail.</p><p>A document from HM Revenue and Customs said that the housing benefit and welfare reforms could push 118,700 children in Scotland into poverty. Most of us never got involved in politics to do that, and the same probably applies to many of my colleagues on the Tory benches&#8212;it is surprising to have to say that about the Lib Dems, too.</p><p>In Renfrewshire, 68 per cent of all tenants receive some form of housing benefit. I spoke to the housing department there today and was told that the effect on how it goes about its business will be massive. That department does not know the detail of the reforms, although it is one of the bodies that will deal with them.</p><p>Renfrewshire&#8217;s population is split 50:50 between working-age people and older people. As Jamie Hepburn said, we do not have the housing to deal with the need for one-bedroom homes. The Tories say that they want everybody to work for themselves and to make their way in the world but, under the proposals, every under-35-year-old will be staying with his mother and father, because he will be unable to get a bedsit.</p><p>We must look at the difference that the reforms will make. Last April, the local housing allowance for private lets was reduced from 50 to 30 per cent of rents. That has left many people who rent from private landlords at their mercy, which is a worry.</p><p>There are other issues. I mentioned child poverty, and looked-after children will also be affected.

Back in Paisley and Renfrewshire, the town centre managers will probably look at the minister&#8217;s offer and have ideas of some events and conferences that could be held in Paisley and Renfrewshire. It is the sort of thing that can make a difference and regenerate our town centres.</p><p>In Paisley, our town centre manager, Amanda Moulson, working for Renfrewshire Council, has secured more and more events in the town, which has encouraged more footfall in Paisley town centre. We have had a couple of conferences along the way, as well, and her work is much appreciated. Through Paisley vision board, she is currently running a poll in which 87 per cent of respondents are saying that they want more events in the town of Paisley. That shows the kind of things that can make a difference in the area.</p><p>Two thousand and twelve is the year of creative Scotland, whose four main objectives are promotion, celebration, participation and collaboration. Those are the things that we must all ensure when we talk about events. In our earlier discussion, we talked about the fact that we tend to stick to specific areas and do not promote Scotland in its entirety. That is something that we must do. What is the point of bringing someone to Glasgow if they do not see the great history of Paisley or my colleague Stuart McMillan&#8217;s beloved Greenock? What is the point of not making sure that people go there as well? We must look into that.</p><p>In Paisley, next year, we will have the Gaelic Mod for the first time. This year, from 25 to 28 October, we will have a Spiegeltent in County Square for the Paisley fringe festival, which is one of only four new festivals that Creative Scotland has allowed for this year. Renfrewshire Council received a &#163;10,000 grant for that event. That will give us a chance to get on with some of the ideas that we have talked about for the Mod next year, which should be exciting and different. I have often heard it called the whisky Olympics. I have never been to the Mod, but when it is in Paisley, people will drink to help the town&#8217;s economy&#8212;but always responsibly.</p><p>Mary Scanlon mentioned the film &#8220;Brave&#8221; from Pixar/Disney, which has a nearly fully Scots cast, although a number of the actors&#8212;Julie Walters, John Ratzenberger and Emma Thompson&#8212;are not Scots. I will forgive Julie Walters because she is, as my father said, a feisty woman like my granny; John Ratzenberger is seemingly a lucky mascot for Pixar, as he has been in every Pixar movie; and who can forget Emma Thompson&#8217;s very good Scottish accent in &#8220;Tutti Frutti&#8221;, in 1987? That series was written by Paisley&#8217;s own John Byrne, of course, and it shows the difference that film and television can make to a community that we are still talking about the programme all these years later. Glasgow recently experienced that with the filming of the Brad Pitt movie &#8220;World War Z&#8221;. The movie brought &#163;2&#160;million for Glasgow, and it will be interesting when tourists come to Glasgow to see where the scenes that are set in Philadelphia were filmed. Incidentally, Philadelphia was where the declaration of independence was signed&#8212;I mention that in passing.</p><p>There is so much that we can do as things move on. I recently asked the minister a parliamentary question about the Olympic games. I asked what we were doing to promote Scotland and to move people away from the hustle and bustle of London. Everybody assumed that I was talking about Paisley but, if members look at the Official Report, they will see that I never mentioned Paisley although the minister mentioned Paisley in his answer. That just shows that people expect me to talk about Paisley all the time.</p><p>The national stadium at Hampden Park will benefit from the Olympic games, as we will have football games there. Over the coming years, we will also have the Commonwealth games in Glasgow. In Renfrewshire, we are investing &#163;8.5&#160;million in the Lagoon sport and leisure centre as a hub, to ensure that Renfrewshire is the gateway to the games. As everyone knows, Glasgow airport is, in fact, in Paisley.</p><p>When we talk about promotion, celebration and participation, we must&#8212;as Siobhan McMahon said&#8212;look to our own towns. Glasgow may be the dear green place, but Paisley is, to me, the centre of the universe. Currently, we are running a campaign entitled &#8220;Paisley is&#8221;, to which we add a tagline at the end. &#8220;Proud past. Promising future&#8221; is an important tagline, as we have to think of our past and move towards the future. &#8220;Paisley is happening&#8221; when we have major events. I just like to say, &#8220;Paisley is my kinda town.&#8221; Richard Lyle will remember when I sang that song at the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities one evening, late on.</p><p>We must look at all the events that various towns hold. Locally, we have done an awful lot with the town centre manager, Amanda Moulson, and her team. We have the Paisley fringe festival, which I have mentioned; the Xmas lights ceremony, which 35,000 people attend; and sma shot day, which involves a bit of Paisley history and is one of the oldest events. The weavers fell out with the manufacturers over the sma shot&#8212;it was the one bit of cotton that kept the whole shawl together, but the manufacturers would not pay the weavers for it. Ever since that dispute, the first Saturday in July has been a holiday in Paisley.</p><p>I could talk about more. Once again, I have had to leave out most of my speech. In the future, I will have to have an edit button in my head.</p><p>We can take such ideas and make a big difference. We have had a fantastic debate. Everyone is proud of their area and of everything that we can do. We must get together, make the project more joined up and move on from there.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662888", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, like the minister, am an optimist.

In the 1980s and early 90s, fair trade was about coffee and wine&#8212;in moderation, of course&#8212;and we had to go to specialist stores to get fair trade goods.</p><p>My introduction to fair trade came through&#8212;of all things&#8212;sports clothing, which of course was not fair trade because there was an issue about the rights of the people who were manufacturing it. I learned that footballs and sports shoes were being made in sweatshops in the Pacific islands, Pakistan and elsewhere. That opened my eyes and encouraged me to take a step and to make a difference.</p><p>The Fairtrade Foundation is asking everyone in Scotland to take a step for Fairtrade fortnight in 2012. It is encouraging everyone to change their lifestyle in order to change the lives of people&#8212;particularly farmers and manufacturers&#8212;in the developing world. A change in our shopping habits can make a massive difference to individuals&#8217; lives.</p><p>Some 19&#160;million glasses of fair trade wine are sold in the United Kingdom every year. The situation has changed since the beginning of the fair trade movement and most major retailers sell fair trade products, but we could do a lot better. In Paisley, a shop called Rainbow Turtle used to be the only place where we could get such products, but now it is one of many. That is a success.</p><p>There is always a debate among people in the fair trade movement about whether they should work with the big manufacturers. Does working with the big confectionery manufacturers, for example, mean selling out and working with companies that are part of the problem? I have been having that debate in fair trade circles for quite a while.</p><p>However, it is gratifying to see that top brands are making the difference. That is particularly true in the chocolate market: KitKats, Cadbury&#8217;s Dairy Milk Buttons&#8212;a favourite of mine, maybe because I have not grown up too much&#8212;other Cadbury products and Maltesers are all fair trade. Sainsbury&#8217;s sells only fair trade bananas, and it sells more than 1,200 a minute&#8212;that is 650&#160;million a year.</p><p>If we want people to take a step in Fairtrade fortnight, we must ensure that there are lots of different events. During the past few years, a lot has been done for fair trade in Renfrewshire. Way back in the early noughties, in 2003, Paisley became a Fairtrade town. That was during the time of Provost John McDowell, who was a Labour provost. In Renfrewshire there has always been cross-party work to ensure that we can do something. In 2007, when the Scottish National Party-led Administration came in, we ensured that Renfrewshire became a Fairtrade area. We need such political guidance, in addition to our working with organisations including church groups and the young people who are involved. There must be some sort of control and effort so that people can push things forward, as we have done.</p><p>During Fairtrade fortnight, various events will take place. One event in which I will not be involved this year is the Fairtrade football tournament. I played in it two years ago and nearly sent a young man to hospital because I am so slow now, so I have decided that it will probably be better for everyone if I no longer play. It was quite difficult for us, but we made it to the quarter finals.</p><p>We have organised events with the University of the West of Scotland and other organisations to ensure that people get to know about fair trade and where they can buy the goods. In Renfrewshire, we publish a directory every year: this year&#8217;s edition is not even hot off the press&#8212;it will be published tomorrow. It contains a list of all the companies and people who sell fair trade products in Renfrewshire. That gives everyone an opportunity to find out about fair trade, and encourages other retailers and companies to take that step.</p><p>Public sector procurement has been a problem&#8212;it always comes up when we are discussing fair trade down this way. In Renfrewshire, we are trying to go down the route of producing Fairtrade Foundation school uniforms. That seems to be a perfect way to use fair trade cotton; there is a market for the uniforms, it would defeat the fallacy that fair trade goods are always more expensive, and we could deliver those goods to people. However, we have had difficulties with local authority procurement processes. It was good to hear Alex Neil say in the previous debate that the Government has asked for the local economic impact to be taken into account in procurement. It will be interesting to see whether we can do that in the public sector, because it could make a massive difference.</p><p>The Fairtrade Foundation is asking us to take just a small step, and it is trying to achieve 1.5&#160;million steps in 2012. There is an opportunity for everyone to register online, so people can do it in their school, their university or their bowling or sports clubs&#8212;just about anywhere&#8212;to try to make a difference.</p><p>Last year the Fairtrade Foundation had a fantastic Fairtrade fortnight that focused on cotton. Even though I was involved, I did not know about the differences in price between fair trade cotton and cotton that is not fair trade. It makes so much difference. The farmers face so much difficulty: the work is labour intensive, and some of the stories that I heard were quite shocking. In Renfrewshire, we have on numerous occasions had people over from farms in Africa and elsewhere to tell people about what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>It is extremely important that we are now talking about trying to make Scotland a fair trade nation in 2012. My co-convener of the cross-party group on fair trade, James Kelly, and I must try to make that happen&#8212;there is no pressure on us now, James. It is good that we have that opportunity to set ourselves that test. We talk about Scotland being a socially just country, but it is not just about Scotland&#8212;it is about everywhere, and our place in the world. That is extremely important.</p><p>The various events that we have held in Renfrewshire have been important. We have ensured that fair trade has always been part of those: in a 10km race, for example, fair trade bananas were supplied by the Co-operative Wholesale Society to give the runners as they crossed the finish line. We also had the chance to get sponsorship from a major sports manufacturer, but we knocked it back because we had an issue with the firm&#8217;s labour practices.</p><p>I could talk about the issue all night, but we do not have all night. If we can all take a small step, no matter how small, we can make a difference not only here in Scotland but in the rest of the world.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is about something that I got involved in when I was a younger man&#8212;the issue has stayed with me&#8212;and I wanted to do something for my community and was involved in politics.

I sometimes wonder whether I live on the same planet, let alone in the same country, as some Labour members, because they do not seem to get the idea of local authorities working together in partnership. Sarah Boyack said that the local government settlement is bad news for thousands of families throughout Scotland. I am tired of hearing such gloom and doom. I believe that there is no such thing as a problem; there are only solutions. It may be because my mother introduced me to John Lennon at an early age that I believe that it is possible to find a solution to every problem.</p><p>The position that we are in is the result of the squeeze from the Westminster Government. If we had the full economic powers of independence, we could make a difference. I know that the Labour Party has great difficulty with that, but it is quite a simple solution. Kenneth Gibson and the cabinet secretary asked Sarah Boyack what Labour had to offer the people of Scotland in the next couple of years during these difficult times. Yesterday, one Labour member said that the &#163;10 million that is to be spent on the referendum should be redistributed throughout the country in a way that only the Lord himself could do. Today, we have been told that Labour&#8217;s other big idea is a bed tax. Is that it? Is that all that we are to get from Labour? During these difficult times, does Labour have anything else to offer? Labour members can intervene if they want. The people of Scotland are looking for ideas, leadership and a way forward, but Labour has nothing. I can tell from the silence among Labour members that they have nothing to offer.</p><p>Local government, like national Government, is about responsibility and leadership. In these challenging times, we must live in the here and now and deal with the current challenges. The cabinet secretary has supported and helped local authorities. It is up to members such as me and other councillors throughout the country to take on the responsibility of providing for people in our areas.</p><p>I listened to what my colleague James Dornan said about Glasgow City Council. Renfrewshire Council is looking for solutions for the people of Renfrewshire, whereas, 7 miles away in Glasgow, Labour Party members blame everyone else and want to stay in their city chambers like dinosaurs, locking themselves away from the real world and the issues at hand.</p><p>The leader of the Glasgow City Council administration, Gordon Matheson, has already been mentioned. Leadership is about being responsible and showing the way forward; it is also about being able to work with people. In the Evening Times of 20 September last year, Gordon Matheson said:</p><p>&#8220;not only is your council tax bailing out the Edinburgh trams&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>which I believe the Labour Party wanted&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;your city is being asked to run up debt interest payments of around &#163;2.1 million so that Mr Swinney can build a bridge on the other side of the country&#8221;.</p><p>That is Labour&#8217;s idea. Labour in Glasgow is concerned about one wee pokey part of the country instead of the whole of the country.

I wish her all the best for the future. I have known Angela Constance for many years and there is no doubt in my mind about her social conscience when it comes to the issues on hand.</p><p>A level of maturity is needed in this debate. To be fair, it has been demonstrated. John Park, in particular, was a perfect example. He was constructive and got the correct tone for the debate.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch mentioned modern apprenticeships. In sectors such as construction, apprentices who are in their second or third year can be affected by redundancy. I have had to deal with that as a local member. I have mentioned the case before in the Parliament but, luckily, I can announce that I managed to get the apprentices concerned jobs within the local authority. I asked the local authority to take on responsibility for them, although they obviously had to go through the full interview process.</p><p>We must have the political will to do that and we must ensure that the local authority and any other partner organisation are willing to take that forward. The minister has made it clear that the Scottish Government will work with any group, company, organisation or individual to support Scotland&#8217;s young people, and the Government has provided &#163;30 million for training, work or education.</p><p>In the Renfrewshire Council area, Reid Kerr College has spent millions of pounds on its construction skills subject area to ensure that it can retrain people. Margaret McCulloch said that some people&#8217;s skills become dated, and she is quite right. They can become dated and outmoded, but people can retrain. For example, electricians can be trained to become part of the renewables industry. That training gives people, including self-employed individuals, a chance, but it is also mainly for young people.</p><p>We must work with everyone that we possibly can and ensure that we make an all-Scotland effort to increase youth employment. It is important for partners and stakeholders to help as well, and local authorities have a major part to play in that.</p><p>I will be slightly party political at this point. SNP-led Renfrewshire Council is helping young people in its budget this year by investing &#163;2.5 million to fund the creation of 250 subsidised jobs, 1,300 training places and the opportunity for 800 young people to develop the work skills.</p><p>I asked the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth a question about that. He congratulated Renfrewshire Council on that approach and said that other local authorities should consider such investment as a way forward. That scheme would, of course, cover 16 to 24-year-olds. In effect, it would mean the Scottish Government working with 16 to 19-year-olds and the local authority working in its area with everyone else.</p><p>That is an example of a local authority working together with the national Government on its commitment to an education place or modern apprenticeship for all 16 to 19-year-olds.</p><p>As a parent in Renfrewshire, I find all that quite good. It just happens that my son and daughter are 18 and 20, so it helps them&#8212;I may have to declare an interest in that. In all that, along with the Scottish Government&#8217;s youth employment strategy, it is extremely important that we work with the stakeholders to ensure that we supply what businesses, local authorities and third sector organisations want from young people to move things forward.</p><p>As the minister mentioned, it is extremely important that we get younger people&#8217;s involvement at every level of government, whether it be through herself within this place or through community planning partnerships out in the community. I have always striven locally to get younger people involved and engaged in the political process. I agree with Chic Brodie that it would be of benefit if we gave 16 and 17-year-olds the opportunity to vote and decide on all these issues. When we empower people, they give something back and want to get involved.</p><p>We have disagreed today, but there has also been a positive tone in the debate. We should talk up the abilities of and opportunities for Scotland&#8217;s young people, showing the vision and promoting the possibilities for their future. We must provide a vision, not just a wish-list of things that we want to do because, as some Labour members have mentioned, what is important is not what we do in here, but what happens out there in the public with all our young people.</p><p>We must ensure that our young people receive support and have opportunities to get jobs for life. The debate should be conducted with maturity and should provide vision. Scotland needs independence to tackle the issue in its entirety, but we live in the here and now and, as the Scottish Government has mentioned, we have worked within the existing constraints and there are ways in which we can do things. The Scottish Government&#8217;s vision has shown the way forward. We could talk about this all day but, as I said, we are not important&#8212;the reality of young people&#8217;s lives outside this parliamentary bubble is.

I have enjoyed the consensus in the debate, because I know that, outside the chamber, people are concerned only about the service and its delivery, and what that means for their families and friends. The professionals who work in health and social care are also concerned about how they can deliver&#8212;there are many motivated professionals out there who want to make a difference and who want to deliver.</p><p>I like the idea that health and social care partnerships will be integrated and accountable, and it is important that we involve the public and the third sector. It would be good if there was a way in which service users could feed into the partnerships, perhaps through community planning groups. If someone uses a service, they will get involved and engaged only if they are gaining from that process and having some input from the other side.</p><p>We must look at the accountability of local authorities and elected members. It is very important that there is an accountable officer in the partnerships, but it is also important for the leader of the council to take an active role. When I was working in my own area for Renfrewshire Council, it was ably led by Councillor Derek Mackay. He is now Minister Mackay, and I wish my good friend all the best for the future. I am extremely proud of everything that he has achieved, and I know that he is the man for the job. I will go on to a best man speech in a minute.</p><p>As council leader, Derek Mackay was very motivated by the idea of getting involved with the community health partnerships. The CHPs in our area worked because of focus and direction, which came from a political level as well.</p><p>The current social work model works well. Nationally, social work deals with a diverse group of 650,000 adults, who feel that they are treated with dignity and respect. We need to remember that social work is based locally, in local authorities, which deal with cases day to day. Authorities also deal with housing and other issues for adults and young people. Social work deals with difficult and challenging cases and it is important for us to move things forward.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Integration of Health and Social Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the cabinet secretary for bringing the debate to the chamber, and I declare an interest as a sitting Renfrewshire councillor.

In my time as an elected member, I have noticed that it is better for families and individuals to be together in their areas. Our area has had various housing schemes such as high flats with social areas where older people can congregate, so that people can stay together all the time. That has been good and successful, to the extent that people have become almost clannish and allow into their own wee area no one other than people in their own block.</p><p>The agreed national outcomes are important and involve local authorities and the NHS working together in a focused partnership. In relation to partnership, no one will be surprised that I will talk about carers. I emphasise that we must ensure that carers are equal partners in the new organisations.

Iain Gray is quite right when he says that we are talking about real people who have hopes and dreams.

I hoped that we would look to the future and talk about working together to find solutions to the challenges that we have ahead of us. Unfortunately, my dreams were let down when Iain Gray started talking and it was just the same old Labour rhetoric. However, the First Minister and the Scottish Government listened. I welcome the introduction of a minister for youth employment. We need to give our young people all the support that we can, whether it be through jobs or education. The Scottish Government&#8217;s vision is quite incredible in these difficult times.</p><p>I have been working with my local colleges and employment agencies to help the younger people in our area. It is extremely important to do that. There have been occasions when private sector companies, such as construction firms, have gone out of business and I have worked with their apprentices and local agencies to ensure that we can get them back to complete their apprenticeships. All politicians have to have the will to make a difference in people&#8217;s lives. It is not just about our words in the chamber but about our deeds outside it.</p><p>At the end of the day, I do not believe that there is such a thing as a lost generation. I was a teenager in the 1980s, when there was constant talk about a lost generation and young people were said to be left with no future and no hope because of the scourge of Thatcherism. However, many of us fought against that and made sure that we did something with our lives so that we could have a future, and a lot of us are still here.</p><p>It is up to us to support our younger people and not keep talking them down by talking about a lost generation. If we tell people often enough that they are lost and have no hope, they will start to believe it and, when it gets to that stage, we will never get them back. Our job as community and national leaders and as elected members is to lead, build up and support all the people of Scotland and show them our positive vision of the future.</p><p>Let us look at some of the things that the Scottish Government has already done. The employment rate for 18 to 24-year-olds in Scotland is 62.9 per cent, which was higher than that in England between July and September 2011. We have invested in a record number of apprenticeship places. The Labour Party asked for that and then, when it got it, it did not want it any more. We have committed to ensuring that every 16 to 19-year-old is offered a learning or training place by delivering 46,500 training opportunities and 25,000 more modern apprenticeships, which is 60 per cent more than there were when we took office.</p><p>When we look at some of the things that have been done by the SNP minority Administration and now the SNP majority Administration, we can see the difference between their outlook of hope and vision for the future and the complete negativity from the Labour Party. In its time, Labour cut the number of new apprenticeship places by almost a fifth in 2006-07, and during consideration of the 2011-12 budget, it voted in a way that suggested that it no longer wanted modern apprenticeships. It says one thing and then does something entirely different. We have to not only say what we believe in but follow that up with deeds.</p><p>We can see what the Government has done even with the limited powers that it has. However, there is a better way. There is a future. In every school that I visit, and from every school that visits the Parliament, it is clear that young people are listening to the vision of the First Minister&#8217;s independence generation.

If it were not for him, a person in my generation probably would not have known what happened. He told me years ago that, between 1957 and 1958, there were up to six test detonations in the Pacific Ocean at Christmas Island that involved weapons that were many times more powerful than those that were used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>As the years moved on and he was no longer a councillor, I did not see him for a while, although I always saw him in the Paisley Daily Express&#8212;he would be talking about his latest campaign to represent the veterans in the area. I met him again earlier this year at the peace garden in Barshaw park in Paisley on the anniversary of Hiroshima, and we had another discussion. Once again, he captivated an audience of young and old people. He talked about what he went through and highlighted the horrors of nuclear weapons.</p><p>What Ken said meant something to me and others in my generation as we grew up in the 1980s, during the cold war, with the idea that the world could come to an end because of a nuclear holocaust. That sounds like hyperbole now, but as teenagers in the 1980s, we discussed that regularly. I think that so many of us in that generation became political because that was a major issue.</p><p>Ken McGinley and I spoke after we met at Barshaw park and I invited him to the opening of my constituency office. That was an important day for me and I wanted to include a man who had made an impact on my life. On a lighter note, that evening Ken met some people from Glenburn seniors forum, who have also helped me along the way. He told me that a woman told him that they had met before, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we danced at the Templars dance hall in Paisley.&#8221; Now, Ken must be quite a charismatic individual. That dance hall has been shut for about 40 years and the rest.

The veterans that we are talking about might not have been involved in a traditional battle, but they served their country and they have suffered as a consequence.

I see that members are laughing, but I promise that I will.</p><p>As has been mentioned today, 657,000 Scots are carers, and no doubt every one of us knows individuals who care for someone. In my area of Renfrewshire, there are 24,087 carers. I know that members are fed up with hearing about my personal circumstances&#8212;I just heard one of my colleagues say that&#8212;but I look after my wife, who has multiple sclerosis. I am technically her carer, but she would probably say that I have difficulty caring for myself. Luckily, I have a support mechanism in my family that enables me to do the job that I do. I am here partly because of that support, and partly because my wife Stacey Adam will not allow something as trivial as multiple sclerosis to prevent her from gaining any of the objectives that she wants in life.</p><p>However, other people who have to work in the private sector or in the public sector do not have that support mechanism. In my constituency, Lynn Williams&#8212;who has already been mentioned a couple of times&#8212;works for a caring organisation, but she is able to do that only because her employer is extremely flexible in allowing her also to care for a member of her family.</p><p>It was an SNP manifesto commitment to have a carers kite mark for employers. I was extremely interested in that, and I know that the minister is working with officials on a scoping paper for discussion with carers interests, which he will produce at a later date. We need to ensure that all third sector and private sector employers look at that. Most carers want to work, and it is only because of their circumstances that some of them can no longer work.</p><p>As the minister has said, it is important that we get all these things right. I have every confidence that we will and that we will progress with the implementation of the carers strategy. I will go through some of the recommendations of &#8220;Caring Together&#8221;. It is important that we develop a carers&#8217; rights charter and implement measures to identify carers better. A lot of carers are invisible and people do not know about them because, as has been mentioned, it is natural for families to take up the burden; they do not see it as a burden&#8212;they are just looking after their family member.</p><p>It is also important that we improve the quality and uptake of carer assessments and support plans; that goes back to what I mentioned earlier. Renfrewshire Carers Centre and carers centres elsewhere have been mentioned, and it is extremely important that we ensure that carers are represented on community health partnerships, as that will be a way for them to help to design the packages and what is available for carers in their areas.</p><p>&#8220;Getting it Right for Young Carers&#8221; recommends that we put in place measures to help professionals in education. I particularly liked the minister&#8217;s announcement of the pilot areas for the young carers authorisation card. I know that he has already identified one area, but there are at least 24,000 carers in Renfrewshire and I wonder whether he has thought of Renfrewshire as a place to pilot that measure for young carers as well.</p><p>One of my constituents, Sandra Webster, is a young woman with two autistic sons. She also has a daughter in sixth year who, last week, was brought in front of the headmaster and accused of being a truant because she was helping her mother. The school knew about her position, as did the local authority and her MSP. We should not get ourselves into such situations. That young woman is trying to get academic qualifications while helping her mother, who has admitted that she could not do anything without her daughter being there.</p><p>During the election campaign, we visited Renfrewshire Carers Centre and met the carers there. I was confident in the SNP manifesto and told people, &#8220;We&#8217;re dealing with your lives. You are the individuals who are dealing with this on a day-to-day basis. Yes, I have problems in my life, but I&#8217;m not in your shoes and don&#8217;t have to live your life.

I am a proud Paisley buddie and I am ambitious for the town, as are most people who are from towns such as Paisley&#8212;they are ambitious to see us build something for the future. A problem arises if we do not give people ambition and ideas for the future, showing them where we can go; negativity develops and they start to turn in on themselves. Luckily, over the past five years, we have shown that things can get better for Paisley if we have a can-do attitude.</p><p>I am a great believer in community-led regeneration. In fact, the Renfrewshire administration reinstated the local area committees with a budget of grant money from the general fund and some money from the towns fund. Through those cross-party groups, people were able to decide what they wanted themselves. I was the chair of a committee in Paisley south and said at the very first meeting, &#8220;Right. Let&#8217;s get out there and change our local community.&#8221; The local community thought that that was hyperbole from the big man again, but, with the limited funds that the group had, we made a difference.</p><p>For example, we got &#163;160,000 of external funding and invested &#163;20,000 ourselves for state-of-the-art tennis courts in Brodie park. It is an incredible thing, in this day and age, to have state-of-the-art municipal tennis courts that are free for all and that everybody can use. Now, 40 young people arrive at those courts every night of the week to learn to play tennis. It helped that, when we eventually made contact with Andy Murray&#8217;s mother, she held a gun to the head of Tennis Scotland&#8212;metaphorically speaking&#8212;and told it to give us the money. There is no point in having the elite of the sport at Braehead arena if local people are not allowed to play. If that is not the work of a strong community, I do not know what is.</p><p>I agree with the cabinet secretary that, over the years, community planning and work with local businesses, the community and public sector partners have been extremely important.

All three of those projects are now moving forward, but they had not moved forward before my colleague took control as leader of the council&#8212;obviously helped by his best man and friend on the council and now on the back benches.</p><p>We also invested in social housing&#8212;there has been talk of that today. There is a Scottish housing quality standard to meet by 2015 and the previous Labour administration said that it was privatise the housing stock or nothing, but we achieved the standard. It took three or four attempts to achieve it, but we got there in the end through the biggest investment in housing in Renfrewshire since the second world war.</p><p>I want to say one thing about the tax increment financing scheme. The cabinet secretary and I have known each other for many years. Renfrewshire Council made a bid to the scheme for the Glasgow airport economic investment zone. We are not taking the huff, but we will keep on at the cabinet secretary to have a look at the proposal, because it is a way of ensuring that we get the necessary infrastructure in an area where lack of infrastructure has been identified as a major constraint. It would give us a chance to create 3,300 jobs over 25 years through investment of &#163;17&#160;million. That is quite a good deal, even if I say so myself, so perhaps the cabinet secretary could consider it.</p><p>I want to talk about one of our local further education colleges, Reid Kerr College, whose principal, Audrey Cumberford, has invested in a state-of-the-art institute of construction and engineering. Some of her colleagues think that that is quite a strange thing to do in these difficult times. The college has spent &#163;4&#160;million ensuring that it has increased space for training in motor vehicles, electrical work and the fast-developing area of renewable energy. It is training people such as electricians so that they can get involved in the renewables side of things, which is important. It is a college that believes in investing in the future.</p><p>I am running out of time. I would like the cabinet secretary to consider having an economic zone or area in Paisley town centre, because that is definitely something that we need. That would help us to hold events such as the one that Renfrewshire Council and Paisley vision board held recently, when 37,500 people partied in Paisley town centre as they watched the Christmas lights being switched on. Incidentally, takings for restaurants and pubs in the area were up 55 per cent, which shows that people spent their money.</p><p>Despite Tesco&#8217;s breaking new ground in Wallneuk in the new year and the &#163;9&#160;million investment in Gilmour Street station, I would still like the cabinet secretary to fund some of the things that I have asked for. I have given local examples from Paisley and Renfrew, but I have no doubt that other members could identify similar initiatives from their areas. It is important that I am ambitious for the future of my town and my community.

It is particularly funny that Mary Fee should ask that question, given that, in Renfrewshire Council, she voted for a Tory budget that would close a care home in Paisley.</p><p>Mary Fee rose&#8212;</p><p>I want to move on and talk about the matter in hand. I am talking about people with long-term conditions.</p><p>The minister was right to say that there must be a shift from the traditional model of delivery of care. Given the severe financial cuts from Westminster, there is a need for strong leadership on health and social care, particularly in relation to the needs of older people and people with long-term conditions. In Renfrewshire, at the high flats at Rowan Court in my council ward in Paisley, work has been done to create a social area at the bottom of the flats, where the older people can meet. People look after one another, which means that older people can remain part of their community, rather than facing the expense of going into a care home.</p><p>We also dealt with delayed discharge. There is free bus travel for elderly people now, but there was a time when Renfrewshire Council used to send people doon the water for a summer trip. We used that money to help with delayed discharges.</p><p>We also have the groundbreaking reaching older adults in Renfrewshire&#8212;ROAR&#8212;partnership, which is ensuring that we can work with everyone and that people are not left alone.</p><p>Something that does not work is Strathclyde partnership for transport&#8217;s dial-a-bus scheme. I have brought the issue up again and again. Renfrewshire Council spends &#163;3 million a year on the system, and it annoys me when I hear of elderly people being abandoned at clubs and having to get taxis when no one came to pick them up. A report from the council says that it would be cheaper to provide a 24/7 taxi service. We are spending money that could be better used.</p><p>In 2007, when the SNP administration came in in Renfrewshire Council, the scrutiny board had a look at demographic change in Renfrewshire and how we could deliver services. It was important to do that at an early stage, because we could see that there were difficulties ahead&#8212;and that was before the financial problems that we currently face. At that time, an expert from the University of Paisley&#8212;as it will always be to me; I know that it is the University of the West of Scotland now&#8212;told us that the retirement age was the idea of the Prussian premier Bismarck. Bismarck learned that most of the people who worked for him died at the age of 64, so he decided to establish a retirement age of 65. We heard about the need to keep older people involved in society for longer.</p><p>It is important that we have the services that older people need. Some 20 per cent of the &#163;70 million change fund, which is rising to &#163;80 million in 2012-13, will support carers. That is extremely important. I have been dealing with a case in which a gentleman has Alzheimer&#8217;s and terminal cancer and all his wife wants is to get him back home so that he can spend his final years with his life partner.</p><p>How we deal with the health and social wellbeing of our older population defines us as a nation. There is a need to consider different models of delivery, and such work must be led by health and social care professionals, who need the Parliament&#8217;s support. We must move forward together.

As with other issues that we have discussed, I never really thought about looked-after children before I became a councillor and had to deal with cases. One thing that has become clear is the tremendous work of people in social work departments across the country. They deal with difficult situations and have a difficult job and they work with families to get the best for them.</p><p>Anne McTaggart was right to say that we should support those who look after the children. It is hard enough to be a parent at the best of times without having to be the parent of a child with a challenging background. One point that has come out for me in the past few years is how important it is to take on the responsible role as a corporate parent. All the children of Scotland are our children. If we do not get things right here and now, we will create another debate for us to have in future about social problems further down the line. I am extremely pleased that we have had such an open debate, in which everyone has agreed that we have to deal with the situation.</p><p>A lot of work has been done, but we can still achieve so much more. The minister is right that every single child wants stability and predictability at home. When it comes to dealing with looked-after children, that is what we must aim for.</p><p>Given my local authority background, I know that it can be extremely difficult for kinship carers to get access to funds, go through the process and get support. Nine times out of 10 in a difficult circumstance, family members will just take the children in&#8212;because that is something that families do&#8212;and they will not be aware that there is any form of support available for them.</p><p>The minister was right to say that she is quite happy to ruffle a few feathers to get this situation sorted. Her passion for the subject is clear and I believe that that same passion for change can be seen today in the chamber.</p><p>Some of the young people we are talking about have very challenging backgrounds. In Renfrewshire, the council tends not to try to put children into alternative care unless it has everything that is needed for the care and protection of that child. The number of looked-after children in the area is high due to the rates of social deprivation and drug and alcohol abuse there. Those are issues that we will have to address in order to deal with the situation.</p><p>At 31 October this year, Renfrewshire had 765 looked-after children, 321 of whom were in accommodation. It looks like it will face an on-going situation of looking for permanent families for 50 children at any given time. The problem is that it is difficult to get foster parents. No matter what local authorities do, it is difficult for them to get people involved in fostering. I agree with Kevin Stewart that the best people to sell the idea of being a foster parent are foster parents, because they can tell others what they have gained from the experience.</p><p>Members of staff in Renfrewshire Council, who are ably led by the director of service, Peter MacLeod, are motivated to succeed in this area. In the first half of this year, the council managed to get 13 children adopted into a home&#8212;a significantly higher figure than the previous year. That was because a resource was made available; the council made a decision that getting children adopted was an individual social worker&#8217;s job for that period. It is important that local authorities look to that model for the future.</p><p>The minister is quite right to work with and ask more of local authorities on this issue. Quicker intervention might be better in some cases, but the correct decisions, rather than rushed ones, have to be made.</p><p>I mentioned resource. It is not a case of just throwing money at the situation; in a lot of cases there can be better working within various local authority departments.</p><p>It is important that we get this right and that we all take our role as corporate parents seriously. Much work has been completed, but we need to achieve much, much more. We all know the social benefits to our country of getting this right. If we do not, we will create future problems&#8212;and future debates&#8212;for ourselves.

I mean that the discussion or argument is simple.</p><p>She keeps phoning up my wife to ask why that court down south is making decisions for Scots law. That is the kind of discussion that people who are not in the legal profession are having. The common sense of ordinary hard-working people means that they cannot understand why criminal cases from the Scots legal system, of which we are justifiably proud, have to be heard outwith Scotland. They are asking themselves why there has to be another tier after the High Court in criminal cases, and I admit that I feel the same way.</p><p>The establishment of the UK Supreme Court under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 has led to an increase in the potential for judgments in high-profile criminal cases in Scotland to be overturned on appeal. I believe whole-heartedly in justice and everyone&#8217;s right to appeal, but some of the decisions that have been made have upset the public in Scotland.</p><p>That state of affairs has been caused by a quirk of various acts since devolution. Within the UK, Scots law is no longer on an equal footing with the law in the rest of the nation states of the union. People who know more than I do have said as much. Brian McConnachie QC, who is vice-chairman of the Faculty of Advocates criminal bar association, said:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to argue that we should have something different here than in England.&#8221;</p><p>I agree with some of the recommendations of Lord McCluskey&#8217;s review group. It believes that the High Court of Justiciary should remain the final court of appeal in Scottish criminal cases, and that an appeal to the Supreme Court should require the granting by the High Court of a certificate that the case raises a point of law of general public importance. It also believes that it is not appropriate that the Supreme Court be required by statute to apply the test of miscarriage of justice in Scottish criminal appeals. My simple ideal of the law tells me that those are good ideas for Lord McCluskey to proceed with.</p><p>The Scots legal system is one of the mainstays of Scottish life. It was a part of Scotland before the union, it has been a part of Scotland during the union and it will be an important part of Scotland after the union. However, the debate is about the current situation and the quirk that means that Scotland is the only part of the UK in which a case can bypass the High Court and be heard in the Supreme Court. This is not a discussion just for the chamber or the legal profession; it is one that Scots are having the length and breadth of the country.

If the cabinet secretary had to put them all in a motion, she would probably need a digital archive of her own to hold them all.</p><p>The preservation of heritage is extremely important. In Paisley, we have the historic &#8220;Arbuthnott Missal&#8221;, which is a Catholic prayer service book that survived the reformation. It is the only one of its kind in existence. Many people have not been able to get access to it or see it because it is so precious and so old, but it is now available online. If the Presiding Officer will indulge me, I will read some information about it.</p><p>&#8220;The Missal, which is locked in a vault at Paisley Library, has only been seen by a handful of people in the past century because of the damage it could suffer through being handled and being exposed to artificial light. Now everyone can flick through its pages&#8221;.</p><p>However, the next part is a comment on the technology.</p><p>&#8220;Not quite everyone ... the Missal can only be seen in Internet Explorer using an additional ponderous Microsoft plug-in.&#8221;</p><p>There are clearly some problems with making things available digitally.</p><p>I attended last night&#8217;s event; the Scottish ten project brings many things alive again because it enables us to see history. One of the things I found fascinating is that a teacher can walk his or her class through the construction of Stirling castle, demonstrate how it was built and the materials that were used, then dismantle it again, all using the computer technology. In the long term, it could be a wonderful resource.</p><p>Fountain Gardens in Paisley has also been used in the project. It is one of the oldest parts of the town and it is named after a fountain in the gardens, ironically. It was used as the template to check the equipment. The old statue that has been there for some time was created by John Love, after whom, incidentally, Love Street is named. That is a place close to my heart because I used to go and see St Mirren play there. I do not think that the gentleman would have thought that, for years to come, people would be saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not be going to that Love Street in two weeks&#8217; time, after that.&#8221; However, the friends of Fountain Gardens are looking at investment to improve the statue in the gardens.</p><p>For too long, our greatest landmarks have been left in disrepair. Another perfect example&#8212;I make no apologies for being parochial&#8212;is that we used to have a jail in the county buildings in Paisley, where there is now a 1960s and 1970s modernistic shopping centre. We are the only people with a river running through our town who actually built over it. That was the vision in the past. Alexander Stoddart, the great Paisley sculptor, told me that if we had the vision and the money he could take down that modernist piece of nonsense and rebuild the jail brick by brick. People always talk about these old buildings and the heritage of which they are an important part. With the right technology, we can go into Paisley schools and show pupils what was there in the past. The project is a wonderful step forward.</p><p>The ScotlandsPeople family history thing is quite good. I remember when Councillor Jim Mitchell way back in the 1990s decided that Elvis&#8217;s family had come from Paisley, and he and I had to go all the way to Edinburgh to research the project. I will not tell members what happened. It was quite a tenuous link. I do not think that he did come from Paisley, but Jim managed to bring the council meeting to a standstill as he serenaded the provost with some Elvis numbers in the five or 10 minutes he was given to speak for.</p><p>Willie Coffey is right. So many people are interested in shows such as &#8220;Who Do You Think You Are?&#8221; It is about tourism and bringing people into industrial towns, or post-industrial towns such as Paisley. Although those towns are not top of the list for people to visit, people want to see the mill that their great-great-granny worked in and hear about the mill lassies and their heritage. These things are important.</p><p>Paisley recently had the dubious honour of featuring in &#8220;Who Do You Think You Are?&#8221; because the Bee Gees come from the town. I apologise for that. It cannot all be good. We have Paolo Nutini and Gerry Rafferty to balance that. I also remember an episode with David Tennant. Like Clare Adamson, I am a bit of a sci-fi geek. I always found it strange that Doctor Who needed to use a TV show to investigate his past when he has a time machine, but nevertheless it was an interesting show. People want to go and see things from their past.</p><p>It is interesting that we can show people all over the world Paisley abbey and Paisley&#8217;s history. We can sell the town to people who are abroad, to encourage them to come back and see what is available. That goes for other places in Scotland, too; everyone can do it.</p><p>As with any nation, if we are to move forward it is important to understand who we are and where we came from&#8212;the good and the bad.

[Laughter.]</p><p>The subject is close to my heart and I appreciate the minister&#8217;s comments that, although much work has been done, there is so much more that we can and will do. I never had experience of mental health issues until I became an elected member of Renfrewshire Council and dealt with some groups&#8212;although I think that that may not have been the case, because the stigma of mental health means that, without knowing it, I probably did have dealings with people who were suffering from various forms of mental ill-health. It either affects you or your family: my son James was diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum last year. We have had to deal with it.</p><p>I welcome the consultation on the mental health strategy, which includes 14 high-level outcomes to measure the success of what we can achieve. It will ensure that we can close any gaps that exist. The existing work and further actions should be prioritised to reach the challenge.</p><p>The minister is correct that the Scottish Government&#8217;s first dementia strategy was published in 2010. I had met someone in the Renfrewshire Carers Centre and I came across him again on Saturday night in a licensed premises. His wife has dementia and he was there because he was able to spend some time on his own&#8212;which is down to the Scottish Government. He was proud of my being his MSP, he was pleased with what had happened and he wanted to know whether I would sing a song&#8212;which showed what his major problems were at that stage. I was more concerned with the problems that he had to deal with daily. My wife has since told me that I must deal with my work during my working day and not take it home with me&#8212;it had a profound effect on me. I have noticed it in my colleagues on Renfrewshire Council, such as Lorraine Cameron in Paisley and Provost Lawson, who were working with survivors of bereavement by suicide in Renfrewshire, and whom we met at a tree they planted outside Renfrewshire Council&#8217;s Paisley headquarters at Renfrewshire house. It makes it so much more real and emotional when we see people who have suffered because of these issues.</p><p>I welcome the target of a 20 per cent reduction by 2013. It is important to set targets. We are dealing with real people with real lives and real issues.</p><p>We must move away from there being a stigma attached to mental health. My colleague Dennis Robertson said that we all have mental heath and that the issue is how healthy is our mental health. Since my election, I have met so many people in Paisley who have suffered because of the problem. They include a Scrabble champion who, along with his wife, suffers from depression. It took him longer to admit it because Paisley men do not get depression. Another example is the woman who would not leave her home because of her fear of everything, but who now enjoys writing poetry and other artistic pursuits. Another Paisley example is a woman who has become a writer. It is proof that, when working with local authorities and partners in our communities, we can make a difference in small ways to help these people&#8217;s lives.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hope that comment was not directed at me.

I heard Mr Baker say that there are no rabbits being pulled out of hats. I say to him, &#8220;It&#8217;s called an election. You have a manifesto; you have the election; you win the election; and then you have the spending review. If you do it all openly and above board, everyone knows what you are going to offer and do.&#8221;</p><p>Mr Baker acknowledges Westminster&#8217;s cuts, yet at the same time says that Labour wants to do something different. I remind Mr Baker that it was a Labour chancellor who said that the cuts that the Government would have to make would be deeper and tougher than those made by Thatcher.</p><p>Talking about deeper and tougher than Thatcher, Willie Rennie had the audacity to say that he was thinking about vulnerable people, while the Liberal Democrats are in a coalition Government that is attacking people on the disability living allowance. Those vulnerable people in our communities have no idea how their families will continue. Mr McMahon and I heard only a couple of weeks ago at a cross-party group meeting about some of the results that will come from that.</p><p>Mr Gavin Brown told us to stop whining about Westminster and to take our handout from it. That is part of the problem, Mr Brown. As the cabinet secretary said, the further powers of independence are needed.</p><p>We have been told that Westminster is at war with the economy. The only war that it is bringing to the people of Scotland who work in the public sector is increasing employee pension contributions and it is threatening the public sector and Scotland with an &#163;8.4 million per month bill and &#163;102 million per year invoice for the good of it.</p><p>While Westminster wages war, the Scottish Government has offered &#163;826 million of Barnett consequentials. At a time of real-terms cuts from Westminster, the Scottish Government has offered &#163;2 billion to the likes of Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board to help front-line services and people in our communities.</p><p>The Christie commission is very important for public sector reform. Willie Rennie said that the reform of the police and the fire and rescue services was not a good example. I argue that it is a good example, because it shows that we have the ability to look at the plan and have a centralised force that at the same time will be accountable to local people in all 32 local authorities. It is entirely up to the grouping of local authorities whether they wish to have it in any other shape or form. For me, that is a perfect example.</p><p>If the cabinet secretary is looking at public sector reform, I ask him to look at the Strathclyde partnership for transport. It gets &#163;40 million per year from a partner organisation, it has corporate costs of nearly &#163;10 million per annum and it has loan recharges of &#163;8.9 million per annum, but nobody knows what that sum is paying for or what it has built. I ask that we look at the SPT, as there are better ways of delivering transport in our areas.</p><p>On regeneration, I am pleased that the small business bonus will continue. In places such as Paisley, it is much appreciated. Empty property relief is a fantastic idea, which will help Paisley High Street and other high streets across Scotland ensure that they are full of retailers, rather than empty shops.</p><p>On the four enterprise areas, I ask the cabinet secretary if he could look at Renfrewshire Council&#8217;s plan for Glasgow airport enterprise area. If we are to look at matters such as renewables, we have steel engineering on our doorstep in Doosan Babcock, along with William Tracey and WH Malcolm, which are already working in the industry. It might be a good idea to look at Glasgow airport.</p><p>In closing&#8212;I am well ahead of schedule for a change, Presiding Officer&#8212;I will say that we live in very difficult economic times and it is important that we work to represent and provide for all the people of Scotland. The cabinet secretary has been bold and radical during these uncertain times and it is time for sobriety of thought from politicians, not the heckles that we have had from the sidelines.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651370", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Spending Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been interesting.

The reason why most of us get involved in politics is to make things better.</p><p>The tone of the debate has been extremely good. Richard Baker and Gavin Brown were very constructive and obviously gave some plaudits to the cabinet secretary, too. Patrick Harvie said that there are various things that he wants to do. For a lot of those, we need extra powers in the Parliament, but Mr Harvie and I probably agree on that anyway.</p><p>The issue is too important for us to play party politics in this debate. That has shown through, because we have had a constructive debate.</p><p>We have a cabinet secretary with a proven record of working through the difficult economic times in a minority SNP Government. I would go so far as to say that he is probably the safest pair of hands that the Parliament has had since its inception.</p><p>We must remember that, behind every glossy document, we are dealing with the lives of people in our communities, with businesses and with organisations. The decisions that we make here make differences in our communities.</p><p>The strategy is an update of the 2007 document. Its priorities were: a supportive business environment; learning, skills and wellbeing; infrastructure development; effective government; and equity. Those were important then and they are now, but things have changed and the Scottish Government has changed with them. We have also added the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>Unfortunately, the dark cloud of Westminster is now coming in, as the Government there makes decisions that will cause continued problems for the Scottish economy. It is important that the Westminster chancellor listens to the chorus of support for other fiscal stimulus to respond to the slowing economy that he could create.</p><p>On the positive side, the strategy mentions things that we are doing, and can do, much better. Smarter procurement is one of those&#8212;it has been mentioned on numerous occasions by members from all parties&#8212;as is working with businesses to make it easier for companies to find and compete for public contracts.</p><p>What the strategy does not mention is that more than 95 per cent of the Scottish Government&#8217;s main contractors are paid within 10 working days, otherwise it makes it very difficult for smaller businesses with less cash to bid for Scottish Government contracts. Of the 55,000 registered companies on the public contracts Scotland website, 84 per cent are SMEs and 75 per cent of the contracts that are awarded go to SMEs. That shows that things are going in the proper direction, although there is still work that we can do. For example, in Renfrewshire we have a local fair trade hub and a business that could supply school uniforms to the education department, but there are difficulties with that to get round routinely. We must work on such matters and ensure that we make progress.</p><p>The Christie commission has stated that there is a pressing need for public reform. Its four key objectives are not exactly rocket science; people who work in the public sector knew that those things had to change. The objectives are: building public services around people and communities&#8212;the Government is pleased to say that it takes that seriously; prioritising prevention; more effective work between delivery organisations to integrate services locally; and improved accountability and transparency. Those are words in a document, but we must ensure that we make them work.</p><p>I mentioned at the recent Public Audit Committee meeting that Strathclyde partnership for transport provides similar transport services to those that councils offer. A perfect example is the MyBus dial-a-bus service, which continues to cost millions of pounds and, to the disappointment of the people who use it, does not work well. Renfrewshire Council, on the other hand, could provide a 24/7 taxi service without the &#163;10 million annual senior management cost of SPT.</p><p>When we are making difficult decisions, we must consider such situations. The proposed single police force and single fire service are an excellent example of taking that into account. Some, such as the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, had issues with the proposals, but those were obviously to do with accountability. After last week&#8217;s announcements, we can see that the savings will be made. We must keep an eye on that, because that is the point of creating single organisations. It also ensures that we will still have fire and police services that will do something for us.</p><p>We have already mentioned education. It is not misty eyed to say that the people of Scotland are our greatest asset. It is important to have a sustainable economy, and free education is an investment in the future to ensure that we come out of the other side of the economic recession fit to do everything.</p><p>The Labour Party asked for 20,000 modern apprenticeships when the SNP was a minority Government and John Swinney gave it 25,000. We will continue with that between now and the end of the parliamentary session. It is important to remember the 16 to 19-year-olds who will end up in education or an apprenticeship, but we should think about older apprentices who, perhaps because of what happened to a business, have lost their jobs and not finished their apprenticeships.</p><p>In my area, Reid Kerr College has invested in construction and engineering and is looking to get into renewables.

I have found out to my cost this week that our connectivity in Renfrewshire is very good&#8212;I might wish that it had gone down at one point last week, but in the end that is not what happened.</p><p>A large part of Renfrewshire is rural and it has problems similar to those in the constituencies that other members have discussed. My colleague Derek Mackay represents that part of Renfrewshire. There are a few not-spots, as Fiona McLeod described them, in Renfrewshire, in 3G or within the broadband network. When going cross country from west to east in the train, it is noticeable that the 3G signal is patchy all the way; I have experienced that difficulty. In my case that might be a good thing, but it is a problem if we cannot even have such connectivity in the central belt of Scotland on the main rail connection between our two major cities.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I spoke about Scottish broadcasting and the Scottish digital network. I spoke of a woman called Sandra Webster, who has two autistic sons and is a carer. To me, she is a hero, because she spends all her time with her children, trying to ensure that they have a quality of life. She is lucky in that, because she lives somewhere such as Paisley, through social networking she can contact many of her friends and fellow carers, talk about things and have company when she goes home at night, the door gets locked and the boys get put to bed. It is not only in urban Scotland that such situations exist. The cabinet secretary is correct to say that it is important that we have social integration when it comes to broadband.</p><p>As I have said, I am quite lucky now. Back in the days when we had dial-up, I remember trying to download the Scotland Act 1998 when it was published. I left it overnight but eventually gave up and went to the library to read the act, because downloading it was next to impossible. Access to broadband is vital for business, because we must ensure that the whole of Scotland is competitive and that we can showcase our goods and wares to the rest of the world. If we get left behind on connectivity, in rural Scotland or in urban Scotland, we will get left behind. We cannot afford to let that happen.</p><p>I am pleased with the Scottish Government&#8217;s national broadband plan. The Scottish Government is working with Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and local authorities to develop a strategic national broadband plan to ensure the roll-out of the next generation of broadband in all parts of Scotland. That is vital when we are dealing with issues for businesses.</p><p>Earlier today, I went to an STV breakfast at which representatives from STV talked about the multiplatform way in which they deliver news and everything throughout Scotland. They highlighted that it is important for us to ensure that everyone in our communities will be able to access such services in the future. It might be an idea for us to look at that, so that the whole of Scotland can have such provision.</p><p>It is important that we continue actively to seek further powers. We in this Parliament are the individuals who must ensure that broadband connectivity can be supplied for the people in our communities, because companies throughout the world will not be interested in various parts of rural Scotland. We must ensure that they want to talk about it and that we have the power to deliver, so more powers on the issue would be welcome.</p><p>I agree with the Scottish Government&#8217;s realistic commitment to provide broadband for all our rural communities. In order for Scotland to compete on the international stage, we must ensure that the whole of our nation has access to broadband and that our nation can engage with the rest of the world and be competitive.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Connectivity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As many members know, I am the member for Paisley, so it may seem unusual that I am in speaking in the debate, given that Paisley does not have many rural areas.

Why can&#8217;t she get a localised news network?&#8221; I am not talking about just putting a see-you-Jimmy bunnet on the network but about having a localised news network or television output.

In particular, I agree with his point that we do ourselves a disservice if we cannot agree on this important issue. However, I believe that the cabinet secretary was not having a sideswipe at Jackie Baillie; she was merely responding to some of the points of view that she had put across at the start of the debate.</p><p>There is a first for us all, anyway: I have agreed with Hugh Henry at the start of the debate. The amendment in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s name ensures that this welcome, important and valuable debate is more focused and concerned with the actual delivery of services and with the quality of service for our older people. We are dealing with people&#8217;s lives, and Hugh Henry put it aptly. We are dealing with families and with older people&#8212;we are dealing with people whom we know in our communities.</p><p>The current situation with Southern Cross Healthcare is concerning to me. In Renfrewshire, more than 300 individuals use the company&#8217;s services, and it has a problem. I am glad to hear that the cabinet secretary is working with COSLA and other partner organisations to find a solution. The priority is quality and continuity of care, and I have an interest in that.</p><p>This is one of the most important debates that we will have. Care for older people is one of the biggest challenges, because of the changing demography that has been mentioned a number of times in the debate. In 2031, 38 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s population will be over 65. When I first became a councillor in Paisley and Renfrewshire, at the beginning of the term, our scrutiny and petitions board considered how we could deliver services for an ageing population. We had to consider the matter proactively in order to move forward.</p><p>Jackie Baillie is correct: how we look after society&#8217;s vulnerable members defines how civilised a society we are. We all agree on that. How we get there and deliver the services is the subject of debate, but we are all agreed about how we must look after our older people.</p><p>We live in difficult economic times, and sustainability and delivery are the important things. It is not all about money. In Renfrewshire, we had success by taking a small fund of money that had been used for something else for older people to alleviate the problem with delayed discharge. That worked out. We should be talking about how we can make differences in that way, rather than just throwing money at the problems.</p><p>This is not a blame game. Too often, the public get fed up with us all for sabre-rattling and falling out with one another over issues such as this. It is a matter of delivering service&#8212;locally in particular. The people in social work departments in councils know how to deal with social care, and they can deliver the service best. It is a matter of working in such a way as to make CHPs and other organisations deliver. It is not about reinventing the wheel; it is about working with what we have and making it work for our older people.</p><p>During the election campaign, I heard from the Labour candidate in Paisley about the proposed national care service, but it was unfortunate that Labour provided no guarantees or detailed proposals on integration and costs. I have to say to Jackie Baillie that it almost seemed as if Labour was sitting on the sidelines on the issue&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Caring for Scotland&#8217;s Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members are about to hear something that they will not have heard from me before in 20 years of knowing Hugh Henry: I agree with Hugh Henry.

I was pointing out only that, in the debate during the election campaign, we heard no concrete proposals.</p><p>Scotland spends &#163;4.5&#160;billion every year on older people&#8217;s services. The cabinet secretary was correct to say that it is not about throwing money at various projects and that it is about intervening at an early stage. Such an approach to delivering services is not only cheaper but a better way of keeping older people in their communities, with their families and neighbours.</p><p>In my council ward in Renfrewshire there are high flats at Rowan Court, which are occupied by older people. There is a public area to which residents can come down, so that they can meet their neighbours in their community and not become isolated. The approach works well. Last year, we had a very bad winter. When we talk about services for older people, we must be careful to commend social work departments throughout Scotland. During three weeks of the worst weather in decades, members of Renfrewshire Council&#8217;s social work department made 25,000 visits. Council employees were willing to deliver a service that was above and beyond the call of duty, and we should never forget that.</p><p>As I said, caring for Scotland&#8217;s older people is one of the biggest challenges that we will face in the coming years. I am thankful that the Scottish Government and the Parliament have a good track record on care of the elderly and many other social care issues. The challenge should bring us together, rather than divide us. I will put it bluntly: we are dealing with people&#8217;s lives. The delivery of services is more important than any member&#8217;s attempt at one-upmanship.

My office will be locked from now on, as soon as I get the keys.</p><p>I stand before the chamber a proud Paisley buddie, the grandson of a mill lassie from Ferguslie. There has been a lot of talk about legacies. In Paisley, because the mill lassies were always paid the most money, they held the purse strings and were charged with decision making, so we ended up with a legacy of very strong-willed women, one of whom I married. She met Prince Charles last night, and I will be sending an apology to the palace as soon as I can.</p><p>Paisley is my home town, and it is an honour to be the first member in this Parliament to represent the town in its entirety. My mother-in-law has often said that I am unique. I thought that she was being less than complimentary, but it turns out that she was right.</p><p>It is important to remember some of the politicians who have represented my town in the past. Hugh Henry and Wendy Alexander have represented various parts of Paisley since the reconvening of Parliament, but I will also take time to mention a Paisley buddie who represented the town and always fought its corner: Councillor Jim Mitchell, who died earlier this year. He was a father figure to me and a major influence in my life and my political life. He was also very involved in Derek Mackay&#8217;s political life. He dedicated his life to the people of Paisley, both as a local activist and during 30 years as a councillor, and he never lost his passion for Scottish independence. I mention that because Jimmy&#8217;s ghost will be sitting there saying, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t get independence into your speech.&#8221; He is missed every day, and I will endeavour to represent Paisley in a manner of which he would be proud. However, I am quite glad that he is not here today, because he would be telling me everything that I have done wrong and how I could have made my speech a lot better.</p><p>On my way in here today, people said, &#8220;You&#8217;re talking about sport, George. When are you going to mention your passion for St Mirren?&#8221; Well, here it is.</p><p>I will mention some other people who have represented the great town of Paisley, this time in its sporting endeavours. In 1959, David Lapsley lifted the Scottish cup. I was not there&#8212;I was born in 1969, although I may look a wee bit older. I had the honour of naming a street after Mr Lapsley. Although he was not born in Paisley, he adopted the town and represented it well over the years. In 1987, Billy Abercromby&#8212;who had his own problems with alcohol and everything else after he left football, although thankfully he is getting beyond that&#8212;represented the town very well.</p><p>Those points are important, because they show how sport can make a difference in a community or town such as Paisley. On both those occasions, everyone in the community put aside their differences and supported their local football team. Regardless of which football team they actually supported, they supported their town. We even got to the stage in 1959 when Mr Lapsley was pronounced the king of Paisley.</p><p>Sporting success can make a difference in our communities, but it is not all about winning trophies. As the motion quite rightly states, it is about access to sport. It is good that the Scottish Government is providing most of the investment for the Glasgow Commonwealth games, which will bring financial benefit for all of Scotland and the west in particular. As everyone knows, Glasgow airport is in fact in Paisley, and in Renfrewshire we are saying that we are the gateway to the games.</p><p>The SNP-led council administration has been investing in sports for the future. There has been investment of &#163;7 million in Seedhill and Ralston playing fields to provide 3G pitches and better changing facilities. The administration has been working with St Mirren at Allanton playing fields to provide a new training centre for our Premier League team. Regardless of which team you support, it is a benefit for any town like Paisley to have a Scottish Premier League football team. We are also currently investing &#163;92 million in an education and leisure capital expenditure programme that will upgrade many of our sporting facilities. All of that has been done during times of financial constraint: it is all about priorities, and sport is one of our priorities in Renfrewshire.</p><p>The Lagoon leisure centre in Paisley will have &#163;7 million-worth of refurbishment. The on-going development of the community sporting hubs in Paisley recently received more funding from both the local area committees. That will ensure that sporting clubs can join together, and it will offer them hope that they can still endeavour to do their best in their sport and encourage them to become part of the community hub network.</p><p>I am looking for further funding for tennis courts in Brodie park, where there is an old red ash court that is only used for one week after Wimbledon. It is not just about football; it is about other sports, too. I have been looking for that funding for some time. We need to get some people who are involved in tennis to take control and get some investment, as well as getting community activists involved.</p><p>In the same area we had a play park for pensioners, which the media found quite interesting. For &#163;20,000 we got a gym for people to use in the public park. That is not a new idea, and it is not rocket science. It was laughed at initially, but it has been very successful. It provides access for people of all ages and ensures that everyone can mix in the park, which is how it was meant to be used.</p><p>Renfrewshire also has its award-winning diversionary street stuff project, which involves the council, the police, St Mirren, a local bus company and various other partners. We have street football, a gym bus and a youth bus, which encourage young people not to be antisocial and to have healthy lifestyles.</p><p>I am a great believer in getting involved in those programmes, rather than just seeing what happens. I once met a young boy who said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know the football was here, big man&#8221;&#8212;which seems to be what I get called when I am out and about&#8212;&#8220;but if I had known I wouldn&#8217;t have had these four cans of lager. I like a lager.&#8221; &#8220;So do I,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but the difference is that I&#8217;m 40 and you&#8217;re 14.&#8221; At the end of the day, all such young men want to be footballers, and if they can access football through those means we will be able to address that 5 per cent of young people who might end up getting involved in antisocial behaviour.</p><p>Sport is about making a difference to people&#8217;s lives.
