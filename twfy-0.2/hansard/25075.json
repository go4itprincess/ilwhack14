However, those were not the worst euphemisms that we heard. As John Finnie said, some children are told that they are &#8220;going to a party&#8221;. The spectre of a child being told by their family that they are going on holiday, to visit their relatives or to attend a celebration, only to be made to undergo a violation of themselves and their bodies, in their earliest and most vulnerable years, was the most disturbing thing for me.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s round table included representatives of a great range of organisations that are active on the issue, including Fatou Baldeh&#8212;I hope that I pronounced her name correctly&#8212;who is herself a survivor. We touched on many issues, one of which is data. How do we work out how many procedures have taken place, when the data are drawn from census projections of the number of people in the so-called at-risk communities? We hear reports, and one person&#8217;s anecdotal evidence is another person&#8217;s qualitative evidence.</p><p>It was put to us that it seems strange that no one has presented to a general practitioner, although there are so many families from at-risk communities. However, is that any wonder? If a child were to report having undergone FGM, they would have to criminalise their parents. Family members might be prosecuted. The relationships in families&#8212;including the power relationships&#8212;are clearly strong, not to mention the relationships in communities, which put pressure on families.</p><p>As John Finnie said, it was pointed out that we must be careful about the terms that we use. &#8220;Female genital mutilation&#8221; is not a term that is in common use. A person who was asked by a health worker whether they had undergone FGM might well not recognise the term and say no.</p><p>The overwhelming view from the meeting was that action to tackle FGM must be sensitive. We must not be tolerant, permissive or lax, but we must show the positive sensitivity that Malcolm Chisholm described so well. Mukami McCrum, from the Kenyan Women in Scotland Association, suggested that if people who are sensitive to negative portrayals of their community in debates and the media regard action as a broad attack on the community, they will withdraw from the debate and the problem will become even more hidden.</p><p>Amnesty International has campaigned for a Europe-wide approach to FGM and has stated:</p><p>&#8220;The debate in the UK about more prosecutions misses the point. Legal repression, although it may have its place, is not the best answer.</p><p>We need to work ... with the communities where this happens to try to change attitudes, not to drive the problem further underground ... We should consider the best interests of the children before we rush to send their parents to prison.&#8221;</p><p>There is experience of dealing with the issue in other European countries. France has a very aggressive programme of screening which, it was pointed out to us, would only retraumatise those who had been through the experience and would subject many innocent people to an invasive examination. We have heard parallels drawn with the issue of whether there needs to be similarly aggressive screening for sexual abuse, the rates of which are, unfortunately, much higher according to all our estimates.</p><p>We did hear some good news, however. Mukami McCrum told us about action that has been taken in Kenya that has reduced the incidence of FGM from 90 to 25 per cent. That is still 25 per cent too much, but it is progress. Burkina Faso has done likewise.</p><p>Anela Anwar from Roshni said:</p><p>&#8220;we need to put a lot of sustainable effort into community engagement programmes. Without engaging communities&#8212;men, women and girls&#8212;on it and empowering young girls and women to make their own choices while staying safe, we will not get anywhere.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 30 January 2014; c 1782.]</p><p>That is also the view of the Scottish Refugee Council, as expressed at the committee and to members today. We cannot tackle FGM without female empowerment. We must also provide healthcare training to ensure that there is a sensitivity out there and that people can see the warning signs both in healthcare and in schooling.</p><p>I have read some apologies for FGM from anthropologists and others, and they disgust me as much as the practice itself. FGM is gender-based violence. It is child abuse, it is grotesque and it must end.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882339", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Female Genital Mutilation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "&#8220;Circumcision&#8221;, &#8220;growing up&#8221; and &#8220;cleansing&#8221; are euphemisms for female genital mutilation that are in common use, as the Equal Opportunities Committee heard when we held a round-table discussion on the subject a week ago.

Whenever the Equality Act 2010 is mentioned in the Equal Opportunities Committee, my colleague John Mason mentions the prospect of a hierarchy of rights. However, it seems to me that the amendments in the group try to create a hierarchy of rights by creating special protections.</p><p>Those protections are unnecessary. Section 14 states:</p><p>&#8220;nothing in this Part so far as it makes provision for the marriage of persons of the same sex and as to the persons who may solemnise such marriages affects the exercise of&#8212;</p><p>(a) the Convention right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion,</p><p>(b) the Convention right to freedom of expression&#8221;.</p><p>Those two strong protections run right through the bill and apply equally to those on both sides of the debate.

John Mason suggests that we need a provision on that because the bill creates a new definition. However, the bill goes out of its way to ensure that it is perfectly legal for a church or other religious organisation not to perform same-sex marriage. The bill creates a situation in which every church has to choose, so it seems perverse to think that the wording of the bill could be cited as a reason for actions against a group that had used the powers that are in the bill. There is a strong difference between a bill that permits same-sex marriage and one that criminalises opposition to it. This bill is clearly permissive rather than compulsive.</p><p>None of the amendments in the group is necessary, because all the protections are in the bill. I would not want to lodge an amendment stating that support for same-sex marriage is a belief that is worthy of respect in a democratic society or that an organisation that supports same-sex marriage should not be denied access to public services, even though I can foresee circumstances in which local authorities or other organisations might have a bit of reluctance in that regard.

They need to look up and see whose constituency that pool is in, because the Royal Commonwealth pool, in Edinburgh Central, will be hosting the diving. I want to speak as a constituency MSP with an interest in that matter.</p><p>Before Mr Malik has kittens, I acknowledge that Glasgow is the heart of the games. We must recognise its spirit and its determination in relation to the objective of hosting the biggest Commonwealth games ever. If I talk about Edinburgh, it is not to steal Glasgow&#8217;s thunder but to show that the games reach across the nation&#8212;though, in the case of Edinburgh, perhaps more literally than in other cases.</p><p>As Malcolm Chisholm said, the Royal Commonwealth pool will host the diving. Scotland has hosted the games twice before&#8212;both times here in the capital. The games in 1970 were a landmark, because that was the first time that metric units were used, which caused some confusion as it was the year before decimalisation, and everything seemed to be changing. The games in 1986 were slightly more troubled, and suffered from boycotts due to South Africa&#8217;s participation. I hope that the 2014 games&#8212;the third to come to Scotland&#8212;will provide a much more unifying experience.</p><p>Of course, all of that makes the Commie pool the first facility to have hosted three Commonwealth games, so its name has never been more deserved. However, just a few years ago, the future of the pool was in doubt. Refurbishment of the pool was a key commitment of the 2007 Liberal Democrat and Scottish National Party coalition in the City of Edinburgh Council, but that was, no doubt, spurred on by the Commonwealth games. The project represents an investment of &#163;37&#160;million, which has come mainly from the council but includes &#163;10&#160;million from national bodies&#8212;the Scottish Government and sportscotland.</p><p>Located against the backdrop of Holyrood park, the pool is world class not only as a facility but as an advert for the capital and the country. When the refurbishment was completed in 2012, I was privileged to be at the opening. It was obvious how important it was not only for the community in the vicinity but for people across the city. We now have a state-of-the-art 25m diving pool, a 50m eight-lane swimming pool, and a 25m teaching pool, where there had previously been much less.</p><p>The best words come from some of the stories that were told then, which were recorded by the local paper. One memory of the old pool jumps out from the pages:</p><p>&#8220;There was the icy cold blast that seemed to whip through the changing rooms, causing teeth to chatter and giving goosebumps to bare arms and legs.&#8221;</p><p>Yes, we did not have to be on those windswept pitches when we had the Commonwealth pool&#8212;the slightly tired Commonwealth pool.</p><p>That description has now given way to this:</p><p>&#8220;the familiar Commie Pool odour has vanished along with the tired changing area. In its place are roomy, family friendly changing areas, large opaque glass-fronted lockers ... working showers and free-use hairdryers&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games and Legacy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have seen the very unedifying sight this afternoon of four constituency MSPs trying to get their towels down first by the pool.

Scotland won 11 golds in Melbourne in 2006 but, sadly, only six in 1970 and three in 1986. For Scottish medals in diving, we have to go back to 1950, 1954 and 1958, when Peter Heatly won three golds, a silver and two bronzes. However, to anyone who would dismiss us as the Jamaican bobsleigh team of diving, I point out that in order to qualify for the Commonwealth games our athletes have to go through years of training, and I would challenge anyone to match that.</p><p>For any young Scotsman or Scotswoman, reaching the Commonwealth games is an accomplishment in itself. They will have to be strong because there will be a strong challenge here in Edinburgh, at the Commonwealth pool. Tom Daley, the 2012 Olympic bronze medallist, will be a well-known participant, and it is likely that we will also see Matthew Mitcham, who won Olympic gold for Australia in Beijing in 2008. He has now returned to form and is likely to participate.</p><p>As has been said, however, the Edinburgh experience is more than the Commie pool; it is also Meadowbank, which hosted both previous games. I look on Meadowbank fondly&#8212;not just because it has occasionally moonlighted as a venue for election counts that have run late into the night&#8212;I see Fiona Hyslop reliving some memories&#8212;but because it houses my local Edinburgh Leisure gym. However, what was once state of the art faces the same issues of ageing.</p><p>The Scottish Government has shown no shortage of commitment to Edinburgh&#8212;I point to the national performance centre for sport as an example of that. On the unanimous recommendation of the advisory group, Heriot-Watt University will be its host and, following &#163;30&#160;million of investment, it will be ready for January 2016. That is a fine investment that will offer</p><p>&#8220;world class training facilities for individual athletes and squads, high performance coaching and cutting edge sports medicine.&#8221;</p><p>The centre will specialise in football, rugby and volleyball, but will also support athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, fencing, handball, hockey, netball, shinty and squash&#8212;it will be like an entire Commonwealth games in one building.</p><p>Legacy is about more than facilities; it is also about inspiration. I remember watching&#8212;on a black-and-white TV, believe it or not&#8212;the marathon at the 1990 Commonwealth games in Auckland. I like to think that that inspired me, although it was another 20 years before I finally ran a marathon. I hope that active schools and the changes that have taken place since my time mean that teenagers today have a more positive experience of the kind of sports that I never took part in.</p><p>Broughton high school, in my constituency, is a community sport hub as well as a Scottish Football Association football performance school. In addition, as part of the legacy, Stockbridge primary school is taking part in the &#8220;game on&#8221; challenge by organising a sports day as a mini-Commonwealth games. That will not only help to raise activity levels, but will broaden the pupils&#8217; knowledge of the world and create the cross-cutting learning that is at the heart of curriculum for excellence.</p><p>Last but by no means least, there will be a benefit to culture and tourism. The 11 days of the games are timed well to coincide with Edinburgh&#8217;s festivals&#8212;I cannot speak about Edinburgh without speaking about the festivals. Sir Jonathan Mills has said that the Commonwealth games will be one of the two inspirations for his farewell programme at the Edinburgh International Festival. The Commonwealth games was also listed as the first reason why Scotland was ranked number 3 on the Lonely Planet guide&#8217;s 10 countries to visit in 2014.</p><p>I will finish with the words of Robin Worsnop, the chair of the Edinburgh tourism action group. He said:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quicker to get from the centre of Edinburgh to the centre of Glasgow by rail than to take the tube from east London to west London&#8212;and much more pleasant&#8221;.</p><p>Although we might not be trying to steal the thunder from Glasgow, if, after our visitors have enjoyed the sights of Glasgow and the wonders of the games, we can steal some of them for our wonderful festivals, I am sure that they will have seen all the best that Scotland has to offer.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games and Legacy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will not need them&#8212;that is true&#8212;but I will not be competing in the diving for a wide range of reasons.

I looked up the definition of that word on urbandictionary.com and it would definitely have constituted unparliamentary language so I will not repeat it. However, I can report that it is a compliment of a sort.</p><p>The bill will change an important part of Scots law that, as the policy memorandum helpfully highlights, dates back to the Bankruptcy Act of 1621. Since that act endured for 364 years before being repealed, we can only hope that this bill can reach a similar level of timeless appeal.</p><p>This is the right time to be reopening this area of law. Citizens Advice Scotland reports that, in 2012-13, its bureaux took on 15,800 debt cases, with a total debt of more than &#163;186 million. Changes to bankruptcy law and the debt relief model could therefore have a significant positive impact on the advice and support that are available to those clients. I am sure that we have all seen the situation in our surgeries. When the Government consulted, 129 responses were received, which is three times the typical number of responses to bankruptcy consultations.</p><p>The Government has already updated the debt arrangement scheme, as Kezia Dugdale highlighted. That system falls short of bankruptcy, but it freezes interest and charges, and prevents further legal recovery in exchange for a full repayment plan. With better access to money advisers under the changes, the number of people who are able to access DAS has been increasing significantly. In the previous parliamentary session, the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Act 2010 was a rapid response to the recession that passed a limited but valuable set of amendments to protect home owners and debtors, and particularly to reduce the risk of homelessness as a result of insolvency.</p><p>Today we are debating the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill. I was going to talk about the Chinese walls at the Accountant in Bankruptcy, which I asked about during the committee process. However, I have been impressed by a demonstration of parliamentary pirouetting that is worthy of a Commonwealth gold. It began with the Government being accused of flip-flopping by a party that had just promised to vote against in the chamber what it had voted for earlier in committee. I remember when the Bain principle reared its ugly head&#8212;the desire to vote against anything suggested by the Scottish Government or the SNP, and to find and cling to some reason, however tenuous, for doing so. Is that what is inflating what should be a stage 2 objection to detail and drafting into a stage 1 objection to the general principles of the bill?

It was quite a memorable image because it was an example of joy being used in the face of overwhelming sorrow, like the families of the deceased who insist on people wearing bright clothes.</p><p>If there was not perhaps the greatest amount of sombreness at that 2002 event, the next year I visited the United States national AIDS memorial grove, where there was enough seriousness and reflection to go around. San Francisco had been at the heart of what was originally entitled the &#8220;gay-related immune deficiency epidemic&#8221;. That naming and the developments that happened led to very visible effects on groups of people who had already been marginalised by society. Today, the US still has 1 million diagnosed HIV/AIDS carriers, which is the highest level in the developed world.</p><p>I have never known anyone who has been diagnosed that I am aware of. I came in a later generation, when the so-called gay plague had instead become more like the plague, with 60 million people dead or infected from it. That shocking figure is reminiscent of the numbers of people in the middle ages who were infected by the black death.</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa, as we heard, suffered particularly badly, having spent decades improving healthcare systems and bringing the average life expectancy up by a year or so at a time. After 1990, HIV/AIDS meant that that progress went into reverse. Life expectancy across sub-Saharan Africa started to fall again.</p><p>The countries that, until that point, had had the best healthcare systems often found that those healthcare systems had only helped to spread the disease. Some countries have rates of prevalence as high as 30 per cent of all adults, and they had to struggle with companies that put patents before people.</p><p>In March 2002, the Thai Government took unilateral action to use generics. The price for treating one person for one month fell from $750 to $30. The US Government blacklisted generics and it was only the following year that the World Trade Organization agreed a regime whereby developing countries could use generics.</p><p>Work by campaigners and philanthropists has seen tremendous progress around the world. Deaths globally now are down&#8212;2.2 million in 2005 and 1.8 million in 2010. However, there are still far, far too many deaths.</p><p>Here in Scotland, 5,900 people have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, while an estimated 1,400 have HIV/AIDS but are undiagnosed. That is despite the change in average life expectancy among those who have the disease, since it has become a chronic condition rather than a terminal one.</p><p>The stigma has always been, and remains, the great barrier. When I was seven, at primary school there was a girl who was bullied. As happens in playgrounds, there was a weapon of choice, which, at the time, was to say that she had AIDS. Other children would not sit in a seat that she had sat in. While the adverts of the time were certainly necessary, that is the effect that they had.</p><p>We must tackle the basis of that stigma, which is the ignorance at the heart of the issue. I welcome the Waverley Care report. I asked the First Minister and I was grateful that he reiterated the Scottish Government&#8217;s support. I welcome the Government&#8217;s action plan and the cross-party resolve that I think the debate will show.</p><p>World AIDS day is a chance to remember the dead, to acknowledge those who continue to live with HIV/AIDS and to work together across all our boundaries to end the scourge once and for all.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788770", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World AIDS Day 2013"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The first time that I marked world AIDS day was in 2002 at a student fundraiser in aid of HIV/AIDS charities.

That really matters, because the publications that are based on the census include the annual survey of hours and earnings, the Scottish health survey and the social attitudes survey, which all really influence Government policy and resources.</p><p>I want to make a few observations about the census based on what I have seen from the data, which might be relevant to some decisions. The relevant ministerial responsibilities are sport, equality, housing and welfare and parliamentary business, so perhaps I will simply be putting points on the record.</p><p>Given that I am a constituency member, my eyes first turned to the data from my constituency of Edinburgh Central, where I learned that the median age of 29 for women and 30 for men meant that it was second only to Glasgow Kelvin in youth. That sounds appealing, but imagine how I felt when I realised that, compared with my constituents, I am now officially middle aged. What that means for Sandra White I will leave for another day.</p><p>Members: Oh!</p><p>I take that back. [Interruption.] I can more than imagine how she feels, Presiding Officer. I heard your comment.</p><p>Like 50 per cent of my constituents, I do not have a car, and like 53 per cent of them, I have a degree. I am single and unmarried, and in that respect I am like 63.3 per cent of my constituents.</p><p>In light of our debate a fortnight ago, I note that Edinburgh Central does not win the accolade of being the gayest constituency in Scotland&#8212;that goes to Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s Edinburgh Northern and Leith constituency, with 427 civil partnerships in comparison with 286 in Edinburgh Central. However, more worrying is that, after Glasgow Kelvin&#8217;s third place with a score of 249, the number drops away sharply. I would like to think that our inner cities are magnets for same-sex couples for the same reason that they act as magnets for all types of residents, but I suspect that other factors may be at play outwith our cities.</p><p>The census also confirmed the experience of community councils and the concerns of tenants groups that the size of the private rented sector has exploded. Now 39 per cent of all Edinburgh Central households are in private rented housing&#8212;almost a doubling in the past decade. In the City Centre ward, which is home to Georgian townhouses, 45 per cent of households pay rent to a private landlord every month for the roof over their head. That changes services and neighbourhoods, and it creates new regulatory challenges for local authorities. Perhaps local authorities will experience difficulties in filling primary schools but, at the same time, they will need more and more staff and resources to enforce landlord registration.</p><p>One thing that worries me is the health of our democracy. Edinburgh Central&#8217;s total population is 84,000. The population over 18 is 75,440, which is the highest in the country. However, I know from looking at the electoral register that only 55,300 people are registered to vote. Where are those missing 20,000? Some will be students, but in no other constituency are there more residents than people registered on the electoral roll. Only about 15 per cent of residents were born outside the European Union, and many of them will be naturalised or Commonwealth citizens.</p><p>I note in passing that, under the procedures set out in the 14th amendment, the United States allocates members of the legislature to states based on their population rather than electoral registration. Edinburgh is cosmopolitan, but also transient. We must be aware of that and take action to resolve the situation.</p><p>I offer my most fulsome apologies to my colleague from Glasgow Kelvin.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22781896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Census"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Statisticians and demographers see the census as quite a rare gold standard.

We already know the why. For the past 50 years, Scotland&#8217;s views as expressed at the ballot box have diverged from those of the UK as a whole. David Cameron&#8212;supposedly our Prime Minister, too&#8212;can stand up in the House of Commons, turn round and look behind to 300 cheering Conservative members of Parliament. Just one of them was elected in Scotland. As the white paper sets out so starkly, for 34 of the 68 years since 1945, we have been ruled by Governments that had no majority in Scotland. That is not democracy; it is tossing a coin, and Scotland deserves better.</p><p>Instead of that uncertainty every four or five years at election time when Scotland has to call heads or tails, let us have the certainty that every Government of this country must have the support of the voters of this country. That is more than a question for pundits on election night broadcasts in studios or constitutional theorists scratching their heads in seminar rooms&#8212;it matters, not least because the two main parties at Westminster are so close these days that it is often a case of heads they win, tails we lose. Today, we see the horror of &#163;100&#160;billion being wasted on upgrading Trident, the on-going victimisation of disabled people in welfare reform and the privatisation of Royal Mail, all of which are being done to us rather than by us.</p><p>Or we could look ahead. In the white paper, we see a signpost to another way on the economy, pensions, childcare and the minimum wage&#8212;you name it. There is no argument that explains why Scotland can make our own decisions on the health service but must leave the rest of the welfare state to Westminster; why we can manage justice but not security; and why we can be trusted with council tax but almost no other tax that we might name. On what Scotland is entrusted with now and what has had to be set out in the white paper for 2016, we toss a coin and health is devolved; we toss a coin again, and welfare is reserved.</p><p>The no side lacks any justification, philosophical consistency or clarity. However, it has a long list of uncertainties whose shadow hangs over the referendum, even if they have not yet properly been appreciated by the voters. In 10 years, will the UK still be a member of the European Union or, in the case of a no vote, will Scotland&#8217;s exporters have been gutted by being wrenched out of that free-trade zone? When the UK Government has pandered to its back benchers and ended the Barnett formula, by how much more will the Scottish budget be cut? Will the UK still have anything resembling the welfare state and will people be working until they are 70? Perhaps most crucial of all for those of us who remember the Iraq war so clearly, will we have been dragged into another Iraq-style war for oil or even just for US Government hubris?</p><p>Endless broadcasts about the meaning of a yes vote dominate the television news in living rooms up and down the country, but where is the same scrutiny being giving to the consequences of voting no? The people of Scotland deserve answers, but we will not get them, because we cannot get them. The central hypocrisy of those in the no campaign is to hold the yes campaign to standards that they themselves fail to meet. Is there any amount of detail that would have been sufficient for the no parties? Alistair Darling could have been presented with the 10 commandments on the slopes of Mount Sinai and he would have dismissed them, asking whether the commandment to &#8220;Honour thy father and mother&#8221; includes adoptive parents and saying that we should be told.</p><p>The real purpose is obfuscation and distraction from the central point of principle, which is that Scotland&#8217;s future should be in Scotland&#8217;s hands. Certainty lies in one place&#8212;when Scotland&#8217;s Government is answerable to Scotland&#8217;s people for its decisions and we can be certain that we get the Governments that we elect and the society that we vote for.</p><p>If we become two equally sovereign nations, the relationship between Edinburgh and London will transform overnight. It is strange that some people argue that the UK would seek to cut off its nose to spite its face the day after a yes vote. If it would do so, what does that say about how we are seen and suffered as part of the union? Instead of relying on the meagre influence of 59 beleaguered and, let us face it, these days usually outvoted MPs, Scotland could depend on the UK&#8217;s national interest&#8212;that base interest of maintaining stability, continuity and business&#8212;and all would come to the table with minds set on a speedy and effective resolution.</p><p>With a yes vote, Scotland&#8217;s voice at Westminster will be drowned out no more. Scotland will be free to govern all our own affairs as we see fit, but we can work together with our partners on our own terms where those interests align&#8212;whether that is on currency, energy, mutual defence or any of the rest of the white paper&#8217;s vision of friendly co-operation. Frankly, that vision is more sympathetic towards the attitudes of the post-independence UK Government than those parties that wish us to continue to be ruled by that Government.</p><p>That is what I see as the best of both worlds, and it is far better than continuing to be governed by the toss of a coin.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22765431", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independence White Paper"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yesterday, the people of Scotland were presented with the most detailed independence blueprint imaginable that sets out the opportunities, the process and the reality of what a yes vote will look like.

Speaking personally, as Ruth Davidson did, I can only feel that the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill is much more immediate and more fundamental, and that it deals with the question of my civil rights. After consideration, I concluded that my remarks, too, ought to reflect that.</p><p>It will not come as a surprise to anyone that, when I was young and my classmates started to notice girls, I started to notice boys. I was afraid. I looked at our society and I did not see myself looking back, whether in our institutions, such as marriage, in what was regarded in public debate at the time as good and moral, or even in how our society portrayed itself in fiction, in which any representation of same-sex attraction made the subject matter adult, to be ranked alongside pornography and violence. When all that I saw or knew of gay people was Julian Clary, Kenneth Williams or Graham Norton, I&#8212;a boy from a chip shop in Dunbartonshire&#8212;did not see myself. I could only conclude that I was different from normal and that what I was was less deserving as a result.</p><p>Today, this chamber can add a new tile to the great interlocking mosaic of our society that has been built up steadily, one piece at a time, since the Wolfenden report of 1957. Same-sex marriage will not be the last piece to be added to that mosaic. The bill is not the finished article, not least for the transgendered, but today we can further build a picture of our society that generations of young people to come can look at and see themselves in. People of faith, whether gay or straight, must see themselves in that image, too, because it would be perverse to expand the freedom to express sexuality only at the cost of the freedom to practise faith. Both are fundamental cornerstones of a humane society, and the dichotomy between them is a false one.</p><p>Amending UK equality laws puts beyond doubt any concern that churches could be forced to hold same-sex marriages by domestic law. Anyone can speculate about hypothetical European challenges, but the ECHR includes specific protection for freedom of religious practice. I quote:</p><p>&#8220;There would ... be a quite a hurdle and a strong protection under article 9 if churches can prove that they are not part of the state.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The Church of Scotland is not and has never been a department of the state&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 19 September 2013; c 1495, 1494.]</p><p>Those are not my words, but those of Aidan O&#8217;Neill QC, when, as legal adviser to the campaign against the bill, he gave evidence to the Equal Opportunities Committee. If the Kirk is not classed as a department of state, which faith would be? The Equality and Human Rights Commission and Karon Monaghan, who is a human rights law specialist, formed part of the consensus that the protections were strong and that the freedom of religion was genuine.</p><p>However, we do not have to speculate. Nine countries in Europe have already legalised same-sex marriage and not one has seen churches being forced to hold such marriages. That fact was confirmed to the Equal Opportunities Committee not once, not twice, but three times over by different witnesses.</p><p>Above all, we must not be drawn by the remote and hypothetical challenge to religious freedom to such an extent that we overlook the very tangible, very real and very much on-going violation of personal freedom that is the exclusion of people of same-sex attraction from expressing their love through marriage, which is the institution that our society considers to be the paragon of commitment.</p><p>Civil partnerships were a welcome step, but they remind me of the ladies degrees that were offered before women were admitted to Scotland&#8217;s universities on an equal footing for the first time in 1892. Those degrees were progressive for their time&#8212;they opened the door&#8212;but who today would argue that a women-only degree was a substitute for allowing women to study on the same terms as men? Civil partnerships are &#8220;separate but equal&#8221;, which is always separate and never equal. They are not enough.</p><p>If we were to surprise everyone and to vote down the bill today, who would we be to continue to infringe the freedom of those progressive faiths such as Scotland&#8217;s Quakers and Scotland&#8217;s Unitarians that sincerely consider same-sex ceremonies to be part of their understanding of what marriage is and should be?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752660", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

She has been a strong convener and has served the Equal Opportunities Committee well. On her first day as convener, Margaret McCulloch not only opened the debate in the chamber but presided masterfully over stage 1 of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill, which was not an easy first task.</p><p>The inquiry was perhaps unlike a lot of inquiries because the process that was gone through was extensive. Committee members visited sites in Edinburgh, Dalkeith, Perth, Pitlochry, Oban and Lochgilphead, and a formal committee meeting was held in Clinterty, near Aberdeen. We really wanted to reach out and deal with the barriers, to overcome the difficulties and to deliver something that manifestly had not been delivered in the past.</p><p>I quote from the report the kind of barriers and stigma that we heard about from Gypsy Traveller witnesses. One said:</p><p>&#8220;My wee sister ... has lied about her address when filling out applications for jobs because, at other times, employers who have found out her address have told her that she is not suitable.&#8221;</p><p>Another said:</p><p>&#8220;If I purchase something from a shop and try to return it because it is faulty, when the person behind the counter asks for the postcode, it comes up on the computer as &#8220;Gypsy Traveller person&#8217;s site&#8221;. &#8230; We cannot use the site address to hire a DVD.&#8221;</p><p>Those are the kind of everyday obstacles that are faced. There is also evidence, which Siobhan McMahon cited, that 47 per cent of the public think that Gypsy Travellers would be unsuitable as primary teachers&#8212;a figure that has barely changed since 2006. That shows the extent of the problem.</p><p>This is not the first time that we have debated the issue. If one core message has come out of the debate and the report, it is about the frustration that has been cited not only by Siobhan McMahon and John Mason but eloquently by Linda Fabiani, whose experience of the previous committee along with Michael McMahon&#8217;s shows that the more that things have changed, the more they have, unfortunately, stayed the same. As Dennis Robertson pointed out, many Gypsy Travellers who come into contact with the parliamentary process are starting to ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point?&#8221; We must be incredibly careful, as hopes that are raised and dashed repeatedly do not rise as high again.</p><p>Members have touched on what has changed since 2001. There are one or two examples of progress. For instance, in 2001 one of the main calls was for the clear establishment of the ethnic status of Gypsy Travellers and we now have that. Unfortunately, although that may strengthen our hand in theory we are yet to see much impact coming through. Nevertheless, that is progress that we can see.</p><p>However, most of the other issues&#8212;in particular, access to services was an issue that went right through the 2001 report&#8212;broadly remain. As other members have referred to, those include the subjects of the committee&#8217;s recommendations on health, education and social work and on the relationships with local authority departments. Nevertheless, we have what the committee considered to be a positive example of progress in the police&#8217;s relations with Gypsy Travellers.</p><p>Our report recommends that the Scottish Government explore how successful pilots and projects can be replicated. One such project, which the committee came into contact with but has not been talked about much, was the north-east dialogue day, which brought people together. When the committee visited Clinterty, we attempted to duplicate that, because it is important to have that link. The old clich&#233; about &#8220;Nothing about us without us&#8221; very much applies in a community like this, which in many cases is so distanced from the statutory authorities simply because of disillusionment.</p><p>The main ways forward broadly fall into three categories: site quantity, site quality and leadership. Site quantity is a major issue, given Gypsy Travellers&#8217; requirement to stop at informal sites. John Finnie reeled off the traditional stopping places across the Highlands that have been blocked off. We heard differences of opinion on the alternative, which would involve transit sites for short-stay formal encampments. Some Gypsy Travellers would support transit sites, whereas others would not want to use them&#8212;that shows that we need their involvement. In suggesting temporary sites as a solution, we must be careful not to see the issue simply through the lens of those in the settled community who feel that they need to get rid of a problem. In that regard, I would be cautious both about defining Gypsy Travellers as opposed to ordinary people and about language referring to &#8220;innocent victims&#8221;. At the time of our report, there were 28 all-year sites operational throughout Scotland, but a study in one region of Scotland has suggested that 35 additional sites are needed in that area alone to deal with the demand.</p><p>Another issue that has come up is the quality of sites. As Malcolm Chisholm said, decent housing is a basic human right, and we need to remember that. In our visits, the committee saw the standards that are endured on a day-to-day basis. However, there are good sites, so let us single them out. Perth is always cited as a top-quality place by experts and observers, although we heard some from the Gypsy Traveller community suggest that Perth is too close to becoming a settled community&#8212;again, the sensitivities of the people we try to help need to be considered. Providing a standard tenancy would be a start. Post-2001, Amnesty established a model tenancy agreement, but when it last surveyed local authorities, only three of them had introduced it.</p><p>Our other recommendations are mainly about leadership, which has been the dominant theme in today&#8217;s debate. Leadership has been a difficult balance for the committee. John Mason was right to point to the carefully chosen language in paragraph 49 of the committee&#8217;s report, which covers a range of perspectives. Some people believe that there is a strong role for central Government, whereas others believe that there is a role for government more broadly, in which local government would be important.</p><p>The stories from, as it were, the coalface of local government that Nigel Don and Mark McDonald gave perhaps emphasise the importance of bringing the local community with us. A councillor who cannot overcome the barrier or mental block that many in the settled community might have will have difficulties in supporting the introduction of a new transit or permanent site. Unfortunately, that difficulty will only be exacerbated if someone comes in on a white charger and makes the situation worse.</p><p>Our point about supporting the development of sites is that everyone&#8212;local government and national Government&#8212;must face up to their responsibility. There is clearly a role for national Government. It is fair to say that, at local decision-making level, we would not tolerate the kind of derogation of responsibility that we have seen. Given the transient or mobile nature of the Gypsy Traveller community, there is a need for a degree of standardisation on access to services. For example, Scotland has one national health service, for which local authorities are not the decision makers. In that regard, the example that has been given by the police is very welcome.</p><p>The committee&#8212;as I was&#8212;was disturbed by COSLA&#8217;s response, which Christian Allard and others mentioned. It is important that COSLA is brought with us on the issue. We would all struggle to live a life according to our values and traditions if we faced the same obstacles as the Gypsy Travellers.</p><p>The committee has received the Scottish Government&#8217;s response. Action can only come from the steps that have been set out in the report. However, inaction might be possible, as was the case 12 or 13 years ago when similar promises were given but not acted on. Consequently, the committee will be watching and scrutinising what the Government does, how ministerial mainstreaming is working, the development of the campaign with Amnesty, the potential updates to site provision, and the exploration of a standard Gypsy Traveller tenancy agreement.</p><p>Although I am sure that we would all have welcomed much more concrete and immediate commitments, we will be watching to make sure that those turn into concrete actions this time around. If this Parliament is to mean anything, the Government, the agencies and all the relevant authorities must take action when a committee, with cross-party support, sounds an alarm.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to Mary Fee for her determination and grit&#8212;that may be code for something; I do not know.

Scotland&#8217;s colleges do excellent work on that already. Some 22 per cent of college students come from the 20 per cent most deprived areas of the country, and articulation with universities is a well-trodden path that allows people from non-traditional backgrounds to access full university degrees. The amendments will put into the new founding statute what the sector does so well already.</p><p>Amendment 77 will create a similar duty on the Scottish funding council, which is already required to have regard to a wide range of areas, including skills needs, the economy, social and cultural issues, sustainable development, the UK and international context, and the educational support needs of students. Widening access to higher education will now take its well-deserved place alongside those other priorities. Moreover, amendment 77 will ensure that the Scottish funding council will not simply have to pay heed to the desirability of widening access, but will promote the sharing of good practice among institutions. That is an important role for the Scottish funding council into which I hope it will grow over the coming years.</p><p>Finally, amendment 78 will create a duty on the Scottish funding council to review and report every three years on progress on widening access. We have seen a lot of reviews of higher education in these islands. In past years, our student communities have anxiously watched when another review&#8212;by Dearing, Cubie or Browne&#8212;has come along with questions that have always been asked in such a way that the answer would always be more fees, more charges and more barriers. The reviews in question will focus on how we can open doors, rather than shut them. Although they will be a lot less grandiose, I hope that they will be just as closely watched, well respected and deeply challenging, because we cannot allow to continue the status quo of recent decades in terms of socioeconomic participation.</p><p>At stage 2, the cabinet secretary accepted the principles of my amendments in those areas, but pointed out technical problems, which have been addressed by our working together, so I hope that members will join the chorus of stakeholders, which includes Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and NUS Scotland, in supporting the amendments.</p><p>We have in the chamber the shared objective that access to learning should be open to all.

At 6.25 we will not be able to say &#8220;job done&#8221; and move on. The price of widening access is eternal vigilance against the social and economic inequalities that will, for as long as they exist, try to pull young people and their life paths in different directions.</p><p>The amendments that I proposed earlier built on amendments that I proposed at stage 2, and I worked on them collaboratively with the cabinet secretary. However, they also built on actions that I took further back when, as a student representative, I argued long and hard to bring down barriers to access. Indeed, they built on the steps that I took as a 17-year-old from a state school and a family with no background in higher education, when I packed my bags and went off to study at Scotland&#8217;s oldest university.</p><p>Since I have been in politics, there has been no pulling up the ladder; instead, I have always tried to give a leg-up. Abolishing tuition fees and increasing support for living costs to record levels opens the door, but as MSPs we must ensure that more is done to help students across the threshold. The lead measure in the bill for widening access is the system of targets. I believe that the targets must change behaviour in institutions so that they make their approaches and reaching out stronger, higher and deeper, because the status quo is just not an option. When the higher education sector receives more than &#163;1.5 billion a year of ever-scarcer public money, all institutions have to recognise that widening access is something that they do and that it is not someone else&#8217;s problem.</p><p>The stark statistics of the past decade speak for themselves&#8212;usually through the Scottish index of multiple deprivation. I have been as much of a critic of the SIMD as anyone else; I do not think that it represents parts of my constituency adequately, and I believe that it is far too blunt a tool. However, I criticise the SIMD as someone who wishes to see another yardstick for measuring socioeconomic disadvantage rather than something completely different being measured.</p><p>I believe that the bill now strikes the right balance of flexibility and prescription. Universities come in all shapes and sizes, so the approach for each will need to be tailored accordingly. We need only look at the example of two institutions that are headquartered in my constituency: the Open University in Scotland and the University of Edinburgh, whose different approaches make for a striking contrast.</p><p>My successful amendment at stage 2 enshrined the participation of staff and students in the widening access agreements that will be set out with each of the institutions and which will guide the approaches. My hope was that by doing that we would ensure that the approaches would be better designed and would ultimately have a greater chance of success. It is absolutely crucial that the targets are successful.</p><p>In the same vein, I also proposed an amendment to ensure the review of widening access overall. I say to those who are sceptical about the targets that they should wait to see that review&#8217;s findings on how they have been working. Indeed, I ask of anybody who is critical of the bill&#8217;s provisions on widening access: if not this bill, what bill, and if not through targets, how? We must deliver change.</p><p>Students come in all shapes and sizes, too. We know from study after study and pilot after pilot that when students who have been separated by background, privilege and advantage all their lives sit down next to one another in the same laboratories and lecture halls, those who had been excluded rise to the challenge. That is not social engineering; that is the evidence of countless studies. I think that when the glorious diversity of our nation is reflected in the labs and lecture halls, then and only then will our job be done.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694875", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

As the constituency representative for at least 13,000 people in full-time, further or higher education, I will address that issue in depth.</p><p>The committee heard in private from an underemployed graduate who had journeyed through unpaid work experience and casual labour in a state of limbo for some years, unable to get a first step on the ladder. The more time that the search was taking, the more graduates were emerging in cohorts behind him, which further reduced his chances of getting the job that he had trained and longed for.</p><p>I found that story quite familiar, as I saw it many times in my social circles among the classes of 2004 and 2005. I can only conclude that the labour market changes that were going on at that time have now become embedded.</p><p>There are three important social justice issues to consider in relation to graduate unemployment. First, there is displacement, which has already been mentioned. Graduates take other jobs, and as a result there is a knock-on effect and others end up being unemployed.</p><p>Secondly, although graduates are more likely than the population as a whole to come from affluent backgrounds, I think that we in the chamber all agree that we want to change that. If the image takes hold&#8212;it already has done in some quarters&#8212;of someone who slaves away on a degree course with a student loan for four years, just to emerge into the same job that they would have had if they had gone straight into work, that will hit those who are most risk averse. They are the potential students whom we are trying to encourage to participate in greater numbers&#8212;namely, those who have little family history of participation in higher education and of seeing the benefits that it can bring.</p><p>Thirdly, if there is an ever-more cut-throat battle for graduate level jobs, the odds are clearly in favour of those who have the personal contacts or the family resources to give them an edge.</p><p>The committee highlighted a lack of data on on-going skills underutilisation, but there is one good piece of data, which is the higher education destinations survey. It applies only to the point six months after someone has left education, but it is regular and quite comprehensive. The survey found that, right now, 26.2 per cent of graduates in employment are underemployed. To satisfy John Mason and Gavin Brown, that means that those graduates are not in the job types that were classified by Elias and Purcell of the Warwick institute for employment research in 2003 as graduate occupations, which gives a level of independence to the definition.</p><p>The proportion of graduates in employment has changed in recent years, presumably in an attempt to upskill further in a more competitive job market. However, having done the further reading for the inquiry&#8212;which once led Murdo Fraser and the committee to call me a swot&#8212;I have reached some conclusions about what that shows.</p><p>In written evidence to the committee, NUS Scotland stated:</p><p>&#8220;since the onset of the recession, graduates have been less likely to find graduate level employment, but have remained less likely to be unemployed than those without degree level qualifications&#8221;.</p><p>However, the higher education destinations survey goes back further than the recession, and so does the problem. Although there was a relative peak around 2006-07, Scotland&#8217;s current level of graduate underemployment is now comparable to 2002-03 or 2003-04. That leads me to suspect that the problem is structural rather than temporary.</p><p>International evidence is quite scant, partly because of certain methodological issues, but we know from UK surveys that Scotland has much more of a problem with graduate underemployment straight after courses than the rest of the UK and that that has been the case for as long as the higher education destinations survey has been published, which is well over a decade.

I do not know what the figure was in 1999, but the doubling of the sector has clearly had a particular effect on Edinburgh Central.</p><p>As the estimates are updated each year, Edinburgh Central usually exchanges with Glasgow Kelvin the accolade of having the highest concentration of private rented households. Interestingly, it also exchanges with Edinburgh Southern the accolade of the most expensive street for house prices, which perhaps shows how much of an upstairs-downstairs area it can be.</p><p>When an area has such a concentration of private rented households, it is not just the tenants who are affected by issues such as tenants&#8217; deposits and landlord-tenant relations; entire neighbourhoods are affected. Neighbourhoods in central Edinburgh have had their very nature changed because of large-scale transitions in tenure.</p><p>The end of the motion points to the regulation of letting agents and of the sector, which is a proposal that I strongly endorse. The current system is straining under the weight of regulation in enforcing not just the deposit scheme but things that have been around for longer, such as landlord registration and the period within which the private rented housing panel should resolve cases.</p><p>There have been incremental changes that everyone has welcomed, but in each case they have come with a great challenge as regards enforcement. The tenant information pack for all tenants is most welcome, but we do not know whether there has been 100 per cent take-up, and I am already seeing casework involving letting agents who are finding&#8212;shall we say&#8212;creative ways to get round the law on premiums. The strategy for the private rented sector sets out three suggestions on the regulation of letting agents, at which we must look carefully, because there is a danger of minimal compliance with a lot of rules.</p><p>We should not forget that the populations that we are talking about are very hard to reach. In Edinburgh, we are talking about migrants, young people and people who used to be homeless and who are housed temporarily in the private rented sector. I often find that students have access to the best advice through their student associations and that it is the other large groups&#8212;in population terms&#8212;who encounter the problems.</p><p>Such people have a very odd relationship with landlords if difficulties come up. There are few relationships that we can think of that are like the landlord-tenant relationship: landlords have such power. The bad landlords will view as assets properties that all the groups that I have mentioned view as homes. Should a tenant want to make a challenge, the difficulties in seeing things through to a resolution include the turnover of tenants, which means that a tenant might well have moved on to a different let by the time that the PRHP can rule. It is also difficult to engage lawyers, especially in Edinburgh, where most of the lawyers represent landlords, which means that they cannot take on tenants&#8217; cases because of a conflict of interest. There is also the fear of blacklisting&#8212;people worry that, if they complain about one landlord, they will find it harder to get their next let.</p><p>I welcome the motion, which focuses on tenancy deposits and looks at the wider sector. In addition, I very much welcome the private rented sector strategy, which wisely focuses on improving the operation of measures that have been inherited from previous Administrations, such as landlord registration and the PRHP. I welcome the idea of the online information hub, but, although that will benefit greatly some groups of private tenants such as young people, it will not reach them all. At all times, we must keep the hard-to-reach groups at the forefront of our minds.</p><p>Other issues that the strategy addresses include the regulation of letting agents and giving consideration to housing standards; after all, the private rented sector is almost at the bottom of the league when it comes to energy efficiency. It also invites consideration of the suitability of a new tenancy system, which I know that Shelter has argued for.

Perhaps that is emblematic of how much the committee&#8217;s membership has changed since work on the report began. We have had not only almost an entire change of membership&#8212;including a change of convener and deputy convener&#8212;but a change of responsible minister as well. It is like a latter-day ship of Theseus or, as I believe it is called by fans of &#8220;Only Fools and Horses&#8221;, a &#8220;Trigger&#8217;s broom&#8221;, every part of which has changed but whose essential nature has continued. That essential nature is the concern that we have shown for youth homelessness.</p><p>A lot of points have come up in the debate that I will do my best to respond to in the next nine minutes. It was particularly good of Linda Fabiani to let us know how far things have come since she was a lass. Hers was the first of a good many testimonies of working on the front line, which included Richard Lyle&#8217;s casework, Anne McTaggart&#8217;s experiences as a social worker and George Adam&#8217;s reference to his daughter&#8212;no doubt, she has a bright career ahead of her as either a financial adviser or a charity fundraiser. Personal testimony was a very important part of the inquiry, which included visits and a great many human stories. It was an example of how a committee should meet those who are directly affected, and not simply their representatives.</p><p>One of the key issues that has come through in all the speeches, and which was very much in the foreground of the report, is that of family breakdown. In the question of how young people become homeless, that is the be-all and end-all. Anne McTaggart made the excellent point that changes brought on by the recession and unemployment feed directly into that issue. When it gets harder to put dinner on the table and when the role of the breadwinner is suddenly challenged by unemployment, stress grows, tempers fray and it is no wonder that people get into difficulties such as that which Dennis Robertson highlighted, when leaving the family is often an issue of safety.</p><p>Any committee report is only the tip of an iceberg, nine tenths of which is in the written evidence underneath. Women&#8217;s Aid&#8217;s submission noted that violence is a growing feature of family breakdown leading to homelessness, and Shelter pointed to the same concern. There is a danger, when looking at family breakdown, to blame the young person for not being able to get on with the family, but there can be real problems&#8212;which members have highlighted&#8212;of substance misuse, mental ill health and domestic abuse. In those circumstances, it becomes a rational course of action for the young person to leave, and they should be assisted just as any other person in an emergency situation has a right to be supported by statutory services.</p><p>That is not to say that we cannot prevent homelessness. Indeed, prevention is a major theme in the report. Jamie Hepburn gave an example from North Ayrshire, where staff have tried systematically and vigorously to contact parents on the day of presentation, which has made a big difference and resulted in a success rate of between 65 and 80 per cent. The more of that that we have, the better. Malcolm Chisholm mentioned Edinburgh Cyrenians, which I am familiar with. The organisation has spoken highly of the value of mediation in preventing things from reaching the point at which angry words are thrown, bags are hurriedly packed and doors are slammed, potentially never to be opened again. I very much commend Edinburgh Cyrenians&#8217; written submission to the committee to any member who is interested in that area.</p><p>Similarly, the sofa surfing&#8212;that is perhaps an informal term to use; it would normally be used in a different context&#8212;or hidden homelessness that Elaine Murray identified needs to be looked at more closely, because if people do not present as homeless, they will not be able to access all the relevant services.</p><p>Education is an issue that has come up quite a lot. Quarriers told us in evidence:</p><p>&#8220;Young people have come to Quarriers and said, &#8216;Is this really what it&#8217;s like?&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 12 June 2012; c 512.]</p><p>Stewart Stevenson said that homelessness was not a cushy number. It was suggested in evidence that there has been a perception that homelessness is a lot easier than it is and that it is a direct route to getting a flat. That needs to be challenged.</p><p>Peer messaging is another issue that has come up quite a lot&#8212;Malcolm Chisholm raised it and it came up in evidence. We need to understand the potential but also the limits of education. It is easy to put the burden on schools, but young people are in school for about 30 hours a week, whereas the rest of their life&#8212;which is often very turbulent&#8212;takes up the other 130 hours, so we must be realistic. We must also recognise that schools, particularly those in economically challenged areas, are generally open to the realities of the situation and are doing a great deal of work.</p><p>However, as has been said, peer support represents a great opportunity, from two angles. First, being told what the reality is intimidates people. We have heard examples of people who have gone through homelessness bringing the reality home to their peers. Secondly, peer support can provide inspiration. Quarriers, which gave a lot of evidence, has run an exchange that involves school pupils going to Holland. We would not normally associate such exchanges with people who are at risk of homelessness, but the young people concerned come back greatly boosted and more able to deal with life challenges of the kind that have been mentioned.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Having and Keeping a Home"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a great pleasure to wind up on behalf of the committee for the first time as the deputy convener.

Truancy is one of the key factors that show up someone who is likely to be at risk of homelessness. The research by Suzanne Fitzpatrick of Heriot-Watt University highlighted all sorts of trigger evidence among 14 to 17-year-olds that would show up at school as warning signs. That highlights the importance of getting it right for every child. Although we talk about early intervention, that should not be restricted to the early years. If we can solve a problem in the early years, that will help throughout someone&#8217;s life, but early intervention can mean intervention at the early stages of a developing problem in the late teens. That is where having a named person and agencies working together comes into play as an important factor. I was a bit concerned that GIRFEC was not mentioned by many of the agencies that came to give evidence. There is always a danger of siloing in how we look at the issue.</p><p>There has also been debate about life skills. George Adam made the point that the keys are not enough. There were differences of opinion on life skills among those who gave evidence. For some people, a lack of life skills is a real problem, but others struggle even to get that far. Streetwork, which works in my constituency, said:</p><p>&#8220;homelessness work is not simply about teaching young people the practical skills to maintain a tenancy, though these are important too. It is primarily about understanding the impact that neglect, trauma and abuse has upon the emotional development and behaviour of young people.&#8221;</p><p>Another issue that did not come up a great deal in the evidence, and which has not been mentioned much in the debate, is employability. There is a set of layers. For someone to become employable, they must have life skills, but before they can have life skills they must overcome&#8212;in many cases&#8212;mental health challenges, such as those that Stewart Stevenson talked about. If they want to take the final step to employability, they come across the benefit trap of going to college, which Linda Fabiani, James Dornan and Siobhan McMahon mentioned. Many witnesses cited that, too, not least Yvette Hutcheson, who gave us the example of how she would be paid to sit in a hostel, but not to sit in a college classroom. Although we might have differing opinions on how to solve that issue, it is definitely one that must come to the foreground.</p><p>We have seen some progress with the community care grant. Lots of speakers highlighted that and it is right to emphasise it. Siobhan McMahon was right to highlight the existing seven-week target, and we now have a three-week target that everyone will back. I do not think that I am overstepping my remit as the committee&#8217;s deputy convener when I say that the committee will be interested to see whether the target is observed.</p><p>Dennis Robertson spoke well about the Quarriers charter. John Mason made the point that, because by 2015 all social housing will be regulated through the Scottish housing quality standard, we have the possibility of two tiers opening up, the other being private rented sector accommodation. I know that a strategy is coming later in the year and I am sure that the Equal Opportunities Committee and other committees will look at the issue through that lens.</p><p>Welfare reform was not touched on as much in the report as it has been in the debate, although the issue came up in the written evidence. We have seen the Scottish Government step in to provide greater funding for advice, to take over the community care grant and to deal with council tax benefit reform. However, there is a limit to how much the Scottish Government can do. Alex Johnstone said that he would like to see a debate on that issue. With an impartial hat on, I think that I speak for the majority of the committee when I say that I would quite like to see that as well. Perhaps it would be useful to the Equal Opportunities Committee and other committees if the Parliament had access to the DWP dataset so that we could properly model all the implications.</p><p>I will end where Margaret McDougall began. We must remember the human cost of youth homelessness: potentially blighted lives, crime and ill-health. That is a future that the Scottish Government, local government and the Parliament must strain every sinew to prevent.

I commend to any member who is interested in childcare the Official Report of our meeting last Thursday, in which we explored many issues, one of which I want to examine in my speech.</p><p>Jackie Brock, from Children in Scotland, said that a total of &#163;8&#160;billion is being allocated to UK early years funding and questioned whether putting the bulk of that support through tax credits&#8212;the system that we have inherited&#8212;is the right approach, as opposed to a more rights-based system. After all, the current system is clearly failing an unacceptable number of families, who still face unaffordable childcare.</p><p>There was consensus on the need for a different approach, which I found surprising. Clare Simpson, from Parenting across Scotland, agreed and highlighted a change of heart on the part of Beverley Hughes, the former Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families in the Labour Government, who has taken such a view since leaving office. The view was backed by Claire Telfer, from Save the Children, who looked forward positively to the work that the Council of Economic Advisers will do to consider the economic and financial case for a different approach.</p><p>The Denmark model has often been cited in evidence to the committee, during the current inquiry and during our inquiry into the budget. In Denmark there is no spending on tax credits, but if we compare the proportion of overall early years spend that goes on the direct provision of day care with the situation in the UK, we find that in Denmark twice as much goes on direct provision. Private provision in Denmark is growing but accounts for only 5 per cent of the market, and competition is allowed and encouraged between state providers in municipalities, which work at a much more local level than happens here.</p><p>The crucial point is that whereas in the UK financial support is capped, in Denmark it is the sum that people are charged that is capped. Although Denmark has higher tax rates overall, the difference between its spend on childcare and early education and the UK&#8217;s spend in the area&#8212;1.3 per cent of gross domestic product and 1.1 per cent of GDP, respectively&#8212;is small. Let me put that in perspective: the gap is only a sixth of the gap in relation to defence spending as a proportion of GDP, which of course leans in the opposite direction.</p><p>We are where we are, and no one is calling for child tax credits to be removed. Indeed, on Thursday, Satwat Rehman, from One Parent Families Scotland, told the Equal Opportunities Committee that the UK Government&#8217;s reduction in support from 80 to 70 per cent of childcare costs means that in many cases work no longer pays and childcare is unaffordable. Maggie Simpson, of the Scottish Childminding Association, said that the bills of the people whom she represents are increasingly being left unpaid. Save the Children reminded us that this reform is one of many welfare reforms that will increase child poverty.</p><p>There was a clear feeling that if we were starting over we would not choose the current system. Liam Byrne has said almost as much and has looked thoughtfully and positively at the example of Denmark. If we were starting over, we would develop a system of greater direct provision.</p><p>That brings me to the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to 600 hours of provision. The commitment was welcomed by One Parent Families and Save the Children, partly for what it is and partly because it shows a desire to move towards a universal system of provision. It is a welcome incremental improvement.</p><p>I agree with members who said that transformational improvement is beyond the Parliament&#8217;s current constitutional powers. However, the case for transformational improvement is becoming more and more unanswerable, as members will realise if they read the evidence that has been and will be provided to the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s inquiry.

The longstanding agreement on UK-wide provision expires on 30 June. It is as though a great-grandfather clock were looming over us and ticking, with every swing of the pendulum taking us nearer to the deadline.</p><p>Although transitional arrangements are less than ideal, I welcome the minister&#8217;s comments in that regard, because a firm deal that sets out matters after 30 June is probably beyond us, given the timescale, and the existence of transitional arrangements will ensure that the wildness of the free market is not set loose on all the households we represent that have issues with flooding.</p><p>Let us make no mistake about this: back in March, the AXA UK chief executive Paul Evans warned that unless there was an agreement between the ABI and DEFRA, homes in flood risk areas would become &#8220;unsellable&#8221;. His views are shared throughout the industry and, worryingly, it all seems to be a bit of a who-will-blink-first negotiation. Before the new year, the media reported that a deal had to be in place by Christmas to ensure that it could come into effect over the summer; however, deadlines keep whooshing by and we are none the wiser.</p><p>I want to go back some time to April 2000, when the Water of Leith in my constituency burst its banks in a flood that no one who was there has forgotten. Hundreds of households along the river were affected and, as anyone who has seen the pictures will know, Murrayfield&#8212;not just the area, but the stadium itself&#8212;was inundated. After a very long battle involving a public inquiry and after the difficulties that arose from the overnight change in the financial climate in 2008-09 and the resulting rethink, my Roseburn and Murrayfield constituents are only slightly more protected than they were 13 years ago. When at a recent community council meeting, the subject of the 2000 floods came up&#8212;believe me, it always comes up&#8212;a resident who had lived in the area since she was a girl recounted her memories, rattling off dates like a history book right back to the 1960s and demonstrating how the same story had been repeated. Last year, there was a near miss that in other circumstances would have been the next instalment of the recurring cycle of flooding in the area; fortunately, however, and thanks in no small part to Scottish Government-funded works upstream at the Braid burn, the risk has been reduced slightly.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Water of Leith is currently projected to flood much more than once every 75 years and as a result my constituents face crippling insurance premiums&#8212;and that is before we take into account climate change concerns, which mean that those figures will need to be reviewed. Of course, the flood alert system is valuable and one would rather have it than not, but what a warning to get first thing in the morning: &#8220;Your house might be flooded today, so take action!&#8221; The people of Murrayfield and Roseburn want to put such traumatic experiences behind them.</p><p>Thanks to Scottish Government funding to the council, flood defences have been put in place further downstream at Stockbridge and Warriston but budget overruns mean that, although Roseburn might finally see diggers in the ground next year, they will be working on only a trimmed-down scheme or second-best alternative paid for with leftovers. A solution for Gordon MacDonald&#8217;s constituents further along the Water of Leith at Longstone is even further off.</p><p>As the minister well knows, I have lobbied the Government quite extensively on this issue; indeed, we met as recently as last Tuesday when I pressed for Edinburgh to have a seat at the table at the next round of national funding. I sense that the Government will be guided by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on the crucial eligibility issue. For my constituents, the key issue in being able to protect their homes and indeed insure them against flooding is that eligibility be extended to older flood schemes that, as a result of the changed financial circumstances, require additional support. Obviously, that will result in a more crowded field of applicants but my constituents stand more chance as one group among dozens competing for funds than they do if they are left out of the competition entirely.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You could easily be mistaken for Father Christmas today.

Of course, that money has not been ring fenced. The criticism of de-ring fencing flood funding is that a council could take the money and spend it on something else, but it is quite clear to every party to the Water of Leith project that the City of Edinburgh Council has spent the money allocated for flooding on that very issue. Although the sum has been substantial and has delivered a great deal, there have been difficulties with contractors as well as all the other issues that arise with major projects and, as a result, we have been left in a less than ideal situation.</p><p>I know that applications in Renfrewshire have been ruled out because of ineligibility on the same basis as the Water of Leith, therefore I urge MSPs throughout the country whose communities may be similarly affected to lobby COSLA along with me to get its seat at the table. My constituents want the protection, and it would be perverse if it were not reflected in their insurance.</p><p>I welcome the fact that commercial licences are now likely to happen as a result of the 32 local authorities giving their consent. SEPA&#8217;s flood risk map shows Roseburn and Murrayfield in the at-risk zone, but it also shows Stockbridge, just down the Water of Leith, in the same at-risk category even though its defences were virtually in place when the map was completed. There are three very distinct groups that the new insurance regime needs to capture. It needs to ensure that, in Stockbridge, where the defences are in place, the insurance reflects that protection at least somewhat and it needs to ensure that my Roseburn constituents can get insurance at all.</p><p>The third and largest group in my constituency&#8212;and probably in every other MSP&#8217;s constituency&#8212;is those who face little or no risk, who deserve Professor Crichton&#8217;s core point being taken on board at least somewhat. Given that Scottish planning policies have deliberately and consciously sought to reduce flood risk while, by all accounts, English planning policies appear to have gone in the opposite direction, it seems perverse that Scottish households are now paying, by the ABI&#8217;s figures, at least &#163;151 million per annum extra to shore up inappropriate development elsewhere. It is one thing to accept the sharing of risk; it is quite another to create moral hazard whereby planners are rewarded rather than reprimanded for poor decisions.</p><p>In the light of that, it is perhaps no wonder that the ABI walked away from the previous deal and that such long and fraught negotiations are going on.

One is &#163;27, which is the annual sum that goes from a household bill to the green schemes of the renewables obligation certificate and the feed-in tariff&#8212;ROC and FIT. The other figure is &#163;52. The schemes that are linked to the two sums are often put together as environmental schemes, but they approach from the matter from two fundamentally different angles. The &#163;52 is for boosting energy efficiency and tackling fuel poverty, thereby providing affordability.</p><p>I hope that no one in the chamber would begrudge that fuel poverty funding, not least because the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee has heard repeated calls for more of it, for more surety and, indeed, for a complete absence of the convener&#8217;s trademark raised hand of dissent&#8212;any comparison to Tommy Sheridan is not intended.</p><p>We should also remember the advice from the UK Committee on Climate Change, which is that green policies will lead by 2020 to bills that are &#163;500 lower than would be the case if we depended solely on gas. Of course, we could go even lower by doing nothing at all, but doing nothing is not an option&#8212;or at least it is only an option for those who deny that anything at all is happening. The motion commits to decarbonisation, so I guess that that category does not include the Tories. If they believe that decarbonisation is necessary and their advisers say that green policies are cheaper in that context, I simply cannot understand how they can come to any doubt about affordability.</p><p>Scotland has, by any reasonable definition, a balanced energy policy. For example, the 2020 renewables route map highlights offshore wind, wave and tidal, and growth in hydro and biomass as key parts of achieving our 100 per cent target. If that is not a balanced energy policy, I wonder what is. Is it nuclear, with all its costs to the taxpayer? The UK Parliament&#8217;s Public Accounts Committee identified costs of &#163;67.5 billion in relation to Sellafield, and &#163;12 billion to &#163;14 billion will go to Hinkley Point, according to the nuclear industrial strategy document.</p><p>Of course, there is the interesting sight of the UK Government and EDF Energy in negotiations about just how much public subsidy is needed.

Like many of the recent speakers, I am not a member of the Finance Committee, but I am a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, so I have always had half an eye on the bill.</p><p>I have to say that my cross-party consensus antennae started tingling very early in the debate. That is often a good sign, but less so when you are speaking last and hoping to find a lot of points in Opposition members&#8217; speeches with which to disagree.</p><p>Ken Macintosh&#8217;s opening comments in favour of devolution eloquently reminded me of why I support independence, as he focused so well on how responsibly and maturely we have handled the debate on LBTT and constructed the tax. The ability of Scotland&#8217;s Parliament today to use wisely the part responsibility that we have can provide us with confidence that we could very well bear the whole responsibility further down the line.</p><p>Indeed, we have in the Scottish Parliament already adjusted those tax powers that are under our control. We have adjusted the council tax through the freeze and other smaller measures, and the same is true for business rates. To the Labour Party&#8217;s credit, it was not afraid when it was in office to adjust business rates from those that had been set in Westminster&#8212;although, of course, the SNP Government has since adjusted them once more.</p><p>It is a sign of success and maturity that we have such a consensus. In the political dictionary, next to &#8220;Scottish solutions for Scottish problems&#8221; we will simply see this debate.</p><p>However, I have two questions. First, how has SDLT continued in its current form for so long? The slabbing effect has been roundly and repeatedly criticised from every side&#8212;there is no one defending it. As we have heard, the IFS said in February 2013:</p><p>&#8220;SDLT is a contender for the UK&#8217;s worst-designed tax.&#8221;</p><p>It could be called slabbed or tiered, but I prefer to think of it as lumpy, like a badly stirred custard. A house can sell for &#163;249,999, and someone pays &#163;2,500; but if it sells for &#163;1 more, they pay &#163;7,500. The new structure might be complicated to explain if we were introducing it in a vacuum, but since it resembles the system of income tax with which most of us are familiar, that does not present a problem.</p><p>In the hypothetical scenario that we have heard about, the amount of &#163;185,000 functions simply like a personal allowance, with charges being levied on value beyond that. The system has the benefit of being not only fairer, but simple to understand. That is a win-win that is not often found in any field of government, let alone in tax.</p><p>Even in Edinburgh, the average house price stands only slightly above the hypothetical &#163;185,000, and for such a property the bill would drop two thirds in that scenario. According to ESPC, 81 per cent or more of three-bedroom and four-bedroom properties would have lower bills, and that is in Edinburgh, which is one of the warmest property markets in Scotland.</p><p>It is a mistake to fixate on the rates. Stamp duty rates, as with all taxes, can vary and have varied, up to and including on budget days. Today&#8217;s debate is on the general principles of the bill at stage 1, and we must not hang things on a frame before the structure is in place.</p><p>Economic efficiency is a worthy principle, and since the objective of the change is to ensure revenue neutrality&#8212;to which John Mason alluded&#8212;it is only closer to the time, when we are able to examine the evidence on which the calculations can be based, that we will be able to get a finalised rate. Anyone who is looking will be able to estimate within a broad range of parameters what the liabilities are likely to be.</p><p>Having considered all the issues, why has it taken so long to address them? The answer is simply that we now have a Government and a Parliament that can respond more efficiently.</p><p>My second question has been addressed from various quarters. When so many members have supported energy efficiency measures in the bill, why is the market so resistant? The zero-carbon homes relief that was created in the last budget of the Blair regime in 2007 is one of those things that sounds good in a think-tank paper but did not work once it was released into the wild.</p><p>The Scottish Building Federation talks about relief for new-build properties, but we already have the lever of building standards. The UK Green Building Council alternative is interesting, but I do not think that it could be applied in practice.</p><p>It is not straightforward for residents of tenements to improve their energy efficiency&#8212;a particular constituency interest of mine&#8212;because co-operation is needed, and the technologies carry substantial up-front costs. Even if such properties came within the LBTT threshold&#8212;if it was &#163;185,000&#8212;they would be at the lower end, and the relief would almost certainly be insufficient to deal with anything but the most perfunctory or minimal energy efficiency work. So, although there is clearly a good intention there, it is not enough to achieve a material effect. Further, I do not think that it would be understood enough by potential buyers to achieve the desired nudge for behavioural change. All of that is a shame, because we really need an innovative mechanism.</p><p>Even the widespread distribution of energy performance certificates and their publication, and rising gas and electricity bills, have all somehow remained external to buyers&#8217; decision making. We need to find a way to address that, because it is a distortion of a properly functioning marketplace. Although the end of getting people to take more notice of energy efficiency in transactions is correct, the means that has been proposed is not, so an alternative one will need to be found.</p><p>The bill shows what Scotland can do and, as many of my colleagues have said, our potential for future responsibilities. If health, why not pensions? If schools, why not benefits? If LBTT, why not all the other taxes as well?</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad that we are debating the bill.

I must say that the University of Edinburgh has been slightly disappointing when one looks at the SIMD measure.</p><p>That leads me&#8212;with very little time left&#8212;on to the SIMD measure issue that others have mentioned. SMID is a good base but, just as the legislation is not the last word and the issue is the flexibility that is shown and how we go on from that, we need to look further than that measure.</p><p>The average population of a SIMD zone is 803. That can contain significant diversity, especially in small settlements or in places such as Edinburgh, where there has been a deliberate attempt to pursue mixed housing approaches to planning. Students from the lowest income backgrounds are the least likely to travel. I want universities to get credit for reaching not only the hardest to reach but those whom are genuinely underrepresented.</p><p>We should look beyond SIMD. We should also look at subjects in institutions. For example, medicine and law show tremendous levels of segregation by socioeconomic class. That situation has continued for many years. When I suggested that to the NUS, it was somewhat resistant because of a fear of dilution. If we looked at the NS-SEC&#8212;the national statistics socioeconomic classification&#8212;approach, we would still have a stretching target.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary to consider whether there is scope to amend the bill at stage 2 to introduce a process so that students at institutions are consulted when widening access agreements are being drawn up.

I think that we are together today in saying that we need, as well as world-leading targets, world-leading action to achieve them.</p><p>It is very easy to get caught up in party-political fights and not to realise that we are, to an extent, fighting the problem and discussing it in the margins. Even with the policies alone that are set out in RPP2, we are, by my calculation, on course to reduce emissions by 39.56 per cent, from 72.3 megatonnes to 43.7 megatonnes. At the start of the passage of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, even a reduction of 34 per cent seemed like a good place to go.</p><p>It is clear that we should accept at this point that, although proposals will need to be turned into policies, the policies alone can take us quite a distance. In fact, it turns out from the recalculation that we were, to begin with, further than we had thought from our target. The Scottish Government is to be commended for saying that, instead of going only so far, it will go to a point that may be further away and may require more effort. It may have gone unnoticed by many, but the 42 per cent target that we talked about is now 43.66 per cent as a result of the recalculation. That the Government has stuck to its guns is definitely worthy of commendation.</p><p>We have in the plan a hugely ambitious trajectory for recycling that will finally put us among the best in Europe. We heard at the last cross-party group on renewable energy and energy efficiency meeting that the Scottish Administration is the only one of the four UK Administrations that is now directly funding home energy efficiency. More than that, that public funding can help to unlock private sector funding from the likes of the ECO and the green deal. The &#163;200&#160;million a year can bring about a fundamental change not only in the cost of heating homes, but in the amount of carbon that that heating emits. That is a win-win situation that really does not need much of a sell to the public to win its support.</p><p>RPP2 sets out very clearly an electricity decarbonisation goal of 50g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour. In Scotland, we continue to recognise that nuclear energy, although it is&#8212;very arguably&#8212;a low-carbon energy source, is definitely not a green one. All of that is commendable to anybody who approaches the debate from an environmental perspective.</p><p>In committee and when I met environmental groups, I heard the same calls for more information as we have heard during the debate, but we must acknowledge that there are limits to how much we can expect from a document that, essentially, seeks to peer into a crystal ball and to see 14 years hence. I have not been an MSP for very long, but every committee report that I have seen or co-authored has called for more information; the reports that we are considering this afternoon are no different.</p><p>I have sensed an openness in the Government. I remarked to one representative that it would be handy to have the tables at the end of RPP2 in Excel format, and he replied that the officials had already sent him the spreadsheets, along with more detail that he had wanted, and he offered to forward them. The draft RPP2 is already clearer and more comprehensive than any other climate change action plan in any nation anywhere, and every reasonable request for more information that the EET committee has made has been answered positively.</p><p>Of course, that brings me to the unreasonable requests. Many EET committee members&#8212;and many members who have spoken in the debate&#8212;have pressed for the inclusion in RPP2 of a lot of hypotheticals. Although it is sensible to take risk into account, to acknowledge it and to present an assessment of its impact, it is impossible for any organisation to produce a complex branching tree of all the overlapping contingency plans, that covers every factor and every potential mathematical combination thereof. No one in the chamber needs me to remind them that the EU&#8217;s target, regulation of the green deal, energy market reform, the renewable heat incentive, the successful development of CCS and even the possibility of a run of bad or good winters are all very much beyond the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s control.</p><p>On CCS, Commissioner Oettinger put the issue well when he spoke to the EET committee. He pointed out that once Government decreed that sulphur dioxide should no longer be pumped into the air by industry, the practice was stopped.

I grew up on the shores of the Clyde, not 5 miles from Faslane. My family&#8217;s shop in Helensburgh thrived on the custom that naval personnel brought to the town; I have relatives who still work at the base; and, frankly, I can still close my eyes and visualise the Kilcreggan peninsula with the great black silhouette of a Vanguard-class submarine sailing in front of it.</p><p>Growing up with nuclear weapons so close by, I saw what I can only call a form of madness. We knew that the nuclear weapons were there, but the only way to live our lives was to put out of our minds the inevitable conclusion. We just put up with the situation.</p><p>Nuclear weapons exist for one purpose. We cannot use them for peacekeeping, for disaster relief, or for humanitarian intervention. We can use them only for mass destruction: the destruction of cities&#8212;all the terrible human cost of the Iraq war in one place in one second&#8212;or the destruction of armies. Any army that we would fight would be composed of young men who were forced from their homes to take up arms and a uniform, who were marched into their graves for the high offence of having been conscripted by a Government that was almost certainly despotic in its nature.</p><p>We can talk of deterrence&#8212;there has been a lot of talk of deterrence today&#8212;but that is just code for threatening to do such things rather than doing them. The difference between committing mass slaughter and threatening to commit mass slaughter is a fine moral hair to split.</p><p>Nuclear weapons are the weapons of politicians, not of generals. They are the weapons of presidents, prime ministers and tinpot dictators who want to strut on the world stage or sit on the UN Security Council&#8212;leaders who know that they would hide in their bunkers if their own people were consigned to destruction. If my nation was ever, God forbid, to suffer a nuclear attack, I would want to see those who perpetrated the attack being held accountable, not the hapless millions who already had to endure the misfortune of being ruled by them.</p><p>Deterrence can work in many dimensions. Many countries have substantial conventional deterrents and choose to seek their security through conventional means, such as Brazil, Japan, and Germany&#8212;for all that Germany has had its difficulties in achieving that. One country that gave up its nuclear weapons, post-apartheid South Africa, is a fine example that we have held up as a model to follow in many situations.

That, too, is refreshing and would be welcomed by the public who, after all, always say that we should work together and overcome our differences, rather than argue all the time.</p><p>However, politics is about differences and if we all agreed on everything, we would not need a Parliament. So, to keep things interesting, I will dwell on a couple of the divisions. Given that I am one of the members to whom Murdo Fraser referred who was not present during the evidence, I have to draw more on the experience of drafting the report.</p><p>It is fair to say that the committee mirrored the difference of opinion that exists between the Scottish Parliament and the UK Government on nuclear power, in particular. Contracts for difference are the price support mechanism that is being introduced for the UK. Everyone recognises that they are the new UK Government&#8217;s subsidy mechanism for renewables, but nuclear power is also eligible, so the contracts are, ipso facto, also a subsidy for nuclear power, which is one of the points of contention in the report.</p><p>Although there are silos for the different energy types, nuclear draws from the same limited pot of money as renewables do. A lot depends on the strike price and implementation, but I am uncomfortable that they are sitting at the same table. My approach to nuclear power would probably be to take it, lock it up with a padlock in a cupboard and throw away the key. That is an aspect of UK energy market reform that has implications for Scotland and which the committee rightly opposed, although only by a majority. I do not think that any energy source should hide behind greenwash and hoover up subsidy that is intended to support genuinely green energy. That goes for Scotland as much as anywhere else.</p><p>Rhoda Grant alluded to paragraph 185 of the committee&#8217;s report, which states:</p><p>&#8220;the support the Scottish Government can provide to the development of the renewables sector is limited by the current constitutional arrangements.&#8221;</p><p>That is factually true, as head D in part II of schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 remains in effect.</p><p>Rhoda Grant rose&#8212;</p><p>I can only assume that the three members who voted against that paragraph did so not because it is false, but because it is an inconvenient truth.

All those members should reject tuition fees by backing the Government motion, because the SNP Government has shown that the unstoppable march to ever-higher fees is no such thing: fees are a choice, not a necessity. There is already a graduate contribution, which is called income tax. The necessity is free education.

When we are looking at the important role that science can play, we have to recognise that rigorous social scientific evidence often blurs the line with the STEM family, and not least the M part of that.</p><p>One problem with social science, in terms of the esteem that it has in debates such as today&#8217;s, is that as it is taught in universities it leans heavily toward the qualitative. An acquaintance of mine has three degrees in politics but has never once taken a statistical research methods course. Qualitative research is worth while, but it is different. We can look at the same evidence qualitatively and interpret it differently. That makes it distinct from the formal scientific method in Karl Popper&#8217;s principle of falsifiability.</p><p>Quantitative social science is different, and it deserves to be credited as such. This and previous Scottish Governments have funded the regular Scottish social attitudes survey conducted by ScotCen, which is based in my constituency. I point out that the difference between that and the Scottish health survey, which Nigel Don mentioned, is marginal. Over the years, the social attitudes survey has given us plenty of political footballs on constitutional issues, but it has also given us irreplaceable hard data on issues such as drug use, antisocial behaviour, discrimination and racism. Although what we are presented with is often the top-line percentage, the detailed statistical analysis that happens with the data gives us a much greater insight into relationships, contributing factors and, looking at what we are doing, what works and what does not. Frankly, the distinction between that and, for example, epidemiology in health science, which is indisputably STEM, is non-existent.</p><p>Without doubt, the most obvious social science that we depend on in the Parliament is economics.

However, where we have different values, it is possible to test, to an extent using the scientific method, whether the policies that we are putting forward will realise those values. In the Parliament, with the exception of the Scottish Green Party, we are all quite fixated on the objective of economic growth and we often scrutinise our economic policies on that basis; they can be subjected to the scientific method and, frankly, they should be.</p><p>Economics is divided quite starkly&#8212;I suppose that we could characterise it as Keynesianism versus Friedmanism&#8212;but in a way so is physics, between the Newtonian understanding of the universe and Einstein&#8217;s understanding of the universe. Anybody who can reconcile those two is going to win a Nobel prize.</p><p>In Parliament, there is a strong consensus on the wisdom of capital investment. It is a rare economic decision that is taken without mention of the gross domestic product multiplier effect. All of that is derived from evidence-based methods that deploy scientific approaches in much the same way as happens in the STEM areas. Frankly, I think that we should demand the same standard of evidence and scrutiny in justifying how we run the economy as we would when deciding whether to approve a new hay fever remedy.</p><p>In June, the UK Cabinet Office issued a paper that floated the idea of taking some of the experience of randomised control trials from drugs and applying it to public policy. That is what Governments already do through piloting, but the rigour of RCTs is much higher. I once remarked to a medical researcher that an error rate of 3 per cent was reasonable.

There is a popular book that I have some sympathy with, which is quite social-scientific but whose evidence base consists of a series of simple bivariate analyses in extremely small N case studies with incredibly weak R-squared values. However, it has become political flavour of the month, in no small part because it has at least nodded towards quantitative terms, however flawed they may be.</p><p>I just want to place a marker that there is a lot happening in the social sciences that can inform our discussions here, as long as we respect their strengths and see their limits.

A lot of alarmist language is going about, but it must be realised that UK newspapers are already substantially regulated by domestic law. Their content is restricted by laws on the integrity of court proceedings, especially in relation to children; on incitement; on data protection; on defamation, which has resulted in the notorious super-injunctions in England; and on obscenity. All those issues present difficult balances between competing rights. I am not saying that the right balance is being struck in all instances, but I simply observe that such law exists already.</p><p>In contrast, the Leveson report does not recommend additional regulations such as French-style privacy laws, although it could well have done so.

The focus on corporate governance and professional standards is the main reason why attention must be paid to the recommendation.</p><p>A particularly welcome aspect of the report is its examination of the international experience. The report draws parallels between the UK newspaper industry and other north European systems. The seminal academic work&#8212;the comparative study of news systems by Hallin and Mancini in 2004&#8212;describes north European systems as &#8220;democratic corporatist&#8221; systems, and further research has found that followed through to families of media systems among nations.</p><p>Countries that are similar to the UK have vibrant and often charged newspaper systems, as in southern Europe. However, the readership level in northern Europe is higher, which means greater resources, a more central role in society and more pressures to compete, which often result in riskier behaviour and a greater fundamental responsibility to society to get things right. We face the same challenge, which has been addressed by models in other countries through a great range of means.</p><p>The US media market has a potential customer base that is six times the size of that in the UK, but the circulation figures for the top-selling American newspapers are lower than those for the top-selling UK equivalents.

First, everything that Leveson recommends happens in at least one other nearby European country that is free and democratic. Not only have UK titles made no complaints about operating their subsidiaries in Dublin under the Irish Press Council, but the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index 2012 rated Ireland as having the 15th most free media system in the world. The UK is 13 places lower, at 28th, and all the countries with forms of press council&#8212;the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Germany, which Leveson highlighted&#8212;are ranked above the UK.</p><p>Secondly, every country has adapted its system to its local circumstances and legal traditions. The Netherlands has a very strong sense of journalism as a profession like medicine or law, so the main sanction is to name and shame. In Sweden, there is a preference for direct financial penalties on corporate owners.</p><p>We must realise, therefore, that there is a need for separate Scottish statutory underpinning in order to recognise not only our values&#8212;as with everything that this Parliament does&#8212;but the distinctiveness of our legal system. It is also necessary to look at the pattern of the industry in Scotland, because if regulation is to be led by industry, the relative weights of key figures will be different, based on Scottish circulation.</p><p>I draw members&#8217; attention to section 5 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, which&#8212;as just one example&#8212;gives statutory underpinning to the advisory role of the UK Committee on Climate Change, which gives it the power to advise the Scottish Parliament even though there is one system for the entire UK. The 2009 act also gives the Scottish Parliament the ability to designate another body, should it wish to do so. That is obviously not a direct, like-for-like comparison, but it shows that such legislation can be put in place.</p><p>Thirdly, in every country the industry&#8217;s participation is important, as it must buy into the system.

However, the briefing papers that I was sent by NUS Scotland and Scotland&#8217;s Colleges included what I would present as being constructive engagement, or suggestions for ways to manage a difficult process of change, rather than head-on attacks on the process. I can also quote some great enthusiasts for the changes.

South of the border, the Conservatives are reducing FE college budgets by 32.3 per cent. These are difficult times, but the Audit Scotland report shows that here, between 2007 and 2011, college reserves went up from &#163;98.9 million to &#163;206.4 million. In these difficult times, we must look at all the options when solutions are thin on the ground. I know what the Conservative interpretation of all the options would be. It is right there in &#8220;Spending Review 2010&#8221;, which states:</p><p>&#8220;In further and higher education, the Government believes that there must be a shift away from public spending towards greater contributions from those that benefit most and who can afford to pay&#8221;.</p><p>If that is what the Conservatives wish to introduce in Scotland, they should be open and say so.</p><p>I am a little surprised by the Labour approach to defending the status quo, which is set out in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676797", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I go into full flow, I want to reflect on some of Liam McArthur&#8217;s comments.

As I am used to speaking in quite controversial and combative debates, it is good to be able to talk about an issue that has general agreement in the chamber. [Interruption.] I thank my esteemed colleague Mr Hepburn for handing me back the half of my speech that I dropped. If anything, although we accept that more should be done, we all generally agree that progress has been made.</p><p>My constituency has benefited from bus services. Indeed, the number 10, which has already been aired quite a bit this afternoon, runs through Edinburgh Central. I personally benefit from the service, not in a registrable interest sense but because I live very close to the route. Most crucial of all for me as a constituency MSP is that my newsletter has benefited from a picture of me sitting in the driver&#8217;s seat of a number 10 bus with a big cheesy grin. All of these things are important to me as an MSP.</p><p>My colleague Gordon MacDonald, who will speak later, will perhaps give a perspective on Lothian Buses that he has picked up from working with the company. However, as a customer and user, I certainly have a perspective on green buses and Lothian Buses. Unusually&#8212;or perhaps usually; we do not really compare transport habits in the chamber&#8212;I do not drive or cycle. Instead, I am one of those Edinburgh residents who are largely if not entirely dependent on either their own two feet or public transport to get around the city. Taking the bus to and from surgeries can be quite interesting, particularly when I get looks from the person whom I have just seen and who is probably thinking, &#8220;What? An MSP using the bus?&#8221; We need to get to a situation in our society where that sort of thing is not remarkable and is, indeed, perfectly normal. On the subject of perfectly normal, anyone who, after that admission, compares me with Stewart Stevenson will get an invitation to take it outside.</p><p>The introduction of the number 10 service has marked a step-change in quality as well as improving the environmental credentials of Lothian Buses. For a start, it has given the company an opportunity to renew its vehicles. In London, which Iain Gray referred to, the bus fleet is of real quality. A lot of people have said that Edinburgh has the best bus service in Scotland&#8212;and it certainly has. Having dared to step on buses in Glasgow, I just do not think that the service in that city competes. I note, however, that buses in London provide crucial information for tourists. Anyone who has used public transport in cities abroad knows that it is all important to know where one is, and the number 10 service provides invaluable information about stops. Indeed, it reflects very well on the status of Lothian Buses as an essentially publicly owned company.</p><p>As anybody in Edinburgh would be proud to confirm, the company is viewed with great warmth as the people&#8217;s buses, and it is perfectly in keeping with that tradition that it is so progressive in embracing the number 10&#8212;not only using the green bus fund, but levering that money so that it ends up with even greater investment.</p><p>I have seen the same progressiveness in other issues on which I have dealt with Lothian Buses, such as allowing buggies on to buses. There have been some difficulties with that&#8212;anybody in Edinburgh who has seen a parent with a buggy left at a bus stop will understand some of the deep difficulties that there had been with that&#8212;but the buses now have spaces for them and the policy across the whole system is that parents can get on. That is another example of the progressive attitude that Lothian Buses has taken.</p><p>The number 10&#8217;s improvement in quality has generated not only local jobs at Alexander Dennis but at least one extra local job: that of the person whose job it was to confirm to the person who was recording the destinations that they had got the pronunciation right. However, Alexander Dennis is the great employment story. It has 1,000 employees, and its customers include New Zealand, Norwich and, on the Enviro400, Ottawa and Toronto.</p><p>Again, we see Scotland&#8217;s success not only in manufacturing but in technology. It is important to remember that the battery technology for those buses is heavily dependent on Scottish research and development. Scotland is at the forefront of such development.</p><p>An interesting aspect of the debate is that, in the past, the Labour Party called for clever procurement, but the Government created a fair competition scheme in which a Scottish company was uniquely well placed to win. I must congratulate it on that little bit of enlightened mercantilism. If the minister will not tell Brussels, neither will I.</p><p>A 30 to 40 per cent reduction in emissions was promised and a 59 per cent reduction was delivered. Thanks to the technology involved, once the batteries are upgraded&#8212;provided that the technology has moved on by then&#8212;the Lothian Buses hybrid buses will, I hope, be able to achieve a 100 per cent reduction in emissions and run entirely by battery.</p><p>We are starting to see that kind of future proofing in transport policy as changes are made to lever in action towards achieving the 2020 carbon targets. Public transport is the low-hanging fruit&#8212;it is the easiest policy area for us to influence directly&#8212;and I welcome what the Government has done. I would always welcome more.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad to get up and speak in the debate, even though I have just lost half my speech.

I recognise that we already have the best-funded postgraduate system in the United Kingdom, but there is no incompatibility between recognising that and arguing that we could do even more.</p><p>I will go straight to a suggestion that might interest potential postgraduate students, whether they are studying law or any other subject.</p><p>According to the spending plans that are currently set out, the annually managed expenditure for net student loans advanced will rise from &#163;408.3&#160;million next year to &#163;468.3&#160;million the year after. Assuming that inflation of current commitments and all else is equal, that should leave around &#163;50&#160;million in genuine additional resource. That is a rare thing in government these days, and there will be many deserving student causes knocking at the minister's door for a share of that funding. We have already seen an unprecedented uplift in core living-cost support for undergraduates this year, and my inbox is twitching in anticipation of more e-mails asking for further increases. There is also the long-standing question of part-time students. It is clear that postgraduates are not making the only demands on funds, but postgraduates are expected to undertake full-time studies with limited support from public funds, especially for living costs. On their behalf, let me make a gentle tap on the door.</p><p>The recent European Commission report entitled, &#8220;National Student Fee and Support Systems, 2011/12&#8221;, showed that Scotland and the rest of the UK were poles apart for student funding, with the UK having the highest undergraduate tuition fees in Europe, and Scotland ranking alongside mainstream social democratic nations such as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in upholding free access to an undergraduate education. That is good news, because it shows that the supposedly irreversible trend towards ever-higher fees&#8212;which have been backed by Administrations of many colours&#8212;is no such thing. However, the report noted that Scotland was the only one of those five nations to charge routinely for what it called &#8220;the second cycle&#8221;, or postgraduate education.</p><p>Postgraduate education is fragmented and unregulated. However, there is a creativity to the chaos of courses, whether they are professional, applied or purely academic. In some cases, professional bodies pick up the cost, and it is fair to ask why the legal profession&#8212;not one known for its penury&#8212;does not carry more of the cost of professional legal training, as happens in accountancy.</p><p>It would be impossible to consolidate all of those arrangements into one overarching entitlement without tampering with the healthy variety in the sector in a way that would not be helpful. However, with the resources that are available&#8212;and bearing in mind the other competing priorities&#8212;I think that some form of creative, targeted and well-designed funding scheme to help to expand access to postgraduate education by funding fees and living costs for individuals from lower-income backgrounds is not beyond the wit of man. Of course, if it is not beyond the wit of man, it is definitely not beyond the wit of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning. Therefore, I simply suggest to the minister and the Government that, when they come around to considering the student loans budget for 2014-15&#8212;an enterprise that is soon to be under way if it is not already so&#8212;they consider seriously whether such a scheme to help postgraduates in the round can be developed.

GDP is not a flawed measure, but it is definitely limited. Perhaps economists are more aware of its ups and downs than are those of us who quote it readily in public discourse. GDP&#8212;which has been around for about 80 years&#8212;is a quick and dirty measure of economic activity in a country. It was never intended to go beyond that, but it has been pressed into service in many roles for which it was not designed.</p><p>Even for measuring the size of the cake&#8212;to which Patrick Harvie referred&#8212;there is a rival measure, which is gross national income. That measures not the amount of economic activity in a country, but the amount of economic activity that ultimately accrues to a country&#8217;s citizens. In Europe, GNI tends to be virtually the same as GDP, but in Equatorial Guinea, where the GDP of $27,478 per capita is quite impressive by sub-Saharan Africa standards, the GNI per capita is 47 per cent lower. It is clear from that indicator that the people of that country are not the sole beneficiaries of its resources.</p><p>Similarly, we must adjust for purchasing power parity, because a loaf of bread does not cost the same in Blantyre in Lanarkshire as it does in Blantyre in Malawi. That further introduces the estimations and approximations that make social science an inexact art.</p><p>In the past in the UK, people often looked at productivity as an indicator in economics. However, as GDP growth tended to come from working ever-longer hours from the 1980s onwards, that indicator fell out of fashion.</p><p>Even with an awareness of GDP&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses&#8212;of which there are many&#8212;we run the risk of losing sight of what it truly means to prosper. The humankind index is not the first attempt to create an alternative, complement or supplement to GDP. Amartya Sen&#8212;the first Indian Nobel prize winner in economics, who perhaps does not get as much of a hearing in the UK as Joseph Stiglitz does&#8212;has spent a career on trying to develop an alternative paradigm for the whole of economics that is centred on the capabilities approach. His famous example is that, in the Bengal famine, there was no legal impediment to people buying food but, although the free market was satisfied, the starving were not.</p><p>That led to the United Nations development programme&#8217;s human development index, which combines literacy, life expectancy and other wellbeing indicators. Countries with a high GDP tend to have a high HDI, but the link is not absolute. One example that is often cited is Kerala, a state in India that is one of a kind in having a democratically elected Communist Government that has managed to remain democratically elected for a great many years. It has always matched developed world levels of health, in particular, with only developing world levels of finance. HDI is not perfect either, though, as it leaves out environmental efficiency and, frankly, gives high scores to countries that have not very free political systems.</p><p>All that shows that the process is still developing. HDI mimics GDP&#8217;s strength and is comparable across countries, whereas the humankind index is distinctively Scottish. However, I think that its greatest strength, as well as its shortcoming, is that it is distinctive to the priorities of the people in Scotland who participated in its development. Although it is unlikely to be the last word on the issue, it is the first, and it is a very useful reminder that progress has more than one dimension.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Humankind Index"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Ken Macintosh for allowing us to debate the subject.

That study has been quoted by, among others, the languages working group and the modern languages excellence group, and the minister alluded to it.</p><p>The study set out a wide range of benefits of language learning, which apply not just to the ability to master languages but across the curriculum. It was led by a Finland-based&#8212;although Anglophone&#8212;academic and it summarised 30 years of research in about as many pages. It also included primary attitudinal research about attitudes to language learning. It will come as no surprise to anyone here that people in English-speaking Europe&#8212;which I presume means the UK and Ireland&#8212;were the least convinced of the benefits of multilingualism. That is a cultural problem that is recognised widely&#8212;by the languages working group&#8217;s report, by the modern languages excellence group and by everybody in civic society who has commented since the working group&#8217;s report was published. Unless we are united in challenging such beliefs head on, we might as well not even bother being here.</p><p>However, there is one thing that we must accept. Skirting round it or pretending that it is not the case will not help. Much of Europe has one automatic first foreign language to learn&#8212;English. All the research on success in language learning schools that I have come across&#8212;whether it is from the Carleton board of education in Canada in 1996, from SCILT, Scotland&#8217;s national centre for languages, in 2001 or the 2008 study on Walker Road primary in Aberdeen, which undertook an early immersion project&#8212;links effectiveness in language learning to exposure.</p><p>The playground and classroom-immersion school has better results than the language-medium school, which in turn has better results than the traditional subject-teaching approach. When we consider that, it becomes clear that, although being endlessly bombarded with Hollywood films or Anglophone pop music might be one person&#8217;s cultural imperialism, it is another person&#8217;s head start in multilingualism.</p><p>The reverse is simply not the case.

There is perhaps an interesting point in there somewhere.</p><p>In this country, the choice of second language is not automatic, so we have to make an active case for the language that we teach. French has been the default language for a long time, but German, demand for which has declined, and Spanish and other languages of Latin America and the far east, demand for which has grown, all compete for a limited slot, and a considerable case has to be made to win over the minds of adults. The Barcelona agreement contains an ambitious target, which will be especially ambitious for Scotland.</p><p>In preparation for the debate, I looked up last year&#8217;s standard grade exam in German reading, to see how much I could remember from my schooldays. I think that, with a dictionary and a bit of luck, I might have made a decent stab at it, but I took German far beyond standard grade, and I do not think that the ability to muddle my way through the exam constitutes a basis for a claim to multilingualism. Our stats on people who take languages at standard grade show a consistent downward trend.</p><p>Turning the trend around will never be easy, but there is an obligation in that regard. If, as I said, multilingualism brings benefits and the rest of Europe has a head start, we must ensure that we do not allow permanent disadvantage to emerge relative to the rest of Europe.

We need something similar if we are to succeed.

I believe that the council is arguing honestly and legitimately its view that the site is not common good land. After all, if it argued that it was common good land, that would potentially have strengthened the case that it was making for exclusion. That said, the view that Waverley market is not common good land is predicated on the council having made an error in 2005, when it listed it on its register of common good assets. The minister stated in committee that the bill</p><p>&#8220;has certainly thrown up a wider issue about how accurate information about common good is in the generality&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 7 March 2012; c 681.]</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree with him on that point.

Cycling has been a huge feature of my mailbag for the past few months, mainly in relation to funding, but more recently to the safety aspect, as many people are concerned about the four tragic deaths of cyclists in Edinburgh.</p><p>I am sure that other members welcome, as I do, the summit that was held on March 21 and the Scottish Government&#8217;s repeated recognition that, although it does not always have a role in delivering cycling funding or cycling schemes, it has a leadership role that applies not only to cycling but to all aspects of road safety.</p><p>A strong argument that has been made by cycling groups, and by Alison Johnstone today, is that one of the best ways to ensure safety among cyclists is to create a critical mass on the roads, so that cyclists are seen as partners and equal road users rather than as unwelcome intruders. That stands alongside all the technical road-safety improvements that were set out in the eight-point manifesto of the pedal on Parliament campaign, which I commend to members. It proposes a number of practical changes to planning, speed limits and other traffic laws, transport strategies, training and&#8212;above all&#8212;funding.</p><p>A good starting point in the discussion on active travel funding and the effect on cycling uptake is the excellent &#8220;Civilising the Streets&#8221; report by Transform Scotland. It looks at 13 cities around Europe and how they have substantially increased safe cycling. The report consistently argues that the key drivers that increase safe cycle use are material upgrades in three areas: dedicated cycle lanes, parking spaces and reduced speed limits.</p><p>One of the issues around dedicated cycle lanes that has been articulated to me by cycling campaigners is that they can make cyclists seem like the &#8220;other&#8221; by segregating them. I have also had constituents firmly make the case that, if large numbers of cyclists are to be encouraged, people have to know that they will be protected by something more than a line of paint. That is my view, as well.</p><p>An interesting section in the Transport Scotland document says:</p><p>&#8220;In all cases, the investment in active travel was coordinated and implemented by ... local government ... The study also found that financial support from the national government could be a vital factor&#8221;.</p><p>That is a useful interaction. It is similar to the situation that we have at the moment, with central funding through the CWSS grant scheme and Sustrans, which is matched by local authorities, and a strong emphasis on the actions of local government.</p><p>Transform Scotland highlights Stockholm as being a particularly illustrative example, because it faced many of the challenges that we face, including its geography, a low starting base and&#8212;a perfect parallel with Edinburgh&#8212;the medieval design of its city centre, which restricts flexibility.</p><p>Although the setting aside of a percentage of money and its being put in a pot for cycling is welcome, the greater prize&#8212;as illustrated in the part of the Transport Scotland report that focuses on Stockholm&#8212;is to ensure that all transport planning mainstreams the needs of cyclists, whether on general-use roads or new developments. That is the second point of the pedal on Parliament manifesto. That is not easy, and no one should pretend that it will be. However, it is not distinct from funding and it is a core part of what must be done.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664547", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cycling"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will not even try to follow that with my cycling record.

In my first one, which I made in my members&#8217; business debate last June, I said that I would never grow tired of proclaiming from the rooftops the virtues of my new constituency. Little did I know that I was going to get so much practice at it in such a short time.</p><p>Fortunately, it is a case of third time lucky, in that we have had the great news that the HQ of the green investment bank will be coming to Edinburgh. There is nothing wrong with a bit of self-congratulation, as long as it is tempered with reflection.</p><p>The unity that was shown in the campaign, not only in the Parliament but in civic society and the private sector in Edinburgh, was a model for how we can work together in the interests of the city, the country and the environment. It is testimony to all the groups that came together&#8212;led, as Sarah Boyack&#8217;s motion says, by the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, but also including Scottish Financial Enterprise, the City of Edinburgh Council, the Scottish Government and MPs and MSPs from all parties&#8212;that we succeeded in making the irrefutable case for Edinburgh as the natural heart of the new green economy.</p><p>During that campaign, some of the minor disagreements that we had about the institution and about wider issues of green investment were put aside. Although I did not want to be a party pooper, I was going to dust those off as notes of caution but, fortunately, Ms Boyack has already done so, so I do not feel as if I am spoiling the party.</p><p>Now that the announcement that the GIB&#8217;s HQ will be coming to Edinburgh has been made, we need to be sure of three things, namely that it is green, that it is an investment bank and that it is an HQ. The investment and the footprint in Edinburgh will be vital. We cannot simply have a branch of the bank. I will be interested to see the details that emerge on what, physically, will be in Edinburgh. I note that the Green Investment Bank Ltd is registered with Companies House&#8212;it has registration number 07951292&#8212;as a company in England and Wales. If the HQ is based in Scotland, perhaps it should be registered as a company in Scotland.</p><p>As an investment bank, it must have borrowing powers very early on and be able to actively act like a bank. Having to wait until 2015 seems to be an inordinate delay.</p><p>Furthermore, it must be green. We might take that for granted, and the priorities that have been set out for it include a range of worthwhile green issues in addition to offshore renewable energy in general, such as energy from waste, non-domestic energy efficiency and other measures that are vital parts of the new green economy, and which are necessary if we are to deliver the change that we need to make if we are to meet the 42&#160;per&#160;cent target. However, the &#8220;Update on the design of the Green Investment Bank&#8221; document includes the suggestion&#8212;admittedly, it is not prioritised&#8212;that, at some future time, the low-carbon interventions that the bank might progress could include nuclear power. I would dispute whether nuclear power is low carbon, and I would definitely disagree that it is green.</p><p>Those three important caveats should not detract from Edinburgh&#8217;s success in being announced as the location for the bank&#8217;s HQ.</p><p>Ms Boyack mentioned the union and the market that it brings, and the ability to access English markets gives the Scottish renewables industry a great deal of strength. International trade will always happen, but I note that there have been a few instances in which the kind of investment that the bank is aiming to stimulate has been held back. For example, there is the long-running issue of transmission charging, which is still hampering investment in Scotland. Another example is the fossil fuel levy. Although I very much welcome today&#8217;s announcement, I wish that the steps that have now been taken had been possible four or five years ago. If it is bad having to wait until 2015 for the bank to have borrowing powers, it is just as bad that we have had to wait until 2012 to be able to announce that money that was raised in Scotland and was earmarked for Scotland can be released.</p><p>Overall, the GIB is a great initiative. It strikes me that it is somewhat reminiscent of what was done as part of South Korea&#8217;s path to prosperity, in that it identified where the market failures were and focused public investment strategically with a view to picking a winner and, above all, to climbing the value chain. In the past, the focus has always been on generation but, in the future, the real prizes will be in the technology for marine, wave and tidal power, not simply in manufacturing, which brings many jobs, too, but in development and export. That is the objective that we aim to reach.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Investment Bank"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is my third speech on the green investment bank in less than a year.

As the MSP for Edinburgh Central, I am one of the ex officio members of the board of the National Library of Scotland under the 1925 act as amended. However, I will be happy to play the role of a turkey voting for Christmas when I press my voting button to send that interest into oblivion at 5 o&#8217;clock. Sadly, that will also put an end to any forlorn hope that I might follow in the footsteps of Guido Biagi, who was the librarian of the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence in the late 19th century and with whom I share a common but, I admit, rather distant ancestry.</p><p>As a member of the NLS board, I am in very good company. Membership is also held by the Lord Advocate, the Lord President of the Court of Session, the dean of the Faculty of Advocates, the minister of St Giles, the lords provost of four cities, five further representatives of the Faculty of Advocates, four representatives of the universities, two representatives of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Queen&#8217;s and Lord Treasurer&#8217;s Remembrancer. I admit that I do not know who or even what that is, but it sounds very important. That is by no means the entire list. It is, therefore, no wonder that an overhaul of the governance of the NLS is needed, because it is a 21st century organisation that faces all the challenges of a modern NDPB.</p><p>In my brief hello as a member of the board, which has since given way to a long goodbye, I was introduced to the NLS&#8217;s organisational to-do list. It is a familiar story to anyone who administers a public body in Scotland. It includes balancing budgets, managing limited staff resources, dealing with the ever-present question of public sector pensions and pursuing shared services, on which the NLS is powering ahead by merging departments with the National Galleries of Scotland, with the NLS taking the lead where it is more established and the National Galleries doing so where it has something to offer.</p><p>The National Library is more than just a technical or a regulatory NDPB. As Scotland&#8217;s only copyright library, it is a national institution. It offers a first-class service that is unrivalled anywhere. One of my first visits coincided with a study visit by a friend of mine who is a PhD student in Birmingham and who was consulting some of the primary sources that are held uniquely at the NLS. Cross-border movement in such research is common, as researchers go where the books are. I note with interest that the UK Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 confers continued rights on the library of Trinity College Dublin to receive UK published books and that that is reciprocated by the Republic of Ireland&#8217;s Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, which confers the same rights on UK libraries to receive Irish public books. Books are not separated by national borders, nor should they be.</p><p>As Scotland&#8217;s central library, the National Library has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past decade, in particular. Gone, for anybody who was familiar with the library 10 years ago, are the security barrier and the unwelcoming entrance with a security guard who asked for credentials. Those used to be the first things that users of the library saw. Instead, there is a visitor area with a cafe and exhibitions. The NLS is realising its role not only as a library of last resort but as an inclusive and important part of central Edinburgh&#8217;s cultural life.</p><p>For example, last year I enjoyed the banned books exhibition, where a publication that had incurred a fair amount of ire from Sarah Palin in Wasilla, Alaska sat alongside &#8220;The Love That Dares To Speak Its Name&#8221;, which was the last victim of the UK&#8217;s blasphemy laws in 1976, and even one of the Harry Potter novels, which I understand has been accused of turning the world&#8217;s children to witchcraft. That is news to me.</p><p>We can all appreciate that growing openness. It is not everyone who has to consult a copyright library, but everyone can find something there of interest.</p><p>As somebody who has been in a few copyright libraries in my time, I think that the NLS ranks high for atmosphere. I always found the British Library unwelcoming&#8212;not to mention ugly and full of bricks&#8212;and, to be honest, I found it harder to look at the Bodleian in Oxford after I learned that part of it was the architectural inspiration for the temple of the dark lord in the works of that former Oxford professor J R R Tolkien. I always rather liked the Radcliffe camera myself, but clearly he had a less positive experience than many people have had with the NLS and other libraries since then.</p><p>Such is the openness of the NLS that it is now actively working across Scotland, and one of its priorities is to expand its reach through local libraries and the innovative use of information technology. By doing that, it will become a truly national institution and be part of the cultural life of not just Edinburgh but the entire country from Stranraer to Shetland. That sort of public involvement and promotion of books and learning in the wider sense is not in the 1925 act&#8212;very little is. Section 1(1) of the act states:</p><p>&#8220;There shall be established and founded in Scotland a library with the name of the National Library of Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>That is similar to the oft-quoted first line of the Scotland Act 1998. That act goes on in considerable detail, which the 1925 act does not, although it does go into such detail as to set out the librarian&#8217;s pension. Given that the 1925 act has worked in some respects for 90 years, they clearly do not make legislation like they used to.</p><p>The bill sets out not just the powers of the NLS, as the 1925 act did, but its purposes, and that has been particularly welcomed by the chair of the board and the national librarian. It provides a clear, updated and usable governance framework for the institution, which can only help the NLS to continue to grow and to develop its first-class provision for Scotland and beyond.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest, which has already been alluded to.

He also left 50,000 more unquoted. As the cabinet secretary said, where cases of the sort that Mr Henry mentioned arise, Education Scotland and local authorities should engage them in support. As far as we can tell, that is what is happening. No department or teacher should be afraid of asking for help. Just as support was offered before, it will be offered again. As a member of the Education and Culture Committee, I look forward to finding out more details of the support that is on offer, as I am sure that that is an issue that we will continue to examine. I also welcome the deep audit that is being run by Education Scotland, which will help to identify the support needs.</p><p>What matters are the 54,000 pupils in secondary 2. They and all the cohorts that follow them deserve the chance to be assessed using the same methodologies and philosophies of curriculum for excellence through which they have been taught. What matters now is getting it right. We cannot get it right by putting it off. We are past the point when standard grades could have been extended for one last gasp, and there was never a point when it would have been reasonable to make the entire country&#8217;s schools decant to intermediates for only one year before decanting again to nationals. If we had done that, I am sure that the EIS would be getting more than a 10 per cent response rate to their survey on the issue. Doing that would have let down pupils and created even more of an administrative obstacle for teachers. Of course, that is assuming that, if there were to be such a wholesale delay, moving to nationals would still be the aim&#8212;I hope that it is the aim of everyone in this chamber who supports curriculum for excellence.</p><p>One of the core changes in curriculum for excellence is the move away from the frenetic focus on repeated assessment. The pressure that Scotland puts on its young people is intense and unnecessarily duplicating. That is why nationals are one-year courses rather than the two-year standard grade courses and why we are introducing the three plus three model.</p><p>We should not underestimate the concerns that have been expressed. They are real, but they are best responded to by support, which is in place and is moving further into place with every passing week. We should also not underestimate the prize that is on offer. Secure implementation is important, but wholesale delay is impossible. Rather than unproductive speeches, such as the one that Hugh Henry gave at the Labour conference, we should hear about the ways in which we can continue to support schools so that, together, we can provide confidence to pupils and parents and ensure the successful delivery of curriculum for excellence.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662543", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am 45 seconds in; I cannot have said anything that Mr Findlay particularly dislikes yet.

I come back to it not in contention, but more in agreement and to highlight the point. The difficulty that we sometimes have with members of the public, in our surgeries, on the street or in opinion polls, is that they can be slightly more sceptical than is desirable about international support, whether in the form of aid or on climate issues. In a way, the inconvenient truth about the consensus that we have in civic society and political parties is that there is that greater level doubt. A YouGov poll on 21 June 2011 found that 43 per cent of Scots would scrap the UK&#8217;s international development budget entirely.</p><p>I am glad of the consensus here and the support that we have, and of the continued prominence that we give to the issue, but let us not act complacently; let us be aware that there is still an argument to be made and that we have some difficulties in making progress. The YouGov poll also asked whether aid should be given to countries where there is corruption, and used other Trojan horse questions to try to influence people. I believe that we have a moral duty and are required to profess it at opportunities such as this, and any time we are confronted by members of the public asking why we send money abroad.</p><p>I am glad that Aileen McLeod brought in the term &#8220;ethical&#8221;&#8212;I do not think that it was used before her speech, but it sums up where we are on the issue. The question is ethical. I will draw a little bit of a distinction between two ethical principles that have been conflated a lot. To use reductionist language, one school of thought says, &#8220;This is bad&#8212;we can do something about it.&#8221; A separate principle is, &#8220;This is bad&#8212;we caused it.&#8221; Those two distinct analyses give rise to different levels of obligation.</p><p>In relation to poverty, the causation of underdevelopment or the global south&#8212;whichever term people choose to use&#8212;is debated. In relation to climate change, the question is a lot clearer. I am drawn to the World Development Movement&#8217;s phenomenal statistic&#8212;which I have no reason to doubt&#8212;that the UK emits more carbon dioxide in one year than Bangladesh has emitted in its entire history. When we have spent 200 years polluting our way to prosperity, the issue becomes not noblesse oblige&#8212;helping because we can help&#8212;but helping because we caused or contributed greatly to the problem, so we have an obligation to help.</p><p>I was quite drawn to the minister&#8217;s comment about allowing the Malawis of this world to skip the high-carbon phase and go straight into clean technology. That almost takes me back to some of the difficulties that arose over the Kyoto protocol, to which countries refused to sign up at the start because it made allowance for developing countries to increase their emissions in some circumstances. Countries that did not want to make sacrifices were eager to argue that countries that were a lot less fortunate should make cuts, too, although they were in no position to do so. For example, I believe that the average greenhouse gas footprint of an Indian 10 years ago was one tenth that of a person in the United Kingdom. Given that, saying that developing countries should have no scope to increase emissions is a bit awkward.</p><p>Lots of actions are happening. If I can be allowed a plug, I will say that time for reflection on 14 March will be taken by&#8212;I apologise for my pronunciation&#8212;Esther Wanjohi, who is from Kenya and is in Edinburgh as part of an exchange with the eco-congregation at Saughtonhall United Reformed church. Along with the climate challenge fund and eco-schools, eco-congregations are at the forefront of the work that is happening to mobilise grass-roots opinion and ensure that the country comes with us.</p><p>To be ultra-local, the City of Edinburgh Council has just become the first local authority in Scotland to set a firm target for its spending on active travel. I hope that other local authorities will follow it. As councils spend &#163;475 million a year on transport, it would help if activist groups and MSPs put a little bit more pressure on them to meet their obligations on active travel and other environmental targets.</p><p>This has been the first debate on the concept of climate justice from the country that had the first carbon assessment of a budget and, if not the first act on climate change, certainly the best. We are many countries, but we are one world.

However, in the spirit of the debate&#8212;and perhaps in the spirit of the bank itself&#8212;I will begin with a bit of recycling.</p><p>Members: Oh!</p><p>I am sorry&#8212;it does not get any better than that.</p><p>Back in June, I described Edinburgh as the most natural, the most logical and in all respects the best location for the green investment bank. Like Gavin Brown, when the criteria were published, I thought that the people who had put them together must have had Edinburgh in mind. Looking at them, one cannot help but think that the bank was designed for us.</p><p>As other members have pointed out, there are three requirements: the ability to recruit specialist staff; the opportunity for close working with other parties involved in the deals; and a location that is good value for money. As the formal bid points out, Edinburgh scores incredibly highly in each category. In the Edinburgh travel-to-work area, 60,000 people are employed in the financial services industries; 80 per cent of the world&#8217;s largest banks are present in the city either directly or through subsidiaries; and Edinburgh accounts for 25 per cent of all UK life and pensions employment. Surely that already answers the question of recruiting specialist staff.</p><p>The formal bid also points to the world-class quality of life in Edinburgh. Obviously, as the member for Edinburgh Central I will talk up the city in any way possible. Recently, however, I was reading about the great success of the property market in the new town, which is already attracting very high-status individuals who have been priced out of London. Although they might cause some displacement in the rest of the market, I welcome them and their economic contribution to the city. It simply shows the quality of life that Edinburgh can offer. In fact, at the moment, we cannot seem to build hotels fast enough.</p><p>As for enabling close working, I note that there is both SSE and Iberdrola. On the third criterion, the formal bid shows that the figures for value for money are singularly impressive. For example, the figure of &#163;27 per square foot per year is half that for London and, to any potential inward investors who might be listening, I point out that it is lower than the figure for Glasgow. That might well be in the next Labour leaflet in Glasgow. Finally, I note that, of the 10 locations that the formal bid suggests could be used, nine of them are&#8212;crucially&#8212;in Edinburgh Central.</p><p>In the debate in June, Gavin Brown set out a strength-by-strength list for Edinburgh. As far as financial services are concerned, the list is second to none and includes banking, asset servicing, asset management, insurance, private equity and, above all, committed institutional project sponsors. I hope that that analysis is still supported unequivocally by all parties. Indeed, back then, Sarah Boyack singled out the huge investment in the renewables industry. Tavish Scott reminded us that the prize is not just for Edinburgh but for the whole of Scotland, and he might have given a friendly dig on behalf of Aberdeen when he was doing so.</p><p>The coalition of support for the green investment bank is impressive. It includes Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, SSE, McGrigors, Forth Energy, the City of Edinburgh Council, Scottish Power, and Scottish Enterprise. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has been involved, as have PricewaterhouseCoopers, Anderson Strathern and the Scottish Government. We might have disagreements over the detail&#8212;that is perfectly natural&#8212;but it serves to emphasise the importance of our underlying agreement. There are disagreements about what the green investment bank might invest in, how it would interact with the fossil fuel levy, the importance of borrowing powers and other things, but those disagreements have arisen because of the shared desire for a successful green investment bank. They do not get in the way of our combined support for Edinburgh as its natural and automatic location.</p><p>Last night, a group of MSPs were at a reception to mark the opening in my constituency of the first Scottish high street branch of Triodos. Although it is an international company, Triodos is what we might call a boutique bank. It has about 30,000 savers in the UK and it uses their deposits to lend to businesses that meet its criteria for sustainability, such as renewable energy, agricultural and social enterprises. In a way, it is like a small-scale, private sector, green investment bank. I first heard of Triodos 10 years ago when I was researching ethically motivated investment schemes. Back then, there was an impression that Triodos was an oddity that one could bank with by post and whose chequebooks were printed using soya ink. Now, it is open for business and trading right there on Hanover Street in the heart of Edinburgh. I can see how its time has come as a model and I hope that it grows even further, but such small, specialist houses will never fuel the renewables revolution that Scotland and the rest of the UK so desperately need. I hope that the GIB will follow in Triodos&#8217;s footsteps.</p><p>Indeed, I am happy to echo Patrick Harvie&#8217;s point that the more we see the big banks looking like Triodos in their investments and support for the green industries, the more we will be able to welcome their contributions, but we should not forget that, in this debate, we have the unusual situation of all parties supporting the GIB coming to Edinburgh and we have the unlikely alliance of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Friends of the Earth Scotland.</p><p>The prize is great and therefore worth fighting for. When investors are looking for finance for green projects in the future, they should automatically think of Edinburgh and of making their base here, thereby bringing all their benefits to this city and this country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Investment Bank"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I rise to support the Edinburgh bid for the green investment bank.

If members want to sit there and wring their hands, that is their right. Members have a right to be heard in the chamber. However, unless they present solutions, they simply will not be taken seriously. This is familiar territory for the Labour Party, which always opposes as old Labour and governs as new, but it is unusual for the Conservatives, who have never tired of telling us about Labour&#8217;s deficit and, to paraphrase their favourite Prime Minister, the impossibility of spending other people&#8217;s money. That turnaround is the only new thing in the motion. We only have to look at it closely to see the real Conservative Party solutions.</p><p>Let me turn to a brief positive note. The Conservative Party manifesto was thin on colleges as it contained just one paragraph on the subject, but next to it we saw a welcome suggestion that universities could be encouraged to share administration on a regional basis. That was interesting. I take it that regionalisation is one thing that we can agree on.</p><p>The Conservative Party&#8217;s flagship policy for all tertiary education, of course, was to put a price tag of at least &#163;6,000 on going to university.

That really would be taking with one hand and giving with the other.

I hope that the last of the festive spirit continues in the chamber today.</p><p>Before Christmas, the December statistics that Kezia Dugdale referred to were a good Christmas present for Scottish education. The report card was very good; of 54,000 leavers, 89 per cent were going to positive destinations. More are going into higher education, further education and training, and even more are going directly into employment. That percentage is up not only on the previous year but on 2007-08, before we were hit by the storm of London&#8217;s recession. The number of pupils staying on for sixth year rose by 45 per cent to 54 per cent.</p><p>With regard to qualifications, whatever measurement we choose to use&#8212;the number of standard grades or their equivalent achieved at secondary 4 or later; the number of pupils achieving one, three or five highers in secondary 5; or the number of advanced highers and baccalaureates awarded&#8212;we can see that the results are going up. There are two things that we can rely on every August&#8212;the Edinburgh festival and endless news stories about A-level grade inflation, in which regard no one has ever criticised the quality of Scotland&#8217;s qualifications. The motion gets it right in putting pupils and teachers squarely at the centre for recognition of all that&#8212;they deserve due congratulation for all their achievements in delivering those progressive moves in the statistics.</p><p>However, I would like to mention one challenge that is implicit in the motion&#8217;s reference to increasing attainment &#8220;for all young people&#8221;. In Scotland, we have a democratic tradition that includes the belief that questions of family background should be left behind at the school gate. Our schools are comprehensive and universal; they are never bog standard. That is not unique to Scotland, but for our nation it is a valuable and crucial principle.</p><p>However, a great deal happens beyond the school gate. Growing up in a family that is struggling by on a lower income does not make a child a better or worse person, but it presents many more obstacles that the child must overcome. In its investigation into the attainment of looked-after children&#8212;the subject of yesterday&#8217;s debate, in which I did not get to speak&#8212;the Education and Culture Committee has found that not only does being looked after have a great many effects on children and their education, but that simply facing the challenges of poverty does, too.</p><p>In this Parliament, we talk a great deal about the decisions that a young person makes at 16, but those decisions emerge from the lifetime of experience that they have already accumulated. The experience of the early years, of school and, alongside it, of the family environment will influence the answers to the question about self-worth and self-belief that is posed to every young person who, at 16, is asked by a careers adviser what they want to do with their life.</p><p>It is not just the bottom 20 per cent who face challenges. London&#8217;s recession has made life for families up and down the country like running on an ever-quickening treadmill, which involves running harder and harder just to stand still. The lesson that is taught to a young person who sees family members work hard all their lives only to be laid off in the vague and far-off name of something called deficit reduction can be far more powerful than any lesson that is taught in the classroom.</p><p>The motion states that</p><p>&#8220;a high-performing early years and schools system is the single greatest tool in improving the ... life chances of young people&#8221;.</p><p>I agree. Education broadens horizons, provides empowerment and breaks down barriers, but it is not the only tool, and I worry that in the face of today&#8217;s great social problems the position of education might be like that of the person running on the ever-quickening treadmill, as the social problems become more and more challenging. I have concerns, given that we are dealing with an economy and a welfare system that are in the hands of a Government whose priorities are manifestly a world away from the challenges that ordinary families face in their day-to-day lives as they raise their children and send them to school.</p><p>However, it is not all bad. To return to where I started, the growth of all those challenges and difficulties just makes the achievements of our education system and our teachers all the more laudable. In these difficult times, they are achieving not just the same, but more. The teachers who work in the most deprived parts of my constituency are nothing short of amazing. For me, there is only one measure in education that matters&#8212;the outcomes for young people. Every other measure is a means to that end.</p><p>This is a time of great change in schools, as it is in society. Curriculum for excellence corresponds well with the educational principles of other nations that have similar democratic education traditions, and whose higher and more equal attainment we seek to emulate. I cannot help but notice that they have also been able to tackle many of the chronic underlying social factors that make educational attainment so much harder.</p><p>Curriculum for excellence emerged from a great consultation and development process that saw the political parties in the Parliament working hand in hand. Great hopes are invested in it; it is not hyperbole to call it the greatest education reform in a generation. This will be a crucial year for it. The details of curriculum for excellence&#8217;s implementation are important, but let us not have our eyes drawn away from its grand ambition&#8212;which must go further than just education&#8212;of making the Scottish education system one that delivers for every child in the country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658693", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People (Improving Learning Outcomes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by wishing everyone a happy new year, as I have not got around to doing so in person yet.

One of the organisers, who is a long-standing friend of mine, went out of her way to find a male speaker for the rally. Her reasoning was very simple: men commit the vast majority of violence against women, so male voices must at all times be heard to condemn that violence just as strongly. The reclaim the night tradition is a bit sensitive about female-only spaces, and clearly there is a need in services for such spaces.</p><p>However, I am glad that the cause has never been allowed to become a female-only campaign. Initiatives such as the White Ribbon Campaign, which calls on men to work to end violence against women, are laudable and I only wish that they had a higher profile. The issue is too important to be thought of as anything other than one that demands the attention of everyone in Scotland.</p><p>Violence against women is unacceptable. All criminal violence is unacceptable, but violence in which a man exploits gendered power over a woman through physical or mental means is more than a crime against an individual, as Malcolm Chisholm said. The effects of such violence are very real. Lives are blighted and some people face every day with fear.</p><p>I agree with other members that attitudes matter. As a society we have long since left behind any open suggestion that women are anything but equal. We now have unity in Parliament and across civic society that condemns domestic abuse; there is no political divide on the issue. Anyone who was to suggest that hitting a woman every now and then does her good would be ostracised and condemned, and rightly so. I do not think that the same could have been said just a few decades ago.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are still struggling with attitudes that are usually, although not exclusively, held by women; for example, that women are &#8220;asking for it&#8221; because of their behaviour or their dress. I see women out on Friday nights and sometimes wish that they would put on more clothes in case they catch their death of cold, but never do I think that skimpy clothes give a man licence to rape them. That is a real attitude that I have heard on the lips of everyday people in this day and age&#8212;not many years ago, but just a few months ago on &#8220;Call Kay&#8221;. It is abhorrent to suggest or to encourage the belief that women are somehow responsible for men&#8217;s violence against them. As well as Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid, which has been working on the issue for many years, I single out Rape Crisis Scotland, which has recently taken the initiative in tackling that attitude head on. The &#8220;This is not an invitation to rape me&#8221; campaign is hard-hitting and is aimed at men. It is all the more commendable for that.</p><p>True equality in our society would go a long way towards preventing gendered violence against women, but if we had true equality in our society, women would not be paid 20 per cent less than men are for doing the same job.</p><p>I will add one sad caveat, which is that the UK Government&#8217;s on-going insistence that there be no recourse to public funds in this regard conjures up the grubby picture that perhaps the rights of women to services and support are more dependent on the passport that they hold than they are a genuine universal human right. I know that charities and agencies across Scotland have done everything that they can to get around that, and have done very well in that regard.</p><p>I am proud of the unity&#8212;in this chamber and in the country, on the part of leaders and civic society&#8212;that is evident when it comes to facing up to and condemning the blight of violence against women and what it does to Scotland. I congratulate all the charities, agencies and many informal campaign groups, such as the Edinburgh feminist network, that work tirelessly on the ground, day after day, to end violence against women.

Every sentence that I use has to have a verb, a noun and a plug for independence, so let me get on to that.</p><p>For me, the Durban conference casts a lot of doubt on the argument that the world is interdependent and the nation state is outdated. The 21st century state looks like the 19th century state to a greater extent than it is usually given credit for. Back in 1884, heads of Government met in Berlin, decided the future of the world and carved it up between them. Now, 127 years later, their successors will divide it up in a somewhat different way, but the future of the world is still their responsibility. They might have domestic pressures and cross-border influences, but it is still them&#8212;the heads of Government&#8212;who commit their states to action. When corporate and civic leaders also have seats around the table, as was the case at Davos, it is called a forum. The status of nation state is still a privileged one to have.</p><p>Although I welcome the fact that the UK Government is permitting Scotland to participate in Durban, I look forward to the day when Scotland can participate directly in such events, when we will be able to express whatever views we hold rather than speak only when we agree with the full member state. That said, I welcome the news that we can find common ground on the issue.</p><p>We have a fantastic story to tell. Having achieved a 28.9 per cent cut in emissions by 2009&#8212;that figure was obtained using a slightly different measure to the one that Rob Gibson cited&#8212;we should achieve the Kyoto target with room to spare. We should remember that the Kyoto protocol asked for a cut of just 5.2 per cent from the 1990 baseline by 2012. In doing so, it was criticised for not going far enough, but there were those for whom it still went too far. It has been ratified by 191 countries, but Afghanistan, Andorra and South Sudan have joined the usual suspect of the US Government in the non-ratification camp.</p><p>It is easy to rush to reflexive condemnation of the US Government, but not all the countries that ratified the protocol have delivered. Canada&#8217;s emissions have not fallen since 1990; in fact, they have risen by 24 per cent. The vast majority of that rise is accounted for by just one province, Alberta, whose centre right government has been unmoved by environmental concerns. The lesson of all that is that deeds, not words, are what matter; they are what the developing world&#8212;the underdeveloped world&#8212;is calling for.</p><p>As my colleague Graeme Dey explained, the consequences of not acting would be stark. Friends of the Earth states in its briefing that the RPP, which is a fantastic document,</p><p>&#8220;cannot afford to sit on a shelf&#8221;.</p><p>I agree, although I think that we would disagree on the extent to which that is happening. I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with those concerns, perhaps by updating the climate change delivery plan or providing information in some other way to ensure that there is no doubt whatever about the clarity of the Government&#8217;s intent among the wider public, whether on active and sustainable travel or carbon credits. I certainly have no doubt about its direction of travel.</p><p>In ecological terms, we are the luckiest country in Europe when it comes to economic factor endowment, and we should not overlook that. Two or three hundred years ago, flat land was the prime property; now the rugged landscape and seascape of Scotland can come into their own. We hold the low-carbon investment conference, and I hope that the green investment bank will soon come to my constituency of Edinburgh Central, although I would settle for it coming to one of the neighbouring constituencies&#8212;I am not precious about that.</p><p>I welcome the investment that Scotland has secured in renewable energy, but I probably speak for many when I say that I would like to see a few more home-grown companies taking advantage of the opportunities that exist. My constituency is benefiting from improvements to housing and public transport and from the climate challenge fund and the jobs that are coming with renewables.</p><p>I note that, in August, the Scottish Government expressed an intention to consult on legislation to reduce the use of plastic bags. I hope that the minister looks closely at the option of a bag levy, the potential for which was reserved to the Government under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, because as well as reducing landfill, such a levy could generate funds that could be directed towards spend-to-save measures&#8212;such as home insulation&#8212;that make financial and environmental sense, but which need a bit of up-front investment. That is an example of suggesting action and suggesting how it might be paid for&#8212;many members would do well to learn that lesson.</p><p>I support action on climate change not just because it is the right thing for the economy or because of steps such as those I have outlined but because it is the right thing to do. Whether it is expressed through a moral duty or framed under the economic urgencies of the present, what matters is the underlying commitment and intention for real action. The heads of state at such conferences can sometimes give the impression of a nervous schoolboy afraid to volunteer or of a card sharp eager to pull some quick wins. If Scotland can be a voice of reason, however constrained, it becomes our moral duty not just to act, but, by example, to encourage others to do so too.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Nations Climate Summit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that I can already guess which one Mr Harvie disagrees with.

I was glad that there was the buffer zone of the voice of reason in the middle. That intemperate set of exchanges reflects what has been going on between the UK Government and the unions as well, which seems less like dialogue and more like monologue conducted through a megaphone. As with the rest of Westminster&#8217;s deficit reduction plan, it has the distinct smell of ideology rather than reason.</p><p>There are some redeeming features and the concessions have certainly been welcomed all round. It was not so long ago that left-wing publications were talking about the value of career average rather than final salary pensions for people on low incomes that tend not to progress greatly over the course of their careers. It is interesting that it was accepted that the public sector tends to have better pensions than the private. If that were an indication that the UK Government wants to address the issue by levelling up rather than by levelling down, we might not see so much of private sector workers being set against public sector workers and instead look at the underlying issues of long-term security and pay.</p><p>No wonder there is resentment from the unions&#8212;the problem is not just the impact of these changes but the whole way in which the issue has been approached and the breach of trust. The proposals include a commitment to no further reforms for 25 years but, as the Royal College of Nursing took pains to point out in the briefing that it circulated, it was only in 2008 that there was an agreement with the previous UK Government that aimed to ensure sustainability in public sector pensions, which we are told is the underlying motivation. The UK National Audit Office report in December 2010 estimated that the overall saving to the UK taxpayer from that agreement was &#163;67 billion. Between that and the switch from the RPI to the CPI, which has already happened, the long-term cost of public sector pensions has reduced by almost 30 per cent.</p><p>In the earlier deal, staff in the public sector agreed to pick up costs for the growing pension bill, should it happen, as people lived longer. However, again according to the RCN, in the last year for which figures are available, the NHS pension scheme across the UK paid out &#163;6.3 billion but took in &#163;8.4 billion. That is not to give a permanent clean bill of health to the pension scheme, but it is hardly a picture of a scheme in crisis.</p><p>The figures come from 2009-10, before the current UK Government took office. As the RCN notes,</p><p>&#8220;it is difficult to get an exact figure&#8221;</p><p>for the balance now. That lack of disclosure does not build trust. Public sector workers and their unions can ask, rightly, what the UK Government is trying to hide. If the argument is on sustainability, it is not one that I heard today and, frankly, the case has not been made.</p><p>Looking ahead to next week, I think that it is a shame that there is not greater unity in the chamber. This Parliament is at its best when it is united, and there would be much better outcomes for public sector workers if the Labour Party did not approach the SNP with the same ideological objection as the Conservatives approach the unions.</p><p>Next week, thousands of workers throughout Scotland will take to the picket line because of an ideological cash grab on their livelihoods.

Edinburgh is one of a kind. We already have a sense of place that municipalities the world over can only dream of. Along with the festival, that atmosphere and ambience is the cornerstone of our international tourism and business appeal, and it is one of the reasons why so many people fall in love with the city and move here&#8212;I include myself among them.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s current set of national outcomes recognises and cherishes that strength for Edinburgh and for all of Scotland:</p><p>&#8220;We value and enjoy our built and natural environment and protect it and enhance it for future generations&#8221;.</p><p>As a national outcome, it is well said and well timed. It cannot be repeated often enough. The vagaries of architectural fashion have shown that they can, in months, effortlessly destroy heritage that has taken centuries to develop. In Edinburgh, we have the vandalism that is the St James centre, the narrow escape from the Caltongate development, and the Missoni hotel, which is better than the old Lothian Regional Council headquarters, but then a bandage is better than an open wound. The Parliament&#8217;s design is novel and distinctive inside, but it is hardly in keeping with the buildings around it. Some of us still carry a torch for the Royal high school. Glass and concrete can be found anywhere.</p><p>I have heard a lot of concerns about clone towns, but that usually refers only to the shops, which are identical on every high street. Edinburgh has that too. In the Royal Mile, heritage memorabilia&#8212;the euphemism for what everyone else calls tartan tat&#8212;continues to expand in the face of valiant and welcome, if unfortunately limited city council action. My understanding from the Scottish Parliament information centre is that councils might already have further powers to restrict the more garish displays but they are not willing to put it to the test. I would welcome clearer guidance on that, perhaps from the minister in due course.</p><p>Local authorities have to guard against the clone town effect happening to our urban spaces. Residents and visitors alike want to look around them and know that they are in Edinburgh, a world heritage site, not some soulless identikit North Atlantic modernist dystopia that is reminiscent of one of those 1960s campus universities that are only ever used as sets for filming low-budget sci-fi.</p><p>No one is proposing to bulldoze wholesale the old and new towns of Edinburgh, but over the decades there have been numerous earnest applications, each of which would chip or have chipped away at the atmosphere. Poor maintenance makes historic buildings more vulnerable to an unsympathetic developer. The Odeon on South Clerk Street springs to mind. It is therefore imperative that the VAT hike&#8217;s blockage to proper maintenance be swept away.</p><p>Like boiling a frog, gradual erosion can go unnoticed until it is too late and history has become a hodge-podge. At least the residents of the new town have a better record at making their voices heard than those in the old town, although sadly it was not enough to defend Princes Street from the fashions of the 1960s and the out-of-town obsessions of the 1970s and onwards.</p><p>Historic Scotland&#8217;s guidance in &#8220;New Design in Historic Settings&#8221; provides a welcome steer. Historic Scotland singles out the Scottish poetry library as a case study of sympathetic development, but the poetry library is helped by scale. Too often, the developer&#8217;s objective, even today when the 1960s should just be a memory, is the great new landmark building that will make their name. It is not just a 1960s problem. I look at many of the new builds and wonder what they will look like in 30 or 40 years&#8217; time. We must build with the long term in mind.</p><p>The sentiment of the residents in the last planning meeting that I attended in the old town was, &#8220;Heaven protect us from landmark buildings.&#8221; Residents have long memories and perspectives. Above all, they want to be listened to when they talk about the future of their own communities. Whether it was developers&#8217; threats to the buildings that they grew up with or the impacts of landlordism when the community was once a year-round community, the worries that they expressed are real. There is an unfortunate legacy of planning as something that is done to people rather than with them, especially in lower income areas. If I make one plea for the new architecture, it is that it should pay heed to the importance of communities&#8217; input, whether through charrettes or other forms of involvement.</p><p>Human nature leads us to overlook the familiar, and we in Scotland have turned underrating ourselves into an art form. However, what is at stake here is precious. The sense of place in Edinburgh is valuable for not just its economic contribution, but the simple reason that it is irreplaceable. The national outcome cannot be repeated enough because it stresses that we must protect and enhance our built environment for future generations.</p><p>Today, the old and new towns can stand proudly alongside Amsterdam&#8217;s Grachtengordel, Salzburg&#8217;s Altstadt and many of the other beautiful city centres across Europe that are both preserved and thriving. The city of Edinburgh is not a museum, but if it becomes nothing more than an architectural testing ground, it will not continue to be a vibrant community that offers so much for the entire nation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654653", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy (Architecture and Place Making)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare a small interest as the tenant of a listed building although, as I am the member for Edinburgh Central, it is perhaps no surprise that my constituency office is in an historic and conservation area.

I will continue&#8212;that intervention does not even deserve an answer.</p><p>Until Mr Findlay intervened, a consensus was developing. We all accept that learning about Scotland&#8217;s history, literature and music&#8212;the Scottish context&#8212;is a good thing, which is a decent starting point. Of course, much of that is happening already; we can agree on that, too. However, there is nothing incompatible in recognising that much great teaching of the Scottish context takes place while recognising that many shortfalls and inconsistencies exist and believing that what is good practice or even common practice must become standard practice.</p><p>The principle that is at stake is clear. The entitlement to an education is inseparable from the entitlement to an education about the society in which we live. Curriculum for excellence is strong on that. I do not accept the argument that, because Scottish studies would fit in well with curriculum for excellence&#8217;s ethos, it cannot happen. That seems to be an argument in favour of Scottish studies. I am left bemused at the state of a country in which the right to learn about the society in which we live is even contested.</p><p>Let us be clear: good practice exists, but gaps remain. That has been most obvious and most talked about in history. The last attempt that I could find to gauge knowledge of Scottish history was a study of 3,000 secondary 4s&#8212;it is a little dated and could perhaps do with being revisited&#8212;that was peer reviewed and published in The Curriculum Journal. It is most worrying that the main reason that was chosen&#8212;by 37 per cent&#8212;for the act of union was an English military conquest of Scotland. The most popular description of Culloden&#8212;chosen by 41 per cent&#8212;was a battle between wholly Scottish and wholly English armies. I put it very gently to anyone who is sceptical about Scottish studies that ending those misconceptions would in no way be nationalist brainwashing.</p><p>In case anyone thinks that I am singling out the youth of today&#8212;although the cohort to which I referred are my contemporaries&#8212;a 2004 study of 1,000 people across the United Kingdom on British history by the BBC found that distinctions between ages were minimal. However, 6 per cent of respondents to that study thought that the Spanish armada&#8217;s vanquisher was Gandalf from &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221;, so perhaps the most important finding is a cautionary one about multiple-choice questions.</p><p>I am not the only one who thinks that there is a gap here. The Government has very much reflected civic society on the matter. As well as the Scottish studies working group, which has been given credibility by the involvement of figures such as Liz Lochhead, we had, in 2010, the literature working group, which worked with the Government in a cultural rather than educational context. One of the wide-ranging recommendations in its report, which I was drawn to in preparation for this debate, urged the inclusion of a mandatory question on Scottish literature in higher English. I do not know the background, but I suggest that that was the source of the current proposal. The group, which was chaired by The Herald&#8217;s literary editor, included Allan Massie and Andy Nicoll and I am sure that anyone who suggests that it was an agent of tartan parochialism can look forward to a very hearty write-up in The Sun.</p><p>Given the lack of any research, one cannot help citing personal experience in this debate. If members are going to be anecdotal, I should perhaps add my own anecdote, which, as I pointed out somewhat insensitively to some of my colleagues yesterday, is perhaps a little more contemporary than most.</p><p>For me, geography was the exemplar subject. Glaciation was taught with reference to the Clyde coast and Glen Fruin and the starting point for examining urban land use was the town in which we lived. It was a fine example of teaching of universal concepts through a Scottish context. Such an approach meant that learners could more readily access and identify the subject matter. It felt alive and relevant.</p><p>I have nothing but the highest praise for music, which ranged with a very even hand across cultures, genres and periods. However, I took English for six years and, aside from one Liz Lochhead poem, the closest it ever came to Scottish literature was &#8220;Macbeth&#8221;&#8212;which does not count. Do not even get me started on history. Two of my nephews now attend the same school and, as far as I can see, little has changed. That kind of patchwork needs to be addressed.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652307", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Studies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "From third time lucky to three strikes and you are out.

The people at Nari Kallyan Shangho had realised that if they were to know more about Scotland they would need a course to be taught.

The maintenance of the education maintenance allowance makes us the envy of the United Kingdom, as does the retention of free education.</p><p>I want to take issue with points that were made in yesterday&#8217;s debate. It is rare that I say this, but I have a great deal of sympathy with what Annabel Goldie said about parenting skills. In a spirit of co-operation, I say that I am glad that she raised the issue. However, the only reason that she gave for the problem was the lack of parenting skills, which is a bit of a circular argument.</p><p>There is a major problem with early-years parenting in this country, which needs to be addressed. I hope that it will be dealt with quite well by the proposed children&#8217;s services bill. We have to look deep into the reasons behind the parenting crisis. For most people, there is no deeper instinct than the instinct to care for one&#8217;s offspring. When that breaks down, it is the result of economic pressures or wider pressures to do with a lack of hope and a lack of opportunity&#8212;and in most of the worst cases, the presence of no shortage of alcohol.</p><p>I take issue with Ken Macintosh, who said yesterday that education is entirely devolved. He is right if we are talking about how the money is divided up and how the budgets and systems are administered. However, he delivered what, in essence, was a wish list&#8212;a series of &#8220;I wants&#8221;&#8212;which was based on an unlimited budget and financial powers that the Scottish Parliament does not have. I share many of his aspirations, but unless there is realism from the Labour Party about the Parliament&#8217;s ability to fund such aspirations, there will be no constructive discussion on the topic.</p><p>On the proposals on children&#8217;s rights, as of 2009 194 of the 196 members of the United Nations had signed up to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child&#8212;of course, incorporating the convention into a country&#8217;s law means going a lot further. It is interesting that the two UN members that had not signed up to the convention, of their own volition, were Somalia and the United States. The rights in the convention are widely recognised. That is important, because we live in a society in which, according to the Scottish Youth Parliament, 64 per cent of young people feel that they are viewed negatively or very negatively&#8212;the proportion rises to 80 per cent in relation to the portrayal of young people in the media. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund&#8212;UNICEF&#8212;reported in 2007 that child wellbeing in the UK is the lowest in the developed world.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s proposals in that regard and the opportunities for all guarantee for 16 to 19-year-olds show that the Government puts young people at the heart of its programme and its aspirations.

We see in the media reports of grade inflation, but they should carry the warning, &#8220;Not for viewers in Scotland.&#8221; In the last term, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service uprated Scottish school-leaving qualifications against A-levels because it was felt that the grade inflation in England had closed the gap between school-leaving qualifications in England and Scotland.</p><p>However, we should not rest on our laurels. The 2009 programme for international student assessment that was carried out by the OECD, which my colleague Gordon MacDonald mentioned, is possibly the largest piece of comparative research on education across the world. It did not look only at how well students were attaining; it also gathered considerable data about their educational experiences, and it drew conclusions from that. It is the most extensive piece of research of its kind ever done, and although some of its recommendations about what is seen to improve learning and attainment may be uncomfortable for us, they are worthy of consideration.

Children spend 30 to 35 hours a week in school, but they spend 130 hours elsewhere. Yesterday, I met Save the Children, which pointed to evidence that two thirds of low-income families report difficulties in meeting the financial costs of schooling. I do not think that we can separate the issues of inequality and poverty from education. There are two bottom 10 per cents: there is the bottom 10 per cent by income and the bottom 10 per cent by attainment, and perhaps we look too closely at one without looking at how the two interact.</p><p>The issue of the attainment gap sent me scurrying off to the Scottish Qualifications Authority&#8217;s attainment data sets, which reveal an interesting situation: for every decile one goes up, the average pupil gains two grades at standard grade. However, socioeconomics explain an extremely small proportion of the variance in results in the OECD research&#8212;only 14 per cent. What is the difference? I think that we square the circle by realising that the OECD research measures aptitude, whereas the SQA statistics measure outcomes and qualifications. Perhaps the Government and the Education and Culture Committee need to look at why pupils who are not that different in aptitude are not achieving the same qualifications.

I begin by recognising the work that has been done since the campaign started last September, which has been led by the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, the City of Edinburgh Council, the Scottish Government and its agencies, and parliamentarians from all parties.</p><p>I am a relative newcomer to the issue, but I wanted to give Holyrood an early opportunity to place firmly on the record our support for the project, which runs across all parties and all regions of Scotland. As a Parliament, we will disagree on many details, such as the role of the fossil fuel levy in the green investment bank. Those differences of opinion are real, but they are normal; we cannot wish them away, nor should we seek to. Their existence just serves to highlight how significant a development it is when we do agree. The Parliament is at its best when it is in agreement. Together we united to pass the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and together, I think, we are united in supporting Edinburgh as the natural place, the logical place, and in all respects the best place for the green investment bank.</p><p>I speak as the member of the Scottish Parliament for Edinburgh Central, and two key considerations stand out for me in this matter&#8212;that the green investment bank would be good for Edinburgh, and that Edinburgh would be good for the green investment bank. What benefits would the bank bring to Edinburgh? As the motion states, the United Kingdom Government, in its May update paper on the GIB, estimated direct employment from the institution of between 50 and 100 jobs and direct capital of about &#163;3 billion, which will be rolled out in three stages up to 2015. That might seem quite modest compared with, for example, Standard Life, which has just shy of &#163;200 billion in capital and thousands of employees, but the impact on Edinburgh should not be measured in such narrow terms.</p><p>In the election, we in the Scottish National Party presented an ambition for the whole of Scotland that was built on our vision of Scotland playing a central role in the low-carbon industries of the future. The people of Scotland endorsed that vision overwhelmingly, and those industries are already significant. In 2009, 10 low-carbon exports from Scotland totalled &#163;845 million and growing, and they will grow further. HSBC predicted in &#8220;Sizing the climate economy&#8221; last September that the global market in low-carbon industries will reach $2.2 trillion by 2020. As with all things these days, the most important market is estimated to be China, but I do not want our renewables revolution to be built wholly on imported Chinese technology.</p><p>As Mary Scanlon alluded to last week in our debate on green energy, there is a problem in that green investments in Scotland can be porous. We are not yet at the centre of the technology. For example, about half of all wind turbines in the world are made in Denmark. As a country, we in Scotland have for many years run the risk of being on the edge of developments, of being a branch economy and of being an importer. As I said in the green energy debate, the prize of the GIB is to be at the heart of the financing of new technologies&#8212;offshore wind, energy efficiency and waste reduction. Through steps such as the Saltire prize, the leasing agreements and the 100 per cent renewable energy target, together with the sheer political will that is being shown in Scotland, as a country we are starting to take our rightful place in the development of the technologies. However, as a global financial centre of long standing, Edinburgh has its own specialist niche to fill in the new economy. The GIB would put Edinburgh firmly on the global low-carbon investment map.</p><p>Convincing Edinburgh of those benefits is not the hard part. Convincing Westminster is more of a challenge. However, it is now widely acknowledged that the only credible bids on the table are those from Edinburgh and London. If I was Vince Cable, I would be a little bit worried, because for civil servants in Whitehall it has gone from being a default, almost as far as to become a reflex, that when a new institution is set up, it is set up within sight of the Thames. It would be the easiest thing in the world for the machinery of the relevant department just to continue the habits of a lifetime, but the case that has been put forward for Edinburgh is formidable. It was tremendously well presented in the March business case that was compiled by Grant Thornton and put forward by Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, which&#8212;with their forbearance, I hope&#8212;I will now shamelessly plagiarise.</p><p>At the heart of the business case is a simple proposition:</p><p>&#8220;Edinburgh is the only location in the UK which can bring finance and the clean energy industry together in a single location ... To support successful commercialisation, it is important that the GIB is closely connected to where the action is.&#8221;</p><p>Some 38,000 people work in financial services in Edinburgh. Our financial sector continues to outperform that of the UK as a whole. Assets under administration in Scotland are estimated to total &#163;1.3 trillion, and with tax increment financing, Scotland is also beginning to be at the forefront of innovation in project financing, just as we are&#8212;through Aquamarine, Pelamis and others&#8212;increasingly at the forefront of innovation in technology. We are indeed &#8220;where the action is.&#8221; In fact, our green potential has been praised in the chamber so often that listing our share of Europe&#8217;s offshore resource has become almost a clich&#233;, so here is a different illustration. Our peak demand for electricity in this country is around 6GW; our practical offshore resource is a little over 206GW.</p><p>All of that goes without saying. I could spend every minute of every debate for the next five years shouting from the rooftops the virtues of my new constituency, but I think that I would try the patience of other members. Therefore, I say that although I was elected by Edinburgh Central, it was to serve as part of the Parliament of Scotland for all of Scotland, and all of Scotland stands to benefit from the investment. Members from other parts of Scotland will testify to that, and I look forward to their contributions.</p><p>I hope that, today, we can come together as parliamentarians across our divides to state the case not just for Edinburgh but for Scotland. In that spirit of consensus, let me&#8212;for the first and perhaps the last time&#8212;quote the Secretary of State for Scotland, who said of Edinburgh that</p><p>&#8220;the city&#8217;s strategic location and financial expertise make it an ideal place to locate the Bank.&#8221;</p><p>I could not agree more, and I hope that his own colleagues are in as much agreement with him as I am.

In doing so, I realised that there is something quintessentially Scottish about renewable energy. If he feels that I am moving from prose into poetry, I advise Mr Carlaw to remember that that is what the Scottish people desired 14 years ago.</p><p>Renewable energy is not the most tartan and shortbread of topics, but it brings out two very important, and conflicting, aspects of the Scottish national psyche, if such a thing can be said to exist. First, there is the high esteem in which we hold engineering and manufacturing, science and innovation, which has run through everything that has been said. When I was sworn in, I paid homage to the Italian side of my background but today, as we move into the territory of offshore and marine renewables, I pay greater tribute to the Scottish side&#8212;the shipbuilding Jamiesons who worked in Denny&#8217;s of Dumbarton. I know that it is traditional to go straight into talking about one&#8217;s constituency but, the last time that I checked, there were no shipyards in Lochrin basin, so I will work with what I have.</p><p>Denny&#8217;s was part of a national industry. Sadly, it closed a great many years ago, in 1963. That gives the lie to the suggestion that it was only under Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s Government that Scotland&#8217;s industry was allowed to decline. Denny&#8217;s firsts included its making of the first all-steel merchant ship, the first commercial turbine steamer and the first all-welded ship. Regrettably, it has been too many years since Scotland has been able to drum out such a hammer beat of industrial firsts, but I think that that time may be coming again.</p><p>If the value that we attach to engineering is among the better angels of our nature, our nation&#8217;s often chronic lack of self-belief sits on the other shoulder, constantly whispering doubts in our ear. Those who would talk us down have always been on hand to help. During the campaign, at my final hustings, I was accused by the Labour Party candidate of offering &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221;. It was no person present here who said that&#8212;just to explain, there is a community council that straddles two constituencies. It was one of those awkward moments when it is easy to feel the nervous shuffle of feet in a room even though everyone is sitting down. For a country that has been taught to talk itself down, standing up and standing out as one of the world&#8217;s leaders in renewable energy does not come easily. It is uncomfortably like that dreaded trait&#8212;showing off.</p><p>In Scotland, we now have a spring in our step. The remaining challenge for we MSPs is to keep showing how the goal relates to lives. That means jobs, primarily, to the constituents that I represent. The target of having 100 per cent renewable energy is a great symbol that offers a warming sense of ambition. However, on its own, it does not offer comfort to the 17-year-old school leaver in Dalry.</p><p>Finding and moving to clean energy is not just our responsibility, it is also an opportunity for people from all walks of life: the welder in the yard building the offshore turbine; the business people in meeting rooms in foreign countries securing deals to export our expertise; or the young Edinburgh university graduate engineer at her desk, on a team designing the next big thing in tidal power; and all the jobs that depend on those people. I hope that the renewables route map, or road map&#8212;whatever we want to call it&#8212;will mainstream such opportunities, as today&#8217;s motion suggests.</p><p>If we talk of green energy in the same terms as oil was spoken of in the 1970s, it is because it is on at least the same scale. We should not be afraid to accept that. Last year&#8217;s offshore valuation study estimated that eventual income from direct sales of North Sea electricity would reach &#163;14 billion. That is just from the electricity; it ignores the expertise, skills and all the linkages that happen in any economy. That wealth must not be frittered away like the wealth before it. It must be used wisely and it must be shared. In that respect, we have two more good Scottish values to commend.</p><p>The capital, Edinburgh, is near the front of any queue for economic benefit. Right now, however, there is one pressing issue for the city, which is whether we will provide the location for the UK&#8217;s green investment bank. Next week, I will host the first member&#8217;s debate of the session on the subject, which is a privilege for any member, but particularly for a new member. The value of the green investment bank will not be measured by the size of its payroll or the extent of its capital. It is true that there are issues about how it will be funded and in what it might invest, but we can have our disagreements on those points later. What we can do now is come together and back the excellent campaign being run by Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce in the interests of the city. We can agree that locating the green investment bank in Edinburgh would be a vote of confidence in Scotland and a message to the world that on renewable energy, instead of looking to London, Paris, Frankfurt or Zurich, it should look first to Edinburgh. Scotland has been called Europe&#8217;s geographic periphery; now, instead, we can be the new frontier.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure and an honour&#8212;and, indeed, the best kind of duty&#8212;to speak for the first time in the Parliament on behalf of the voters of Edinburgh Central who sent me here.
