However, I am equally embarrassed, ashamed and angry at having to take part in such a debate in a wealthy, developed nation. People in my home village, my county, my country, throughout the nations of the UK and way beyond cannot feed their children, their families or, indeed, themselves.</p><p>More than 50,000 of our fellow Scots sought help in the past year alone. That is the equivalent of every man, woman and child in a full Ibrox or Celtic Park on a Saturday going hungry. It is a huge and growing scandal. Those who present to food banks are decent people. They are often hard-working people who are keeping down a job or several jobs trying to survive but they are forced to wipe away their tears, swallow their pride and walk through the doors of the food bank to ask for help to feed their children.</p><p>I have been unemployed but I am very fortunate that it was for a short period and neither I nor any members of my family have ever ended up going hungry. I cannot imagine what it is like to look into the cupboard or fridge and see little or nothing there&#8212;indeed, I do not think that any of us can. I cannot imagine the mental turmoil, the pressure, the feelings and thoughts that people experience in the days and weeks leading up to the time when they are forced into a situation in which the food bank is their only option. We can only wonder how that feels. Even the thought of it makes my stomach churn as I speak. God knows what it is like for those who are in the real-life situation.</p><p>We must be honest that the growth in the use of food banks has not occurred by chance. It has not occurred because of an individual&#8217;s behaviour. It has not happened because of somebody&#8217;s bad luck. It has happened because of deliberate political choices and a decades-long adherence to the doctrine of neoliberalism. That is an ideology that promotes the rule of the market, the free movement of capital and goods, deregulation, trickle-down economics, an attack on organised labour and freedom from the state. It celebrates reducing public expenditure for social services such as health and education, promotes privatisation and promotes individualism over a collective approach to our economy and society.</p><p>It is a doctrine that has dominated political thinking over the past 40 years and has resulted in the mass redistribution of resources from poor people to rich people; repeated attacks on trade unions; market deregulation; the privatisation of our public services including, in some countries, the water that people drink; and poverty and food shortages across the developing world, which are now coming to us in the developed world. At the same time, the biggest corporations have been rewarded with yet more tax cuts and profits. All the time, benefits, services and social protection have been reduced. Food banks, homelessness, low pay and insecure work are the symptoms of such a system.</p><p>Stuart McMillan referred to Westminster as the problem. I am as happy as anyone to put the boot into the Tories and the Liberals, but there are food banks in France, Spain and across the EU. Tory cuts exacerbate the problem, but they are not the root cause of the problem. That is much, much deeper. Of course, it is telling that not one Tory or pathetic Liberal could turn up to this debate to take the consequences. They are usually here for every members&#8217; business debate, yet there is not one of them here today.</p><p>I would like this to be a world in which we see feeding people as our priority over profit, and in which we use new technology and human ingenuity to banish the scourge of hunger for everyone.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22883964", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Banks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For anyone with an interest in social and economic justice and fairness, this, of all debates, must get the political juices and emotions flowing.

He cannot walk because of his condition, so he uses a wheelchair permanently. Like many disabled travellers, he is sadly used to experiencing a wide range of problems when travelling at home and abroad, particularly when he is going on holiday. He could have problems with booking, poor information provision, problems with the hotel or his room, or issues with buses and taxis. The list appears to go on and on, and the problems will be familiar to many disabled travellers.</p><p>On his most recent holiday, the experience that he and his partner had was so bad that I felt that it had to be exposed because, without doubt, many other people will have had similar experiences. Since I lodged the motion, and my brother&#8217;s case was featured in the Sunday Mail, many other people have come forward and shared similar experiences.</p><p>Last year, John booked a holiday via a Scottish company, Barrhead Travel, and requested the usual adapted room with a roll-in shower and all the other things that he would need on holiday. On making the booking, he asked the adviser whether there would be an aisle wheelchair on board the aircraft so that he could get to and from the toilet while he was on the flight. Of course, that was confirmed.</p><p>However, when he boarded the Jet2 flight, he found that, despite previous assurances, no aisle wheelchair was available. The stewardess he spoke to advised him that they did not have such a thing. Indeed, she did not even know what one was. He then had to board the plane last, in front of everyone else, which he found very embarrassing. As someone with limited mobility, he had to drag himself to his seat, which took a great deal of time and energy. He was then seated in the ninth row from the toilet and told that there was no aisle wheelchair to get him to and from the toilet, and that he was not allowed to move seats because he would be blocking the evacuation route for able-bodied passengers should there be an emergency.</p><p>The cabin steward was very defensive&#8212;indeed, he was aggressive and unhelpful&#8212;and my brother had to endure the humiliation of discussing his toilet requirements and health problems in front of all the other passengers. He was told that the cabin crew could not assist him to move, if needed, as that was against the company&#8217;s health and safety policy. At one point, the situation became like a &#8220;Carry On&#8221; film, because the cabin crew suggested that his partner should carry him if he needed to be moved. That ignored the fact that she is small and he is over 6ft tall and weighs 13 stone. It was an utterly ridiculous suggestion.</p><p>Customer service seems to apply only to able-bodied passengers as far as Jet2 is concerned. The company seems to be happy enough to take money from disabled passengers while treating them with complete contempt.</p><p>I do not know about you, Presiding Officer, and I will not ask you to respond to the point, but I do not think that many of us could last for a four-hour flight without needing to go to the little boys&#8217; or little girls&#8217; room. Of course, the situation was repeated on my brother&#8217;s return journey.</p><p>How did he feel? He was certainly embarrassed, angry, disappointed, and humiliated. He had been treated very much like a second, third, or fourth-class citizen. He felt that no one was interested and that they did not care about his most basic needs. For other passengers, things can be as bad or even worse. The trailblazers group of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign has highlighted a number of related problems for wheelchair users travelling on flights. Some people have been unable to take flights because most of the budget airlines will not carry wheelchairs of above a certain weight. Wheelchairs have been damaged beyond repair, and people have said that they have low expectations of airlines&#8217; ability to take care of their medical and mobility equipment. I thank the trailblazers group, the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, and Roberto Castiglioni of the Reduced Mobility Rights campaign for their efforts to improve the rights of disabled travellers.</p><p>Things need to change. We need to ensure that airlines provide a decent and dignified service for all passengers at all times. In June 2012, the European Commission issued guidelines to improve and facilitate the application of Regulation (EC) 1107/2006, but they are not legally binding. The guidelines state:</p><p>&#8220;Under Annex II to the Regulation cabin crew are required to provide appropriate assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility in moving from their seat to toilet facilities if required. Any particular procedures implemented for the assistance of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility should neither compromise the performance or the health and safety of cabin crew in undertaking their duties&#8221;.</p><p>The guidelines also state that on-board portable</p><p>&#8220;aisle wheelchairs should be used for this purpose where available.&#8221;</p><p>However, that is only guidance.</p><p>The Civil Aviation Authority suggests that</p><p>&#8220;providing assistance without the use of an on-board wheelchair should be avoided unless airlines are able to overcome inherent health and safety concerns.&#8221;</p><p>Some airlines are doing very well in that regard and I commend British Airways, Thomson, Thomas Cook, Virgin Atlantic and Ryanair&#8212;I know that some people may be surprised by that. However, Jet2, Flybe, easyJet, CityJet and Aer Lingus do not provide on-board wheelchairs and Monarch does only if a special request is made. I say to those airlines: get into the 21st century and get your act together because your competitors are providing those services and you need to, too.</p><p>Finally, since the events that I described and the publicity surrounding them, Barrhead Travel has updated its website on accessibility guidance, and I encourage other travel agents to do so because some of them are making poor provision for disabled passengers. New accessibility guidance has come from ABTA for its members.</p><p>The reality is, though, that space and cost factors appear to be the only ones preventing airlines from adopting on-board aisle wheelchairs as a standard feature. However, given that Ryanair, one of the lowest-cost carriers, provides aisle wheelchairs on board its entire fleet, space and cost arguments simply do not stack up. Barring the physical limitations on smaller aircraft, all airplanes flying from and to Scotland, the United Kingdom, and all European countries should be equipped with on-board wheelchairs. It is only fair to say that the airline industry now has no plausible argument to further delay adopting on-board aisle wheelchairs as a standard feature on board each and every aircraft that has the ability to carry and use them.</p><p>In this year of all years, when the Commonwealth games and the Ryder cup are coming to Scotland and disabled passengers will come from all over the world to visit Scotland, every airplane landing in Scotland with over 60 seats that is capable of carrying on-board aisle wheelchairs should have them. That would allow every passenger to travel with some level of dignity.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22860563", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Airlines Discriminating Against Disabled People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My brother is a multiple sclerosis sufferer.

It is reported that an astonishing 1 million people commit suicide every year. That is one every 40 seconds&#8212;more than all the world&#8217;s murders and wars combined. There are, of course, many reasons why people decide to take their own life but, whatever they are, the fact that 1 million avoidable deaths take place through suicide every year is a truly shocking statistic.</p><p>I echo the sentiments of the minister and the Scottish Government that much work needs to be done. Therefore, I welcome the new suicide prevention strategy that the Government is introducing. I hope that it will build on the good work already being carried out by the likes of the choose life programme and various other programmes in which local authorities, health boards, communities and many other agencies are involved.</p><p>Prevention is the key to all activity and informs the new national strategy. However, in forming any prevention strategy, we must be fully aware of the facts and figures so that we can target resources effectively. For example, we need to know why men are nearly three times more likely than women to take their own life. We need to understand that the most vulnerable group is men between the ages of 35 and 44. However, men aged 25 to 34 and 45 to 54 also appear to be highly vulnerable.</p><p>I find the socioeconomics of the matter stark. There is a very strong correlation between suicide rates and levels of social and economic deprivation. Between 2008 and 2012, the age-standardised rate was more than four times higher in the most deprived tenth of the population than in the least deprived tenth.</p><p>I have to say that, with income levels falling, welfare changes and the general thrust of austerity, desperation can and does creep into people&#8217;s lives when they are on the breadline. The Samaritans report &#8220;Men and Suicide: Why it&#8217;s a social issue&#8221; points to an increased risk as income goes down, as well as to an increased risk in groups with poor education and among unskilled manual workers and social housing tenants.</p><p>I will make one other point on statistics. I note that the figures in the motion and the Government&#8217;s new strategy state that there has been an 18 per cent reduction in the suicide rate in the past 10 years. However, I looked at local authority figures prior to the debate and it appears that there is a difference between the headline figure in the strategy and the local authority figures. Perhaps, in his closing speech or after the debate, the minister could clarify the difference between what is in the strategy and the figures that local authorities produced. I make that not as a political point but as a point of clarification.</p><p>Beyond the statistics, we need to focus and refocus on prevention and on targeting people and groups in the communities where they live. As members would expect, there are many sources of information and analysis on the subject. The report to which I referred&#8212;&#8220;Men and Suicide: Why it&#8217;s a social issue&#8221;&#8212;highlights a number of points, but the socioeconomic dimension jumps out. We need to address the fact that suicide figures are significantly higher in the communities that I mentioned.</p><p>As a general rule, the poorer someone is, the more likely they are to self-harm. At a basic level, if someone lives in poor housing, has a very low income, is under financial pressure and does not have support systems around them, and if their life seems devoid of hope, it is unsurprising but nevertheless upsetting that they might take the appalling option of suicide.</p><p>For other people, major events or changes in their life are the trigger. That could be job loss, relationship breakdown, the death of a friend or loved one or a change in physical health or mental wellbeing. The Samaritans report points to a number of factors that contribute to the high figures. The main ones are whether they are male, their background, personality traits and emotional literacy and mid-life challenges. Those are issues that any strategy must recognise and address.</p><p>Of course, we must draw people out to enable them to share their feelings and concerns. I am sure that we would all recognise that we Scots are not the best at talking about our personal difficulties. We may be free with our moans about the weather, the national football team, physical ailments or the after-effects of a good night out, but we are much more reticent when it comes to our inner feelings, emotions and what is going on inside our heads. We do not tend to share those feelings. Often, the last people we are willing to share our troubles with are the very people who can help us most: the people we live and work with and the people we love and care most about. There are many attractive things about our national character but that is a part of it that we have to change quickly because, for far too many of our fellow Scots, those troubled feelings, which are often caused by major events or experiences in their lives, cause them to self-harm or suicide. Of course, we need to develop platforms to help people to open up, and I hope that the Government's strategy helps to ensure that that will happen.</p><p>I want to finish by giving voice to someone who has been affected by suicide and who is a relative of one of the 3,904 suicides in Scotland over the past five years. This person, who is a friend of mine, told me this week about his family&#8217;s experience, and I said that I would relay what he said to the Parliament.</p><p>He said that the issue of mental health problems needs to be publicised more on television and online and in newspapers, magazines and the general media. He said that such awareness raising is important but that brief, infrequent adverts are never going to be enough. The first port of call must be to ensure that ordinary people&#8212;family and friends&#8212;can spot the signs that there are problems and know what they are. More awareness raising through the media would help, and I am grateful that the strategy points to greater use of social media.</p><p>He also said that the health service must get away from attempting a quick fix by prescribing pills for mental health conditions such as depression rather than taking a longer-term approach, and that mental health services have to be more effective and accessible. That is still not happening. It takes months for a client to see someone and, when they manage to do so, the number of sessions that they are allowed is restricted.</p><p>He also said that his family had great support from the charity Touched by Suicide Scotland, which runs eight self-help groups and works in five different council areas. It has expressed frustration at the different ways in which it is treated by local authorities. Some are very supportive but others appear to completely fail to recognise the support needed by individuals who are bereaved by suicide.</p><p>On awareness training, the charity urges us to go much further and make the focus of training much wider than previously, when it has been mainly on health service staff. Of course, GPs, nurses, health visitors and so on need training, but we also need to train housing officers, benefits staff, advice workers, shop stewards, bar staff and people who work in bookmakers, bingo halls and the like, because they will come into contact with people who may be at risk of self-harm. I hope that, under commitment 2 of the strategy, training will be considered for those groups of workers.</p><p>Touched by Suicide also expresses concern about support for children and young people who are at risk of suicide and says that not enough is being done in schools and colleges. It says that, if a child is at risk of suicide and is classed as priority, the quickest timescale for them to be seen by someone is within five days, which can often be too long. It raises concern about funding being a big problem for small organisations that support people who have been bereaved by suicide. If they support people in different areas, they often have to submit multiple applications for funding in each of the geographical areas that they work in.</p><p>Five years ago, when I was a councillor, six constituents in my ward took their own lives in an 18-month to two-year period. Six lives wasted, six families shattered and communities devastated. I hope that the strategy has the impact that it is designed to have. I speak regularly to the friends and family of those six people. They never forget, and they never stop saying one word: &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854657", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Suicide Prevention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Suicide affects far too many families and communities throughout the world.

In the spirit of consensus for which the cabinet secretary and I are well known, I say that we also reject the marketisation of the NHS and the so-called reforms that are wreaking so much havoc on the NHS in England. I believe that Scottish Labour and the Scottish Government are at one in doing that. Indeed, so bad are the Tory reforms that even Jackson Carlaw will not endorse them&#8212;that tells us everything about what is going on in England.</p><p>We can also agree on the commitment, dedication and skill of the whole NHS workforce, without whom the NHS would simply not function. We ignore them and their concerns at our peril.</p><p>Health is fully devolved and our responsibility in this Parliament is to hold ministers to account for what is going on here in Scotland. As the motion sets out, the reality is that the NHS in Scotland and the staff who work in it are under pressure as never before. There are budget pressures, fewer staff are being asked to do more for less, the social care system is in crisis and there is bed blocking. Waiting times are increasing, there is only a skeleton weekend service, vacancy rates are up and the number of cases of bullying and the use of gagging clauses to silence staff are up.</p><p>In addition, junior doctors are being left to look after up to 100 beds while working up to 100 hours a week and patients are being left on trolleys and are sometimes being treated in cupboards. Only last week, at the Western general hospital, patients were being left on trolleys for up to 13 hours. Let us also not forget Scotland&#8217;s shame of health inequality, which is increasing despite the Scottish Government&#8217;s rhetoric&#8212;unsurprising, given the &#163;1 billion of cuts to anti-poverty initiatives.</p><p>In the summer, I called for a full-scale review of the NHS in Scotland. That call was not made on a whim or for narrow party-political reasons; it followed wide-ranging discussions that I had had with doctors, consultants, nurses, patients, trade unions and a range of stakeholders from across the NHS. The evidence that they presented convinced me that we need to look at the whole system to ensure that the NHS is fit to meet the needs and demands of the 21st century. We need such a review to examine how we sustainably finance and resource the NHS; to ensure that we have the right people in the right places to meet growing demands and expectations on health services; and to address not only the challenges but the opportunities of an ageing population.</p><p>Let us look at some of the evidence to support that call. Caroline Gardner, the Auditor General for Scotland, told the Public Audit Committee about the hidden waiting times scandal. Let us remember that this was the scandal that Nicola Sturgeon said did not exist. Ms Gardner said that</p><p>&#8220;the focus of attention of the Scottish Government and NHS boards during 2011 was on whether the 18-week treatment target time was being achieved rather than on how it was being achieved.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Public Audit Committee, 27 February 2013; c 1218.]</p><p>That information should have rung alarm bells with those in charge of the health service at the time.</p><p>Caroline Gardner also said that the NHS budget was on an amber warning. We now see her organisation highlighting how only three health boards met the 12-week legal treatment time guarantee, with nine of the 14 boards failing to meet the accident and emergencies target.</p><p>Caroline Gardner, in her most recent report, said that in 2012-13 pressures had increased and the health service was focused on short-term measures:</p><p>&#8220;The health service needs to increase its focus on longer-term financial planning so that it is prepared for the challenges it faces.&#8221;</p><p>Dr Brian Keighley of the British Medical Association said in October 2013:</p><p>&#8220;NHS managers have the unenviable task of managing shrinking budgets whilst trying to achieve a range of annual targets, outcomes and performance standards that are set by government ... This can leave boards focusing on planning services for the short term; making savings from easy targets such as the workforce ... This is not sustainable and the BMA welcomes Audit Scotland&#8217;s recommendation to introduce structures that encourage longer term planning for NHS boards.&#8221;</p><p>Theresa Fyffe of the Royal College of Nursing Scotland said that the Audit Scotland report</p><p>&#8220;paints a picture of an NHS that is doing its best whilst&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>listen to this&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;creaking at the seams.&#8221;</p><p>She continued:</p><p>&#8220;next year&#8217;s health budget doesn&#8217;t look set to change much in practice. It is not sustainable to manage the health service in this way, as shown all too clearly by missed waiting times targets, growing vacancy rates for nurses and other healthcare staff and an increasing reliance on bank and agency staff as well as private healthcare.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The NHS, which was introduced by that radical post-war Labour Government of Attlee and Bevan, is the greatest social policy that has ever been implemented by any Government.

Therefore, we have a duty to listen.</p><p>We see those pressures in the increase in sick days. Only in the past few days has the amount of sick days come to light, with Tayside showing that 24.5 per cent of all sick days are stress related. The figure is 16 per cent in Fife and 14 per cent in Lanarkshire.</p><p>Before Christmas, we were reminded of the tragic death of Dr Lauren Connelly, who died in an accident having worked excessive hours in the week prior to her death. We cannot treat young people who are the future of the NHS like that. That is why I have called on the Health and Safety Executive to examine junior doctors&#8217; hours, and I hope that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will support that call.</p><p>Junior doctors are often asked to work 100 hours a week. That is unhealthy for them and their patients. I know that we will talk about averaging out the working time directive and all the rest of that, but a doctor who is working for 90 or 100 hours a week cannot function or deal with their patients properly.</p><p>What about the cabinet secretary&#8217;s claim that the NHS is moving to 24/7 working? Although some health boards have yet to respond, we know from a recent freedom of information request that, in Forth Valley, 553 allied health professionals&#8212;who include physiotherapists and occupational therapists&#8212;work during the week, whereas only 40 work at the weekend. In Fife, 2,043 nurses work during the week, but only 648 work at the weekend. In Lothian, more than 1,100 medical staff work on weekdays, but only 25 work at the weekend. Does the cabinet secretary believe that those staffing numbers support his theory that the NHS is a 24/7 service?</p><p>In addition, we had the report on NHS Lanarkshire, which covers the cabinet secretary&#8217;s constituency. As some of my Lanarkshire colleagues will undoubtedly cover, it is a service that is said to be in a &#8220;state of perpetual crisis&#8221;. Speaking of that report, Dr Neil Dewhurst of the Royal College of Physicians, said:</p><p>&#8220;The findings of this review make depressing, but not surprising reading ... Clinicians across Scotland will recognise the challenges facing colleagues in Lanarkshire. Doctors and nurses work under severe pressure with rising numbers of patients treated by a workforce with high locum levels and local recruitment difficulties.&#8221;</p><p>In social care, in Edinburgh 15 per cent of the places in private care homes are unavailable because of concerns about the level of care that is being provided. The knock-on effect of that is that there is no place for more than 100 patients who are waiting in hospital to be discharged.</p><p>In the home care sector, which is based on the minimum wage, contracts have been driven down to the lowest levels and training, wages and care visits have been cut to the bone. In some areas, according to Age Scotland, the length of visits has been reduced to as little as seven minutes. That does not amount to &#8220;world-leading&#8221; social care, as the white paper claims. The system is not providing care and dignity to people in old age; it is failing our elderly and vulnerable people. It is also failing the staff who want to provide good care.</p><p>Like many people, I have family and friends who work in the NHS and I know what pressures staff are under. I also know about the extent to which many of our staff go way beyond the call of duty to help patients. It is those same staff who are the most vocal and the most concerned about what is going on. They are desperate to provide the care that they have been trained to provide. The cabinet secretary has a choice: he can ignore those informed voices or he can act now and instruct a wide-ranging review of the health and social care system. To date, as those voices have grown louder, the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response appears to have been to stick his fingers deeper into his ears. That is simply not good enough.</p><p>Our NHS needs to be staffed properly and managed effectively, and people and stakeholders need to have confidence in it. For the sake of our best-loved public service, I appeal to the cabinet secretary to initiate that review today.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament believes that the NHS is the country's most valued and loved public service; notes the growing pressures on health services and staff across Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to conduct a full and comprehensive review of the NHS in Scotland to ensure that it can become a 24/7 service fit for the 21st century.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr McDonald makes my argument for me.

I think she implied that, because Parliament came to a consensus, that was Parliament at its best. I argue that this Parliament is sometimes at its best when there is no consensus and we are debating big ideas and topics. Of course, that has nothing to do with the debate; rather, it is a comment to help the Presiding Officer on timings.</p><p>This is a vital report on young people in care and their future. The committee is correct to observe that</p><p>&#8220;Few issues are of greater importance&#8221;</p><p>than improving the outcomes for some of our most disadvantaged children.</p><p>I start by thanking the committee of which I was a member for almost all the inquiry. The report asks some very searching and legitimate questions of the Scottish Government and society as a whole. I will be candid. When we consider the outcomes for looked-after children, only one conclusion can be reached: we have failed and are failing looked-after children very badly, despite the heroic efforts of front-line staff in some cases and the resilience of the young people themselves.</p><p>Various measures evidence that failure. Liz Smith gave the stark educational attainment figures for looked-after children. The Scottish Prison Service&#8217;s bulletin from the 13th prisoner survey on &#8220;Prisoners who have been in care as &#8216;looked-after children&#8217;&#8221;, which was published in 2011, shows that 28 per cent of all respondents&#8212;prisoners in Scottish jails&#8212;had been in care at some point and 20 per cent had been in care at the age of 16; 38 per cent of young offenders had been in care as a child and 26 per cent at the age of 16; and 37 per cent of female prisoners had been in care as a child and 28 per cent at the age of 16. However, only 2 per cent of children are in care at any given time.</p><p>The same survey found that 82 per cent of prisoners who were previously in care were using drugs in the 12 months before going into prison, compared with 60 per cent of those who had not been in care, and that 33 per cent reported being prescribed methadone compared with 19 per cent of those who had not been in care.</p><p>Prisoners who had been in care also had greater problems with reading, writing and numbers. A range of other differentials exist between such prisoners and the population.</p><p>Those figures and many other sets of statistics represent our collective failure of young people in care. The committee acknowledges those failures but also underlines the need for sufficient resources to be provided to ensure that those who are in care and who are most disadvantaged get the best and most effective support and help available. If we genuinely believe that how we are judged as a society depends on the support that we provide to our weakest and most vulnerable people, it will be the actions following the report that will, to use a clich&#233;, test that to the full.</p><p>One of the main issues examined was about the decision to remove children from their home and into care, as many members have mentioned. The decision to remove a child should always be based on what is best for that child. Will the child be better protected, cared for and nurtured and given more opportunity to develop well if they remain with or are removed from their family? Some young people who we met very powerfully argued that they should have been removed much earlier from their family; others suggested that leaving the young person with their family was the better option. It became absolutely clear through the inquiry that each case has to be considered individually and that the young person and their rights have to be at the centre of any decision making. I think that we can now put to bed the view that removing children is a last resort, as that is simply wrong.</p><p>The committee heard that young people who remain at home, and their families, need much more intensive family support than they appear to get at present, and that requires resources. Unison, which represents many of the front-line staff, told the committee:</p><p>&#8220;Our members are reporting more and more cases involving mental health issues. We are taking some children into care in cases where, if the proper services had been around and if their parents had received the mental health support in the community that was required, they should not have needed to come into care.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 28 May 2013; c 2514.]</p><p>The same is true of young people who are removed from the family home. They have often experienced trauma in their relatively short lives and they need help to move on. In their lives, they have often been badly let down by adults for a range of reasons that may include addiction, abuse, crime, illness, homelessness or a parent being in prison. Too often, these young people are moved from placement to placement, separated from siblings or moved back and forth from home to placements, more often than not without the adequate support and tailored care that they need, and without counselling and psychological or emotional support that is tailored to their needs. The care that they do receive often finishes way too early in their lives.</p><p>Those who have come through the care system positively, who are the exception, often point to a key individual who they trusted and who cared for them, respected them and treated them with dignity. That is fundamental to a successful young life for any child, but especially for those who need to be cared for outside their natural family.</p><p>I think that the committee took a bit of convincing to take evidence from young people themselves. I am glad that it did that. Their evidence and their experiences were&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Do we still have plenty time in hand in the debate, Presiding Officer?

As a West Lothian councillor from 2003 to 2009, I was there at the beginning of the developing community development trust initiative in my county. In 2005 and 2006, I saw the potential in the vast array of community groups that operated in my home village of Fauldhouse&#8212;a working-class, ex-mining community that is not without its challenges but which has great people who have a lot of initiative.</p><p>In that community, we had groups doing youth work, pensioners groups, religious organisations, sports groups and so on. They were all doing fantastic work in the community to support people and develop new projects, but they often competed for the same relatively small pots of money. Some inevitably felt frustrated and disappointed when the effort to raise funds through grant applications was unsuccessful.</p><p>What did we do? In the first instance, I got together with a then West Lothian Council officer called Paul White, who now works for the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. I name him because he was influential in what developed. He and I looked at what was out there and saw the community development trust model as providing a potential opportunity to galvanise the community and take things forward.</p><p>A year of often tortuous development work took place, funded by a European Union grant. That allowed the concept to develop in the minds of the groups concerned, which began to see the potential benefits of the new organisation. We were grateful for the encouragement that we received, particularly from Gorebridge Community Development Trust. Archie Pacey, who is in the public gallery, was a great help and an inspiration when we really needed someone to give us a bit of a boost&#8212;he certainly did that.</p><p>Eventually, we formed a community development trust&#8212;a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. We appointed a skilled board with a wide range of people at the helm. I pay particular tribute to the chairman, Robert Russell, and the other board members, who have given up their time and put in effort over the years to make the trust a success. I served as company secretary and as a director for the first five years of the trust&#8217;s existence&#8212;I resigned this year only because of work pressures. I suppose that I should declare that as an interest.</p><p>Since the trust was established, it has gone from strength to strength. It has grown projects and income as it goes along. The point is to generate enough income for the trust to be sustainable. We employ staff. We employed about 16 future jobs fund trainees on an environmental project before the Tories scrapped that scheme, and the trust employs community jobs Scotland trainees.</p><p>With lottery funding and grant funding from the Levenseat Trust, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and others, the trust bought and transformed an ex-council office. It now has a community cinema, a soft play area, a dementia cafe, a food bank drop-off point, a walking group, and it hosts the credit union, a fruit and veg co-op, a time bank project and an anti-sectarian project. It has meeting rooms and a conference room, it has held music festivals and organised remembrance Sunday events, and it hosts an annual fair. It helps to recruit volunteers for its projects and those of all the other community groups that operate in the area. It does that because it has dedicated staff who work at the grass-roots level to seek out the funding that can make things happen. The staff do not make everything happen themselves, because that is not the point. They help others to facilitate projects and help with grant applications that allow other organisations to grow and develop. That is part of the business plan and what they are supposed to do.</p><p>The trust is a social enterprise that works at the coalface and delivers benefits in the community. I am proud of the work that it does and proud that I was involved from the start.</p><p>Community development trusts do not and should never replace local government&#8212;that is not what they are there to do. In my area, we could not have set up the trust without local government support and I am very grateful to West Lothian Council for all its assistance over the years.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22781963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Development Trusts and Community Initiatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christine Grahame for lodging the motion.

However, the issue of social care in Scotland is one of the scandals of our time, which has been swept under the carpet and kept as far away as possible from prying eyes.</p><p>We sit in Parliament today pretending that all is reasonably well and that, with the bill, everything will be okay. Well, it will not, and I think that we all know that. Since the summer, I have met dozens of pressure groups, health professionals, trade unions and local authorities who have all, when asked directly, said that the social care system is in crisis. Yesterday, The Herald invited 30 stakeholders to a round-table session to discuss that and other issues. Not one person at that event mentioned the bill or believed that it would make the changes that are needed, and all of them said that the system is in crisis. Let me explain why I agree with their analysis.</p><p>At present, councils are bearing the brunt of Government cuts, which is having a direct impact on the front-line services that they provide. That is nowhere more evident than in social care. Contracts that were awarded a few years ago at, say, &#163;14 an hour are now being won at &#163;12 an hour as contractors try to secure work in the face of council cuts that have been passed on from the Scottish Government. That may sound like a good thing, but the consequence is that, the day after they win the contract, their staff are told that they might have to work two more hours a week for the same money&#8212;and they are now in the fifth or sixth year of a pay freeze. That results in a high turnover of staff as people leave to get a better-paid job, maybe in a supermarket, while those who are left behind are demoralised and de-skilled, as training is often cut back to save money.</p><p>Many staff members are on the minimum wage. Some have to pay for their own uniforms and use their own mobile phones, and do not get paid for travelling between clients. Those people often work for less than the minimum wage. The result of all that is that, as one care worker told me, people now work in care only because they cannot find another job and many stay only until they find another job. We simply cannot continue like that.</p><p>How we treat staff has a direct impact on the quality of the care that is provided to our elderly, our disabled and our most vulnerable people. I ask the cabinet secretary to reflect on this. In the circumstances that I have described, what quality of service does he expect to be delivered? Does he really believe that, in the words of today&#8217;s white paper, Scotland has &#8220;world-leading ... social care&#8221;? If he does, he is the only person in Scotland who believes that.</p><p>At the moment, many providers operate in 15-minute time slots. When those were introduced, if a person needed an hour of care, four 15-minute time slots were provided for them. Now, it seems that one 15-minute slot has become the norm, irrespective of the care that is required. In The Times today, Age Scotland highlights the fact that care visits are now down to seven minutes. Is that a world-class social care service? I think not. What level or quality of care can be provided under such a system? I repeat: we cannot continue like that.</p><p>A few weeks ago at my surgery, I spoke to a young woman of 18 who had just left school. She wanted to work in the care sector, so she got a job with a private provider. After being given four days&#8217; training in an office, she shadowed a fellow worker for one and a half days and was then sent out with her own client list. On day 1, she was given 30&#8212;I stress 30&#8212;visits to do. On her first visit, she was verbally abused by a client who suffered from a mental health disorder. She was quite scared. The second client whom she visited was a male in his 70s who had a catheter in and she did not have a clue what to do; and so things went on throughout her day.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22763087", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We will support the bill at decision time, as we agree with its broad principles.

Thankfully, what is happening in Scotland&#8217;s NHS is different from what is going on in England, but the cabinet secretary should not use Tory ideology and an attack on the NHS there as a diversionary tactic to cover up what is happening here and now on his watch.</p><p>Patients should always be at the centre of health policy, funding decisions and clinical priorities. I am sure that all members of the Parliament agree that all decisions should be considered on the basis of how they will impact on the patient, but there are many areas of current policy in which that approach is very much an afterthought or is missing completely.</p><p>For months now, policy makers, professional bodies and trade unions have been raising the issue of how prepared the NHS is for winter. Such preparation is key to delivering person-centred care, particularly at the most testing time of the year. Last year, accident and emergency units were full to bursting and patients were stuck on trolleys for hours on end because bed and staff numbers had been cut. Since 2007, the system has lost 1,000 beds and there are 1,200 fewer nursing and midwifery posts than there were in 2009.</p><p>How would the patients affected by those cuts view our warm words about person-centred healthcare? Doctors and nurses complain about having to look after increasing numbers of patients without the support that they need. How would the patient who has not seen a doctor all day because of the pressures that the doctors are under view the warm words about person-centred healthcare?</p><p>Further, what about the repeated boarding out of patients during their stay in hospital because of pressures? Staff tell me about patients being moved time and again from ward to ward to free up space. Who could forget the appalling story last winter, exposed by the Daily Record, of John McGarrity, a frail 84-year-old who was left for eight hours on a hospital trolley without even a pillow after being rushed to hospital with chest pains? John was not the only patient to be left on a trolley, but his son described the scene to me as</p><p>&#8220;like a scene from a third world country, not something you would expect to see in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>How would John and his family view their experience of person-centred healthcare?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Person-centred Healthcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by declaring an interest, in that my wife and daughter work in the NHS.

How does that sleight of hand fit with person-centred healthcare? The cabinet secretary mentioned GP practices, but there are some practices in which patients cannot get an appointment, staffing is stretched and GPs want to spend more time with patients with complex needs but are unable to do so.</p><p>It is those areas and the general state of the nation in Scotland&#8217;s NHS that should be debated. I suspect that the people of Scotland, the patients and their families, and the staff working heroically under enormous and growing pressure would prefer us to consider the nuts and bolts and day-to-day realities of the world as they face it rather than the woolly but worthy motion presented today.</p><p>In such a debate we could hear from the Government on basic questions. Do we have enough staff? Are they in the right places? How many patients should doctors be expected to look after? Is the level of financing right? How do we develop a long-term approach? What level of care do we as a nation want to see? Those fundamental questions have been highlighted very ably by The Herald in its NHS campaign, which reflects the concerns raised by people in our communities and in our mailbags day in, day out. One consultant I spoke to recently summed it up when she said:</p><p>&#8220;If I can appeal to you to raise one thing with the government it is the need to end crisis management in the NHS&#8212;at present we just lurch from one crisis to another, we cannot go on like this.&#8221;</p><p>How does person-centred healthcare sit with that view from a person in a front-line post in the NHS?</p><p>We as a society owe the vast majority of staff working in the NHS and other care services a huge debt of thanks for their tireless and unstinting efforts to ensure that our NHS continues to function and look after us. However, the reality is that they are being asked to do that while the Government makes decisions that make their lives much more difficult. Not only are they being asked to do more with less, but the very people expected to deliver the person-centred care to which we all aspire have seen their incomes cut as wages stagnate. What kind of message did it send out to them when the cabinet secretary awarded a miserly 1 per cent pay increase to the lowest-paid staff while giving a 4 per cent rise to senior managers? Is that redistribution Alex Neil style?</p><p>How will the healthcare system support people this winter? Will the cabinet secretary give us a sign of his confidence in winter planning by guaranteeing that the waiting times will be met? Will he guarantee that? I am happy to give way to the cabinet secretary if he wants to intervene. I see that he is not taking that opportunity, which is maybe telling.</p><p>The Government itself states in its 2020 vision that there are economic challenges ahead, but those challenges are undoubtedly having an impact on healthcare across the board. Scotland&#8217;s Auditor General expressed concerns about that, putting the NHS on a financial amber warning last year. The Auditor General raised similar concerns about long-term financial planning this year.</p><p>Audit Scotland noted that pressures increased in 2012-13 and that the focus is all too often on short-term measures. A senior nurse, speaking to the media, remembered the worst years of the Thatcher Government, when hospitals were desperately underfunded, and said:</p><p>&#8220;We are definitely getting back to that now.&#8221;</p><p>What about the critical role of social care in person-centred healthcare? As a society, not just as a Parliament, we have to address the morality of a system that has been driven down to the lowest common denominator by cuts to local government. At the moment, we have a system in which care providers compete for contracts that are ever more squeezed and care staff are often paid at the lowest level. Contracts are cut to the bone, followed by wages that are at or sometimes below the minimum wage, 15-minute care slots even if people need more than that, and elderly people being put to bed at 6 o&#8217;clock because that is when their care slot is. Where is the person-centred approach in that?</p><p>What is happening in social care in the community is being repeated in the care home sector. What is going on in social care is grossly unfair to the councils and the good providers who are doing their best with reducing budgets, immoral for the staff who are involved, and inhumane for the elderly and vulnerable people who need the person-centred care that we all aspire to.</p><p>We support the principle of person-centred care&#8212;healthcare has to be built around the individual. However, I fear that this winter will be one of the most difficult yet for the NHS in Scotland, and unfortunately it will be staff and, most important, the patients who will suffer.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Person-centred Healthcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That might be the case from a survey, but I tend rather to speak to people on a daily basis who come to my surgery, email me and talk to me.

The report is a very good one that makes an informed contribution to what is a vital debate that is being watched by many people in the chamber, across Scotland and beyond.</p><p>For many of those who have tried to navigate the current system of accessing new treatments, it is at best confusing and at worst downright frustrating and unfair. The former health secretary defended the IPTR system by saying:</p><p>&#8220;We already have a very fair, rigorous and quick system for appraising NHS drugs in Scotland. The Scottish Medicines Consortium considers whether newly-licensed drugs should be used nationwide and recommends them for use where they are proved to be safe, clinically effective and cost-effective.</p><p>Even where a medicine isn&#8217;t recommended by the SMC for general use, patients in Scotland can still get it on the NHS if their clinician believes it is appropriate and obtains permission from their local health board.&#8221;</p><p>For many patients, that description simply did not reflect the reality on the ground. In case after case, patients with serious conditions such as cancer and multiple sclerosis were denied access to new-generation drugs. As the committee&#8217;s report states, they were often denied access</p><p>&#8220;despite them submitting clinical and expert evidence as part of the request.&#8221;</p><p>High-profile cases emerged as my colleagues Jackie Baillie, Graeme Pearson and Johann Lamont, along with other MSPs, represented their constituents in Parliament. The patients who were involved in those cases did not seek the limelight or public exposure&#8212;all that they wanted was the chance of an extended life for themselves and their loved ones.</p><p>In support of those brave individuals, we had the campaigning work of the people who took petitions through the Parliament&#8217;s public petitions system. They are the people whom we must commend for getting us to where we are today. It is their petitions and campaigning that have influenced the committee&#8217;s inquiry and forced the Government&#8217;s hand. They have done the Parliament and the people of Scotland a great service.</p><p>Although the Health and Sport Committee welcomed the previous Swainson and Routledge reviews, it said that they would</p><p>&#8220;do very little to improve access to new medicines in any meaningful way and that more fundamental changes were needed.&#8221;</p><p>Those changes must, of course, be fair and transparent but, ultimately, they must provide greater access to medicines that have not gone through the system.</p><p>There is no simple solution&#8212;none of us is suggesting that there is. It is a complex and highly sensitive area in which answers do not come easily. The committee captured those difficulties well when it said:</p><p>&#8220;decisions need to be made about the value of treatments in relation to their effectiveness, cost and wider societal benefits, but within the context of a public sector under increasing budgetary pressures. When these issues combine with personal circumstances and experiences of individual patients and their loved ones and the impact that decisions can have on their length and quality of life, it is probably not surprising that the answers to the questions posed by this issue are not easily found.&#8221;</p><p>A good example of the failings of the existing system was provided in the evidence of Dr Stephen Harrow from the Beatson west of Scotland cancer centre. He recounted how he had made an individual patient treatment request that was refused not once but three times, despite its being supported by clinical evidence. That was a situation that clinicians, patients and stakeholders found difficult to understand.</p><p>There are always ways of doing things better, and the system has to support patients in getting access to the medicines that they need when that request for access is supported by clinical judgment and expertise.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s report has identified many areas where things could and should be done better, including improving transparency, patient involvement, data collection, sharing expertise and standardising paperwork. However, although such steps are welcome, the report also makes it clear that</p><p>&#8220;urgent consideration should be given to encouraging greater flexibility in the IPTR process to approve drugs where there is clear, clinical evidence that a particular patient would derive material benefit from such a drug even if existing IPTR criteria had not been met fully.&#8221;</p><p>I am pleased that the Scottish Government has accepted the need to improve access and that, in its words,</p><p>&#8220;the procedure for accessing drugs in exceptional prescribing circumstances, when all other treatments have been exhausted, should be clearly linked to clinical opinion.&#8221;</p><p>Although the replacement of the IPTR system with a new, peer-approved clinical system is a move in the right direction, the proof of the pudding will be in how that impacts on patients and whether more people are able to access the life-saving or life-extending drugs that they so desperately need.</p><p>I ask that, in summing up, the cabinet secretary responds to the following questions. First, how will the new system be implemented and rolled out? How will it be monitored to ensure that guidelines are not ignored? How does the fund fit with the statement of intent on innovation? How will he avoid the new locally run PAC system becoming another postcode lottery? I know that the cabinet secretary has said that he wants a national system, but I point out that it will be run locally. Finally, when will he publish the timescale for implementing the new system?</p><p>Sadly, these changes have come too late for many, but I hope that a new supportive system will help save and extend the lives of many other very needy people.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to New Medicines"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would very much like to thank the Health and Sport Committee for its report, and I commend its convener, Duncan McNeil, for his excellent speech.

It fills me with rage when I hear people speaking about the low-paid and the unemployed when they have no idea what their life is like. We do not need people to patronise the low-paid and the poor.

There are many great things going on at the elite end of the game in Scotland, and we have a crop of very high-quality players who are among the top 500 in the world. They include people such as Martin Laird, Paul Lawrie and Stephen Gallacher&#8212;and, of course, Catriona Matthews, who was a member of the team that was recently victorious in the Solheim cup, and Carly Booth, who is coming through very rapidly. Over the past few decades, Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance have been standard bearers for Scotland, flying the flag worldwide for the home of golf.</p><p>The hosting of the Ryder cup next year is, of course, eagerly anticipated. The match is, alongside the open and the masters, the top event in the golfing calendar. Over the years, as members have mentioned, there has been thrill after thrill. Any golfer&#8212;or any golfing or sports enthusiast who was watching&#8212;will never forget Bernhard Langer&#8217;s anguish at Kiawah Island, Torrance&#8217;s putt at the Belfry, or McDowell&#8217;s victory at Celtic Manor. The most recent Ryder cup at Medinah was just something else. I watched the match on an iPad in the middle of a ceilidh at the Labour Party conference&#8212;the things that one will do to avoid dancing with Margaret Curran, but there we go.</p><p>Over the years, Scots such as Bernard Gallacher and John Jacobs have played prominent roles not only as players but as captains too. Graeme Dey referred to the greatest Scottish story, in which the legendary Brian Barnes beat Jack Nicklaus at the peak of his powers twice in one day. I recall seeing Brian Barnes play at Dalmahoy when I was in primary 7. He was perhaps not the most shining example to young golfers, as I remember him marking his ball on the green with a beer can, which went down in golfing legend; I hope that people would not do that these days.</p><p>All that at the elite end of the game is fantastic, but at club level things are quite different, and many clubs are struggling in the current economic climate. Ten years ago many local clubs had waiting lists of five or 10 years, or even longer. Membership was a reasonable price, and demand was very high. In my area of West Lothian, clubs catered largely for the communities in which they were located, and local people made up a significant part of the membership. Now, due to falling incomes and wages being frozen, waiting lists have largely been wiped out as people give up membership or take their name off the waiting list because they simply do not have the money to join.</p><p>According to the Scottish Golf Union, adult male membership rates have fallen by 15 per cent since 2004, and there are 25 per cent fewer women playing. That has resulted in clubs&#8217; income falling considerably while costs are increasing, and many are facing significant financial problems. In such circumstances, the temptation for clubs is to cut fees and day ticket prices to compete for a diminishing group of potential members and visitors. Such a race to the bottom on price could be a grave mistake, with clubs competing themselves out of existence.</p><p>Instead, we need to support clubs in planning ahead to maximise their income and cut their costs while maintaining the quality of their unique selling point: golf played in the country where the game was invented on natural courses and in beautiful surroundings. To that end, I want the Government, sportscotland, councils and the business community to work very closely with the Scottish Golf Union and clubs to expand the clubs&#8217; business planning skills and knowledge, and I want the SGU management development programme to be rolled out to as many clubs as possible to support their long-term planning and sustainability and a not insignificant number of direct and supply-chain jobs. Given some organisation and time, there will be obvious opportunities to develop revenue and make savings&#8212;renewables development is an obvious example&#8212;and if clubs could work together and establish joint initiatives to save money on energy supply, insurance, the purchasing of maintenance materials, food and equipment they could achieve significant economies of scale.</p><p>The Ryder cup will be a huge global event in 2014 that will excite and thrill people; it will certainly excite and be relished by Scotland&#8217;s large army of fans. However, I hope that one of the greatest events in the game will not be followed by the disappearance of some long-established community clubs, because that would be a legacy that we could really live without.</p><p>Finally, a number of colleagues have mentioned David McLetchie.

The Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth regularly reminds us that he wants Scotland to be the most competitive place in Europe. However, in this context, the word competitive is a euphemism for low pay, poor conditions and the ripping out of cash from our public services. It will result in hundreds of thousands of pounds being ripped out of schools, roads and hospitals and gifted to corporations in a tax cut.

The book promotes a positive agenda for political change in Scotland&#8212;one that argues for a major political and democratic reform to free up and re-empower local government so that it can work in the interests of citizens and not just obey the diktat of central Government. It argues for an economy that is more democratic, with forms of social, co-operative and public ownership so that we can balance societal, environmental and economic considerations for the wellbeing of the entire society, with the renewables industry being a prime example of where that can be achieved. It argues for an industrial policy where Government support and intervention create and sustain jobs and investment.

We do our best to avoid those things until we have to do them. We do not tell the people who are closest to us simple things such as how much we love them until it is too late. Often, we do not address key divisions in our families and things that have burned away, sometimes for generations, until time is at its shortest. It can be a healing time and a healing process, but it can also cause many further divisions that leave the people who are left behind with lifelong regrets.</p><p>As the report suggests, patients are often offered palliative care very late, and the experience of going through the planning for death often puts pressure on families, who have to help the sufferer, and the people in hospitals who deal with people in their final days.

If we can take the debate to a more mature level, it will help not just patients and their extended families and friends but everyone who is affected by people being in that position.</p><p>When my father was in the Marie Curie hospice in Edinburgh, the help and support for my family was fantastic, but it came very late in the day. That was not the hospice&#8217;s fault but probably ours, because we did what other people do and avoided the issue until death was almost imminent. People need to talk about death and dying and share their feelings, fears and medical needs.</p><p>People also have a lack of understanding of what palliative care is. I certainly did until it came to my doorstep. My wife works in the NHS as a clinical support worker and she often provides palliative care to cancer sufferers. She tells me heart-warming stories of people&#8217;s humility and humanity, the reconciliation of families and people finding peace with themselves through that period, and all of that is greatly assisted by the carers who help people through that time. I will give a simple example. My wife used to be a hairdresser, and if someone who is receiving palliative care wants their hair cut, she will do it. A simple act such as that makes them feel so much better. Such issues might be minor to us, but they are major to the person who receives support.</p><p>We all want to die with dignity, and I hope that the report takes us down the road towards a mature debate about such matters.</p><p>On a lighter note&#8212;there ain&#8217;t many light notes on this issue&#8212;I was cycling by the canal in West Lothian last year when I met a guy who was walking his dog. I asked him where he was going that evening, and he said that he was going to a dying party. I said, &#8220;What do you mean, a dying party?&#8221; His friend had only a few weeks to live and had paid for a party in the pub for all his pals, so that they could have a great send-off for him. That was someone who was at peace with himself and was&#8212;I hope&#8212;moving on to a better place. There is a lesson in that for many of us.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Palliative Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As many members have mentioned, Scots are not very good at dealing with these types of things.

I fully expect a radical like Mr Hepburn to sign up to that bill.</p><p>Last week, I met people from across the UK who work in the national health service, and I heard of the disastrous privatisation of the NHS in England. I am glad that there is a largely public, if not wholly political, consensus in Scotland whereby we reject the marketisation of our most cherished and respected public service. However, it would be a complete dereliction of our duty as members of the Scottish Parliament were we not to highlight the multitude of very real issues that are rapidly piling up in our NHS, which are being brought to members at surgeries week in and week out by staff and patients alike.</p><p>It has been a long hot summer for the NHS in Scotland and I suspect that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing has been getting a little hotter under his starched collar over the past few months. We have had reports from the General Medical Council concerning staff shortages; indeed, it was so concerned about NHS Lothian in particular that it described the staff shortages as &#8220;dangerous&#8221;.</p><p>We have had reports from the College of Emergency Medicine, which reported that 21 out of 24 accident and emergency departments are regularly unsafe&#8212;a fact that it informed the Scottish Government of in April last year, but which the Government apparently did not admit until the following January, a whole nine months later.</p><p>We have heard of bed shortages, inappropriate boarding out of patients and consultants warning that hospitals are regularly at crisis point, at full capacity and</p><p>&#8220;sailing ... close to the wind.&#8221;</p><p>All the while, fewer staff are expected to deliver more for less as wages stagnate, pension contributions increase and pressures rise and rise.</p><p>I would like there to have been more in the programme&#8212;or, at least, in the First Minister&#8217;s statement&#8212;to address how fit for purpose our NHS is and what the Government will do to tackle some of the social ills that shame our country today. The failure of anyone on the Government benches to mention those matters is, quite frankly, astonishing.</p><p>Early in the summer, I called for the Health and Sport Committee to hold an inquiry into the state of the NHS in Scotland in 2013. I repeat that call today and hope that the cabinet secretary will join in with that. As one consultant said to me recently, we cannot go into the winter in the current climate of crisis management.</p><p>Scottish Labour wants integration of health and social care to succeed, and for it to improve care of our older people in particular. Labour-led councils are doing some fantastic work in that field, and we will closely scrutinise the passage of the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill. Where proposals are good, we will support them, but we will also seek to amend the bill to make it better and fit for purpose.</p><p>The same applies to the proposed mental health and adults with incapacity bill. I hope that the Government will support Richard Baker and Graeme Pearson&#8217;s proposed member&#8217;s bill on alcohol, Drew Smith&#8217;s proposed member&#8217;s bill on organ donations and Labour&#8217;s proposals for a new health inspection regime. Those are all positive health and wellbeing proposals.</p><p>I hope that all sides will support my colleague Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s proposed bill on the living wage. Here is a clear example of how the Government can use the powers that it has to put cash directly into the pockets of the low paid. Alternatively, it can choose not to do that. Time will tell.</p><p>As we have already mentioned in talking about the hated and obscene bedroom tax, there is no proposed bill to amend housing legislation to protect tenants from eviction. The powers exist, but the Government chooses not to do it, so Labour will introduce a member&#8217;s bill on that.</p><p>I regret that Christine Grahame has left the chamber, because her speech of despair was not about the socialism that I recognise.

I have observed its passage at close hand, as it has gone through each stage of the legislative process, and I have to say that it has not been a pretty sight.</p><p>I will be frank. As a relatively new member of this place, the bill is the first significant piece of proposed legislation that I have observed at all stages of its passage through Parliament. I expected policy making and the legislative process to be much, much better. I was led to believe that the committee system was one of the Parliament&#8217;s great strengths. Turning ideas and policies into legislation and creating the laws of this land is the role of the committees and this chamber. As such, it is right that legislation must be properly scrutinised rather than rushed, and the rationale for introducing it must be made clear from the outset. On both those counts, the bill has failed miserably.</p><p>The reality is that this has been a shambolic botch job from the beginning. During the committee&#8217;s evidence session with the bill team, it became clear that the team that was dealing with the detail of the bill was just as unsure of the bill&#8217;s purpose and that detail as we were. I am not criticising those public servants, who were doing their jobs to the best of their ability, but am simply sympathising with their plight.</p><p>Then we had discussions with the stakeholders&#8212;the universities, the colleges, the trade unions, the students, the National Union of Students Scotland, the local authorities and the charities&#8212;almost all of whom had very serious concerns about the bill and its content. Such was the extent of our genuine concerns, which were shared with the other two Opposition parties on the committee, that we called for the bill to be withdrawn. At the time, I called the bill &#8220;a dog&#8217;s breakfast&#8221;; on reflection, I want to withdraw that charge because I now realise that that was an unfair slight on the pet food industry. In any case, the bill should have been withdrawn and brought back in a more coherent and comprehensible state. That would have been the right and responsible thing to do. Our motivation was the production of good legislation and the avoidance of bad, but&#8212;true to fashion&#8212;the cabinet secretary blustered on regardless.</p><p>There has been some improvement during the bill&#8217;s progress through the parliamentary system, although I have to say that that would not have been difficult. Had the cabinet secretary filled 42 pages with randomly selected words from the dictionary, we could have amended them into a more coherent piece of legislation with fewer amendments than we have witnessed to date. Let us be honest&#8212;it could not have been any worse. David Belsey of the Educational Institute of Scotland exemplified the confusion very eloquently when he said about the new colleges structure:</p><p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the Government&#8217;s wish to create a nationally incoherent FE structure with a myriad of different types of colleges, governing bodies and funding mechanisms with separate regulations for each, then this Bill is the way to go about it.&#8221;</p><p>That comment was about a structure that the cabinet secretary described as &#8220;simple&#8221;. It was so simple that the sections of the bill relating to colleges required more than 110 amendments to get the bill into the state that it is in today.</p><p>Of course, most of those amendments came from the cabinet secretary himself. With every dozen amendments that he lodged, the case for withdrawal became stronger and stronger. This is a bill that had the cabinet secretary almost pleading with the committee to come forward with amendments to bail him out&#8212;and come forward we did. We lodged amendments on college regionalisation, on equal opportunities, on trade union representation, on collective bargaining, on widening access further than the government proposes, and on many other areas. What happened? All 76 amendments that were lodged by the cabinet secretary and most of the Scottish National Party amendments were agreed to, but how many of the 48 stage 2 amendments that were lodged by Labour were accepted? Surprise, surprise! Not one was accepted, and neither were the vast majority of amendments from the other Opposition parties. So much for the great unifier&#8212;so much for cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to working together to improve the bill. All the amendments that we lodged reflected the concerns of third-party groups and stakeholders, but all were voted down and rejected and the same thing has just happened during today&#8217;s stage 3.</p><p>This is a bad bill.

In the past few months, the bedroom tax has gone from being a bad idea to becoming a real-life here-and-now crisis for thousands of our fellow citizens. Although that living nightmare is hugely significant, it is a mere drop in the ocean compared with what is coming, especially when universal credit, including the housing element, is paid directly to the tenant rather than to the landlord.</p><p>That will undoubtedly mean that tenants and their families who are under pressure to feed and clothe their kids might in desperation make the choice to buy food or shoes, as opposed to paying the rent. Tenants with addiction problems may, in desperation or under duress, use the money to feed their addiction rather than pay their rent. It could mean that a violent or controlling member of the family who receives the payment on behalf of the family might spend it elsewhere rather than on the housing. It will without doubt lead to major problems for a large number of tenants and their families. Having worked as a front-line housing officer, I know that that will be the case unless we act, and act now.</p><p>What can be done? A number of credit unions across the UK have been working on new products to help with budgeting for that particular client group. The main way they are doing that is through so-called jam-jar accounts&#8212;or budgeting accounts. Tenants would have an active account into which the benefit is paid and the tenant mandates the payment to the landlord, who has first call on the monthly cash payment, with any residual cash being left in the account or put on a card for the tenant to use. Some accounts would also provide a small overdraft to help with working cash. If such accounts were rolled out across the country, it could save families from crisis, prevent evictions and&#8212;I believe&#8212;quite literally save lives.</p><p>Two weeks ago I, along with representatives from the West Lothian Credit Union, met civil servants to discuss funding to help to roll out a scheme that the credit union has developed. To my astonishment and dismay, we were told that it was a good idea but that unfortunately, there was just no funding stream available to help with the project. I do not intend to shoot the messenger&#8212;those civil servants were just doing their job&#8212;but I must ask the Government what is going on. We have a simple solution that could help hundreds of thousands of our most vulnerable people across Scotland but, when it is presented with the solution, the Scottish Government appears to be ambivalent, at best. That is not good enough. We need action now because the crisis is here, now.</p><p>Today I spoke to the Association of British Credit Unions Ltd&#8212;ABCUL&#8212;which is an excellent organisation, at its Manchester head office. It tells me that it is likely to be developing new budgeting projects in partnership with credit unions over the next two years of the expansion project. But welfare reform is not two years away. Welfare reform is here, now, and by that time, people will have lost their tenancies, their families and, I fear, some will have lost their lives.</p><p>I hope that the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism will speak to the Minister for Housing and Welfare and urgently look into these matters. This is an area where Parliament can help people now, with the powers that we have. We have to act now&#8212;not in two years, or further in the future.

Student finance and the pressures of increased day-to-day living costs mean that it is now normal and no longer the exception for students to take on part-time&#8212;and sometimes full-time&#8212;jobs to make ends meet.</p><p>On the face of it, the Scottish Government&#8217;s announcement of a student minimum income guarantee, which was trumpeted as the &#8220;best student support package&#8221; in the UK, appears to be very good news. Of course, in this area of policy, as in so many areas of Scottish Government policy, smoke and mirrors and mythology and spin cloud reality. Once again, the Scottish Government appears to be reinventing the English language. Just as we have the non-profit distributing of financing, whose only snag is that it distributes profit, we now have the minimum income guarantee for students who want to enter higher education.</p><p>Now, I do not know whether the cabinet secretary has any debts, but I am afraid that I have. My mortgage on my house and my loan on my car are just that&#8212;they are loans&#8212;so I do not classify them as income. Why would a young person&#8217;s student loan be classified as income? In no other walk of life or area of finance would an increased loan be classified as increased income. Indeed, the dictionary defines the word &#8220;loan&#8221; as</p><p>&#8220;something lent or furnished on the condition of being returned&#8221;</p><p>and the word &#8220;income&#8221; as</p><p>&#8220;the monetary payment received for goods or services&#8221;.</p><p>Perhaps the cabinet secretary can advise us which of those definitions he believes best describes his proposal, but I do not see him rising to do so.</p><p>What of the increased loan guarantee? In essence, the amount of loan available is increasing as non-repayable bursaries are decreasing. For students from households that earn less than &#163;25,000, the grant that is lost will be between &#163;890 and &#163;1,640. As Neil Bibby, Hugh Henry and Murdo Fraser said, poorer students are having their bursaries reduced and loans increased&#8212;under the guise of what we might call the mythical income guarantee&#8212;while students from wealthier backgrounds will see their access to loans increased further.</p><p>Those significant cuts will affect the neediest students. For a student from a family in which two parents earn the national minimum wage of &#163;6.19 per hour, the total family income is just over &#163;21,000. That student&#8217;s annual bursary is only &#163;1,000 per year, which means that &#163;1,945 more of borrowing will produce only &#163;427 of additional spending power, with the rest needed to make up for the lost grant. For a family income of &#163;18,000, &#163;1,760 of increased borrowing will produce only an extra &#163;120 over and above the previous situation. Of course, with student accommodation in halls of residence in this city at about &#163;100 a week, it is easy to see the pressure on students trying to pay for rent, food, books, computers and bus fares&#8212;although, of course, that is not an expense that students will ever share with the cabinet secretary. Far from being a great deal, that to me seems like another Government con. My understanding is that the original plan was for a taper from a maximum grant of &#163;7,000 for those on the lowest income to a maximum loan of &#163;7,000 for people at the other end of the scale.</p><p>Hugh Henry quoted an article by Lucy Hunter, the former head of student support at the Scottish Executive, in The Scotsman today. She highlights that low-income Welsh students can access more than &#163;5,000 in bursaries and will at the same time leave with less borrowing than Scottish students who are in the same position. Although the cabinet secretary likes to point to the great Satan in terms of fees and debts in England, the reality is that the difference in cost for low-income English and Scottish students is very small.</p><p>Last week, Sheila Riddell from the centre for educational sociology wrote a well-informed article on these important issues. In setting out her critique of Government policies, she said that inequality in education is still rife in Scotland. We agree with her. Far too many children and young people from working-class backgrounds and from the villages, towns, cities and regions that we all represent are not realising their potential or being given the opportunity. That is not because they are less able, willing or ambitious than others; it is because they are not gaining access to universities while others are. For example, in Scotland, only 6 per cent of the school population attends independent schools, yet 34 per cent of students at the University of St Andrews come from that sector and the figure is 20 per cent at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen. Clearly, there are many reasons for that, but I cannot for the life of me see how reducing bursaries for poor students helps to redress that inherent inequality in our education system.</p><p>Mr Russell, along with Clare Adamson and George Adam, claimed that Labour opposes everything that the Government does. However, I ask the cabinet secretary how many amendments he accepted from the Labour Party during the deliberations on the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill. Among the 200 or so amendments that were lodged&#8212;about 150 or so by the cabinet secretary&#8212;how many did he accept from the Labour Party? None, yet he asks us to contribute.</p><p>If we are serious about tackling deep-seated educational inequalities, we need to work closely with our communities, schools, colleges and universities to ensure that they do everything possible to encourage and help people from all backgrounds who have the ability and willingness to go to universities and, crucially, to provide them with the support that they need when they are there to complete their course.</p><p>I am afraid that Government spin dresses up debt as income and gives the impression that students are whooping in celebration at the prospect of the mythical minimum student income guarantee. As always, the reality is somewhat different. So, although the rocks perhaps have not yet melted with the sun, it is clear that bursaries are melting day on day.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Student Support"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Meanwhile, let us get back to the terms of the motion for today&#8217;s important debate, which is on support for low-income students.

Many of the same executives took decisions that resulted in a &#163;390 million fine for fixing the London interbank offered rate&#8212;LIBOR&#8212;and for miss-selling. It was not the branch staff in Edinburgh, Livingston, Bathgate or Glasgow who caused that&#8212;it was the people at the top. If what they received was not a reward for failure, I do not know what it is. Of course, it will be the workers in the branches who will suffer the consequences, as will the communities affected&#8212;they will lose their jobs and their branches respectively.</p><p>In May, Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of the bank, announced to the RBS annual general meeting&#8212;like a starving man over a dripping roast&#8212;that the worst was over and that the bank was ready for privatisation. Members must forgive me for not jumping up and down with delight. Where is the logic in nationalising the debt when the bank is in trouble and privatising the profit when it goes back into the black? That is economic madness.</p><p>Of course, it is not just RBS that is up to those tricks. Lloyds Banking Group is getting rid of 1,300 staff across the United Kingdom, many of them in Scotland. It is estimated that 40,000 jobs will go over the next five years in the group&#8217;s learning, pensions, insurance and IT departments. In addition, IT jobs are being offshored on the back of a claim that there is an IT skills shortage. As with RBS, Lloyds branch after Lloyds branch will close: in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Aberfeldy, Barrhead, Alloa, Bathgate, Carluke and Cowdenbeath&#8212;the list goes on and on.</p><p>The banking crisis led me to believe that the banks would mend their ways, but on this evidence no one can believe that to be the case.

If we are going to inspire young people from across society to be the scientists, astronauts, physicists and chemists of tomorrow, perhaps the Scottish Government could look at the pricing structure for entry to those centres.</p><p>I asked the minister about the centre across the road, Our Dynamic Earth, which costs &#163;7.50 for a child to enter. At the Glasgow Science Centre it costs &#163;7.95, at the Dundee science centre it costs &#163;5.50, and at the Aberdeen science centre it costs &#163;4.50. When salaries are being frozen and benefits are being cut, many families will find it difficult to afford those prices, which will result in many children missing out on the potential spark that could ignite a lifelong interest in science and science-based research.</p><p>Hugh Henry mentioned the curriculum for excellence.

Science centres should not be the preserve of those who can afford what are often quite high admission fees. If we are going to inspire young people from across society to be the scientists, astronauts, physicists and chemists of tomorrow, perhaps the Scottish Government could look at the pricing structure for entry to those centres.</p><p>I asked the minister about the centre across the road, Our Dynamic Earth, which costs &#163;7.50 for a child to enter. At the Glasgow Science Centre it costs &#163;7.95, at the Dundee Science Centre it costs &#163;5.50, and at the Aberdeen Science Centre it costs &#163;4.50. When salaries are being frozen and benefits are being cut, many families will find it difficult to afford those prices, which will result in many children missing out on the potential spark that could ignite a lifelong interest in science and science-based research.</p><p>Hugh Henry mentioned the curriculum for excellence.

There are real issues with recruiting and retaining women in science disciplines. That has historically been a problem, and it remains a problem.

Following raids in England by the information commissioner on the Consulting Association&#8212;which, in effect, is the successor organisation to the infamous and sinister Economic League&#8212;we now have evidence beyond any doubt that the biggest construction companies in Scotland and throughout the UK were involved in financing, supporting and using systematically a centrally held secret list that companies used to check whether prospective employees were deemed suitable to employ, and to provide to the Consulting Association their own details of employees whom they deemed unsuitable for further employment in the construction industry.</p><p>I pay tribute to the blacklist support group and to Ian Davidson MP and the Scottish Affairs Select Committee at Westminster for exposing this scandal. The committee&#8217;s report shows how, as a result of those practices, workers were denied employment without explanation, financial hardship was caused and lives were disrupted and sometimes ruined. There was no right of appeal or challenge to the information that was held on the list or the decisions that were made. Those affected, although they might have had their suspicions, had no evidence that they were being discriminated against in such a systematic and methodical way.</p><p>Liberty, the human rights group, has called that a major human rights abuse and it is absolutely correct. The Scottish Affairs Committee report highlights how people were blacklisted for the heinous crime of looking out for their fellow workers; for raising issues of health and safety; and for exposing dangerous site practices that could and did injure, kill and maim their workmates. They were blacklisted for raising concerns about site welfare, refusing to accept no toilet or washing facilities, speaking up about wage rates and raising trade union issues.</p><p>Shop stewards and health and safety reps were at the top of the list when it came to the Consulting Association, as were environmental campaigners and political activists, and even people related to them. Members should listen to some extracts from the recovered entries from the blacklist records&#8212;these are direct quotes.</p><p>Mr A was</p><p>&#8220;Involved in a dispute to try and enforce the main contractor to take responsibility for the non-payment of several weeks wages&#8221;.</p><p>Someone was therefore blacklisted for the crime of wanting to be paid for the work that they had done. The entry for Mr B says:</p><p>&#8220;While at xx, drew H&amp;amp;S issues to the attention of site manager&#8221;.</p><p>He was blacklisted for keeping a workplace safe. Of Mr C it was said that it was thought possible that he was the twin of another employee&#8212;he was blacklisted for being someone&#8217;s brother.</p><p>There are many, many other examples of reasons that were given for being listed: &#8220;shop steward&#8221;, &#8220;communist&#8221;, &#8220;militant&#8221;, &#8220;sells the Socialist Worker&#8221;, &#8220;attended union meeting&#8221;, &#8220;attended meeting at a labour club&#8221; and &#8220;environmental activist.&#8221; That shows the extent of the victimisation of those workers. It is McCarthyism writ large.</p><p>Across the UK, more than 3,000 workers were on the list, including about 400 in Scotland. Some of our biggest names were involved&#8212;companies that have repeatedly received huge amounts of public money from contracts awarded in Scotland&#8212;such as Amec, Amey OW Ltd, Amey Infrastructure Services Ltd, Amey Roads (North Lanarkshire) Ltd, Bailey Maintenance, Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd, Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering Ltd, BAM Nuttall Ltd, Carillion Construction, Laing O&#8217;Rourke, Morrison Construction, Skanska Construction UK Ltd, Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd&#8212;the blacklister in chief&#8212;Norwest Holst Ltd and, scandalously, the Forth crossing bridge constructors joint venture. All those companies have won contracts here in Scotland and have used the Consulting Association&#8217;s blacklist. We are looking for a name for the new Forth crossing. If we do not watch out, it will be known as the blacklisters crossing.</p><p>The Parliament should make it clear that we expect those companies to own up to the extent of their activities, release all information that they hold on individuals, apologise and pay compensation to those affected. The individuals involved should be held to account for their actions.</p><p>Through the procurement bill soon to go through Parliament, we should commit to putting in place guidance to ensure that this situation never happens again. If companies do not comply, those named on the Consulting Association&#8217;s list should be barred from every public sector tendering list. We need to take a very hard line.</p><p>I know that the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities has committed to working with trade unions and others in the Parliament to examine how we deal with the issues. I look forward to engaging in those discussions, but I make it clear that, if no solution is reached, I intend to move amendments to the procurement bill when it is introduced.</p><p>According to Unite, the GMB and UCATT, the scandal has not ended. Shop stewards and union activists are still being sacked from the crossrail project in London. We cannot allow that to happen, especially in relation to one of the biggest construction projects in Scotland&#8212;namely, the Forth crossing. I ask the minister to explain in her summing up how we are ensuring that the companies operating on that contract are not blacklisting as we speak.</p><p>I pay tribute to the real heroes of this story, who are not politicians or trade union leaders but ordinary electricians, joiners, bricklayers, steel erectors and scaffolders. In the course of upholding health and safety standards and the principles and values of good trade unionism in looking out for their fellow workers, they were victimised and had their livelihoods taken from them. Their families suffered greatly as a result. They are people such as Dave Smith, Steve Acheson, Francie Graham and Steuart Merchant, to mention only a few names among thousands who refused to be beaten. I hope that, because of their actions and the actions of their trade unions, the construction industry of the future will be better than the industry of the past.</p><p>Finally, we need a Scottish-focused inquiry into these activities. It is only in that way that we will expose the true extent of this appalling scandal and how it has affected so many of our fellow Scots. I ask the minister to support in her summing up my call for a Scottish inquiry into blacklisting.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690122", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Blacklisting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest in that I am a member of Unite the Union and was previously a member of the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians.

I know that the illness is close to the hearts of a number of members in the chamber. It is a horrible, frustrating illness that affects young and old alike. In my family, my auntie suffered from it in the latter years of her life, and my brother John was diagnosed with it in his very early 30s. The illness has resulted in his progressive deterioration to the stage where he has been using a wheelchair for the past six years. He has to use a car with hand controls and he needs assistance in many areas of his life, given all that the disease entails. However, he maintains as much independence as he can, which I think is very much a characteristic of the people who suffer from the disease.</p><p>My concerns&#8212;I have no doubt that they are shared across the chamber&#8212;are about inconsistency of treatment and advice. Different health boards operate different policies, with access to consultants almost impossible in some areas but much more easy in others.</p><p>Access to specialist nurse services in some areas is very inconsistent, too. Some people have their nurse&#8217;s mobile phone number and can speak to them almost immediately. Others have never seen a specialist nurse. It has been suggested that each patient should have two comprehensive medical reviews a year, which would be a revolution for some sufferers.</p><p>When new specialist drugs become available people have to go through an exhausting, endless process of application and appeal, pleading their case time and time again.

If someone cannot walk a step or swing their body around, just getting out of bed in the morning and getting dressed must be massively stressful and exhausting. I do not think that many members can imagine how it would feel to go through that every day, before our day had even begun.</p><p>MS patients are hugely resilient and cope tremendously well with an illness that currently has no cure, but they need our help. They need hope, and they need our support. In some areas, such support is significantly lacking.

The speeches delivered by Helen Eadie, Patrick Harvie, Graeme Dey and Graeme Pearson in particular were excellent and insightful.</p><p>Since the exposure of the phone-hacking scandal, a broad debate has developed across the UK and the world on press conduct and ethics and on how we should regulate our press. That is of fundamental importance not only for the newspaper industry but for the functioning of our wider democracy, which many members have mentioned.</p><p>At its best, the press holds decision makers to account and exposes wrongdoing and hypocrisy. It provides scrutiny, it stimulates public discourse and it can be a great educator. When I taught in schools, we often used different newspapers to stimulate discussion, particularly in the social sciences.</p><p>However, as we found out through the Leveson inquiry, the press does not always adhere to high ethical standards. Leveson laid bare elements of the press&#8212;I stress the word &#8220;elements&#8221;&#8212;that appeared to be out of control, unaccountable and all-powerful. They appeared to have a grip over politicians and often seemed above the law of the land.</p><p>We know the names of the celebrities who have been subject to press intrusion&#8212;to libel, phone hacking and all the rest of it. Household names such as J K Rowling and Sienna Miller came before the inquiry. The relatives of famous people have also suffered. Charlotte Church&#8217;s mother&#8217;s experience was particularly disturbing.</p><p>Such people have undoubtedly been wronged, but the public&#8217;s sympathy lies more with people such as the Bowles family, who suffered extreme press intrusion after their son died in a bus crash while he was on holiday, the family of Milly Dowler, whose experience is simply beyond comprehension, or Christopher Jefferies, the landlord in Bristol who was hung, drawn and quartered by the press, despite the little fact of his complete innocence&#8212;we all remember the photographs of him.</p><p>Several members, including Paul Martin, Patricia Ferguson and Stewart Maxwell, talked about the case of the Watson family. The Watsons&#8217; daughter was murdered and their son committed suicide because of the subsequent press intrusion. Mrs Watson gave evidence to the committee a few weeks ago. Her evidence was moving and very disturbing. After all this time, she still feels that she has not had an appropriate apology from the publications involved. The editor of one of the newspapers apologised at the committee meeting, but I hope that, in light of Mrs Watson&#8217;s powerful comments, that publication will look again at the issue and consider how to make the fulsome apology that the family is looking for.</p><p>Helen Eadie brought us back to reality by telling us about a current case in her constituency. However, it is not just individuals who have been wronged. Communities have been tarnished by and written off in newspaper caricatures that bore no resemblance to the reality of life on the ground. I can think of a few communities in my region whose people have been insulted and stereotyped and which are seeking to rebuild their reputations after enduring inaccurate reporting.</p><p>We should also consider how industrial disputes are reported and how the people involved are presented by some sections of the media. Graeme Dey talked about that in his excellent speech, and the NUJ has raised the issue with me. And who could forget the appalling reporting of the Hillsborough disaster, when an entire city&#8217;s reputation was traduced by a particular newspaper?</p><p>Our duty is to look at what has been proposed in Scotland and throughout the UK. As we heard, the royal charter will underpin an independent regulator, which will be predicated on the guiding principle of freedom of the press and will have the power to impose fines and demand prominent corrections. As Patricia Ferguson said, it is crucial that the regulator will not have the power to veto publication. People who appeal to the regulator will have access to a cheap and efficient arbitration service.</p><p>I listened to what the cabinet secretary said when I asked her why she thought that the McCluskey report had gone beyond its remit, but I am still rather in the dark. I will take an intervention from her if she wants to intervene.

We need to protect journalistic and editorial freedom and to ensure that there is no political interference in the press, but surely the independence of the press and its ability to report, scrutinise and act as the fourth estate will be enhanced, not threatened, by the proposals. The charter should help to uphold and raise press standards and prevent the individuals responsible from reverting to the murky depths that Leveson exposed.</p><p>We heard limited evidence in committee&#8212;Liz Smith and Neil Bibby covered that.

The consensus is that that is not a suitable option, given what we now know. Self-regulation clearly failed in the past.

Internationally, a staggering 2 million of our fellow global citizens die at, or as the result of, their work. Each year, families are left without fathers or mothers, and tragically&#8212;this is particularly relevant where child labour exists&#8212;mothers and fathers are left without sons or daughters.</p><p>Around the world each year, more than 2 million men and women die as a result of work-related accidents and diseases. Workers suffer approximately 270&#160;million accidents each year, and fall victim to 160&#160;million incidents of work-related illnesses. Hazardous substances kill 440,000 workers annually, and asbestos still claims 100,000 lives. As has been mentioned, one worker dies every 15 seconds worldwide, which is 6,000 workers every day. More people die at work than at war. Those are truly shocking and appalling statistics.</p><p>The Trades Union Congress estimates that in the UK more than 20,000 people die prematurely every year as a result of injuries or accidents that are caused by their work. More than 2 million people suffer some form of occupational ill health&#8212;and all that at a time when, according to the trade union Prospect, there are only three occupational health physicians and 18 occupational health inspectors left in the HSE&#8212;down from 60 of each in the early 1990s. All in all, the HSE has lost hundreds of staff and, as Bill Kidd mentioned, proactive investigations have been cut dramatically.</p><p>The HSE cuts are built on nothing more than myth and dogma. Health and safety is seen by right-wing politicians, think tanks and free-market disciples as a burden on business that must be slain; David Cameron has vowed to do something about the &#8220;health and safety monster&#8221;. The Conservatives are doing something about it&#8212;they are actively and rapidly destroying the Health and Safety Executive and are making our building sites, factories, chemical works and other workplaces less safe and more dangerous. Make no mistake&#8212;people will die as a consequence and others will suffer injury and disease. Of course, that is another price that workers must pay for dogma. I am actually pleased that none of the members from the UK coalition parties is present for the debate, because I do not think that I could stomach it if they were here.</p><p>In the past year, I have followed the investigation by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee at Westminster into construction industry blacklisting and have campaigned on the issue in Parliament. The investigation is a direct result of concerns about Scotland&#8217;s poor health and safety record in comparison with that of the rest of the UK. It transpired during the committee&#8217;s inquiry that trade unions believe that the figures were worse because health and safety representatives had systematically been denied employment and been drummed out of the Scottish construction industry. That is a scandal, but I will not dwell too much on it today: I will cover it in my members&#8217; business debate next week.</p><p>No family should experience the loss of a loved one simply from their going to work.

It should always be that those with more pay more, and the land and buildings transaction tax sets a good example for the Scottish Government to follow in determining not only that tax but all others. Labour supports the principle of progressive taxation throughout the tax system. Again, that is a good thing.</p><p>As far as the bill is concerned, I support the proposal to curtail tax avoidance by ending the loopholes that have been extensively exploited by clever accountants and others. The proposed changes to the reliefs regime are therefore very welcome. Under the proposals, avoiding the tax will be much more difficult, and I commend the Scottish Government for introducing that element. That is the right way to go on this bill and, I hope, other bills, too.</p><p>We need to ensure that the revenues to pay for public services are collected efficiently. On that note, I hope that there will be further provisions in the forthcoming procurement bill to prevent companies that engage in systematic tax avoidance from winning contracts and securing Government grants.</p><p>I was heartened by John Mason&#8217;s comments that tax is a good thing and that it should be progressive. I certainly hope that he will use the outstanding influence that I know that he has in his party to convince the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth that his party&#8217;s corporation tax policy is exactly the opposite of that.</p><p>It is vital that the revenue from tax meets the shortfall that will arise as a result of the adjustment to the block grant, as Malcolm Chisholm eloquently explained. I understand that Mr Swinney&#8217;s approach is to promote a position whereby any reduction in the grant would be calculated on the basis of a five-year average. I do not know whether the Treasury will agree to that, but I am sure that that is something for his negotiating team. However, it is vital that, at the very worst, a neutral settlement is the result, because we cannot afford to lose any money from a public services pot that is already under intense pressure.</p><p>The bill is a lesson to us. As members have mentioned, it comes as the first of three bills, the two others being on landfill tax and tax management. The bills come as a direct consequence of the Scotland Act 2012, which is an act that shows how devolution has developed and grown in the interests of our people. It shows how, since 1999, devolution has been not a static settlement but one that is adaptable and able to develop over time to deliver Scottish solutions that best meet our needs. It also shows how progressive policies can develop within the framework of devolution, and that imagination and political will are much more important and effective than standing on the sidelines repeatedly stamping your feet and saying that only independence can deliver change. The bill shoots that fox. It highlights how we do not need independence and all the unknowns and vagaries that come with it and shows how we can develop our own solutions while retaining our link to our brothers and sisters in the rest of the United Kingdom. Perhaps that will encourage the Scottish Government to put more of its energies into using the powers that we have and the ones that we will soon have before squealing about the ones that we do not.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate for a variety of reasons.

The Education and Culture Committee has done that to good effect, as is apparent to anyone who reads the committee&#8217;s report or who listened carefully to the convener&#8217;s speech.</p><p>I say at the outset&#8212;so that there is no room for misrepresentation, pretence or false indignation&#8212;that I and probably all the committee&#8217;s members support the broad aims of the bill. I certainly support the aim of improving the governance, transparency and accountability of universities, for which students and trade unionists have called. I support the reform of tuition fees for rest of UK students, for which student leaders have called. I support improvements to and the democratisation of college governance. I recognise the need to improve collaboration between colleges and universities, and I support improved data sharing to support people into employment.</p><p>I bow to no one in my support for widening access to higher education. A college education changed my life by providing me with the opportunity to enter higher education, and for many students like me it is the route to university. However, the evidence that we have heard has raised some serious concerns that strongly suggest that the bill as it stands is deeply flawed.</p><p>For example, the committee&#8217;s ability to fully comprehend the provisions on higher education governance was severely hampered. The Scottish funding council was supposed to commission a working group to develop a new and improved code of governance for universities, but instead the chairs of court took it upon themselves to undertake that work and appointed a steering group. The code has been neither published nor scrutinised by the Education and Culture Committee, and that is wholly unsatisfactory.</p><p>Indeed, the group&#8217;s development of the code was heavily criticised in evidence from the University and College Union Scotland, the Educational Institute of Scotland and NUS Scotland, which complained bitterly about the lack of student and staff representation on the group. Despite the unrepresentative composition of university boards, the university chairs told the committee that</p><p>&#8220;there is no particular problem with governance in Scotland to be solved.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 19 February 2013; c 2011.]</p><p>Given that their assertion was contradicted by students and unions, I have some concerns about the steering group&#8217;s findings&#8212;whatever they may be. I am also concerned that the findings will be accepted entirely by the Government, with the result that the code</p><p>&#8220;would effectively become the &#8216;principles of governance&#8217;&#8221;.</p><p>Professor von Prondzynski himself said that governance was overwhelmingly excellent. Those views were rightly challenged by the UCU and NUS Scotland, and if Professor von Prondzynski thinks that governance is currently excellent, that raises the question of why a new code is needed.</p><p>There is also an apparent difference of opinion between the cabinet secretary and the chair of the funding council on whether the new code would be voluntary or compulsory, which is a pretty fundamental issue. We do not know whether the new code will deal with issues such as gender equality or staff and student representation on university boards of governance.</p><p>Section 3 of the bill relates to widening access, which is a subject that is close to my heart, but many questions that were asked about that subject remain unanswered. How is the objective to be achieved? What actions are to be taken by institutions to improve access? What is the target? Which groups are to be targeted? Who will be counted in the widening access total? What rate of improvement will be deemed a success? Which initiatives have been successful, and which have failed? How are admissions staff to be protected if they apply contextualised admissions? Will there be displacement? How will access be widened with no extra funding? What is to happen if universities do not play ball?</p><p>Government officials said in evidence that financial sanctions were unlikely in the event of a failure to widen access, but only today the cabinet secretary said in his letter to the committee that financial penalties may indeed be imposed.</p><p>What about retention, which is so vital to widening access? How can we talk about widening access when the very students who&#8212;like me when I went through the system&#8212;are most likely to access higher education through college are at present being denied a college place as part-time places and adult learning provisions are slashed? What relevance does widening access have for them?</p><p>I think that we all want access to continue to be widened and for the pace to increase significantly, not least because&#8212;as we heard in evidence&#8212;some institutions are failing miserably.</p><p>However, although the bill may reinforce widening access efforts, the questions that I have raised need to be answered first, particularly those that relate to funding and displacement. In the interim, through the conditions attached to the university grant process, the Scottish funding council could tackle the issue now, which is indeed what it should be doing.</p><p>College regionalisation is another element in the bill about which there are many concerns. The committee&#8217;s report states clearly that, in the policy memorandum,</p><p>&#8220;there is very little information provided about why changes require to be made.&#8221;</p><p>There are major concerns about the complexity and bureaucracy of the proposed college landscape, which will include regional strategic bodies, regional boards with assigned colleges, regional colleges and a completely different set-up for the University of the Highlands and Islands. David Belsey, of the EIS, summed up the situation very well:</p><p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the Government&#8217;s wish to create a nationally incoherent FE structure with a myriad of different types of colleges, governing bodies and funding mechanisms with separate regulations for each, then this Bill is the way to go about it.&#8221;</p><p>Some witnesses expressed the view that the changes to the structures and bureaucracy of colleges are simply a cover for cuts&#8212;we know that another &#163;25 million is to be taken from college budgets. The submission from Angus Council community planning partnership stated:</p><p>&#8220;However, in practice, recent changes to college funding for school-college partnerships have already restricted the range and volume of provision available to young people. It would be unwelcome if college regionalisation compounded this by diverting time, energy and money from core functions.&#8221;</p><p>Unison argued that</p><p>&#8220;the whole thrust of regionalisation is not really about taking a regional approach. Rather, it is about delivering budget cuts&#8221;.</p><p>The Unison representative went on to say that colleges are being forced into merger because</p><p>&#8220;they are afraid that if they do not, they will be cut out after the regional boards start to distribute the funding.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 5 February 2013; c 1953, 1957.]</p><p>There are many more issues on which clarity is needed. How will relationships between the regional bodies and assigned colleges work? Will that result in a bidding war? Will some colleges be preferred over others?

I wish that we still had a vibrant coal industry with skilled engineers, geologists, face workers and all the necessary ancillary staff in work supplying coal as part of a balanced energy policy&#8212;but we do not.</p><p>The reason why we do not is the deliberate policy of the Thatcher Government, which took revenge on the National Union of Mineworkers, and had as its ultimate aim the destruction of the trade union movement and organised labour.</p><p>The 1984-85 strike was without doubt one of the biggest social, economic and political events of the second half of the previous century and its impact is still being felt across Scotland and the United Kingdom. Late last year, the Hillsborough inquiry reported and exposed the alleged corruption, lies and falsification of witness statements by South Yorkshire Police. It explored how officers are alleged to have perverted the course of justice to cover up their failings in relation to that tragic event.</p><p>That inquiry was followed by a BBC Yorkshire &#8220;Inside Out&#8221; documentary on events at Orgreave in South Yorkshire, which was one of the main flashpoints during the strike. The documentary exposed how the police are again alleged to have duplicated statements, to have had statements dictated to them by senior officers, to have perverted the course of justice and to have been responsible for a host of other unacceptable practices in relation to arrests and the recording of evidence and witness statements, all amounting to misconduct in public office. Such was the seriousness of the allegations that South Yorkshire Police referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for investigation. We await the result of that investigation with interest.</p><p>The revelations from Hillsborough and Orgreave motivated me to lodge the motion for today&#8217;s debate. Across the mining communities of the United Kingdom, people know about the politicisation of the police during the dispute, about the involvement of the security forces and about the snatch squads that were established to target individuals&#8212;usually influential trade union officials and activists&#8212;and they know that thousands of people were arrested on bogus or exaggerated charges.</p><p>One of those people was a miner who worked at Polkemmet colliery, in Whitburn, who was on a picket line and a few rows back in the crowd. He was pushed over by the police, he fell and was dragged off the road, arrested, charged and sacked. Another miner was peacefully picketing at Hunterston power station when he was dragged from the crowd and charged with police assault. He is adamant that he did nothing wrong and has never committed a crime in his life. Another man&#8212;a strike leader at Bilston Glen&#8212;was targeted and picked out from a peaceful picket by a police snatch quad, again having committed no crime before or since.</p><p>These are the words of a man who worked at Castlehill:</p><p>&#8220;I was in a village with 4 others when the bus went past carrying&#8221;</p><p>strikebreakers&#8212;he did not quite use that term. He went on:</p><p>&#8220;A group of kids 50 yards down the road stoned the bus. The police returned and arrested all 5 of us&#8212;we had nothing to do with what happened. The next day a sixth man was also charged despite the fact that he was actually 3 miles away and in his bed at the time of the incident.&#8221;</p><p>Time allows me to provide only those few examples of the 1,400 cases, but there are many more like that. Of course, it was not just a criminal record that those people received: more than 200 were sacked and lost their redundancy entitlement, and found it difficult to get work afterwards&#8212;no doubt because they had been blacklisted.</p><p>Of course, they were the fortunate ones. Some men had nervous breakdowns and became ill both mentally and physically or died as a direct consequence of those life-shattering experiences, because of the crime of trying to defend their communities, their jobs and their right to work.</p><p>Given what we now know about police activity in Yorkshire, I think that we have a moral duty to look at that evidence and to reflect on what happened here in Scotland. We have to ask: was it only South Yorkshire Police officers who, it appears, lied and fabricated evidence? Was it only South Yorkshire Police officers who, it appears, perverted the course of justice? Was it only South Yorkshire Police officers who duplicated statements that led to convictions? I find that difficult to accept. We need to establish the truth about whether the arrests and convictions were legitimate or miscarriages of justice.</p><p>Since the launch of this campaign in December 2012, more than 900 people have emailed the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and the chief constable of Lothian and Borders Police demanding an inquiry. I know that the cabinet secretary was involved in the dispute and that he supported miners in Fife and elsewhere, and I congratulate him on that. He will therefore be aware of the allegations that have been made over the years since 1984. He will also have constituents in his own Edinburgh East constituency who were directly affected, having worked at Bilston Glen or Monktonhall. I therefore hope that he will reflect on the emerging evidence and use his personal knowledge. Although individuals may have to take their individual cases to the appropriate body, he could do as has been done in other cases in which police misconduct has been suspected&#8212;for example, the Shirley McKie or Chhokar cases&#8212;and set up an independent review. He has the power to do so. There is a deep feeling that the convictions are unsafe and that there must be such an inquiry.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has a choice. The fact that he is not here today is absolutely dreadful, and will be noted in the mining communities across the country. He can use the powers of his office to establish an inquiry, or he can do nothing. However, we have to be clear that if he does nothing, innocent Scots will live the rest of their lives as victims of an appalling, politically motivated miscarriage of justice. We need an inquiry.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Miners&#8217; Strike (Police Conduct)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wish that this debate did not have to take place.

Water scarcity, political decision making, short-termism, global climatic changes in pollution and, of course, mankind&#8217;s stupidity and irrational behaviour have all impacted on our ability to feed not only ourselves, but our fellow human beings. Over the years, from the very dawn of civilisation until the present day, food security, food production and commodity trading have been major causes of social, economic and political debate and, often, unrest.</p><p>In recent decades, we have experienced BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, bird flu, salmonella in eggs, E coli, listeria and so on. There have been concerns about the use of additives and bulking agents and there have been issues around country-of-origin status, halal status, the substitution of ingredients, school-meals quality, the welfare of animals, the conditions that are experienced by animals due to intensive rearing and, now, the horsemeat scandal. We all enjoyed the various equine gags on Twitter and Facebook and in the newspaper diary columns, but the reality is that the latest food crisis will certainly not be the last.</p><p>In order to change the situation, we need to take on the vested interests that have for years dominated and directed global and domestic food policy. For decades, the EU has operated under the gross excesses of the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which have, historically, provided subsidies that encourage overproduction, which has resulted in food being stored and then dumped on the developing world; intensive farming, which encourages the use of fertilisers and pesticides; and a huge imbalance in EU spending.</p><p>At home, the food production lobby is extremely strong, and attempts to deal with as simple an issue as misleading food labelling have resulted in aggressive campaigning and a huge lobbying operation by the multinationals. An attempt to bring in a simple traffic light system&#8212;which Richard Simpson spoke about&#8212;to alert people to the fat, salt and sugar content of food was opposed by the corporate giants such as Tesco. Richard Simpson said that they appear to have been dragged, kicking and screaming, towards movement on those issues. If that is the case, that is welcome. If we cannot get companies to agree on such a basic step, what chance do we have of dealing with some of the more fundamental challenges in our food-supply chain?</p><p>Food production is an area that exposes some of the worst aspects of our economic system. It involves intensive farming to maximise yield, using factory-style methods and subcontracting of different elements of the production process and system in order to extend the supply chain, while cutting the profits of each sub-contractor at each stage. The minister will be familiar with that from his experience of the closure of Hall&#8217;s of Broxburn.</p><p>Goods travel across countries and, sometimes, continents by road, rail and air for processing. At each stage, the business owners take every opportunity to cut costs by using cheaper meats, bulking agents, mechanical recovery, sweeteners, flavourings, preservatives and God knows what else, without any thought for the implications on sustainability, health or wellbeing, and with profit being the motive driving them every time.</p><p>Domestically, we cannot get away from the fact that the cuts to local government mean that there are fewer environmental health officers and staff involved in enforcement. That is having a direct impact on food safety.</p><p>Public confidence in our food is essential for producers and food businesses. It is clear that light-touch regulation simply does not work. The horsemeat scandal and the work of campaigners such as Martha Payne have highlighted issues around school meals&#8212;in particular, the importance of high-quality school meals at a time when an increasing number of families are relying on food banks. The importance of that cannot be overstated. School meals and hospital food should be valued as major elements of, respectively, a good education system and good healthcare. Our feeding our young people and the infirm with the cheapest foods says something about our values as a society.</p><p>As we have heard, there are also some very good things going on in Scotland, but they tend to be at the higher, or premium, end of the market. We can all be proud of premium products such as Scottish seafood, prime beef, whisky and soft fruit, but that is not where our problems lie. The chances of someone who is trying to exist on &#163;56.25 or &#163;71 a week&#8212;on jobseekers allowance&#8212;experiencing langoustine, venison or premium malt whisky is just a fantasy. To be told by media luvvies to buy free-range eggs or farmers market beef is both ludicrous and patronising.</p><p>We would all like to buy locally sourced good-quality foods, but that is not realistic for far too many of our constituents. For many of them, food is very much on the front line of the battle for survival at this time of austerity and welfare cuts, when the price of food has increased by 30 per cent over the past five years.</p><p>The picture is not good for all our people, and the Scottish Government would do well to recognise that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686116", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Richard Lyle said, the provision of food is, like the provision of fresh water, a fundamental issue for human survival.

They regurgitate the lines about record levels of patient satisfaction and the old chestnut that we hear time and time again: they patronise NHS staff for their hard work and commitment, implying that any criticism of Government policy is, somehow, an attack on nurses, doctors and the hospital staff who work under intense pressure. The reality is that the concerns that we raise more often than not come from those staff, who are being worked into the ground trying to cope with a system that is increasingly under strain.</p><p>As politicians, we should know what is happening in the NHS in our constituencies and regions. We have case loads that reflect the realities of the cuts to budgets, the reductions in staffing levels, the lack of resources and the falling morale. Is it just me who has that on my case load? I do not think so. I am sure that most members do.</p><p>In my region, the waiting time issue has been the bad penny that just keeps on returning. Last year, the manipulation of waiting times and the use of the social unavailability codes was exposed at NHS Lothian and it pains me that my region is seen as the benchmark for bad performance in that area. That scandal was compounded by a culture of bullying and harassment, in which senior management bellowed decrees down the chain of command, not in the interests of patients and their care, but to pauchle the waiting list system and make it look as if imposed targets were being met.</p><p>We know that ministers were alerted to that scandal, but they did nothing about it. No one has yet been held to account for their actions. Indeed, the chief executive&#8212;the head of the organisation&#8212;waltzed off into the sunset with a &#163;375,000 retirement package. If a porter or canteen assistant was guilty of aggressive and long-term bullying, and they lied about a major element of their work when they reported to their superiors, they would be dismissed in an instant. It appears that there is one rule for the workers in the NHS and another for the bosses. Some things never change.</p><p>Last week, it was revealed that waiting times in accident and emergency units were the worst for five years. They were so bad that Margaret Watt, chair of the Scotland Patients Association, was moved to remark:</p><p>&#8220;The figures on waiting times in accident and emergency in Scotland are shocking.&#8221;</p><p>Margaret Watt&#8217;s remarks reflect the real world. Across Scotland, only four NHS boards have met the target to have admitted, transferred or discharged 98 per cent of their patients within four hours of their entering an accident and emergency department. The national average for December was 90.3 per cent; in Lothian, the average was 86.2 per cent, which is a fall from the 92.6 per cent we saw in September.</p><p>What do those figures mean for the people who lie behind them? For patients, the situation is intolerable. Sick children and elderly people have to wait anxiously in accident and emergency for hours on end as the staff are run ragged trying to cope. As Jackie Baillie said, Mr Neil tried to suggest that the long waiting times in accident and emergency that Mr McGarrity faced as he waited on a trolley in a corridor for more than eight hours were not a true reflection of the NHS. If the cabinet secretary would pay me the courtesy of listening, he would hear me say that that was Mr McGarrity&#8217;s experience of the NHS, as well as being the experience of 75 patients in Lothian who were stuck in accident and emergency departments for more than 12 hours in January. That is double the figure that we saw just one year ago.</p><p>Why are waiting times worsening, and why do NHS boards feel the need to distort the figures? Because the NHS is under intense pressure. We have seen cuts to beds, nurses, midwives and support staff, and those who have been left behind are expected to do more for less. They have seen their case loads increase to almost unmanageable levels, and all the while their wages are frozen. The upshot is that staff in the NHS are already under strain, and NHS Lothian now has to do even more to put right the cases that were affected by the waiting time scandal. That is the reality, and no amount of ministerial bluster can deny it. Of course, the minister knows that, because NHS Lothian has had to pour &#163;27 million into sorting out the waiting list scandal, which has resulted in a feast for the private sector.</p><p>Two weeks ago, I attended a packed meeting of West Lothian community councils in Blackburn. The meeting was called to discuss their concerns about the NHS, and the message that came out of that meeting was absolutely clear: people are not prepared to accept what they see going on in the NHS day in and day out. The cabinet secretary should not take my word for it; he should speak to his colleagues Fiona Hyslop and Angela Constance, who will tell him about the angry comments to which they were subjected at that meeting. The people who were there had good reason to be angry. On top of the waiting lists fiasco, we have had the temporary closure of the children&#8217;s wards at St John&#8217;s hospital during the summer, and threats to services such as homoeopathy, community podiatry, and the hospital nursery, all of which are facing temporary or permanent closure.</p><p>I appeal to the Government to stop the spin and bluster, and face up to the reality of what is happening in our communities. These are very serious issues.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Again, we hear Government ministers repeating their well-worn mantras about the SNP&#8217;s alleged great successes in the NHS.

I hoped that we would hear how the Government intends to support the education system as whole and end its current practice of supporting one part of the system while deliberately downgrading another, but I have been disappointed so far.</p><p>The Government motion contains much with which I agree. Education should be about learning and should not be determined by someone&#8217;s ability to pay. It is vital to our society&#8217;s social, economic and environmental wellbeing and a vital element of not only our individual but our collective progress. Without skilled doctors, we collectively become sicker; without teachers, we collectively become less well educated; and without skilled craftsmen, our housing standards become poorer. I trust that the principle of each individual contributing to society&#8217;s collective wellbeing is generally accepted and is not seen as too controversial.</p><p>That said, people should be able to progress their talents through education at whatever level they want and anyone with a talent for engineering, woodwork or music should be allowed to pursue it no matter their socioeconomic circumstances. However, that is not the situation at present. There might be no tuition fees for full-time university students but those who study part time have to pay, as do Open University students, postgraduate students, Scots studying elsewhere in the UK and part-time college students.

We hear ministers saying that they want to live in a land of world-class public services with free this and free that, with the repeated mantra that if only we had the full powers of an independent state all of this would be not only possible but reality. Of course, last week, John Swinney said that there would be no rises in personal taxation in an independent Scotland, which only confirmed that an SNP-led Scottish Government would maintain George Osborne&#8217;s cut to the highest rate of taxation. In an independent Scotland, millionaires will keep their massive tax cut and their sons and daughters will have no problem going to university. However, working-class families at the bottom of the income scale will continue to struggle&#8212;and that struggle will intensify if, on top of that, hundreds of millions of pounds are ripped out of the economy with a 10 per cent corporation tax rate.</p><p>We are faced, then, with a Government promoting a Scotland of flawed and discredited trickle-down economics and the redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich as a central plank not just of economic policy but of social policy. How do those policies square with not introducing tuition fees? The answer is that they do not and the cabinet secretary knows it.</p><p>I admit that I chuckled when the cabinet secretary mentioned Nick Clegg&#8217;s portrait hanging in the hall of some lobbying organisation. It was a good comment. Of course, we cannot lay the same charge at the cabinet secretary himself, given that his own portrait is on display in his room for everyone who visits him to see. That should not be a surprise.</p><p>At present, educational attainment in our schools and access to our universities are largely determined not by ability or potential but by social class, which results in education being effectively the preserve of the better-off. Let there be no room for confusion: this is not because young people in deprived communities are less able&#8212;it is because they are born poor. How are we to tackle that? Figures released yesterday by the campaign to end child poverty highlighted the shameful levels of child poverty in this country but although the main social policy areas that could change the lives of poor families&#8212;health, housing and education&#8212;are all within the Parliament&#8217;s remit, little progress has been made.

Unemployment is disturbingly high and people are desperate to train or retrain and gain an education to help them move on in life. However, as we have heard, the Government&#8217;s deliberate policy on colleges is denying that opportunity to a growing number of our citizens.</p><p>Despite the weight of evidence exposing the policy for the disaster that it is, its chief architect&#8212;the cabinet secretary&#8212;ploughs ahead regardless, with that toxic mix of arrogance, denial and self-delusion that we have all become so familiar with over the past year.</p><p>We all know that there has been growing concern about the extent of waiting lists in Scotland&#8217;s colleges. That concern has come not from Mr Russell&#8217;s favourite bogeymen and women, whether it be Westminster or Labour councils. It has not even come from sound recorder-wielding college principals, or&#8212;to be more accurate&#8212;former college principals. No&#8212;that concern has come from young people, from the NUS, college unions, and business leaders, but also from Scotland&#8217;s Colleges, the very organisation that was trusted to bring together these institutions.</p><p>In a study that Scotland&#8217;s Colleges&#8212;not Labour&#8212;carried out, more than 21,000 people were estimated to be on waiting lists. That is a Scotland&#8217;s Colleges figure&#8212;it is not ours. George Adam and Gordon MacDonald both said that three quarters of those who were identified in the Scotland&#8217;s Colleges report were not truly on a waiting list. Even if we accept that, it will still be the case that a quarter of them are on a waiting list. We seem to have consensus across the chamber that waiting lists are not a false concept and that in fact they exist. Even Mr Russell&#8217;s own audit accepts that waiting lists exist and, when we look at it, there are no quotation marks around waiting lists, as far as I can see.</p><p>As with the budget, student finance, jobs and courses, the cabinet secretary could not face up to the reality of his own policy and instead sought solace in yet more creative accounting. As he did with curriculum for excellence, he ordered an audit. However, as we have heard, this in-depth and extensive audit looked not at all of Scotland&#8217;s colleges but at seven in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Lanarkshire. Do seven central belt colleges, each with another college in close proximity, and some with several, provide a fair representation of how the applications system and waiting lists have developed across Scotland? I think not. As Siobhan McMahon explained, is it any surprise that a Lanarkshire student might apply to Coatbridge and Cumbernauld or that an Edinburgh student might apply to a few different colleges in the city? Of course not.</p><p>However, let me highlight my local situation at West Lothian College, where 94 per cent of applicants come from the county. There are no nearby options. What are the figures there? In 2012-13, 3,800 people applied for full-time courses but only 1,848 gained access. As for part-time students, there were 6,390 enrolments in 2007-08 but this year the figure is down by more than 50 per cent to 3,000. Of course, that situation will be repeated in similar colleges across Scotland, but such colleges were&#8212;surprise, surprise&#8212;omitted from the audit.</p><p>The cabinet secretary&#8217;s audit took a different sample at a different time from that taken by Scotland&#8217;s Colleges in its much larger study; however, there is no explanation as to why those seven colleges were selected. The report is full of assertion rather than fact and, focusing on one college, claims that waiting lists are only 5 per cent of the original Scotland&#8217;s Colleges estimate. The truth is that this survey started with embarrassingly flawed methodology and inevitably ended up with flawed and distorted findings that were grasped and championed by the cabinet secretary because they fitted in with his fantasy view of the world.</p><p>I am sorry but, while Mr Russell comforts himself with these figures, no one else out there in the real world believes a word of them&#8212;not Colleges Scotland, not college principals, not college staff or students and most certainly not the thousands of applicants who have been left without a place. When Mr Henry talked about false concepts and false constructs, I noticed the cabinet secretary nodding his head. I should caution Mr Russell, because the last time we saw such vigorous head gestures from him was when he was supporting his gaffer with the dodgy statistics at First Minister&#8217;s question time.</p><p>As other members have mentioned, on 24 October I asked the cabinet secretary:</p><p>&#8220;With no preamble and no prejudgment, can I ask a simple question? How many people are on college waiting lists? We are asking for a number.&#8221;</p><p>The cabinet secretary replied:</p><p>&#8220;The concept that Neil Findlay raises is a false concept and a false construct. There are no waiting lists of that nature.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 24 October 2012; c 12504.]</p><p>The &#8220;nature&#8221; that I was looking for was a number. Given that even his flawed audit repeatedly acknowledges the existence of waiting lists, a number must also exist. I think that it is right for the cabinet secretary to apologise not only to me but to Mr Bibby, Mr Smith, Anne McTaggart, James Kelly, Liz Smith and others for misleading Parliament once again, because he accused us all of falsehoods in relation to the existence of college waiting lists. I ask him again: do these lists exist? How many people are on them? Will he at some point give us a number?</p><p>A few weeks ago, we were treated to the sight of the cabinet secretary&#8212;let me put this charitably&#8212;being interviewed by college students at Edinburgh College. I am sure that, as an enthusiastic information technology user, he applauded the initiative of the students who put the video on YouTube so that their fellow students could see and hear the cabinet secretary share the great news about his college policies. Those students told it like it is on places, courses, jobs and waiting lists, but the denial continues.

However, the minister tells us that the Government is building more houses than ever, that waiting lists and homelessness are down and that standards are rising. Again, that does not reflect the real world and the political choices that the Government is making&#8212;it cut the housing budget by &#163;86 million in real terms.

The Government has cut funding in our college sector at the very time that we need colleges most. The cuts have led to cuts in jobs, courses and places. Labour&#8217;s political choice is to support our colleges, to provide our young people with the tools that they need to gain employment.

Many members&#8212;most recently Helen Eadie&#8212;have referred to the fact that 75 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s coal is still in the ground. Most of that coal is extracted through surface-extraction methods. I have had major disagreements with the industry about that over the years, particularly when the industry seeks to extract coal on the doorstep of residential properties or when the benefits of extraction do not outweigh what it is doing to the community. However, good companies operate in such a way that people hardly notice that they are there. A major example of that in my area is the redevelopment of the former Polkemmet colliery site over the past five or six years, which has not caused any major problem in the community and which has cleaned up a large brownfield site.</p><p>Coal must of course be part of a balanced energy policy, with gas and hydro. I am sceptical about nuclear, but we have it and cannot simply wish it away, so we must look at it in all our energy policy deliberations. However, I have major concerns about the potential impact of fracking on the environment. Members have referred to the UK Government&#8217;s carbon capture policy, which has been a massive shambles. We need to get the policy back on track. My friends at the National Union of Mineworkers tell me that the price of coal has dropped by 30 per cent because of gas from the US, which is now going down the fracking route, coming on to the market. Members have referred to ATH, so I will not go over that again.</p><p>I have two further, related issues to raise. The Scottish Government is cutting the budget of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust by 67 per cent. The Tory Government in England is cutting its budget in that regard, too, but by only 12.5 per cent. However, &#163;1 million is being taken out of the trust&#8217;s budget in Scotland by the Scottish Government, which must address that issue. I hope that Mr Ingram and his colleagues will address that.</p><p>Finally, my colleague David Hamilton and I have been running a campaign to seek a review of the cases of those who were convicted during the 1984-85 miners&#8217; strike. More than 650 people have contacted me about that and have emailed the Cabinet Secretary for Justice over the past few weeks. There is a real sense of injustice over the issue. I hope that I will be able to come back to it over the next few weeks and months until we get a result.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681469", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Coal Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Fraser needs to stop taking the drugs.

I enjoyed her speech very much and I look forward to working with her over the next few years. This is not good for her, but she sounds like my type of woman.</p><p>This afternoon&#8217;s debate is not just about getting people a job; it is about much more than that. Employment is an important factor in making people, families and communities who and what they are. Unemployment is an ugly scar that blights and debilitates communities. Quite simply, it is a national scandal. We will not discuss anything more important this year.</p><p>We have youth unemployment levels such as we have not witnessed since the 1980s. The youth unemployment rate in my village is 30 per cent&#8212;a level that has not been seen since the Thatcher Government butchered huge employers such as the National Coal Board and British Leyland. We are now in the middle of another closure of a big local employer&#8212;Hall&#8217;s of Broxburn&#8212;which is shedding 1,700 jobs.</p><p>When the First Minister tries to deflect criticism, he usually likes to talk about the number of people who are in employment, rather than the number who are out of work. If we use his methodology, we can see that, although unemployment has dipped recently, so has the number who are in employment. Mary Scanlon referred to that. Fewer people are working, even though the official unemployment rate has declined.</p><p>Another note of caution comes from the stark reality of what is going on in the real world. The labour force survey exposes the gravity of the situation. Since March 2007, the youth unemployment figure has increased from 51,000 to 87,000. That means 36,000 more young people are out of work under this Government. The claimant count shows that the number of 16 to 24-year-olds who are on jobseekers allowance has gone from 22,600 to 35,800. The number who had claimed benefits for more than six months was 3,700 in 2007 and is now 12,275, which is an almost fourfold increase. Even more worrying is that the number who had claimed for more than a year, which was 555 in 2007, was up to 7,050 by November. That is a twelvefold increase, yet Mr Brodie does not want to talk about statistics.</p><p>Perhaps most worrying of all is that 12.2 per cent of all young people are still not in education, employment or training. The last school-leaver destination figures showed that more than 11 per cent of school leavers did not go on to any positive destination. The most recent school-leaver destination figures were supposed to be published in December, but we appear still to be waiting for them. I hope that the minister will respond to that in summing up. I wonder whether the figures will be published later this week, after the debate.</p><p>Of course, for those who are fortunate enough to find work, underemployment is a major problem, about which members have spoken. Young people are much more likely to have the temporary jobs that economists have told the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee are dead ends. The Scottish Trades Union Congress describes those jobs as</p><p>&#8220;low wage and insecure with very little prospect of training or career progression.&#8221;</p><p>Given the grim jobs scene, we should support efforts to tackle overall youth unemployment. However, I say to Government back benchers that a fundamental part of the job of Parliament and parliamentarians is to hold the Government to account and to ask questions about the success, or otherwise, of policy. It is our duty to ask whether interventions are creating long-term and sustainable jobs or whether they represent merely a variety of ways in which to shuffle the figures by creating what one professional in the field recently said some of the schemes promote&#8212;&#8220;holding corrals&#8221; for the unemployed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681238", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome my new colleague Jayne Baxter.

From the big bang, evolution and weather patterns to inventions, space travel and new technology, science is at the core of our understanding of life and our interactions with all aspects of it.</p><p>Science is taught in our schools from the earliest years, and the new school curriculum lends itself to encouraging a cross-curricular approach to the study of science. I know that our teachers will rise to the occasion, as they always do, to deliver new and stimulating lessons not just in the traditional sciences of chemistry, biology and physics but in health and food technology, geography, music, science, art, information technology and all the other disciplines that go to make up the curriculum.</p><p>Of course, it is through school learning that, throughout history, Scots have been inspired to become world leaders in the development of new scientific advances. Celebrated Scottish scientists and inventors have made a tremendous impact on the world and on humanity. Obvious examples include John Logie Baird, whose impact we could all say was truly revolutionary. Even a visionary such as he could hardly have conceived of the power and breadth of his work. Of course, I am absolutely certain that, at some point during his experiments, there was a sceptical Scottish laboratory assistant looking over his shoulder, saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re wasting your time on that thing; it&#8217;ll never catch on.&#8221;</p><p>Others, such as James Young Simpson, changed medical science for ever. James &#8220;Paraffin&#8221; Young was a pioneer in the field of shale oil technology, which was referred to only a few minutes ago in the chamber, and, in recent years, Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell at the Roslin institute created the world&#8217;s most famous sheep, Dolly, who changed the face of science by becoming the first mammal to be successfully cloned. I am absolutely certain that there is a joke to be made at this point about politicians, but I will resist.</p><p>Scotland has produced countless physicists, engineers, botanists, astronomers and mathematicians&#8212;I do not include myself in that list. The Scottish science hall of fame includes the following people in its list of our top 10 greatest scientists: Lord Kelvin, who is famous for the temperature scale and the development of the trans-Atlantic telegraph; James Hutton, a pioneering geologist; Logie Baird, whom I have mentioned; James Watt, who is famous for the steam engine; Robert Watson-Watt, who developed the use of radar; Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone; Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin; Joseph Black, who discovered carbon dioxide; Maxwell&#8212;not Stewart, I hasten to add&#8212;whose achievements are too many to list; and John Napier, who invented logarithms and who I can now blame for my third-year misery in maths. There are, of course, countless others who are unknown to the wider world but who do important scientific work every day, including work within Government, which we recognise and which the cabinet secretary ably listed.</p><p>There are some people who will soon be added to the Scottish science hall of fame. Given his speech in last week&#8217;s careers debate, I am sure that the next member will be that great Scottish inventor, Stewart Stevenson, along with his brother.

That paper says:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland fails to realise the full potential of its research base, and will continue to do so if it systematically fails to cope with the debilitating loss of talent represented by the high attrition rate of highly-trained women from employment. Although our universities now graduate large numbers of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), 73% of women graduates are lost from STEM compared with 48% of male graduates, with a corresponding loss of researchers. In academia, expensively trained women are lost in larger proportions than men at every step of the postgraduate ladder and are under-represented in top positions across the spectrum of business, public service and academia.&#8221;</p><p>As well as being a loss to those individuals, who are missing out, that is also a loss to our economy, society and policy development. It is estimated that a doubling of women&#8217;s high-level skill contribution to the economy would be worth as much as &#163;170 million a year to Scotland&#8217;s national income. That contribution is something that we need to harness, not lose. It is puzzling and frustrating that, at a time of recession, we still hear many of Scotland&#8217;s science and technology companies complaining that they cannot find people with the skills that they need when, at the same time, we are haemorrhaging women from the sector.</p><p>There are of course factors that contribute to the fact that women do not pursue a long career in the sector. The most obvious factor is family commitments, but that is only part of the story. The Royal Society of Edinburgh points to cultural factors that relate to attitudes in the workplace, the organisation of science and technology, the difficulties in accessing career resources and, with such low levels of female participation, a lack of inspirational role models.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of Science in Public Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Dr Murray for that question&#8212;I believe that she was a scientist herself.

As I am sure that the Presiding Officer knows, I am always willing to applaud the Government when it does good things, and I would genuinely have preferred to be able to compliment the minister on implementation of effective reforms in the careers service. It is unfortunate that evidence is mounting that the so-called modernisation of the careers service is, like college regionalisation, driven by a cost-cutting agenda, which is leaving tens of thousands of young people with little or no real careers guidance.</p><p>As SDS confirms in its &#8220;Corporate Strategy 2012/15&#8221;,</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government&#8217;s Career Information Advice and Guidance Strategy ... places a particular emphasis on giving individuals the ability to manage their own career journeys by developing the relevant skills.&#8221;</p><p>However, the ability to manage the career journey is being driven in one direction: away from people and human interaction and towards the web-based service, my world of work.</p><p>There are serious misgivings about the effectiveness and impact of my world of work.

Incidentally, the research that the minister referred to was embargoed by SDS because it did not like its conclusions.</p><p>An SDS spreadsheet identifies that tens of thousands of young people across Scotland are no longer accessing any form of careers guidance. Drew Smith has referred to the figures for his area, but the national figure is that, up until 31 October, only 17 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s school pupils had registered with my world of work. In my local authority area, the registration rate is only 16 per cent. That is not the fault of councils because, irrespective of the political colour of the administration, the registration figures across Scotland are alarming: in Angus, the figure is 11 per cent; in Argyll and Bute, it is 19 per cent; in the Shetland Islands, it is 14 per cent; in Perth and Kinross, it is 17 per cent; in Dumfries and Galloway, it is 16 per cent; and in Highland, which has the highest registration rate, it is 37 per cent.</p><p>Why are those numbers so low? Well, SDS has adopted a new traffic-light system, which categorises our young people as red, amber or green. That determines whether they will receive careers guidance or be left to manage their own career journey. It is estimated that 100,000 young people are in the green category, where pupils receive what the minister referred to as the &#8220;SDS universal offer&#8221;. That sounds very grand, but in practice it means half a school period&#8212;which could be delivered to a class or a group&#8212;on the CMS framework and another half period on my world of work. SDS counts those as two interventions per pupil. A session delivered to a year group of 200 pupils in a hall counts as 400 individual interventions and is recorded accordingly.</p><p>Even with that creative accountancy, if only 17 per cent of pupils are registered, we can see clearly that tens of thousands are receiving little or no careers guidance at all.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Careers Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am just coming to that point.

I have no idea where the minister gets the idea that it has been an increase in staffing.</p><p>Unison was so concerned at the changes and cutbacks that it conducted a survey of its members, as other speakers have said.

Raymond Baker, the director of the organisation Global Financial Integrity, has called corporate tax avoidance</p><p>&#8220;the ugliest chapter in global economic affairs since slavery.&#8221;</p><p>That is a fairly big claim, so it is incumbent on us to examine it and what it means for Scotland, the United Kingdom and the wider world.</p><p>The debate takes place against a background of unprecedented austerity across Europe. Today, general strikes are taking place in many countries. Tax justice simply cannot be separated from what is going on. In Britain, at the same time as our public services are being starved of funds, we have the biggest tax gap in our history, which is estimated to be &#163;120 billion. That figure is made up of avoidance, evasion and unpaid taxation. The issue is not about small businessmen or sole traders; it is about some of the largest household names and companies such as Pfizer, Starbucks, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Vodafone, to name but a few. A conservative estimate is that those companies are dodging &#163;35 billion every year in unpaid tax to the UK Exchequer.</p><p>In recent budgets, the top rate of income tax has been lowered to 45 per cent and corporation tax rates have halved. The use of tax havens by multinational corporations has been officially sanctioned and even encouraged by tax law, while at the same time VAT has been raised to its highest-ever rate. Successive Governments throughout the western world have accepted the agenda or been complicit in supporting it.</p><p>What is the result of all that? About $160 billion has been lost to developing countries through a range of increasingly dodgy practices, including the practice of transfer mispricing, which is when multinational companies export their goods from developing countries at lower than market prices, thereby reducing their book profits and therefore their tax liability. That deprives the poorest nations of desperately needed tax revenues for services. The goods are then sold on to a subsidiary that is based in a tax haven, which then sells on the goods at inflated prices and with the lower tax rate that is applied in the tax haven area.</p><p>To put that $160 billion in context, it is three times the amount that is given globally each year in international aid. On top of that, &#163;13 trillion&#8212;yes, trillion&#8212;has been squirreled away in tax havens beyond the reach of the authorities. That is a scandal of monumental proportions, yet we have allowed it to happen. Another scam involves companies in the industrialised world selling to developing countries at inflated prices to enable the seller to shift large amounts of capital abroad while reducing profit margins and thus tax liabilities. There are many further tricks in the companies&#8217; armoury.</p><p>Current international accountancy standards require countries to report only consolidated accounts on a global basis, which means that no one knows where taxable activities occur and/or where profits are declared. That makes it easy for companies to shift capital and pay tax&#8212;or not&#8212;wherever they choose. We need country-by-country reporting to establish exactly what is going on.</p><p>I am one of those saddoes who watch the proceedings of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. On Monday, it took evidence from Starbucks and Amazon executives, and I urge everyone to watch the footage&#8212;it is a mixture of comedy and tragedy. Starbucks has been operating in the UK for 15 years and has a 35 per cent market share, yet it claims to have made a profit in only one of those years despite a turnover of &#163;3 billion. How much tax has it paid? It has paid only &#163;8 million in 15 years. Amazon&#8212;which, let us not forget, was welcomed to Scotland with open arms by the First Minister and was given a &#163;10.8 million grant&#8212;is even worse, having paid no tax at all in the UK in the past three years. Amazon&#8217;s business model is one of brazen tax avoidance, poor-quality and insecure employment and predatory pricing that squeezes suppliers and affects the whole community. Is that a business model that we should be falling over ourselves to welcome into our country?</p><p>The question is, how do we change things? There are global issues and there are local ones. We need a new global tax consensus that is based on fairness, transparency and accountability. In the meantime, there are things that we can do here in Scotland. We could follow the seven regions of France, including Paris, that have declared themselves tax haven-free zones and will not do business with companies that avoid their liabilities. We could follow Helsinki in refusing to award public contracts to corporate tax avoiders. Currently, the Scottish Government and local government engage with a range of companies that do not pay their way. We could introduce a set of legally binding procurement rules that subject companies that deliver and bid for public contracts to high ethical and environmental standards and anti-tax avoidance measures. That approach was supported by Scottish National Party members Mike Weir and Angus Robertson at Westminster, among 115 other MPs, and I commend them for it.</p><p>The procurement bill is yet to be introduced and we can take action in Scotland now. I urge all members to look closely at that. I hope to hear how the Scottish Government intends to play its part in ending this global scandal and in ensuring that Scotland does not just sit back passively while its public services are deprived of the funds that they need.

It goes to the heart of how we deal with one of the greatest concerns for any parent, relative or friend&#8212;namely how we assist those who are closest to us if they become ensnared in drugs and the world that serious drug use drags people into.</p><p>As we heard, there are estimated to be 60,000 problem drug users in Scotland and almost 600 deaths occurred as a result of drugs last year. We should not forget that those deaths left families without a father, a son, a mother or a daughter. We can put that in perspective by looking around the chamber at decision time. It is the equivalent of five of us dying because of drugs or a combination of drugs and alcohol.</p><p>For six years, I worked as a front-line housing officer. In that role, I saw the multiplicity of ways in which drugs destroy not just individuals but community wellbeing, whether it was the elderly neighbour living in fear, the resentment at dealers showing off their ostentatious lifestyles with no apparent jobs to sustain them, health concerns about people who were visibly in decline, the anger at housing allocation policies, inter-dealer finance or a simple thing such as the dread felt by parents who keep their children indoors because they fear them going out on to the streets. Those were the concerns that people relayed to me and the housing association and councils that I worked for.</p><p>Let us be in no doubt that drug abuse is inextricably linked with poverty. The impact of drugs falls disproportionately, although not exclusively&#8212;as Margo MacDonald rightly said&#8212;on poorer working-class communities. It is they who suffer the most from the health impacts of drugs, but also from the associated crime, antisocial behaviour, violence, fear, loan sharking and the accompanying threats and intimidation.</p><p>The Scottish Drugs Forum recognised the complex picture of drug abuse in 2007, when it stated:</p><p>&#8220;there are strong links between poverty, deprivation, widening inequalities and problem drug use&#8221;.</p><p>In 2000, a Scottish Parliament committee noted:</p><p>&#8220;deprived communities, with poor housing, poor amenities and high levels of unemployment were the most seriously affected areas.&#8221;</p><p>That should be no surprise to any of us. Deindustrialisation created the conditions for drugs to thrive. In the former mining communities such as the one where I live and in large city housing schemes, our people have suffered horrendously over the decades as drugs filled the gap that was once occupied by a job and the social discipline and positive influences that came with it.</p><p>Today, as we see youth unemployment rising, benefits being cut and the impacts of austerity biting in those same communities, I fear that, rather than tackling deprivation, we might be creating the conditions that could lead to a new cycle of drug abuse.</p><p>I echo the comments that the Scottish Drugs Forum made in 2006, when it said that it wanted</p><p>&#8220;now and in the future to see deprivation given its full and proper place in all considerations of drug prevention policy, at both the local and strategic levels&#8221;</p><p>and that we should not let it &#8220;slip from sight&#8221;. I fear that it may well be slipping from sight. The greatest alternative that we can offer to a life of involvement in drugs is hope. If we give people an education, the hope of a job and a caring, supportive community, they will have alternatives.</p><p>The road to recovery policy is a holistic approach with, I think we would all agree, sound motivations. It is not by accident that it has enjoyed cross-party support. It has led to some good initiatives. Other members have mentioned the introduction of naloxone, which is seen as a model of good practice. There are calls for improvements to co-ordinated work, for example between child welfare organisations, mental health services and addiction services. Indeed, the Education and Culture Committee, on which I sit, is holding an inquiry into children and care, and we are looking at those very issues.</p><p>The treatment picture seems to be mixed: waiting times for those seeking treatment appeared to be reducing, but there has also been a reduction in residential care treatment places, as has been mentioned. I believe that any harm-reduction strategies and abstinence approaches must be tailored to the patient, and I think that there is general agreement on that.</p><p>All the treatments that are used and applied must go hand in hand with the fight against organised crime. In my local area there has been an innovative, multi-agency approach called operation focus, which is designed to eradicate organised crime. It uses gathered intelligence to act in one swoop to take dealers out of the community. The way it works is that houses are targeted and raided, with workmen on standby to follow up immediately and carry out repairs to the properties; they then sweep the streets and clean up the area, both physically and metaphorically. Police officers are on the streets in high-visibility patrols for the following couple of weeks. GPs and pharmacies are put on standby because supply has been taken off the streets, and schools are visited by police officers who reassure the pupils about what has just happened. In one school recently, the police officers left to a standing ovation from the young people at the assembly.</p><p>This is a complex issue, but we are doing it justice today.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676313", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is an important debate because it is about people&#8217;s lives and community cohesion and sustainability.

I pay tribute to the activists in east London who started the campaign and have stuck with it all the way. They are the pioneers and visionaries; we are merely followers, but that is no bad thing.</p><p>The campaign for a living wage is not radical or extreme. It does not ask the impossible. It is a campaign for fairness and justice that seeks dignity for all. If it is successful, the state will no longer have to subsidise rotten low pay. At its most basic level, the campaign will enable families to provide for themselves. I hope that everyone supports the campaign and&#8212;more important&#8212;takes action on the living wage.</p><p>The campaign has gained widespread support, from charities, churches and all the major trade unions, such as Unite, Unison, the GMB, the Public and Commercial Services Union, RMT, ASLEF and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians. We can be sure of one thing. Wherever there are campaigns for social justice, the UK&#8217;s trade unions will be there, agitating, organising, educating their members and encouraging them to help to bring about progressive change. Let no one say that trade unions are irrelevant; in these days of austerity they are more important than ever. Of course, the living wage is a central plank of the Scottish Trades Union Congress&#8217;s better way campaign, which offers a practical alternative to austerity.</p><p>Like Malcolm Chisholm, I remember debates during the 1997 election campaign, when Labour promised to introduce a national minimum wage. I remember the scare stories about how the minimum wage would be a disaster for business, costing jobs and being bad for competitiveness. At the time, as Iain Gray said, security guards and cleaners were earning &#163;1 or &#163;1.50 an hour. If that is what people mean by competitiveness, they can keep it.</p><p>I also remember that during the election campaign some people, including Cilla Black, Jim Davidson and Paul Daniels, said that they would leave the country if Labour won the election and introduced such policies. After Labour&#8217;s win, I wrote to them, to offer to run them to the airport if they wanted to keep their promise. It is unfortunate for us all that none of them took me up on my offer.</p><p>We have come some way since the introduction of a &#163;3.60 per hour minimum wage in 1998. The rate is now &#163;6.19. Major employers, such as the GLA, Glasgow City Council and KPMG, as well as solicitors, plant hire companies and colleges, have signed up to the living wage. I pay tribute to those employers and encourage others to follow.</p><p>We are not asking for the revolution&#8212;we might ask for that tomorrow. The living wage rate would deliver an annual salary of about &#163;13,000. I hope that through the forthcoming procurement reform bill and John Park&#8217;s proposed living wage bill we can deliver genuine progress on the issue in Scotland and begin to lead the way. The living wage will not eradicate poverty and injustice, but it will deliver cash into the pockets of many of my constituents, who desperately need help.</p><p>I do not know about you, Presiding Officer, but I want to live in a society in which people have access to skills and education and a good standard of living. I want to live in a society in which there is decency and equality.

However, we need good-quality, reliable services that do not rely on a race to the bottom on terms and conditions to ensure that employers win contracts.</p><p>The reality is that fares are up, routes have been withdrawn and jobs have been lost. As Iain Gray said, in my region earlier this year, it was announced that the Dalkeith First depot in Midlothian was to close and that operations in Musselburgh would be significantly downsized. Those changes could mean that up to 200 jobs are lost. Just last week, Unite the Union lobbied the Parliament on bus services and cuts to jobs and services.

Back in April, he said:</p><p>&#8220;Over a number of years we have tried many marketing and pricing initiatives to change this, but the extra financial pressures put upon us by the current economic climate, high fuel prices and cuts in external funding mean that we simply have no option other than to discontinue the bulk of our operation in East Lothian and Midlothian.&#8221;</p><p>Any green strategy must be predicated on an improved public transport system yet, only last week, we eventually got the transport minister to come kicking and screaming before Parliament to admit finally that the budget that he drew up for the Edinburgh to Glasgow improvement programme would be cut by &#163;350 million. That cut will not encourage people in the affected areas to use more sustainable transport. It will not encourage people on to trains or buses, green or otherwise; instead, car use will continue and emissions will rise.</p><p>I welcome the green bus initiative, but that is tempered with a dose of reality. If we are to celebrate such plans, we must do so while understanding the wider context of the Government&#8217;s transport policy, which appears to prioritise the car over public, sustainable and affordable transport.</p><p>I commend Iain Gray&#8217;s speech, which effectively summarised the state of play in the Scottish bus sector.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am afraid that I do not support the SNP on anything.

Such levels have not been seen since the 1980s. Seventeen hundred workers&#8212;and many more in the supply and contractor chain&#8212;will be threatened with the dole if the Dutch multinational closes the Hall&#8217;s meat processing plant, and that is not to mention the knock-on impact on the agricultural industry.

It was claimed that capital investment had increased construction jobs by 11.6 per cent, compared with a 0.2 per cent drop across the rest of the UK. This year, Scottish construction jobs have fallen by 6.6 per cent, while there has been a 1.8 per cent growth in such jobs in England and Wales. Sole traders, small businessmen, joiners, painters and roofing contractors&#8212;many of whom I have previously worked with&#8212;tell me that they have never seen the construction industry so bad. This is the reality of the world out there.</p><p>The First Minister tells us that he is creating demand by freezing council tax, but the hard facts are that 27,500 public sector jobs are being lost and a centrally imposed tax freeze is exacerbating service decline. What demand are those redundant workers who cannot spend money on food, clothing or services fulfilling? How does a strategy of mass public sector job loss square with the stated priority of providing economic security? Although we are told that the no-compulsory-redundancy policy will continue in the NHS and Scottish Government, nurses and civil servants are flying out the door.

That is a situation that affects all too many of us. I am afraid that my only language skills are in industrial language. I am not certified, but I reckon that I could be at PhD level in it.</p><p>Scottish Labour supports the sentiments of what the Government is proposing. However, far be it from me to indulge in a sterile debate or a round of ministerial back slapping. We support the principles of extending language provision, but we see a number of areas that require further scrutiny. We will, of course, offer constructive advice where we see fit. As the minister and his team know, the Labour education team is always willing to offer help to the Government.</p><p>I thank and commend the Scottish languages working group for a laudable and potentially important contribution to what is a vital debate about languages and language teaching in Scotland&#8217;s schools. On page six of the report, the group states:</p><p>&#8220;Language learning is life enhancing. It opens the doors to possibilities and experiences which are not available to those who are restricted to the knowledge of one language ... Through learning new languages young people can become successful learners with opportunities relating to working and travelling abroad&#8221;.</p><p>I think that we would all agree with those sentiments.</p><p>How many times have many of us, while abroad on holiday, on business or for whatever reason, suffered in embarrassed silence due to our inability to communicate in the language of the country that we are visiting? That individual deficiency is bad enough, but the working group also estimates that our failure to teach languages in a comprehensive and universal fashion amounts to what one commentator said last week is a language tax that costs the Scottish economy &#163;500 million. For economic, educational and cultural reasons, it is abundantly clear that we have to become more multilingual.</p><p>The working group has made some positive recommendations. The 1+2 suggestion of having primary school children learn a language other than English from P1 and another by P5 is one that we support. As the minister said, it fits the model that exists across Europe. If implemented effectively, it has the potential to transform our ability to communicate, with the obvious knock-on benefits that that will have.</p><p>However, we have some concerns and, to be fair, we are not the only ones. The working group itself stated that, in relation to current language teaching in primary schools,</p><p>&#8220;there are concerns that some primary children do not have access to an additional language due to staffing, training or funding issues, or other perceived curricular priorities.&#8221;</p><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that, at present, language provision in primary schools is often ad hoc and inconsistent due to those pressures and others. Such issues are raised repeatedly, not just in relation to language provision but in other areas of the school curriculum.</p><p>We need to look at the proposals against the background of the realities that schools today face. We have to remember that there are widespread and sustained cuts in the public sector, including in education. Since 2007, that has manifested itself in nearly 4,000 teaching posts being lost across Scotland. Many newly qualified teachers who perhaps have the necessary language skills cannot get work, and supply teaching is in crisis in some areas. The rector of a school in my area, for example, told me that their school had been down one modern language teacher for around six months, I think, and could not get supply cover.</p><p>The number of foreign language assistants is down from 300 in 2005-06 to just 59 in 2011-12. The languages working group said that foreign language assistants</p><p>&#8220;will have a key role to play in successful implementation of a 1+2 policy.&#8221;</p><p>The minister did not mention language assistants. In summing up, will he confirm how work with the British Council and others will ensure that more foreign language assistants will be introduced back into our schools?</p><p>What about the cost of and funding for the roll-out? The minister mentioned that, in 2008, &#163;4 million was given to local authorities to support language provision. Funding has been rolled up into general local government settlements, but the working group stated:</p><p>&#8220;if delivery of the 1+2 language policy is to be successful, further dedicated resources will be required.&#8221;</p><p>How will those dedicated resources be provided? Funding of &#163;4 million seems rather a small amount in light of our challenge. We need more information on that.</p><p>The working group acknowledged the need to upskill teachers and for a commitment to extensive continuing professional development. It stated:</p><p>&#8220;There will be significant organisational, resource and staffing issues from Primary 1 onwards ... There will need to be sufficient numbers of primary teachers, appropriately trained, confident and competent in language teaching.&#8221;</p><p>Information on how that matter will be addressed was largely absent from the minister&#8217;s opening statement.</p><p>From our discussions with the teaching profession, we know that it understands fully the need for a major training initiative to implement such a programme, but there is, of course, a big resource issue. What commitment is there to provide the funding for the teachers and training that will be needed for the national roll-out to be successful, should the pilots be so? Since the announcement was made, I have spoken to many teachers and a number of young people about their experiences of learning a language in primary and secondary school. The constant theme is exposure to languages too late and a lack of consistency from primary through to secondary school. I agree that we need to catch young people early in their education and that they need to be immersed in the language, not drip-fed.</p><p>Currently, many pupils in secondary school end their language experience in second year. That is especially true of boys, who largely opt out of taking languages. As we already know, the number of pupils who take highers in the main languages is decreasing, and for languages such as German the decline is significant. If the proposals are to work, consideration will have to be given to how schools offer subjects and how they will manage an already crowded curriculum, which will become even more crowded when Scottish studies comes on stream. In his summing up, perhaps the minister can say how those issues will be addressed.</p><p>We are concentrating on schools, but there are other missed opportunities for developing language skills in Scotland. Many people want to learn a language later in life, because of experiences in business or on holiday for example. My father-in-law is fluent in French and he began to learn it only 10 years ago. That was because of experiences that he had later in life. We should consider enabling people to learn throughout their lives through workplace learning, for example.</p><p>Finally, will the minister clarify what plans the Government has for the pilot schemes? How will they be monitored and evaluated? When does the minister plan to publish details of them? I urge that, when he establishes the pilot areas, he makes them broad and representative. By that, I mean that they should take in urban and rural schools&#8212;as there are particular issues, in respect of supply teaching for example, for rural schools&#8212;primary and secondary schools, and schools in areas with very different socioeconomic indicators, not least because, as the working group stated,</p><p>&#8220;the biggest educational challenge faced by legislators and educators alike is in raising educational attainment for children in areas of high social deprivation.&#8221;</p><p>To conclude, I reiterate our broad support for the objectives of the policy. The points that we have raised have been raised in good faith, and we all want to see the policy succeed.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-03004.1, to leave out from &#8220;supports&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;acknowledges the decline in language course take-up in secondary schools; recognises that developing language skills from an early age is best supported by well-trained teachers and language assistants; notes that the numbers of both have reduced significantly since 2007, and calls on the Scottish Government to identify how any future roll-out of the proposed pilot projects would be funded to allow all young people to start learning a second language from primary 1.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Merci, Presiding Officer.

On 2 May, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning advised me that the Government has no plans to introduce minimum acoustic standards for school buildings. That is extremely disappointing and I hope that the Government and the minister will have another think about that. Bringing in minimum standards would be a simple and cost-effective step.

I apologise to any librarians among us, but the genteel and somewhat staid image is a thing of the past. Libraries are now vibrant hubs providing a range of services.</p><p>In my local authority area, we have developed a model of service provision in which the library and library staff are key to local service delivery. That partnership approach brings together health, police, sporting, council, advice and library services under one roof, increasing the skills of the staff and providing one contact point for all public services. The library hosts storytelling sessions, computer classes, genealogy courses, homework clubs and much more, as well as hosting local resources in book and online formats.</p><p>As libraries change, the arrangements needed to manage and govern them must also change. The bill recognises that. The National Library of Scotland is an important public resource. It is obvious, when we walk through the door, that past and present trustees have carried out their duties well and in the best spirit of public service. It has been well managed and developed, hosting not only extensive book and paper collections but digital and film archives, websites and other new media materials. That area of its work is one that can and will develop further over time.</p><p>The Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s visit to the National Library was an interesting and rewarding experience. We could sense the unique atmosphere of the place and the pride that the trustees and employees have in it. It is an example of a public service that our taxes pay for&#8212;a public service that could never be delivered by the market and one that we have to support, protect and adequately fund.</p><p>Labour accepts that the governance of the National Library is in need of reform. We accept the insertion of the technical amendments proposed by the cabinet secretary and the insertion of the Gaelic name for legal, contractual reasons. We also accept that a governing body of 32&#8212;including, among others, Professor Anderson OBE MA PhD FBA FRSE, the Lord President of the Court of Session, the Lord Advocate, the First Minister, the dean of the Faculty of Advocates, the minister of the high kirk of St Giles in Edinburgh, the Crown Agent, the Lord Provosts of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Marco Biagi&#8212;requires some reform, as it is rather unwieldy.</p><p>We welcome section 2 of the bill, which clarifies the functions of the National Library and makes it clear that the library is a national reference and research library and a resource for Scotland&#8217;s research community. We welcome also that section 2 puts in statute that collections must be accessible to the public. That is the main function of any public library.</p><p>We welcome sections 3 and 4, which cover acquisition, disposal, borrowing and lending, and sections 5 and 6, which relate to legal deposits and the role of the Faculty of Advocates. Those sections have made progress without any major contention, as has section 7 on grants and loans.</p><p>On the other sections of the bill, largely relating to technicalities, we have no major concerns. The cabinet secretary has generally listened to the views expressed about the size of board and the need to reflect diversity in its appointments. That is welcome. Overall, the bill has gone through its parliamentary process fairly easily and without any great division. I put on record our thanks to the committee convener and the clerks, who have ably assisted us.</p><p>We listened to the debate about section 8, on the ministerial power of direction, at stage 1, in the committee evidence sessions, and at stage 2. We were willing to give the cabinet secretary more time to come back with further changes and we regret that that has not happened. The minister accepted that a ministerial power of direction has never been applied to cultural bodies. When probed on that by Liam McArthur and others, the minister could not come up with any concrete examples of when a ministerial power of direction could be used. She also accepted that curatorial independence should not be compromised. It must be asked, therefore, why we would want to include a power that no one has ever used and for which the minister responsible sees no discernible use. There is undoubtedly a trend of centralisation in this Government, particularly in the way in which it deals with education and local government. Section 8 would appear to be another&#8212;albeit small&#8212;step in that direction.</p><p>The bill is to be welcomed. It puts the governance of our National Library on a sound footing. Parties throughout the Parliament have actively co-operated on the bill and worked to improve it. I hope that, collectively, we have developed a valued national institution, making it more able to meet the demands of a modern service environment.

It is ironic that the country that is the self-proclaimed leader of the free world and that claims to be at the forefront of the war on terror jailed people whose only crime was to try to prevent terrorism in their homeland.</p><p>The US has perpetrated a 50-year-long hostile campaign against Cuba, because of one thing: Cuba offers an alternative route, which is based on equality, humanity and justice. I have witnessed at first hand the application of that philosophy. My first visit to Cuba was as a tourist; my second was as a participant in the annual Cuba cycle challenge, which is organised by the Cuba Solidarity Campaign.</p><p>I will tell you something that you already know, Presiding Officer: I am not a natural athlete. Perhaps I am a natural darts and dominoes player, but that is about it. However, I got myself a bit fitter for the journey, and when we cycled the 200 miles through the country, we experienced its sights, sounds and culture. We attended the May day parade in Revolution Square and saw the pride that Cubans have in the achievements of the revolution. Apparently, a million people were there, but I think that every single person in the world was there. I have never seen so many people.</p><p>We saw at first hand the emphasis that is placed on the provision of excellent healthcare facilities. At a polyclinic, we saw the full range of services provided locally that we can get in a hospital. People are referred there by their family doctor, who lives in the community that they serve. We also saw the large regional hospitals, which provide specialist services that cannot be provided locally. There are very short waiting times. The wait for major heart surgery, for example, is a maximum of four weeks. I wish that we could achieve such things.</p><p>The focus on health undoubtedly produces real results. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy in Cuba is 75 years for men and 80 years for women. Members should remember that that is in a developing country. Its infant mortality rates are better than those of the US and the UK, and that is achieved on a shoestring budget that is less than a tenth of the UK&#8217;s and a twentieth of the US&#8217;s budget. Simple, free access to general practitioners is the bedrock of the healthcare system, and there are 14,000 family doctors for the population of 11.2 million. That is a ratio of one family doctor to 785 people. If we include all the doctors in hospitals, colleges and other places, the ratio falls dramatically to one for every 175 people, which is an astonishing figure.</p><p>Hugh Henry mentioned internationalism. We must recognise Cuba&#8217;s internationalism. Cuba does not export arms; it exports medicines, doctors, nurses and teachers. The operation miracle campaign has improved the sight of people throughout Latin America and beyond by removing their cataracts and healing other eye complaints. Hundreds of thousands of people have benefited from that campaign.</p><p>When the catastrophic earthquake struck Haiti, Cubans were the first there. They provided field hospitals, vaccines, emergency shelters and foodstuffs. Cuba sent 6,000 community health professionals to Venezuela and Ecuador to establish clinics in the countryside and the favelas, where healthcare was previously non-existent. After hurricane Katrina, of course, the Government of Fidel and Raul offered medical assistance to the US Government to help with the disaster, but that offer was disgracefully refused by the bigots in the White House, who would rather have seen their people suffer than allow them to be healed by Cuban doctors and nurses.</p><p>In education, despite the system being starved of resources because of the blockade, every child gets the same opportunity.

The answer is no.

Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the importance of ensuring effective running and retention of our public libraries as a vital cog in the social fabric.</p><p>Historically, libraries have played a major role in the self-improvement of many of our citizens. I welcome the bill and the fact that it does not threaten to close down library provision. It seeks to give the National Library of Scotland governance arrangements that are necessary for it to meet the needs and demands that are being placed upon it.</p><p>Sadly, I am afraid that many communities across the UK are seeing libraries being closed or threatened with closure as cuts to local government and austerity policies bite ever harder. I know that we are here today to consider the National Library of Scotland and the proposed changes to its governance, but before doing so, I will expand briefly on the importance of libraries in general because they are vital tools in helping people to achieve and learn. The self-education of many working-class people has been facilitated through libraries, and reading promotes and encourages self-development. Libraries allow people, irrespective of their income, to borrow the same books and read the same material, and that is genuine equality of access.</p><p>I was delighted to hear the cabinet secretary herself mention socialism. Libraries are, of course, an expression of municipal socialism in practice. The labour movement has always promoted education as being one of the greatest tools to foster social, economic, and personal change, and libraries have a key role to play in that. At this time of forced austerity and the on-going attack on public services, we must be ever vigilant and we must guard against the threat of library closures. Libraries are often seen as easy targets and are wrongly categorised as being somehow superfluous. Of course, they are not; they are an essential part of the community and part of a group of cherished public services that are a civilising force in our society.</p><p>Of course, in this day and age, libraries are about more than just books; modern libraries are about exhibitions, displays, digital and film archives, web development, service collaboration, archiving and genealogy, as well as being a traditional source of reference and reading materials. Libraries can provide many of our young people with a sanctuary in which to study in quiet and with space, which might not be available in their family homes.</p><p>The National Library of Scotland is one of Scotland&#8217;s most important and valued public resources. The cabinet secretary mentioned that it was established in 1925. It is right that we now consider its management and governance, and look for ways to ensure that it continues as an effective and respected Scottish institution.</p><p>Past and present boards and trustees appear to have done a very good job, which is evident as soon as we walk through the doors of the National Library. When the committee visited, we were able to see the work that goes on there and to experience and taste the unique atmosphere of the place. However, the governance of the NLS is in need of reform&#8212;a point that was made in 2006 by the Labour-led Scottish Executive. To my mind, there is a compelling case for the NLS to streamline its governance. I have sat on many a board and committee in my time, so I can see how a board of 32 people might be somewhat unwieldy and could result in a logjam in the decision-making process, but I was surprised to hear the cabinet secretary say that there might be a change to the number of board members. At the committee, she expressed a preference for seven or possibly nine members. We are now being told that the number could be as high as 19.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was going to whisper at the start of my speech, but that would have been a cheap and obvious libraries joke, and I would never indulge in such a thing.

The &#8220;Thriving or surviving? National Library of Scotland in 2030&#8221; report and the subsequent &#8220;Connecting Knowledge&#8221; report have sought to devise new ways to embrace digitisation and to broaden learning through the use of technology. That proactive approach is very welcome. I also welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s announcement about the screen archive going to Glasgow. However, any change must be managed and any future changes should be made while protecting the NLS&#8217;s independence and unique status. Research projects or decisions related to the collections, or any decisions about them, must be completely free of political interference. The principle of curatorial independence, like that of academic freedom, is one that we should protect at all costs.</p><p>That is why I have some concerns about the plans for ministerial direction. It is proposed that Scottish ministers may be given the power to give directions</p><p>&#8220;of a general or specific nature&#8221;.</p><p>The cabinet secretary addressed that issue in committee, but I hope that she will expand on it in her summing-up speech. I am sure that she does not want to micromanage the NLS&#8212;I do not think that she intends to stamp books and hand them out&#8212;but there are reservations about the proposals representing another yard down the road to centralisation of power. I am not saying that that is inevitable, but if a less reasonable person than the current cabinet secretary takes over her position in the future, that danger could become a reality. I acknowledge the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comment that the library&#8217;s independence will be respected, but it would be helpful if we could be given more clarity about the proposed ministerial direction. That would allow us to determine whether we need ministerial direction at all.</p><p>One of the library&#8217;s key roles is to preserve and promote our national culture and heritage, as well as to promote cultural policy. I hope that it will continue to be an embracing and diverse cultural policy that respects and reflects all the influences on our great country, wherever they come from, and that we do not become overly parochial. There is a danger that the Government could seek to use its position in order to use cultural policy as a vehicle to promote its wider political agenda, rather than to serve the national interest.</p><p>I would raise my concerns about the potential centralisation of control no matter who was in power, because, used wrongly, the proposals could represent a danger to the library that would dissuade donors, or even raise questions about its charitable status. Again, clarity on that would be helpful.</p><p>We have questions about other parts of the bill. As I have mentioned, the value of libraries lies in their universal character and their status as a public good that is, and always should be, available for all. They are not and should never become commercial entities, so we want more information on the suggestions that the NLS could charge</p><p>&#8220;for the provision of goods and services&#8221;</p><p>and that it could raise and borrow money with ministerial approval. Will the cabinet secretary expand on what that means? Which services might be charged for? How will moneys be raised or borrowed, and how would that affect the services? After all, we know that loans have to be paid back. I wonder whether it is a coincidence that the Scottish Government has given the library the right to borrow at the same time as it is reducing its budget by 11 per cent.</p><p>I am curious about the principle for allowing the library to create and own companies. We need clarity on what sorts of companies they would be and why they are needed. I hope that the proposal will not lead to the creeping commercialisation of the library. Any such move would call into question the broad principle and ethos that libraries, and the NLS in particular, are open and accessible to all people, no matter their means.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is helpful.

My daughter was doing her final submission for her higher English, and the essay was on the living wage, so I have been on the subject for the whole week.</p><p>We will not get ourselves out of the desperate economic situation that we find ourselves in by leaving it to the market&#8212;the very market that got us into the current mess in the first place. We can do it only by investing to create sustainable, long-term and permanent jobs that are well paid and get people out of poverty, whether we call it in-work poverty or working poverty. The living wage of &#163;7.20 will not achieve that on its own, but it will be a step in the right direction.</p><p>I commend the work of the Poverty Alliance, the STUC and the major churches and charities that have been campaigning for the introduction of the living wage for some time. Indeed, I believe that the latest report of the Church of Scotland, which is based on evidence that was given to its poverty commission, should be essential reading for everyone in the Parliament. If anyone does not have a copy, John Wilson or I will be able to provide them with one. It presents a picture of a very different economy from the one that we have now&#8212;one that is based on social justice, dignity and the idea that the economy should serve people, not the markets. It advocates a living wage alongside taxation reform, to make the system fair and redistributive, a Robin Hood tax on speculation on financial transactions and regulation of the financial sector. If those proposals were introduced, they would create a society and an economy that most of us in the chamber could be proud of.</p><p>We need legislation to bring in the living wage. We should not allow there to be any ambiguity by talking about a de facto living wage or whatever. We know that we can do it. Glasgow City Council has done it, and I think that the Greater London Authority led the way. I believe that the British Olympic Authority has introduced it as well.</p><p>The living wage is a key part of the STUC&#8217;s better way campaign. As always, trade unions and working people are at the forefront of any fight against social and economic injustice. It is their work on behalf of the low paid, the exploited and, in particular, minorities and women that will, I believe, lead to the living wage being legislated for. The question is whether we do it now or whether we have to wait for some time in the future.</p><p>John Wilson is absolutely correct to say that the living wage should not be introduced alone, because we have to have the proper employment rights to go along with it. That is another key argument in the better way campaign.</p><p>We should never forget&#8212;although Margaret Mitchell might have&#8212;that, before we had the national minimum wage, we had cleaners, security guards and carers working for as little as &#163;1.50 or &#163;1 an hour. That was a scandalous situation. In fact, it was Dickensian. I believe that it is only a short distance from that to sending children up chimneys.</p><p>Our sense of fairness and justice demands a living wage, so I think that we should make it happen quickly.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662943", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a bit of a living-wage week for me.

I am sorry to have to disappoint her on this occasion, but I am sure that I will get the opportunity to enthral members on that subject in the near future.</p><p>Climate change and environmental justice, and the development of policies in those areas, is of vital interest locally, nationally and internationally. I welcome the debate because it is a reminder to us all that there is a wider world out there that goes way beyond the narrow confines of this Parliament. It goes beyond national boundaries and shows us that, whether they are fishermen in the Western Isles or pastoral farmers in the Sudan, human beings across the world have shared interests and common concerns, and we need co-operative solutions for them.</p><p>The concept of climate justice&#8212;or, more appropriately, climate injustice&#8212;is not difficult to comprehend. By adhering to a flawed and often brutally uncompromising economic system, the west has grown wealthy at the expense of people in the developing world by exploiting their human and natural resources to satisfy our demand for material goods. The impacts of our actions will not be felt some time in the distant future when even the youngest of us&#8212;such as me&#8212;will be long gone. They are being felt here and now. According to Oxfam, almost 300,000 deaths a year are caused by the effects of climate change.</p><p>The bulk of those deaths do not occur in the United States, Europe, or Scotland, but in the poorer countries of the developing world: 50 of the world&#8217;s poorest countries are said to have contributed less than 1 per cent of global emissions, but bear nine tenths of the social and economic consequences. Those with the least responsibility for causing climate change are the ones who suffer the most from its consequences. That, of course, is not climate justice but climate injustice on an industrial scale.</p><p>Climate change has its deniers. Right-wing commentators and neo-con think tanks that are funded by the likes of Exxon and Mobil spew out their propaganda just as readily as their sponsors spew out emissions. Increased incidence of drought and water scarcity, floods, violent weather patterns, desertification and food insecurity have not been dreamed up by left-wing conspiracy theorists; they are happening across the globe here and now.</p><p>Scotland is not immune from the impact. We have witnessed more unpredictable weather patterns, warmer winters, and wetter summers, and we can see that our infrastructure struggles to cope. Just as climate change affects the less developed countries around the world, when a big developer wants to exploit minerals and land resources in Scotland, it is the poorer communities that are often targeted, whether it be for a landfill site, incinerator, or open-cast coal mining. The absence of any third-party right of appeal in this country&#8217;s planning system is a clear injustice that must be addressed if we are serious about promoting environmental justice at home.</p><p>Successive Scottish Governments have carefully considered climate change and how to adapt to and mitigate its effects. The Government&#8217;s climate change targets are laudable, but it is one thing to set targets and another to implement them.</p><p>Let us take renewables. I have said this before and I will say it again: our approach to renewables represents a missed opportunity. Had we sought to take control of our own renewables industry, we could have had the financial benefits stay in Scotland. We could have developed a substantive domestic green economy, with much of the accrued surpluses being reinvested in tackling fuel poverty and in developing further renewable technology.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My colleague, Claudia Beamish, said that I would speak on the green skills agenda.

Forget the referendum&#8212;if only&#8212;this Parliament&#8217;s priority has to be jobs and getting our people back to work. The rising rates of unemployment represent the clearest evidence that austerity is not working, and l accept fully that the actions of Mr Brown&#8217;s much-loved Tory-led Westminster Government are a major factor in that. On the back of the global economic crisis, it is that Government&#8217;s policies, with their massive cuts in expenditure, their attacks on the public sector and the poor, and their failure to intervene and stimulate the economy that have contributed to the disastrous situation we are in.</p><p>What we need to do now is create demand in the economy through sustainable jobs that give people confidence and stability in their lives, which in turn allows them to plan and to build a future. That is the foundation we need to create a stable and growing economy and community, and we will never create that with a low tax, low public expenditure, deregulated approach.</p><p>Increasing unemployment is affecting all our people. Young people are seeing their ambitions and life chances thwarted, and for many older workers this feels like a return to the &#8220;Boys from the Blackstuff&#8221; era of the 1980s. The reality is that unemployment is causing misery for tens of thousands of Scots. In my local authority area of West Lothian, 440 more people have joined the dole queue in the past month. Youth unemployment stands at an incredible 30 per cent, and the long-term rate has quadrupled over the past three years. In January, we had a claimant count of 148,000 across Scotland, but only 19,000 vacancies existed, and at the same time Skills Development Scotland&#8212;the careers service&#8212;has been cutting front-line careers services and jobs. That simply does not make sense.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is much that we can do here and now with the powers that this Parliament already has. In Scotland, Labour for some time called for a youth employment minister, and we welcomed the appointment of Angela Constance, but some worrying messages are coming out of her office. Two things in particular cause me great concern. First, the minister has stated several times that it is not the Government&#8217;s job to create jobs. That is an astonishing statement from a party that claims to be social democrat in outlook. The Government can, and indeed must, create jobs, and it can do so by having an industrial policy that supports manufacturing and prepares businesses for future work, giving them an early indication of contracts, having local contract events to promote work for local employers, and assisting with investment in research and development. Such a policy does not overconcentrate on prestige projects but delivers small to medium-sized local projects that sustain employment; it also has community benefit clauses that build jobs and skills development into contracts.</p><p>The second issue that causes me concern is the work experience programme, in which the Department for Work and Pensions and major employers collaborate to get young people to work for benefit only. I was very disappointed, to put it mildly, to read that the Minister for Youth Employment was said to be &#8220;relaxed&#8221; about the DWP&#8217;s plans and programmes.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy and Recovery"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wonder whether the first part of Mr Brodie&#8217;s speech could be summed up as &#8220;talking down Britain&#8221;, to coin a phrase.

Fantastic things are going on in Scotland in education. Over the past eight years I have worked with some magnificent people and parents in primary and secondary schools, but they have serious concerns that cannot be wished or blustered away. The commitment to ensure that all 16 to 19-year-olds have a place in education or training is commendable, but there are serious concerns about that agenda, not least because we are witnessing reform in the midst of unprecedented and disproportionately large cuts to the college sector, which were highlighted ably by Liz Smith, Kezia Dugdale and, despite what Mr Russell said, Margaret McDougall.</p><p>As Hugh Henry highlighted, the minister&#8217;s focus is on 16 to 19-year-olds, but 20 to 24-year-olds have as much need as their younger friends. Youth unemployment, which is rising, is measured by employment among 20 to 24-year-olds. Why are we prioritising only 16 to 19-year-olds when it is clear that there are major problems up to 24 and well beyond?</p><p>During a time of unemployment and redundancies, college education often provides a platform for retraining and access to higher education for adults returning to education or looking to change career direction. Will those needy groups be among the casualties of Mr Russell&#8217;s cuts?</p><p>On students with additional needs, college principals to whom I have spoken have questioned the adequacy of equality impact assessments in considering those protected groups.</p><p>We are now in January.

That is one of the biggest campaigns in this country on any issue, yet in an education debate the minister did not even mention it.</p><p>The curriculum for excellence was broadly welcomed when the idea was developed by the previous Labour-led Executive. Liz Smith, Colin Beattie and many other members referred to it in their speeches. However, there are serious concerns and confusion about how it is being taken forward. The Educational Institute of Scotland is clear that the introduction of CFE</p><p>&#8220;could hardly be less promising&#8221;</p><p>in the current context of mounting pressure on its members, with teaching assistants cut, teaching numbers down, larger class sizes, pay and conditions under attack, and the crisis in supply teaching. Again, I am surprised that the education minister has not mentioned the crisis in supply teaching.</p><p>Ronnie Smith said recently:</p><p>&#8220;The pace of change must be linked to the capacity of the system to cope with it.&#8221;</p><p>The EIS has been calling for some time for a one-year delay in the implementation of curriculum for excellence and, given the concerns and parental worry and confusion about exams, the Government should consider that.</p><p>It is not a revelation to say that good education needs good-quality, well-trained and motivated staff. Christina McKelvie, Graeme Pearson and others mentioned the quality of teaching that they have observed. I am sure that, when the cabinet secretary reflects on the matter, in all honesty, he will accept that the handling of teacher numbers and related matters has been rather poor.</p><p>The Scottish Government must make youth unemployment one of its top priorities. I hope that the appointment of a dedicated minister, which Labour called for immediately after the election, will make a difference. Time will tell. The contradiction of wanting to deal with youth unemployment while savaging college budgets defies logic&#8212;a number of members mentioned that.</p><p>In recent years, we have witnessed the development of many programmes for young people, such as more choices, more chances, targeted pathways to apprenticeships, get ready for work, and many more. It is essential that the money spent on those courses delivers jobs, a future and hope for the young people involved.</p><p>How many young people on the courses find themselves shuffled from one course to another, their hopes raised only for nothing to emerge at the other end? In the words of one professional in the skills sector,</p><p>&#8220;many of these schemes appear to be used as holding corrals for the young unemployed.&#8221;</p><p>We constantly hear about 25,000 modern apprenticeships being created each year, but how many of those are new employees and how many on targeted pathway courses have gone into full apprenticeships? I am advised that it is very few. Does the minister also accept that, by lowering the qualification for apprenticeships from level 3 to level 2, we have seen an illusory inflation in the figures?</p><p>Marco Biagi mentioned careers advisers. We have seen major changes at Skills Development Scotland. A deliberate strategy of moving away from front-line face-to-face careers guidance to a web-based service has thrown up concerns among careers practitioners. Indeed, a recent survey of front-line staff at SDS showed that more than 90 per cent have little faith in the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to careers guidance.</p><p>Hugh Henry, Christina McKelvie and others spoke about improving the learning outcomes of young people, and how the process starts from birth. I agree. The best way in which to improve people&#8217;s life chances is by providing their families and communities with good homes, a decent income and improved confidence and self-esteem. When the Scottish Government takes actions to deliver those, it will have our full support. However, when it fails, we will hold it to account.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658693", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People (Improving Learning Outcomes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Can the minister tell West Lothian College, which is in my area, exactly what its budget will be for next year?

I also apologise as I will have to leave soon after making this contribution.</p><p>From the first week of entering the Parliament, I have been working with Margo MacDonald, who, unfortunately, cannot make it to the debate, on the very issue that we are debating. Margo and her staff have been focusing on the cost of pay day loans, and developing ideas with Mike Dailly of the Govan Law Centre to see whether the Parliament can curb the scandalous and exploitative practices of pay day loans companies.</p><p>To develop our understanding of the issue, I took Ms MacDonald to the annual general meeting of the West Lothian credit union forum, where we heard at first hand about the activities and practices of the legalised robbers who run the likes of Provident, Greenwood, Wonga and the rest. We also heard about the pressing need of the credit unions to take on those rogue companies, and what would allow them to do that. The credit unions asked for our help to improve their great work, which often takes place in our most needy communities. Following on from that, in December I presented a list of proposals to the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth at a meeting in his office, and I look forward to his reply early in the new year.</p><p>In my brief contribution, I will discuss pay day loans and loans companies, the work of credit unions and the help that the Scottish Government could and should provide. However, before doing so, I feel that we need to mention briefly the elephant in the room: the reason why people end up using pay day loans companies in the first place. In the present climate of constitutional debate, we should not forget Scotland&#8217;s real shame, which is poverty and social inequality. Earlier this week, the campaign to end child poverty showed that nearly half of Scottish local authorities now have wards in which more than 30 per cent of children live in poverty. In a modern, high-tech, wealthy country, that is a national embarrassment. It is in that environment that the pay day lenders thrive.</p><p>It is poverty that means that 46 per cent of all pay day loans are issued to people who earn less than &#163;15,500 a year, and which allows companies such as the Loan Store to operate a system that charges &#163;1,500 in interest for a &#163;500 loan over 12 months with the original balance still outstanding at the end. It is poverty that has Wonga carrying out direct advertising to students on very low incomes to try to lure them into its clutches.</p><p>Of course, there is a clear alternative to pay day loans companies. Credit unions, as we all know, do a fantastic job and all parties and the Scottish Government have stated their support for them, but they need practical help now. Many are constantly facing an uphill struggle to overcome barriers to progress.</p><p>Credit unions, especially the smaller ones, are toiling to keep financially afloat, and there are issues about preferred creditor status, corporation tax and use of reserves. We need to help them to get people through the doors&#8212;that would be the best help that we could give them&#8212;and they need greater visibility.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658774", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High-interest Pay Day Loans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Margaret Burgess for lodging the motion and securing this very important debate.

The principle of setting down long-term plans for investment in key infrastructure projects chimes with my political and economic philosophy. I firmly believe that, in a mixed economy, when the private sector is in decline and the country is experiencing recession, the state should step in and inject cash into the economy to create growth and jobs. There are many projects across the country that desperately need such investment, and we cannot afford to leave things to the failing market.</p><p>The role of any Opposition is to hold the Government to account and, by God, we most certainly have to do that with this plan, because the truth is that it is a pretty dodgy document. If we look behind the smoke and mirrors, we find that funding still has to be identified for more than 50 per cent of the projects that are in the pipeline. Some projects are so far into the future that Doctor Who would have difficulty locating them. It is hardly speculative to suggest that many of the projects are extremely unlikely ever to see the light of day.</p><p>Let us take high-speed rail, which was much trumpeted in Mr Neil&#8217;s hard-hat, high-vis-vest press launch last week. According to the plan, although the project&#8217;s capital value has yet to be identified and finance and delivery remain &#8220;To be defined&#8221;, the timetable is apparently okay. So if someone books a ticket for the 8.45 to Manchester on 1 January 2033, it appears that they will arrive at their destination on time, because that is when the document says that the project will be finished. I think that &#8220;Thomas the Tank Engine&#8221; is more believable than that fairytale.</p><p>In short, the plan is low on detail but high on spin. It claims a headline figure of &#163;60 billion of investment but, in reality, the capital value of the projects concerned is half that figure. In addition, the Government claims credit for maintenance investment that would have happened anyway. At Scottish Water, for example, investment was already being driven by the quality and standards process, 85 per cent of which is paid for by customer charges. Indeed, the Government has halved its loan funding to that organisation.</p><p>It is estimated that 156,000 people are on the social housing waiting list, and there is a need for around 10,000 new houses per annum to meet demand. As Lewis Macdonald said, this week six major housing organisations, including Shelter, the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, pointed out that</p><p>&#8220;Funding for affordable housing is proposed to be one of the biggest losers in the draft Scottish budget&#8221;.</p><p>Will the cabinet secretary please be straight with us and acknowledge that they are correct in that assessment and that that budget has also been halved? When he winds up, will he commit himself to arguing in the Cabinet for any available new funds and the &#163;57 million of Barnett consequentials that are to be released as a result of the English council tax freeze to be invested in social housing? It is one of Scotland&#8217;s most pressing issues.</p><p>What of the college sector? The plan promotes learning, skills and wellbeing and recognises that</p><p>&#8220;our people are our greatest asset, and that a skilled, educated and creative workforce is essential to creating a more ... resilient economy&#8221;,</p><p>but how on earth can we do that when college budgets are being cut by 20 per cent? I grant that some capital investment is taking place, but new buildings are of little use without a broad range of courses and quality teaching going on inside them.</p><p>In my region, there are many local infrastructure projects that desperately need funding, but I cannot find any reference to them in the plan. Will the Avon gorge link between West Lothian and Falkirk be financed through the plan? The cabinet secretary visited Armadale a few weeks ago to see the new station development, but the absence of a new school is holding back that project. Will that be funded through the plan? What of the motorway junction at Winchburgh? Will it be funded to allow the core development area there to proceed?</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657655", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Infrastructure Investment Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At first glance, the infrastructure investment plan, which was published last week, is a very worthy document.

I want to make my contribution from a qualitative perspective, and I will do that by talking about what it is like to live with MS from the point of view of one sufferer.</p><p>My constituent, John, is one of the 10,000 individuals in Scotland who suffer from MS. He was a fairly normal young man. He enjoyed playing football and golf, he worked hard, and he liked a night out. He was a skilled engineer. Indeed, he was apprentice of the year at the factory in which he worked. When John started feeling extreme fatigue, he put it down to hard work, long hours and playing sport. He then started to feel a loss of dexterity and feeling in his hand and an inability to bend his legs. At the age of 31, he knew that something was wrong.</p><p>After several bouts of tests, John was called to his local GP and told not that he had MS, but that he had symptoms that were compatible with MS. That seems to be the way that patients are told. More shockingly for him, he was told, &#8220;Get on with it.&#8221; He told me that that news and the following discussion should have been in the hands of his neurologist and not his GP, because his GP could not really answer many of the questions that came up.</p><p>Perhaps a counsellor should also have been on hand to deal with what is, for many people, shattering news. The news was, of course, devastating for John&#8217;s young family, his friends and his extended family, but worse was to come because, soon afterwards, he was sacked unfairly by his employer because of his disability. Eventually, he won a tribunal case for unfair dismissal but, because he had not been in employment for a certain length of time, he was not reinstated.</p><p>John tells me that, at the outset, he was treated fine, medically. He was admitted to hospital straight away for a week of intravenous steroids. As time went on, he had to battle to get beta interferon, which was held up as the great hope, at the time. He had to wait for it because it was referred to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence process. It was hard enough for John to cope at that time, without him also having to go through the battle for medication.</p><p>John advises me that certain changes would help sufferers. The first is improved support services. He feels that some sufferers who lack family support or the ability to work through the system are being left behind. Self-support is fine for those who have the ability to do that.</p><p>Another suggestion concerns MS nurses. There are only two MS nurses for the whole of the NHS Lothian region, but they are based in the Western General in Edinburgh. For many reasons&#8212;most notably cost, logistics and fatigue&#8212;that is unsatisfactory, especially for sufferers who live 30 miles away in West Lothian. On Tuesday, the MS Society told me that a sufferer is likely to access only one appointment with that service a year.</p><p>John also raises the cost of mobility items, such as high ramps, wheelchairs and hand controls for mobility cars. They are very expensive, and many people have to pick up the cost themselves. The daunting prospect of welfare reform on the horizon is relevant in that regard, too.</p><p>There has been inadequate tracking of sufferers, although I know that the MS Society is now undertaking a mapping exercise, which is a step forward. We need to keep the profile of MS high on the agenda.</p><p>As the illness is a peculiarly Scottish or northern one, we have to be at the forefront of co-ordinating activity to find a cure, which might mean working with other Governments, the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders.

However, as much as it is right to increase renewable energy capacity, it is also right to discuss serious concerns about how that increased capacity has developed in practice. My motion expresses two main concerns about the development of our renewable capacity: first, the overconcentration of wind farms in certain areas, which runs alongside the lack of engagement with, and involvement of, communities; and secondly the ownership of wind farm projects and the risk of losing the potential to create jobs and opportunities.</p><p>The Scottish Government set itself a very ambitious target of producing 100 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. On the face of it, that target is laudable and, if it were to be achieved, it would make Scotland a world leader in the field. However, it is my view&#8212;and the view of a growing number of people in Scotland&#8212;that that lofty ambition could be scuppered by some fundamental flaws in policy and practice.</p><p>One of Scotland&#8217;s most significant onshore projects, the large Iberdrola Renewables Black Law wind farm, is located in my council ward. Originally, the application got through the planning system without a single objection from my community; people recognised the need to support renewables and saw the wind farm as a positive development. However, what happened after that permission was granted should serve as a warning to us all. After that first application, the area has become a prime target for developers that are motivated not by environmental concerns but by pound notes. Close to the grid and to demand, not a tourist spot&#8212;indeed, it is relatively rural&#8212;and with what the developers wrongly viewed as a passive and compliant community, the area ticked many investment boxes and the first application was quickly followed by two applications for extensions and a raft of applications from other developers on nearby sites. Today, there are 15 applications for more than 250 turbines running the length of the county border from North Lanarkshire through West Lothian to the north Pentlands and Edinburgh&#8217;s south-westerly fringe.</p><p>Despite what the guidance says, the cumulative impact on the landscape appears not to be a priority consideration. Instead, what is happening is unco-ordinated, unplanned and incoherent and resembles the prospecting days of the American gold rush, with landowners hawking their land for rental and developers seeing shiny treasure in the form of subsidies from renewables obligation certificates and feed-in tariffs. Local authorities with little expertise in wind energy have been swamped by application after application, but have no co-ordinated regional or national spatial plan identifying preferred areas; indeed, some do not have even a local spatial plan. Crucially, there is no test of landscape capacity on which to base an assessment. The current guidance is weak and has not been applied rigorously enough. Scottish Natural Heritage&#8217;s landscape character assessment and landscape capacity guidance states:</p><p>&#8220;The cumulative effect of inappropriately sited multiple wind farm development could ... create the perception of a landscape dominated by wind farms&#8221;.</p><p>That is exactly what is happening now.</p><p>National spatial planning and a capacity test would give communities some protection from overconcentration and the industry some confidence about where to invest. Both the community and the industry want this approach. The 2010 good practice wind project was set up to develop good practice in reconciling the objectives of renewable energy with wider environmental objectives and promoting communities&#8217; active involvement in planning and implementation. That seems to me to be a recognition that communities have not been genuinely involved.</p><p>How are our communities being affected? My experience over the past 10 years suggests that the current laissez-faire approach is ostracising people. People who were previously evangelical about the benefits of wind energy have become organised, vocal and ardent opponents of further development. If that one issue&#8212;overconcentration in certain locations&#8212;is not addressed urgently and sensitively, opposition to the Scottish Government&#8217;s drive for more land-based wind energy generation will increase, the whole strategy will unravel and the public will turn against it. If the minister takes nothing else from today&#8217;s debate, I ask him please to listen to communities on that specific issue.</p><p>There are serious questions in relation to equality-of-arms issues and environmental justice. I do not have time to go into those in detail, but they are significant issues.</p><p>Ownership and funding require discussion. The development of wind farms is dominated by multinationals and venture capital firms that see Scotland&#8217;s wind as their latest commodity, and will do whatever it takes, including trampling over the concerns of communities, to take advantage of the significant profits that are open to them. Those companies often set up small localised companies as a front for their projects or as a conduit to secure planning permission before buying up the consented site. Community benefit schemes exist, but the sums involved are a drop in the ocean compared to the money that is being made by the French, Italian, Spanish and Danish giants that dominate the scene. A robust community benefit strategy could result in cash, as well as electricity, being generated for communities and public services.</p><p>The &#163;70&#160;million national renewables infrastructure plan gives cash to promote private sector investment in renewables. In effect, it is another subsidy. Contrast that with the paltry &#163;5.35&#160;million in loans&#8212;not grants&#8212;that is being provided for community and co-operative renewables schemes. I believe that that massive imbalance is a real missed opportunity. If communities were in control or in genuine partnership, they would be more involved and would have more ownership of projects.</p><p>There are serious concerns about the current renewables policy; we need only look to the public gallery to see that. I am sure that all the people are here not to listen to my sparkling rhetoric, but because they are concerned about their communities. We need a policy that places communities at the heart of the renewables drive, with a national spatial plan that avoids overconcentration and results in the local host communities enjoying the benefits.</p><p>I thank the members who supported my motion&#8212;those of my party and Margo MacDonald, Mary Scanlon, Alex Fergusson and Jim Hume.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656502", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wind Farms (Impact on Communities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Given that energy provision is critical to local, national and international development, I am very pleased to be able to introduce what is a much-needed debate.

We want our children and grandchildren to live happily without fear of environmental decline. I appreciate the work of Scottish Governments past and present and the previous UK Labour Government in recognising and then setting in place the foundations to take forward the greening of our society and economy. However, as with all policies, green or otherwise, how we achieve things and the devil in the detail matter as much as the lofty ambitions that are set out in Government publications, such as those that we saw yesterday.</p><p>After the spending review announcement, I would like the minister to give some clarifications. Just how much has been allocated to renewables? The Government says that it will provide &#163;200 million over the next three years to support the sector, but what is that money to do, who is it for and who can access it? I hope that the minister will clarify those points in summing up.</p><p>I have two main issues to raise. First, I want a green economy, but we must ensure that the benefits and burdens of creating a low-carbon economy are shared across Scotland and that we have real fairness and equality, not a facade of fairness, equality and distribution. Secondly, I would like to raise concerns about community inclusion or, to be more accurate, community exclusion, which is resulting in communities across Scotland that were once pro renewables becoming vocal opponents, particularly of onshore wind energy schemes. Up and down the country, more and more people are left feeling that their concerns have been ignored by local government and national Government and that the interests of big business are being prioritised over those of communities.</p><p>The draft budget emphasises the levering of private investment into the renewables sector. The private sector will have a significant role to play. However, when referring to the Crown estate yesterday, Mr Swinney said that he wished to see the Scottish Parliament</p><p>&#8220;take on responsibility for the Crown estate, so that the resources that are generated in Scotland can stay in Scotland for the benefit of our communities&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 21 September 2011; c 1919.]</p><p>I hope that he will take that approach with renewables, too.</p><p>Mr Swinney has allocated &#163;70 million to a national renewables infrastructure plan. Is that part of the &#163;200 million or is it additional money? It is apparently designed to attract the private sector. Again, where is the detail? How does he intend to achieve that and, fundamentally, is that approach the right one?</p><p>Over the next few decades, hundreds of millions&#8212;probably even billions&#8212;of pounds will be made from renewables, yet we subsidise multinationals and private equity firms to make those millions. The profits are often sent off to the boardrooms of Europe&#8212;Madrid, Amsterdam or wherever&#8212;while offering relatively few crumbs in community benefit to local people. In relation to onshore wind, press reports this week informed us:</p><p>&#8220;Two thirds of wind turbines in Britain are owned by foreign firms&#8212;netting them millions of pounds in taxpayer-funded subsidies.&#8221;</p><p>When I look at the ownership of wind farms in Scotland, I do not quite see, as Mr Swinney would say, resources being</p><p>&#8220;generated in Scotland&#8221;</p><p>staying</p><p>&#8220;in Scotland for the benefit of our communities&#8221;.</p><p>There is a commitment to increase community renewables to a target of 500MW by 2020. That is admirable but, with the emphasis on seeking private sector investment for major schemes rather than local, public schemes, how exactly is that to be achieved?</p><p>With the right political choices, there could be huge opportunities for household, co-operative, local authority and public estate schemes. Pursuing community, publicly owned schemes would help to provide revenue streams for cash-strapped local authorities, housing associations and social enterprises in the third sector and for the national health service. In fact, the possibilities are endless. We could and should assist social enterprises and public sector organisations into the energy and renewables sector. In photovoltaics, for example, they could provide the equipment, the tenant or resident would get the cheap electricity, and the excess cash generated through the feed-in tariff would fund further development or indeed other activities. We have a chance to share the benefits of renewables throughout Scotland, but I fear that we may be witnessing a missed opportunity.</p><p>As far as public estates are concerned, there are renewables opportunities in the forestry estate and the estate of Scottish Water. &#8220;Building a Hydro Nation&#8221; sets out a grand vision for Scottish Water to develop a renewables capacity, yet only yesterday in the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee we heard Scottish Water tell us that it does not have the funds to do that. In fact, we saw in the budget a cut to Scottish Water&#8217;s promised loans to deliver just its core activities.</p><p>On onshore wind, I make a genuine appeal to Scottish ministers. The overconcentration of multiple wind farm applications in specific geographical locations is causing great concern. From the border between Lanarkshire and West Lothian through to Edinburgh, there are approximately 15 different wind energy developments, with more than 300 turbines planned. In some localities, such as Harburn, residents feel under siege. The people I am talking about are not nimbys. They are good people, who will take their fair share of anything, but they feel that there is a genuine unfairness with the current approach, which resembles a free-for-all.</p><p>I met the minister last week on that very issue. I have spoken to members of all parties and know that many of them share my concern. We urgently need a national spatial plan that prevents the overconcentration of wind farms and spreads the burden and the benefit. I ask members who feel that the issue may not affect them to look at Scottish Natural Heritage&#8217;s website and its wind farm map for Scotland, because this is coming to an area near them.</p><p>I support a low-carbon economy, but there are a great deal of difficulties that we have to overcome.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651783", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Low-carbon Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I hope that you will forgive me if I have to leave in the middle of my speech, but I took a nosebleed when I came into the chamber&#8212;no George Osborne jokes, please.

His education secretary tried that approach in the college sector only to be forced to admit soon after the election that he could not deliver it. We all know people who are being or have been made redundant. If a person&#8217;s job as a nurse, housing officer or classroom assistant, say, is deemed by their employer to be surplus to requirements, but they do not want to leave and the only option for them is be ushered out of the door with a severance package with no option of remaining in the job, that is a compulsory redundancy situation in anybody&#8217;s book.</p><p>Hundreds of jobs have already gone in my local authority in West Lothian. Some 400 nurses are to go in NHS Lothian, and jobs are going in police support, the fire service and, indeed, throughout the public sector. If the First Minister is genuine about a no compulsory redundancies policy across the public sector, let this Parliament legislate for it. While he is at it, he could introduce legislation on a living wage for the public sector. Let it be written into contracts given to the private sector, too. We should start in this very building. It is a disgrace that some of the contracted staff who work here every day, such as contract cleaning staff, are being paid below the living wage and do not get any more than statutory sick pay when they are off ill.

I have been involved with the subject of the debate and in the there is a better way campaign for some months in my home area of West Lothian.</p><p>There are two reasons for my involvement in the campaign: I am sickened by the cuts agenda and the consequences for our people and society, and I believe that there is an alternative to the mad, careless and callous rush to acceptance of neo-liberal orthodoxy. The cuts that we are witnessing are as unprecedented as they are unnecessary. Many economists around the globe categorically reject the argument that the cuts were needed to soothe market conditions, and the evidence clearly shows that there was no prospect of the UK&#8217;s credit rating being downgraded. The internationally recognised economist and professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, Barry Eichengreen, was right when he said that the current breed of cuts-obsessed politicians are</p><p>&#8220;simply intent on cutting ... for ideological reasons&#8221;.</p><p>Clegg&#8217;s and Cameron&#8217;s Cabinet of millionaires does not have a clue about what it is like to live on less than the living wage or to have to choose between spending money on food or kids&#8217; clothes. It makes me want to puke when I hear Osborne and his Bullingdon club chums lecturing us about the big society. We know that volunteers in projects in Blackburn, Addiewell, Pilton, Mayfield and Leith are working themselves to the bone to protect people from the worst of Osborne&#8217;s cuts.</p><p>Those who caused the crisis in the first place are conveniently forgotten in all of this. The bankers and speculators are not punished, and they continue to cash their fat bonus cheques. The cuts are punishing those who had nothing to do with the crash. It was not public sector workers who speculated on derivatives or caused the crash through irresponsible lending; it was the city geniuses, who we apparently cannot live without and are, as we all know, about to embark on the money-making merry-go-round once again.</p><p>My support for the there is a better way campaign was not born simply of a principled objection to the cuts; it also comes from a belief that there is an alternative and better way to deal with the deficit and to build and create a better society. We should be tackling the massive levels of tax avoidance and evasion. Even Mr Gavin Brown&#8217;s party has estimated that it brings losses of &#163;40&#160;billion a year. If that party says that there are losses of &#163;40&#160;billion, we can be guaranteed that the figure is many times more than that. If we tackled tax avoidance and evasion, we could maintain and even expand our public services while we reduced the deficit. I say to Mr Brown that, instead of appointing a notorious tax avoider&#8212;Philip Green&#8212;to advise the Government on how best to slash public spending, perhaps the Government should be collecting the &#163;285&#160;million that he and his wife owe the public purse.

The big question is not so much whether we should have those powers as what we should do with them.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I am sure that you, like me, are experiencing d&#233;j&#224; vu. Once upon a time, the SNP opted out of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. Then, when it saw the way the wind was blowing, it jumped on board the devolutionary train and claimed to be the champion of a Scottish Parliament. Fast-forwarding two decades, we witness the SNP, having once again opted out of the Calman commission and dismissing it as a waste of time, now popping up as the great champion of the commission&#8217;s product: the Scotland Bill.</p><p>A clear pattern emerges. The SNP and the First Minister act like petulant children, refusing to play with anyone else, and then they realise that the game is actually quite good and not only try to join it but try to claim that it was their idea in the first place and try to change the rules. However, I am not one to hold grudges; as a God-fearing man, I will always welcome a repentant sinner back to the fold. Let us hope that, after two major constitutional opt-outs, the SNP has learned from its mistakes.</p><p>The main question in the debate is not whether we have borrowing powers but what we are borrowing for. If we are borrowing to pay for infrastructure projects, including, for example, repairing our crumbling roads, and new transport and housing projects that will employ large numbers of people, count me in; if it is to create real apprenticeships in construction and civil engineering, count me in; and if it is to be used in projects to pay people a decent wage, count me in. My support is based not only on the need to create a better and fairer society but on evidence that progressive taxation and Government investment help to boost demand and strengthen the economy. We have seen that in Norway, Germany and other countries; indeed, the UK stimulus package in November 2008 helped to reduce the deficit as a percentage of GDP and in real cash terms.</p><p>The First Minister recently met the Tory big beasts; today, he meets the Lib Dem kitten. However, I suspect that he made or will make no effort to challenge either on the corporation tax evaders who, depending on who we listen to, pilfer between &#163;40 billion and &#163;120 billion per annum. Those are incredible figures. If that money were recouped, as it should be, and if there were a parallel increase in taxation for individuals and corporations able to pay more, what would be the impact on our economy and society? Prioritising tackling tax avoidance and evasion would stimulate the economy as we would be able to borrow more, invest that money in our communities and pay it back through increased tax receipts.</p><p>However, the SNP is now talking about cutting corporation tax. Instead of tackling the tax avoiders, it wants to cut tax revenues even further.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648395", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill: Borrowing Powers and Growing the Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I put on record my commitment to the principle that the Parliament should have borrowing powers.

Over the past 18 years of my life, as a housing official, a teacher and a councillor, I have witnessed the vital role that good public services play in maintaining and developing a civilised and caring society. Today, the public services that we know and treasure, and which we often take for granted, are in imminent danger as a result of the bankers&#8217; recklessness and greed. Spending cuts are attacking living standards, leaving our most vulnerable people at risk, causing widespread unemployment and damaging educational opportunities.</p><p>I know that I do not look it, but I am old enough to remember the impact of the last Tory Westminster Government. In my home area of West Lothian, following the closure of Polkemmet pit and British Leyland, there were places where unemployment reached 26 per cent&#8212;what a shocking and scandalous waste of human talent. Communities were victimised and torn apart as the Tories took revenge on the National Union of Mineworkers and closed steel plants, car factories and the bulk of our manufacturing sector.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, our young people are in the firing line again. They are being denied access to training, apprenticeships and real jobs. West Lothian currently languishes near the bottom end of the national scale in providing positive destinations for our school leavers. We have to do better&#8212;we have to give people hope. That will happen, but it can do so only if we invest in our communities, our public services and those young people.</p><p>Earlier this year, I joined a million people in London at the Trades Union Congress march against the coalition&#8217;s cuts. With my colleagues in the West Lothian TUC, I have been active in driving forward the Scottish Trades Union Congress&#8217;s there is a better way campaign. I fully intend to continue that campaign inside and outside Parliament. [Interruption.] I suggest to the Scottish Government that if it genuinely wants to work in the interests of the Scottish people and create a consensus around a sound future for our economy and social justice in our society, it should take a lead from that campaign. [Interruption.] For example, we should stop bleeding the public sector. It is public servants, teachers, nurses, classroom assistants and refuse collectors who deliver the essential public services that make our society a decent one. How can the Scottish Government defend public services when it is committed to a five-year council tax freeze with no prospect of reform of that tax on the horizon? I was amused by Mr Swinney&#8217;s phrase</p><p>&#8220;the success of the Scottish Futures Trust&#8221;</p><p>&#8212;not really words that should be in the same sentence.</p><p>We should introduce a living wage of &#163;7.15 per hour, not just in the Scottish Government but in local government, just as Glasgow City Council has done, and we should be evangelical about convincing the private sector to do similar.</p><p>We should highlight Scottish companies that are involved in the global scandal of corporate tax evasion. We should support the proposal for a Robin Hood tax on useless speculation and we should promote regulation for the public good.</p><p>We should have a genuine national investment bank that is able to support job creation and not here-today-gone-tomorrow chancers. We should promote workers&#8217; rights and trade union reforms and stop union derecognition such as that which is happening in the higher education sector.</p><p>We need to make social and economic equality an objective of government and have independent monitoring of progress towards that aim.</p><p>We should invest in the green economy&#8212;not just renewables but all the other opportunities that are presented by that agenda&#8212;and we should have a high wage commission to consider excessive pay and the big bonus culture that has destroyed the reputation of our once-respected financial institutions.</p><p>The debate is called &#8220;Taking Scotland Forward&#8221;. I, for one, sign up to that sentiment 100 per cent. I am a socialist, and no one can be a socialist and a pessimist. Therefore, I am optimistic that we can take Scotland forward. However, that will not happen with an agenda that cuts our valued public services and accepts privatisation&#8212;the public bad, private good argument&#8212;and does nothing to address poverty pay, poor working conditions and the lack of opportunities for our young people.</p><p>To take Scotland forward, the Parliament must defend our vitally important public services.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like many new members, I begin by saying that it is a great honour and privilege to serve in our national Parliament, representing such a vibrant and diverse region as the Lothians, which&#8212;from the warmth and solidarity of the people in the ex-mining communities of West Lothian and Midlothian to the beauty and splendour of Edinburgh&#8212;is a fantastic place to live and work.
