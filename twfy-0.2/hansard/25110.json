Before Glasgow takes over the baton, Strathclyde park will get its place in the spotlight as millions watch the triathlon, which is surely one of the most demanding events as it involves a combination of three very different and difficult sports. It starts with a 1.5km swim, followed by a 40km cycle race, and the final section is a 10km run. It is a true test of stamina and therefore a very fitting event with which to kick off the Commonwealth games.</p><p>Also on 26 July, for the first time at the Commonwealth games, there will be a mixed relay event, with teams of two men and two women undertaking individual sprint triathlons in succession. In addition, North Lanarkshire Council will host the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s cycling time trial on Thursday 31 July, which will take place in the northern corridor around Stepps, Muirhead, Chryston and Auchinloch. My best wishes go to all our Scottish athletes, all the visiting athletes and to everyone who will be volunteering and supporting the games. As the triathlon is the first event</p><p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s in the constituency too&#8221;,</p><p>to use the words of Alan Jackson&#8217;s poem on the wall outside the Parliament, I am sure that it will be watched by many millions across the Commonwealth and throughout the world.</p><p>The 2014 Commonwealth games will give us opportunities. The events that will take place in North Lanarkshire will be a great opportunity to boost the local economy during the games and will provide a superb opportunity to showcase Motherwell and Wishaw, and North Lanarkshire and to say to the world: &#8220;Here we are&#8212;a good place to visit, a good place to stay and a good place to do business.&#8221; It is also an opportunity to display Scotland at its best on the international stage if we can just agree not to use it as a stage for internal politics.</p><p>There is the potential to reap social and health benefits from the games as well as economic ones. We now have stagnation and decline in sporting participation rates, but the games can and should provide a focus to reboot the improvement that we achieved in that regard in the early years of the Scottish Parliament. Sport can be a catalyst for health improvement and social change, which is particularly important in areas of high deprivation, where sporting participation is often stubbornly low. To tap and capture for the future the enthusiasm and passion, and the full potential and success of the games, the Scottish Government&#8212;current and future&#8212;will need to deliver and guarantee concerted effort to extend sporting involvement at all levels.</p><p>The opportunities that are presented by the games have clearly been recognised by North Lanarkshire Council, which so far has invested &#163;2.2&#160;million across various locations, with additional confirmed funding from the Scottish Government of over &#163;600,000. I understand that a further &#163;103,000 of funding is under consideration. I hope that the minister will be able to confirm as soon as possible&#8212;perhaps even today&#8212;that that additional support is being made available.</p><p>North Lanarkshire is also organising a variety of activities, including cultural and sporting events. It is helping with additional volunteers and publicity and branding, getting business involved and&#8212;not least&#8212;working to maximise the legacy of the games. That legacy ranges from the global exposure that the games will bring and the experience that is gained from staging the event, to more tangible legacies, such as an improved road and footpath network, improved cabling infrastructure in Strathclyde park and the potential to re-use the barrier system in the loch there to ensure water quality in the future.</p><p>There will be television viewers around the world, and North Lanarkshire Council will also play mine host to many thousands of visitors from across the Commonwealth nations. I know that they will get a warm welcome from local people, which will, I hope, be matched by the weather.</p><p>Like my constituents, I am looking forward to the games. I suspect that we will find it difficult not to imagine that the sun will be shining.

The shortcomings of the process were such that the committee decided not to recommend support for that part of the LCM. Shakti, Hemat Gryffe and Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid expressed doubts about whether criminalisation would have any significant impact on either awareness or the strength of the message that forced marriage was not acceptable. They also questioned whether there was any need for such a legislative change on the ground that it could be counterproductive to create a criminal offence that deters reporting in a way that the current civil provision for forced marriage protection orders does not. Victims could be put off seeking protection orders and annulments because of their reluctance to see their families criminalised. Indeed, that was the conclusion that was reached when the matter was considered previously. However, despite such reservations, a strong case was made to support the LCM on the grounds of international obligations and consistency of approach with the rest of the UK.</p><p>On consistency, I have to say that opinion on sentencing was divided. Originally, a maximum sentence of two years was specified, which is in line with sentences for similar offences under Scots law. However, in December, the minister revised that to seven years, to match sentencing in England and Wales.</p><p>One problem that we had was the lack of evidence. The minister and Scottish Government officials acknowledged the clear need for more research and said that they would undertake research on the effectiveness of criminalisation. Unfortunately, the fact that that will be done retrospectively leaves them open to suspicions that it will be used to justify their actions. What will ministers do to guarantee the independence of such research?</p><p>The availability of both civil and criminal remedies creates other complications. Victims who have instigated civil proceedings might find that they are suspended if criminal charges are brought. The Scottish Government needs to address the interaction of civil and criminal proceedings and to ensure that the best interests of victims are central to such considerations.</p><p>Such shortcomings highlight the folly of bringing forward legislation in this area without proper consultation. It would have been better for the Scottish Government to instigate research and consultation earlier, instead of being dragged along on the shirt tails of UK legislation, and to develop and introduce properly researched Scottish legislation after full consultation.</p><p>However, that did not happen and now the LCM, despite its lack of credibility, seems to be the only option on offer if we are to meet our international obligations.

However, it can enable an addict to stabilise their addiction and begin to rebuild their life. As well as making their addiction more manageable, methadone treatment is safer than taking drugs of unknown origin and strength, which may also involve sharing syringes and needles, with the risk of contracting hepatitis and HIV.</p><p>Methadone treatment is sometimes criticised by the media or by members of the public who think that more should be done to cure addiction through abstinence. I understand that that alternative is used in some countries, including Russia&#8212;Willie Rennie mentioned that&#8212;but for many users, withdrawal is easier said than done. There may be adverse physiological and psychological consequences; that is the nature of addiction. For that reason, opiate replacement therapies have long been essential harm-reduction measures; that role was endorsed five years ago by the road to recovery strategy.</p><p>However, despite the apparent consensus, the evidence is not clear-cut. The expert review recognises that there are issues with the evidence that is available and quotes the 2012 UK drug policy commission:</p><p>&#8220;Drug policy is currently a mix of cautious politics and limited evidence and analysis. This is coupled with strident and contested interpretations, both of the causes of problems and the effects of policies. In fact, for as long as there has been a drug policy, there have been gaps in the evidence as well as uncertainty about how to understand and act on the evidence that we do have.&#8221;</p><p>In that context, I am pleased that the review not only dealt with the many people who are involved in delivering and receiving a variety of treatments, but accorded their views and experiences equal status with those of local and national bodies. If we are to develop an effective person-centred approach to opioid addiction, it is essential that such evidence is a significant part of our consideration of what will be the best way forward.</p><p>One aspect that has been made clear by such stakeholder input is that some alcohol and drug partnerships perform poorly when it comes to recovery. The report notes:</p><p>&#8220;There was little evidence presented by some ADPs regarding a real impetus towards recovery. Stakeholder reports supported this view.&#8221;</p><p>The review highlights that basic information was not often accessible, and that</p><p>&#8220;Clear strategic plans and objective reports of improvement were rare ... Elements of recovery orientated services were often absent.&#8221;</p><p>It also stated that</p><p>&#8220;There was not a strong sense of accountability ... systems are destined to continue repeating mistakes or failing to capitalise on successes.&#8221;</p><p>Those views add up to quite a damning indictment.</p><p>Addicts who are motivated to stop are unlikely to succeed without the right help and support&#8212;not only for the initial period of withdrawal, but for the longer term. However, that help must address the circumstances that contribute to drug addiction and the relationship between drug taking and criminal behaviour. I welcome the review&#8217;s consideration of those issues and its findings, which seek a more consistent approach that focuses on recovery as a primary aim.</p><p>The review recommends that a full range of care services be available in every area, including community rehabilitation services such as detoxification, residential rehabilitation, and services that deal with employability and housing. It also recommends development of better ways to link action on health inequalities with action to address problem substance misuse. One key measure would be to ensure that local inequalities strategies refer to plans to address the risks that are associated with substance misuse.</p><p>Drug treatment and testing orders have an important role to play in respect of drug-related crime.

That consensus not only applies in the Parliament; it applies among many who submitted their views and gave evidence. There were criticisms, but those had a sympathetic reception from the committee, which is keen to see them addressed as the bill progresses.</p><p>The advantages of reform of tribunals were acknowledged&#8212;those include greater economies of scale and sharing of good practice and resources&#8212;but there was also a strong desire to retain the special support and knowledge that are embodied in the current arrangements. Basically, we do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water. We want to keep the lay involvement, the less adversarial approach and the simpler and relatively informal user-centred nature of existing tribunals. I hope that those principles will be made explicit in the bill, with the fundamental characteristics of tribunals set out in it.</p><p>It was also felt to be important that the bill be drafted in such a way that reserved tribunals could be brought into the structure at a later date.</p><p>The Law Society of Scotland welcomes the bill, but has expressed concern about judicialisation of tribunals eroding their character. I agree that there is a danger that judicial members who would be appointed under the legislation would not understand the informality or the centrality of the user in the tribunal process. The committee has asked the Scottish Government to consider what additional safeguards can be included to avoid that. In particular, there must be a direction in the bill that the president&#8217;s discretion on appointments should be used to ensure that judicial members have the necessary expertise and understanding of the tribunal and its context.</p><p>Although many submissions suggested ways to improve the bill to protect the characters of the tribunals, some people were not convinced that that is possible. The Lands Tribunal for Scotland questioned the efficiency of the approach, and whether it would be able to adapt&#8212;without creating significant problems&#8212;to the one-size-fits-all structure. It put its case strongly, and the committee was persuaded to urge the Scottish Government to think again about its inclusion. The valuation appeals committee was also concerned about the impact of imposing age limits, which would see over half of its membership lost.</p><p>The Mental Health Tribunal also has unique characteristics, and there is support for its being retained in a chamber of its own. However, the worry is that that would be a temporary measure by the Scottish Government, so there must be long-term commitment to that arrangement for that tribunal.</p><p>The other big area in which reassurances are sought is the children&#8217;s hearing system. It has already been subjected to reform, which adds to the need for care when we are considering further change. It is important that regulations in respect of the children&#8217;s hearings system be laid under the affirmative procedure in order to ensure that there is adequate consultation and parliamentary consideration of proposals.</p><p>There are also various concerns about costs. Although we recognise that there is the potential to save money through elimination of duplication and adoption of common administrative and other resources, there will be costs involved in the transition. Long-term savings are one thing, but we should not risk being unsuccessful by trying to make the transition on the cheap.</p><p>Fees and charges are also important, as recent controversy over fees for the reserved employment tribunals has highlighted. Some devolved tribunals also have charges and fees. Therefore, provision for them has been included in the bill, but it is important to ensure that that does not open the door to new charges being imposed where none previously existed, and that it does not become a platform for significant increases in existing charges. The committee proposes that any such charges be subject to consultation of users and stakeholders.</p><p>Another issue that needs to be addressed is the enforceability of tribunals&#8217; awards. More than 50 per cent of awards are not paid, or are not paid in full. As part of our discussions, we should consider how to address that.</p><p>Although I was not a member of the Justice Committee at the time, I spoke in the debate on the matter last year. I said that I was in favour of reducing overlap and eliminating duplication as long as the overlap and duplication are genuine and their elimination does not involve putting square pegs into round holes. We have had the consultation and the committee has considered the bill. My view is that such a reduction is the intention of the bill, but work remains to be done to ensure that it achieves that in practice.</p><p>I am content to support the bill at stage 1, but with my fellow committee members, I will look for significant improvements to be introduced at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22732166", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunals (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Sometimes it takes weeks to hear repetition in the chamber, but when it does we tend to think, &#8220;Oh, no!

Hundreds of staff posts have been axed, and now police accessibility is under attack. The public&#8212;our constituents&#8212;are being pushed towards using centralised call centres, instead of being able to visit a local station.

The basic objectives of the act&#8212;to provide a balance between, on one hand, public protection and, on the other, rehabilitation and reducing reoffending&#8212;remain desirable, but social and legal changes have rendered the act less effective and have possibly made it counterproductive. For example, employers are now much more likely to inquire about criminal records. In addition, the fact that we have longer sentences means that there are more sentences of longer than 30 months that are never spent.</p><p>There are several areas in which change could be made to create a more focused rehabilitation regime in prisons, with better education, work and training, and drug rehabilitation; more measured and effective treatment of ex-offenders that will benefit them and the general public through reduced offending; and a more consistent approach throughout the process of rehabilitation. Contentious though it might be, I welcome the consultation that is taking place, which I hope will help us to address those matters.</p><p>It is estimated that at least a third of all adult males have a conviction and that nearly one in 10 women has a criminal record. There has been an increase in the number of professions and situations that are exempt from the provisions of the 1974 act. Given that 1 million applications for basic disclosure checks are made every year in Scotland, having a criminal record of any sort is clearly a major issue that could affect a person&#8217;s chances of securing employment. Although disclosure is an essential safeguard that was introduced to protect vulnerable groups against certain categories of offenders, it facilitates discrimination against offenders in other categories.</p><p>As a study by the Scottish centre for crime and justice research at the University of Glasgow highlights, surveys of employers and ex-offenders show that there is frequent bias against those with criminal records, which impedes their rehabilitation and reintegration into society and the jobs market. Having a criminal record also affects someone&#8217;s access to education and training, volunteering and financial arrangements such as bank accounts and insurance. Significantly, exclusion from such things can increase the likelihood of reoffending</p><p>Studies suggest that the risk of recidivism decreases greatly within the rehabilitation periods of the 1974 act and that there is a strong correlation between employment and reduced reoffending. That makes sense, because employment provides financial and social stability. It also turns on its head the argument about public protection versus rehabilitation, because in many cases rehabilitation through employment is the best way to ensure public protection from reoffending. Some employers know that and those who have hired ex-offenders are often enthusiastic about doing so in the future, but they are not the norm.</p><p>What do we do about that? Other countries have a variety of arrangements. The consultation document summarises them, using the summary from the SCCJR paper. However, I note that it leaves out the paper&#8217;s health warning that it describes only the stated laws and policies and not how things work in practice. What we see abroad is that rehabilitation periods, where they exist, range from six months to 20 years, according to age, sentence type and sentence length. Unlike the UK, most countries do not restrict the offences that are eligible for rehabilitation by sentence length, and some completely destroy the criminal record once it is spent.</p><p>The SCCJR study suggests three options: modification of the rehabilitation periods; providing a certificate of rehabilitation; and making exclusion specific to certain jobs. Changing rehabilitation periods would help, but it is a broad-brush approach and therefore something of a compromise. The certificate is an interesting idea that I believe should be explored further. It could be tied into more productive rehabilitation activity in prison, where at the moment there is little distinction between time spent playing football and time spent attending education classes. That is perhaps why the former is 10 times more popular than the latter.</p><p>The third suggestion has much to recommend it, although it would require a much more sophisticated scheme of administration, because whole professions are excluded from the 1974 act. There could be much more differentiation of offences. Offenders who undertake community service with vulnerable groups can be subsequently excluded from any employment involving those groups. Surely there is scope for better assessment of risk.</p><p>The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 came from a private member&#8217;s bill that was heavily criticised and extensively amended, which made it complicated and sometimes difficult to interpret. Its simplification therefore seems an attractive alternative, but better still would be well-thought-out legislation that addresses the complexity of the issues that need to be tackled. We need a clear framework for the rehabilitation of offenders, but it needs to be flexible enough to be applied appropriately to a wide variety of circumstances.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Christine Grahame said, repetition could well be the norm for much of the debate.

Corroboration is frequently an obstacle to conviction for rape and attempted rape. Strong evidence can be rendered unusable.

However, statistics are rarely as straightforward as the people who use them would have us believe.

For starters, there is the issue of how to compile the list of eligible voters without compromising the personal data of those who are not yet old enough to vote. However, with a can-do attitude, such difficulties are not insurmountable.</p><p>There are other complications. We want people from Scotland who are serving abroad in the UK&#8217;s armed forces and families who are with them, including 16 and 17-year-olds, to be able to vote.

It was highlighted during that debate that many people were put on the blacklist because they dared to question unsafe practices that threatened workers&#8217; lives and wellbeing.</p><p>Between the two debates, we have had the May day international workers day, when we celebrate the strength of the labour movement. We therefore have good cause to look at the victimisation of those who raise concerns about safety, to highlight the links between poor health and safety and the lack of unionisation in the workplace, to talk about people who have lost their jobs and livelihoods because they tried to do something about the situation and to examine what we can do, the policies that we can adopt and the action that we can take to ensure that such victimisation is not tolerated in a society that cares about its workers&#8217; safety and wellbeing.</p><p>Many of those on the blacklist were employed&#8212;or, to be more accurate, denied employment&#8212;in the construction industry. This is an industry that has one of the worst health and safety records outside agriculture; which, like agriculture, is notoriously anti-union; and in which people have been sacked and even charged with conspiracy for attempting to organise. The list of subscribers to the Consulting Association reads like a &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who&#8221; of the construction industry; as Neil Findlay has already pointed out, although some are no longer members, the damage has been done.</p><p>We all know that people who challenge unsafe practices and organise a workforce to fight against dangerous working conditions should be heroes, but the big construction companies try to make them zeroes by operating a blacklist. What can we do to protect them and encourage good practice? The ICO might have busted the Consulting Association but, in its own words,</p><p>&#8220;compiling and operating an intelligence database, even where this is done covertly, does not automatically breach the Data Protection Act.&#8221;</p><p>That means that anyone who is determined enough can still operate.</p><p>The way forward has been set out and we must start with central and local government&#8217;s dealings with construction companies. Should we be giving contracts to those that have poor health and safety records and which victimise trade unionists? Indeed, it has been suggested that that should be added to the ethical criteria for procurement. Moreover, the fact that bad health and safety has consequences for society and puts a burden on health and other services is an economic criterion that should be taken into account.</p><p>As Roz Foyer from Unite and the blacklist support group said just over an hour ago, there needs to be no more rhetoric and no more hypocrisy.

It was reported a couple of years ago that 30,000 pigs had floated down the Dawson river in Australia. The following day&#8217;s Morning Bulletin newspaper explained that the piggery owner actually said to the reporter that there were 30 sows and pigs. That must be one of the few occasions on which the correction got wider coverage than the original report.</p><p>I highlight that as an example, but the victims of misreporting usually struggle to get corrections, and when they do, they are very lucky if the correction gets anything like equal prominence.</p><p>Most printed stories used to have a relatively short lifespan, but the internet means that misreporting can persist for a long time. It can be thrown up in search results often without any link to a subsequent correction, let alone a correction made or added to the original article. The damage that is done to people&#8217;s reputations and health cannot easily be undone. The rich can seek financial reparation but not many people have enough money to sue the media.</p><p>That is why we need a better system that insists on matters being put to right. Voluntary codes have repeatedly been shown not to be enough. The situation has been reviewed countless times&#8212;about once a decade for the past 70 years. A Press Complaints Commission that is stacked with newspaper people and appointments that the press has the power to veto will never make the grade. We need a system that is independent of Government and free from media interference, that speaks up for people who have been badly treated, and that has the power to address the injustices caused by people&#8217;s treatment by the press. We need a system that can regulate press conduct and make a difference when the press crosses the line, that protects people from prurient invasion of privacy, and that can differentiate between issues in which the public has a legitimate interest and those that should be the personal preserve of people who are in the public spotlight. We need a system that values accuracy and can adequately address inaccurate reporting.</p><p>We do not want a system that threatens the freedom of the press. For example, the regulator will not have the power to block publication. Our press should have nothing to fear from a good regulatory system.</p><p>Newspapers that sign up with the regulator will gain advantage from the terms of legal costs, and claims could be dismissed on the grounds that the claim was frivolous or vexatious, or on other, legitimate grounds. That should help to restore newspapers&#8217; somewhat tarnished reputation so that they can become the purveyors of reliable, factual content that has been obtained in the public interest through principled investigative means. It could be argued that they have often fallen short of an ideal that was generally more of a myth than a reality; nevertheless, it is an ideal to which some have aspired and to which all should aspire.</p><p>Despite that, we know that the press is still not keen, and why should it be when its excesses led to the proposals and are now being reined in? We need a UK solution. Most members of the press are owned by companies that operate across the UK, and many publications cover the whole UK. Even those that print only local editions have online editions that transcend national boundaries.</p><p>In seeking consistency of approach, it has been recognised that various aspects of Scotland&#8217;s law and institutions need to be taken into account. However, as was stated to the Education and Culture Committee, such issues could be addressed by a relatively small number of largely technical amendments.</p><p>I welcome the motion and hope that it will put an end to the days when the empires of Murdoch and other media moguls could ignore the rule of law and common decency.

I also welcome Bill Kidd&#8217;s motion, and his sponsorship of the hazards exhibition.</p><p>I was moved to read the poem &#8220;Empty Shoes&#8221; by health and safety campaigner Wendy Lawrence, which starts:</p><p>&#8220;No more footsteps on the path as you come home</p><p>I just sit here with my grief&#8212;so all alone</p><p>No key is turned by you in our front door</p><p>No sound of walking to me across our floor</p><p>I've cried so much my eyes are red and sore</p><p>Empty shoes, no more you&#8212;just empty shoes.&#8221;</p><p>Wendy wrote that after reading about yet another avoidable death that had been caused by work. That spurred me to organise the exhibit that will be on display in the public lobby from today until next week&#8217;s debate on blacklisting&#8212;many people who are blacklisted have merely raised health and safety concerns. We all know that statistics do not have the same emotional power as poems do to describe the depth of grief that is suffered by the families and friends of victims. However, they show the enormity of the issue.</p><p>The International Labour Organization estimates that, globally, one worker dies every 15 seconds, that more than 2.3&#160;million deaths a year are due to occupational accidents or diseases, that 160&#160;million workers suffer work-related illnesses and that more than 300&#160;million people are injured in workplace accidents. For the economists, that adds up to 4 per cent of global gross domestic product lost at a cost of &#163;1&#160;trillion.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, there were 173 worker deaths last year, which was down from double that figure 20 years ago. However, that figure does not include members of the public who were killed or injured in workplaces. The number of non-fatal accidents at work has also fallen considerably over the past 10 years, from about 1&#160;million to 600,000. As well as deaths at work, UK Government figures show that at least 20,000 people died from work-related injuries and illnesses such as occupational cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disorders and through work-related road traffic accidents. However, estimates of underreporting suggest that the real figure may be as high as 50,000.</p><p>In Scotland, although the figures for workplace illness and injury dropped, the number of fatalities rose to 20. Not for the first time, the Scottish rate is higher than the UK rate, which may be because construction and agriculture are larger parts of our economy and have higher accident rates; agriculture itself accounts for two thirds of worker deaths. However, neither explanations, nor the falling trends, are cause for complacency&#8212;any death is one too many. If we could address the Scottish situation by getting health and safety devolved to the Scottish Parliament, I believe that that is what we should do.</p><p>Historically, health and safety improvements have not come from above. Workers in industries such as the steel industry have had to contend with poor safety regimes and have fought, through their unions, to get improvements. My background is in the steel industry, which plays a central role in my constituency, so I am well aware of the steelworkers&#8217; struggle. I look forward to the creation of a steelworkers memorial at Ravenscraig to mark the lives and health that have been lost as a result of the steel industry. My best wishes go to North Lanarkshire Trades Union Council for its event at 12 o&#8217;clock on Sunday in the Summerlee museum of Scottish industrial life, and to the dozen or more other events throughout Scotland.</p><p>While we &#8220;Remember the dead&#8221;, we must still &#8220;fight for the living.&#8221; In the UK, despite its figures suggesting that low-risk workplaces account for more than half of workplace deaths, the Government has withdrawn unannounced health and safety inspections and workers are still pressured by their employers to meet unattainable targets, with the upshot that safety standards can be ignored. Let us thank our union safety reps for the crucial work that they undertake, often in difficult circumstances, to resist such pressures.</p><p>Let us also remember that this is international workers memorial day. As the disaster in Bangladesh reminds us, there is still much more that we can do. We should oppose cheap goods being produced at the cost of people&#8217;s lives and wellbeing, and we should insist on multinationals taking preventative action, rather than just paying lip service after the event. That is why we need an international workers memorial day.</p><p>I close with the closing lines of &#8220;Empty Shoes&#8221;:</p><p>To honour your great sacrifice</p><p>I hope your workmates unionise</p><p>And do it soon before another dies</p><p>In remembrance of you - no more empty shoes.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Workers Memorial Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank everyone who is attending the debate, who signed the motion, who contributed to the shoes exhibition and who went out of their way to support me&#8212;the hazards campaign, families against corporate killers, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the GMB and Community trade unions&#8212;in my first members&#8217; business debate, which is on international workers memorial day.

The overall conclusion states:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee has some concern&#8221;.</p><p>This is not a minor concern of the sort that would not survive the private meeting in which the report was finalised, and nor is it the sort of concern that could languish in obscurity in lesser paragraphs.

The concerns, which are</p><p>&#8220;expressed in the relevant sections of the report&#8221;,</p><p>are more about the specific means by which the bill will achieve its principles. In other words, it is not clear how it will do what it sets out to do.

On university governance, there is something fundamentally undemocratic about seeking powers to ensure compliance with principles that are not in the bill and are not yet defined or agreed elsewhere. Tony Brian of Glasgow Caledonian University noted:</p><p>&#8220;The provision seems to give future ministers the ability to choose any code of governance that they want&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 19 February 2013; c 2013.]</p><p>The governance code, which the university chairs are drafting, will not be ready until after evidence taking on the bill, so holding back the bill would allow such failings to be addressed.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has recognised some of the shortcomings, such as a lack of gender balance in governance. Encouragement to lodge Opposition amendments at stage 2 tacitly acknowledges the bill&#8217;s weaknesses. Perhaps, in the spirit of political consensus, we should take the entire bill away for a while and overhaul it for him.</p><p>I welcome the recognition of the obstacles that face people who live in areas of high deprivation, which is a major factor in people not realising their potential.

It is a fantastic service that provides a regular meeting point for people with dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s and their carers, giving them the opportunity to meet healthcare professionals and stakeholders in dementia care to discuss any concerns that they have. I was struck by the activity that the cafe brings to the community. I am certain that the vibrancy of that meeting made people feel welcome, comforted and understood. No one was excluded, and staff did an excellent job in providing reassurance and advice to all 60 people who attended. The service is invaluable to our community. With the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer&#8217;s and dementia, it is vital that people do not feel alone in their concerns. We need many more such services.</p><p>Hearing what my constituents had to say made it clear to me that we need to enhance the services that are available to support them and to look carefully at the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy on the development of those services. Carers&#8212;whether of people with dementia or people who require care for other reasons&#8212;contribute an enormous amount to society, but that contribution is not easy to measure and is not generally recognised by the bean counters, statisticians and economists. It is only when we look at what it would cost the state to provide the support that they give&#8212;about &#163;10 billion for the Scottish economy&#8212;that we realise just how much we are in their debt. The health services and central and local government should take that on board in their policy making and activities.</p><p>Dementia carers and other carers deserve a network of support that can address their specific needs, whether from day to day or in a crisis. They need to know how and where to get help, and that help must be available when it is needed. They need support in maintaining their own health under the pressures of caring, and they need support as they struggle with fuel and food poverty. The 250,000 carers who work need the understanding and support of their employers so that they can combine work with their caring responsibilities, and young carers need the support of their schools and colleges as they combine study with their caring role.</p><p>I welcome the project, which is contributing to meeting that need through visits, talks, publications and social and other media. The project also makes clear the need for those providing services to know more about the person with dementia and the linked need for consistency in who provides the services.

Over the past 20-odd years there have been successive, but not uniformly successful, attempts to move services in that direction, and each fresh attempt has encountered fresh obstacles. Too often, reforms are seen as an opportunity to pass on responsibility while retaining funding, which is always more tempting in an era of shrinking budgets. Partners have signed up to integration, but it is too easy for initiatives to be seen as solutions for one partner&#8217;s immediate problems, such as bedblocking, without their being too concerned about how the solution works in practice.</p><p>It makes good financial sense to support people in the community&#8212;I have been told that it costs four times as much to support an in-patient&#8212;but financial gains should not come at the expense of the overall quality of services and support. That is difficult to avoid when local government is severely cash constrained. With real-terms cuts in central Government funding, an underfunded council tax freeze and few other sources of income for local government, something has to give, and it appears to me that the most vulnerable are among the biggest givers. They are faced with either losing services or paying for them.</p><p>As freedom of information evidence has shown, income generation does not come only from car parking and leisure charges. It is clear that social care charges have increased, and that the pattern of cuts and charges is uneven. We could even call it a postcode lottery. I congratulate councillors who have done their best to protect services while keeping charges down, and I lay the responsibility for their dilemma firmly and squarely with the Scottish Government.</p><p>That said, this is not just about budgets. The postcode lottery that is faced by Scotland&#8217;s elderly and disabled people is exacerbated by the lack of a coherent and consistent strategy for care. We need clearer plans from the Scottish Government to address the demographic challenge that we face. We also need better funding for health and social care to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of service users.</p><p>We need to build consensus, which is difficult when the current situation pits partners against each other. We need to avoid service developments being held back by the people in power taking a narrow view of a service in a particular location, rather than recognising the best interests of the service users across an area. Cross-party support for better joined-up health and social care services is undermined by the current set-up, which fosters annual conflict.</p><p>However, by concentrating on structural reform at senior level in the organisations and by focusing on who controls budgets, the Scottish Government is neglecting questions about how to improve services on the ground&#8212;that is what I am told by the people on the ground. Change should happen, but it needs to be driven by reviewing at local level what works well and what can be improved by integrating health and social care services. Local delivery needs a strengthened role for local authorities, not a diluted one. A fully integrated delivery structure should be led by local authorities and underpinned by legislation.</p><p>There should also be straightforward and direct Scottish Government funding to health and social care partnerships using an allocation system that is sensitive to local needs. It is significant that much of the current agenda is being driven by an attempt to prevent bedblocking, but bedblocking is not an issue in all areas so not all councils or health boards will start from the same base. The proposals as they stand are focused on structure, on which budgets are to be included and on who controls those budgets; they say little about the outcomes that need to be delivered.</p><p>Let me come to a conclusion. The cabinet secretary has said that this is a &#8220;revolution&#8221;, and Iain Gray has said that we must not wait for another 20 years. Let us provide the care that people expect to receive in an open and transparent system that supports delivery, with local health and social work organisations that can locally determine the best way to deliver outcomes. Let us get away from the current divide-and-rule tactics, which I do not think the cabinet secretary is trying to recreate.

The former may be a tempting prospect for some, but the latter is more likely in practice and puts an additional burden on already severely cash-strapped councils.</p><p>There should be a duty on planning authorities to keep their costs as low as possible. Indeed, it would be in the interests of economic development for them to do so. If there is also a justification for subsidising planning costs, that should be transparent, accountable and up for discussion.</p><p>Some members will point to community gain as an offset for planning and other costs that fall on local authorities. It is, of course, an important element in seeking to ensure that the wider community benefits from development, but we should not think of it as an unqualified gain.</p><p>There is a need to ensure that planning gain is appropriate to, and commensurate with, the scale of the development. We should also remember that it tends to be a one-off gain and that the local authority is left with continuing commitments to infrastructure and maintenance.</p><p>One idea that has been discussed in considering how to streamline the system is to allow greater powers to grant permission based on precedent. One side of that coin is a reduction in inconsistent decisions, but we must be careful not to generalise too much and to take full account of differing circumstances.</p><p>I note that planning performance is to be reviewed and that consideration will be given to linking it with the reform of fees.

In order to achieve that, the easiest course might be simply to refuse any application that does not meet the requirements. An alternative approach, which has been employed in North Lanarkshire, is to take time to discuss ways in which the application could be amended to help it to meet the necessary criteria. That avoids adding unduly to the applicant&#8217;s costs, but the application takes longer to deal with. The planning authority should not be in any way marked down or penalised for taking that accommodating approach.</p><p>Clearly, speeding up the processing of local development plans is to be welcomed, but we must be careful that it is not done at the cost of comprehensive consultation and participation.

In my Motherwell and Wishaw constituency, there are more than 3,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds.</p><p>Young people need help. They need help to make the right choices about their future, to get qualifications, to acquire skills and to apply for jobs. I was not convinced that the right help was being provided so, a few months ago, I looked into the local careers service that is offered by SDS. I was not happy with what I found.</p><p>For example, the local careers office is hidden away in Motherwell College and its location is not signposted. With thousands of young people in North Lanarkshire not in education, employment or training, and with the cuts in the college sector, it occurred to me that that may not be the most convenient location. To compound that, there is a 20 per cent reduction in front-line staff.</p><p>I doubted that the face-to-face access provided by those staff could be replaced by pushing young people towards web access and centralised careers provision, so I also had a look at the my world of work website. There was one telephone number on the contact page, but even that was a helpline for using the website&#8212;it did not put people in touch with someone who could give careers advice. Searching the site for Motherwell or Wishaw returned a couple of couple of courses at the college, but&#8212;surprise, surprise&#8212;there was no link to the local careers advice office that was based in the college. Was that the minister&#8217;s vision for an improved service?</p><p>It also came as no surprise to discover that, locally, only 14 per cent of the young people have registered on the my world of work website. That is only one in seven, which proves to me that the plan is not working. Will the minister explain why SDS is not co-operating with the academics who are conducting research into the new web-based service? What are the minister&#8217;s views on the previous research carried out for SDS?</p><p>It has been identified that there are shortcomings in the system. I hope that the minister agrees that SDS should work with anyone who can help address the problems or improve the system.</p><p>Having visited my constituency&#8217;s local careers office in Motherwell College, I was more convinced than ever that careers advice should be more easily accessible for all, which means somewhere central where people can go and speak face-to-face with an adviser. The staff whom I spoke to appreciated those concerns, so I decided to approach the council to see whether it could identify suitable premises in Motherwell or Wishaw town centre.</p><p>When SDS was put on the spot, the inaccessibility of the service was clear. With only 14 per cent of young people signing up to the my world of work website, the weakness of the web-based solution cannot be denied. SDS agreed to work with the council.</p><p>I am pleased to say that that has borne fruit, with the careers service now lined up to occupy part of the one-stop-shop in Motherwell. Of course, that victory for common sense is only part of what needs to be done, but it is also very much the exception to the rule, as has been heard from other areas.</p><p>I am also concerned about the traffic-light system that is being used to filter young people in order to decide who deserves attention. For many young people, the system is failing to provide support. There is an issue about whether the support that is offered is appropriate to the categories and whether the categories are being correctly assigned or, in some cases, even assigned at all.</p><p>The web system is aimed at the 75 per cent of the 16 to 19-year-olds who are in the green category. What we know of registrations suggests that only a quarter of them have actually signed up. Those pupils are those who fare best academically, but it is a mistake to assume that that translates into their not needing help with careers beyond what is provided on the my world of work website. It can be difficult for pupils to pick the right courses and plot out career destinations, whatever their level of academic ability or attainment.</p><p>Where is the evidence to support SDS? How does it compare to the evidence that it does not want to talk about?</p><p>The move to an appointments system is also making life difficult for older users, with drop-in opportunities diminishing and outreach for vulnerable youngsters being put out of reach.</p><p>All in all, the picture is one of a service that is perpetuating a dogma that underpins its reforms, which are being shown to be unfit for purpose.

Even the true bottom line figures do not do that. The drop in final budgets from &#163;555&#160;million to &#163;546&#160;million hides inconvenient truths about how those figures are composed. The bottom line figure for 2012-13 includes &#163;15&#160;million for college transformation. Without that funding in 2013-14, the bottom line figure drops to &#163;512&#160;million, so I ask the cabinet secretary please to stop his pretence. This is not about bolstering the college sector; it is about managing its decline.</p><p>Recent figures show that students from deprived areas are still disadvantaged in terms of getting to university, which makes college education an especially important factor in tackling deprivation. I am surprised that the cabinet secretary does not seem to understand that. While colleges struggle, universities have been cushioned from the cuts, which has prompted accusations of the rich being propped up at the expense of the poor. Universities attempt to address that by taking students from colleges. However, in my constituency, Motherwell College has had to refuse more than two thousand applications, so that will not be an easy route. I know that some people will have found places elsewhere, but for a variety of factors&#8212;not the least of which is costs&#8212;people tend not to travel far for college places. Given the axed courses and shortage of places, some people will not even have applied.</p><p>There is also evidence that young people are staying on at school longer, which will increase future demand. In North Lanarkshire, more than 2,000 16 to 19-year-olds are not in education, employment or training. That figure will be an underestimate by 20 per cent or more, and I would bet that quite a few of those 2,500 young people applied to colleges. From their point of view, the Scottish Government&#8217;s pledge to 16 to 19-year-olds looks like a bad joke. For many, the FE sector is the doorway to higher education and the key to the labour market, and they must feel that the Scottish Government has locked that door and thrown away the key.</p><p>This is the second year that there has been a problem for Motherwell College following cuts in funding, courses and staff. Nationally, cuts in FE teaching budgets saw staff numbers slashed by 1,300 last year.

The impact of the bill is thus hugely dependent on how those powers are used through secondary legislation.</p><p>The second reason is that getting a clearer picture of the Scottish Government&#8217;s intentions for the regulations&#8212;and the evidence to support them, which is important&#8212;has been tortuous. Time and again, information has been produced at the last minute or after the relevant discussions have taken place. Although the minister has now issued draft regulations to give a more favourable discount to properties that are reoccupied after being empty, they were made available only recently and there has not been an opportunity to scrutinise the evidence on that measure.</p><p>That leads to the third reason: information has not been gathered about the impact of the bill in the form of a business and regulatory impact assessment. I therefore want to ensure that secondary legislation receives the parliamentary scrutiny that has so far been denied or at least diminished by how the bill has been treated to date.

It is our responsibility to examine and question legislation that gives powers to ministers and to examine and question how they are used. To do so, the Parliament needs the opportunity to assess and debate secondary legislation. That is particularly the case when much of the impact of a bill will be determined by the regulations that are issued by ministers.</p><p>My amendments are designed to ensure that regulations will come back to the Parliament so that we can make a careful and considered judgment on them.

Over &#163;2 billion is spent every year on energy transmission through our grids. We need huge investment to ensure the future security of our supply. Project transmit&#8217;s predecessor&#8212;project discovery&#8212;concluded that &#163;200 billion needed to be spent on energy infrastructure over the next 10 years. A big chunk of that will be for Scottish infrastructure.</p><p>Project transmit is about ensuring that the industry delivers the pipes and wires that we need in a way that supports our economic, environmental and social objectives. The project also needs to take a broad view that encompasses the development of European and other international energy grid networks. The nature of the charging regime is also a fundamental factor in how our energy policy develops because it can make or break the development of energy supplies from new sources and locations, and it can help or hinder our attempts to eliminate fuel poverty, fight climate change and promote economic growth that is based on low carbon technology and power sources.</p><p>In determining charges for transmission, we clearly need to take into account the physical costs of infrastructure. However, we also need to ensure that the way in which we determine charges allows for the development timescale and nature of new energy sources. Tackling climate change is a long-term challenge. We should ensure that entry to the market is not restricted by short-term considerations.</p><p>Project transmit is addressing those issues. It seeks to harmonise the grid charging regime with generation policy and it should deliver lower transmission costs. However, as Ken Macintosh noted, issues remain with island costs. That is particularly important for Scotland, not only because we have many islands and people who live on them, but because our islands have enormous potential for developing renewable energy production.</p><p>Transmission charges are crucial to the future of our island economies. The existing charging regime&#8212;ICRP&#8212;has influenced the market and has in general worked against the development of renewables through measures such as higher transmission charges for Scottish suppliers.

Improved ICRP would be a big improvement on the existing system and, with political will, many of the issues that it raises could be addressed.</p><p>Our amendment suggests that the review of renewables obligation certificates should prioritise community renewables and take account of the remaining disparity in grid access costs under the improved ICRP.

I will continue on that consensual theme, so I apologise if what I will say sounds familiar.</p><p>In 2010, everyone agreed that justice that is delivered by tribunals is an integral part of the Scottish justice system, that we should create an integrated tribunals service, that any transfer of powers should seek to preserve the benefits of existing arrangements, and that there should be wide consultation. It was noted that developments at UK level, with the creation, for the UK, of the Tribunals Service were in danger of leaving Scotland suffering by comparison, with tribunals that deal with devolved matters providing an inferior level of service to users. Although everyone was keen that we be not left behind, some concerns were expressed&#8212;notably about how the tribunal system sits organisationally with regard to the Scottish Court Service, given the significant differences in how they operate. The timescale for implementation and adequate consultation was also an issue. We are now entering a period of consultation on the further proposals from the Scottish Government.</p><p>It is important to preserve the valuable role of tribunals, which combines their specialist knowledge and understanding with their operation as a less formal and less adversarial arena for justice than the court system. Although there is no doubt that the tribunal system that we have inherited is complex and could benefit from a more consistent approach, we must balance measures to address that with the need to maintain the tribunals&#8217; strengths, including their accessibility. Affordability should not be a barrier to justice.</p><p>We must be aware, while we seek to adopt a standardised packaging for tribunals, that their contents vary, and we should not discard important ingredients. We must ensure that the process of simplification and standardisation of procedures does not undermine specialised elements that are of value in particular tribunal areas. The reduction of overlaps and the elimination of duplication are worth while, as long as they are genuine overlap and duplication, and as long as elimination does not involve putting square pegs in round holes, which would not be the way to ensure better deployment and sharing of resources.</p><p>We need to be able to maintain important specialisation in appointments and support structures. I am therefore pleased that the consultation document is careful to make it clear that a coherent system does not mean a one-size-fits-all system. That is, of course, easier to say than it is to achieve, particularly with 40 tribunals that deal with thousands of cases between them.</p><p>As the consultation document recognises, the key objectives are not necessarily mutually compatible in all respects. An emphasis on, or priority for one objective may make others more difficult to achieve. Specialisation has already been mentioned as an issue that is likely to arise in pursuing a streamlined service. There are also potential conflicts between safeguarding the interests of users and pursuing greater administrative efficiency. Even within each one of the stated key objectives, there is room for divergence. Securing just and speedy outcomes sounds good, and it certainly does not serve the cause of justice to allow cases to drag on&#8212;but neither does excessive haste. For those reasons, it is right that the statutory framework be for evolutionary change. Tribunals must be allowed to address their individual issues and requirements, and to integrate to an extent and at a speed that preserves their advantages and ensures the optimal balance in applying the key objectives.</p><p>I note that the consultation covers only the devolved aspects of the tribunal integration. However, given that such integration is taking place in England and Wales, and that it has been suggested by the UK Ministry of Justice and others that there could be a transfer of powers for reserved tribunal administration and the judiciary to Scotland, I take this opportunity to support the principle of such a move.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664830", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunal System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When the proposal to set up the Scottish Tribunals Service was debated in September 2010&#8212;there was the same glamour then as there has been in the debate so far&#8212;I am reliably informed that there was a remarkable degree of parliamentary agreement, both in voting and in the points that were made.

However, hearing comments again in a debate such as this is important.</p><p>If we are serious about tackling poverty, we should be equally committed to the living wage, for it is designed and calculated to take people out of poverty. I congratulate all those who have been instrumental in bringing the campaign to the current stage, including the Poverty Alliance Scotland, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the trade unions and the councils&#8212;notably Glasgow City Council. I am pleased that North Lanarkshire Council has now endorsed payment of the living wage to its employees. In the spirit of consensus, I am pleased that even David Cameron has recognised that it is</p><p>&#8220;an idea whose time has come&#8221;.</p><p>The living wage is not a new idea. As many members know, we can claim that a Scot had a hand in its evolution more than 200 years ago, when Adam Smith wrote in &#8220;The Wealth of Nations&#8221; that workers</p><p>&#8220;should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged.&#8221;</p><p>Those words are quite close to the modern concept.</p><p>For families whose wage earners are paid less than the living wage, it is difficult&#8212;if not impossible&#8212;to provide basic essentials without working excessively long hours or taking on unsustainable debt. Of course, the justification for the living wage goes beyond basic needs. For example, as Save the Children has pointed out, in-work poverty and low pay, particularly among women, contribute to the high level of child poverty in Scotland.</p><p>Those who fear that bringing in the living wage would create unemployment should remember that that argument was also used against the minimum wage, but the relationship between wage levels and income is not so simple. At the bottom end of the wage scale, raising income has many impacts&#8212;through factors such as greater work satisfaction, improved quality and productivity, less absenteeism and increased local spending&#8212;that can offset the higher wage costs and boost employment.</p><p>The old adage that the poor work harder if they are paid less and the rich work harder if they are paid more is clearly a myth that rich people have propagated. We should remember that the warnings of dire consequences and lengthening dole queues proved to be unfounded when the minimum wage was brought in. The opposite was true&#8212;employment continued to grow. Many people who understood why that would happen with a minimum wage that was set at the right level were of the opinion that the minimum wage had been set cautiously&#8217; if anything, it was set below the level that would give the economy the optimal benefits.</p><p>To those who argue that the living wage distorts the labour market, I say that we need the living wage to protect people from the ravages of a labour market that uses high unemployment to drive wages down to poverty levels.</p><p>I hope that, after all the failures of unrestrained markets, we have learned that free markets are not the solution to every problem. The quality of people&#8217;s lives should not be at the whim of market forces. Our society recognises that, and the state steps in to support those whom the labour market squeezes and spits out. Is it not better to protect people&#8217;s ability to keep themselves out of poverty than to adopt a laissez-faire attitude and have to deal with the consequences? We must take a broader view and consider the wider benefits to the economy and people&#8217;s lives. Let&#8217;s face it&#8212;putting a few extra quid in the pockets of the poorest members of our society is likely to do more for the local economy than boosting the bonuses and offshore bank accounts of the better off.</p><p>It is estimated that local businesses will get an extra &#163;1.63 for every &#163;1 that is paid to provide a living wage. Reductions in poverty and inequality also have many longer-term benefits, from better physical and mental health to lower rates of crime and antisocial behaviour.</p><p>The living wage is proposed for the public sector, but I hope that it will be taken up more widely. It is indeed an idea whose time has come, as witnessed by cities and countries all over the world that have adopted the idea. It is not the whole answer, however, and the degree of its success will depend on action to address poverty traps in the tax and benefits system.</p><p>Like other objectives, such as increased numbers of apprenticeships and the promotion of measures to tackle climate change, payment of the living wage could be incorporated into procurement procedures. As John Park does, I hope that the new Minister for Local Government and Planning and the Scottish Government will support the creation of a Scottish living wage unit, as called for by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and trade unions, to increase the impetus for wider introduction of the living wage.</p><p>Finally, just to make the score one each, I put it on the record that North Lanarkshire Council&#8217;s employees would not be receiving the living wage if the SNP&#8217;s alternative budget had been successful.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When we speak near the end of a debate, we become very aware that most of what we wanted to say has been said.

That myth is reinforced by the myth that public finances are out of control and public services waste money. The real waste is ditching services for the sake of a slash-and-burn ideology.</p><p>As Glenn O&#8217;Hara of the Oxford Brookes University notes,</p><p>&#8220;Recent history repeatedly shows that the combination of background inflation, resurgent growth and the establishment of a sound plateau for public spending are actually much more likely to be effective over the medium term.&#8221;</p><p>Perhaps George Osborne should go back to Oxford to learn the lessons of history. His misdiagnoses and flawed prescriptions have hindered recovery.</p><p>There are some signs in the autumn statement, however, that the chancellor has got a fright. Perhaps the OBR&#8217;s analysis has made him think again. If so, maybe our Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth could benefit from having an OBR in Scotland.</p><p>Alongside the downwards revision of growth expectations, George Osborne has decided to take a small step away from disaster. He is trying to stimulate growth by investing in infrastructure, although by far less than he cut, and by making business borrowing easier, although he is not tackling bankers head on&#8212;even action on bonuses has been abandoned. Sadly, the abandonment of child tax credit rises and other measures will make low to middle-income families worse off and increase child poverty.</p><p>The continuing negativity of the Government also depresses consumer and business confidence, making it even harder for business to grow. George Osborne somehow fails to grasp that confidence matters when it comes to growth and that he needs to stimulate both. The OBR report makes it clear that, because of the chancellor&#8217;s low-growth policies, borrowing will be much higher than that projected under the previous Government and much higher than the chancellor predicted. Mr Osborne&#8217;s answer to the failure of his austerity programme is more austerity and making the public sector pay for the bankers&#8217; mistakes.</p><p>The Scottish Government, too, is critical of cuts, such as those in public sector pensions, but when SNP members had the opportunity to do something, what did they do? They passed on the cuts. They were notable by their absence from the picket lines during the recent strike, and their solidarity with and support for public sector workers stops with criticism of the UK Government. Teachers, hospital workers, refuse collectors and dinner ladies were not the cause of the financial crisis; bankers were. However, while plans to tax and trim the casino bankers&#8217; bonuses are abandoned, public sector workers are being made to pay for the consequences of the bankers&#8217; mistakes.</p><p>On the one hand, the Scottish Government has been critical of the Con-Dems but, on the other hand, it is aiding and abetting them with its own additional cuts agenda. There has been a 20 per cent cut in funding for colleges, a &#163;319 million cut in real terms to the national health service budget and a 50 per cent cut to the social housing budget. In addition, there is very little to show for the Scottish Government&#8217;s spending on jobs and the economy, with 100,000 young people unemployed and no overall reduction in child poverty since 2007. Perhaps the Scottish Government&#8217;s mantra might more accurately be: UK Government bad, Scottish Government not so good.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656625", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autumn Budget Statement and the Scottish Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I want to move on.

I believe that there is significant and unaddressed demand for social rented housing and shared equity schemes, but both are dependent on Government support that is rapidly shrinking. The housing and regeneration budget will be reduced from nearly &#163;400 million to little over &#163;250 million in 2014, which is a cut of more than 35 per cent. Next year, the affordable housing supply budget is to suffer an even more drastic cut of 53 per cent, falling from just over &#163;268 million to as little as &#163;125 million.</p><p>Of course, some of the affordable housing budget is included in the local government settlement but it, too, will be under severe pressure. Manifesto promises and the requirement in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016 are unlikely to be met. The pledge to build 6,000 social rented homes each year has become a pledge to build 6,000 affordable homes, just over 4,000 of which will be social rented homes. That is nowhere near enough to meet demand; Scotland needs 10,000 new affordable homes a year.</p><p>The 60 per cent decrease in the money for building affordable homes will be achieved by limiting the subsidy to a maximum of &#163;40,000 per unit, but it remains to be seen whether that subsidy will be raised for areas of greater need. Unless it is relaxed, the limit will make it difficult to fund social rented accommodation in areas of high deprivation; if it is relaxed, there will not be enough money to fund the building of as many houses.</p><p>The 1,000 intermediate rented homes, available through the national housing trust, are by definition affordable only for some. They are out of reach of the poorest tenants. Another 1,000 are to come from subsidised home ownership. I support the continuation of the open market and the new supply schemes, but I note that the Scottish Government is still not providing funding for the open market scheme. That scheme was assessed as being the best to meet particular needs&#8212;for example, the needs of people with a disability&#8212;and also as being a particularly cost-effective option. However, it is now available only for a very limited number of homes that are already in the process of being built.</p><p>I am also concerned about the future of social housing under the new regime of the housing regulator, which has brought forward proposals that will undermine the role of local residents on the boards and committees of registered social landlords. I am sure that there is no great demand for those proposals from housing associations and residents. In accordance with the tenant consultation and satisfaction principles of the Scottish housing charter, their views should be paramount. Any attempt to impose those new rules will be an attack on local democracy. It will not be acceptable for the Scottish Government to wash its hands and say, &#8220;It wisnae me. It was that quango what done it.&#8221;</p><p>The Government must take responsibility, and not give it away to organisations that it then blames when things go wrong. Instead of trying to fix things that are not broken, the Government should address real problems&#8212;such as factors who are withdrawing their services because absentee landlords make their task so difficult.

That might not be what those who drafted the motion wanted to refer to, but it is very true.</p><p>One of the main influences on a child&#8217;s chances of going to university is where they live. Since 1999, there have been some improvements; for example, the number of state-school pupils who are going to university has increased from 31 per cent to 35.7 per cent. However, for schools in deprived areas, that figure is often in single digits, while for schools in nearby better-off areas it can be over 40 per cent. Although Labour&#8217;s schools of ambition programme was addressing the issue and raising aspirations with clear measurable results, it was unfortunately not given the time that it needed to maximise its impact. Given that this deep-rooted problem cannot be tackled overnight and requires a long-term programme of action that is supported to fruition, it is a great pity that the Scottish National Party cancelled that initiative.</p><p>The cabinet secretary, Mike Russell, has recognised that progress has been made in the past 10 years. However, it is still the case that only 15 per cent of Scottish students come from our 20 per cent most-deprived areas. Mr Russell has declared that that inequality of opportunity must be tackled; he thinks that his post-16 reforms will somehow do the job. Statutory duties on universities to address imbalances smack not only of trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted, but of passing the buck. As far as post-16 resources are concerned, there is an educational divide, and far from addressing the problem, the Scottish Government is making it worse.</p><p>Deprived areas may not supply as many university students, and that makes the college sector even more important to them. The college sector now faces 20 per cent cuts, on top of 10 per cent cuts last year. Will that do wonders for attainment? I think not. There will be fewer courses and students. How will that improve young people&#8217;s life chances? What a way to recognise the work of the likes of Motherwell College, which has a great record of success.</p><p>Even if Mike Russell does not force colleges to merge, how will struggling colleges cope with the impact of cuts on staff, students and courses without doing so? Is that what is meant by &#8220;improved competitiveness and ... opportunity&#8221;?</p><p>Alongside the problems of deprivation, we have groups that are particularly affected by barriers to education and employment. I am pleased to note the work that Motherwell College has been doing in conjunction with STV local and Action for Children, helping and encouraging young carers to take courses and explore careers.</p><p>Young disabled people also face obstacles. I note the finding in a report by Leonard Cheshire Disability that 40 per cent of young disabled people have been turned down or discouraged from progressing into further education, while 42 per cent do not undertake work experience.</p><p>To tackle poverty and provide employment opportunities for all, educational inequality must be addressed. We need to help all schools to be good schools, and we need to help all children to realise their potential, but we cannot do that without action that is targeted at the areas of greatest need&#8212;not in a &#8220;Here today, gone tomorrow&#8221; fashion, but with a serious long-term commitment to tackling the underlying causes of such problems.</p><p>What we have, however, is a chasm between the Scottish Government's rhetoric and reality. The reality does not raise aspirations and ambitions for all, does not provide the best start for all, and does not give the same opportunities to all. Our children and young people deserve better.</p><p>I say to the minister that it is time we had an education system that is fit for the 21st century, an education system that equips young people with the employability skills that they need to meet the challenges of the modern world, and an education system that does not condemn the life chances of those who find themselves in the wrong postcode area.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Raising Attainment and Ambition (Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. I want to make progress.

Half are to come from subsidised home ownership and half from &#8220;intermediate rented homes&#8221; through the national housing trust.

With reduced budgets, there is no way that that can be achieved. As well as new affordable housing, we need to upgrade the existing housing stock. We need investment to improve the energy performance of housing, including existing private housing. The draft budget and spending review are underwhelming in their lack of ambition and do not provide the sort of investment that is necessary to deliver the emissions savings that the report on proposals and policies allocated to domestic energy efficiency to meet the requirements of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.</p><p>That is an extremely serious issue, because Scotland&#8217;s housing is responsible for a quarter of our carbon emissions, but it is not only our climate change progress that will suffer&#8212;there are serious consequences for the economy and fuel poverty.

We know what it is like to live in a community that is built around a particular commodity, facing an uncertain and unpromising future, so I have a lot of sympathy for our fishing communities. I recognise the importance of creating and safeguarding a viable, community-focused fishing industry. That needs to be at the heart of the common fisheries policy.</p><p>The long-term needs of communities that rely on fishing can be met only by establishing and developing policies and practices that protect and promote sustainable fishing. If we cannot protect fish stocks and allow overfished species to recover, our fishing communities will continue to struggle.</p><p>Climate change presents major challenges to marine ecosystems, and we must be wary of the combined impact of overfishing, climate change and the use of destructive and damaging fishing practices, particularly in breeding and nursery areas. The CFP has not been adequate to that task. It has allowed poor management of stocks and short-term fixes that create long-term problems of overcapacity fleets, overfished waters, rules that are disregarded and fish that are discarded. The new proposals are a step in the right direction, in that they put conservation and long-term management of species at maximum sustainable yields at the heart of the policy, but they are not yet sufficiently robust to ensure that those objectives are met.</p><p>We still need to put some flesh on the bones of the new CFP. We need workable mechanisms, definitive timescales and allocated responsibilities to turn a laudable wish into a practical reality. An essential element is the creation of clear mechanisms for regional fisheries management to support the fishing industry and communities while protecting the long-term ecological viability of fish stocks.</p><p>As for discards, commercialisation is clearly a second best to not catching the unwanted fish. Changes in fishing gear can be augmented by increasingly sophisticated technology to ensure better-targeted catches and to avoid the bycatch of non-target species.</p><p>It is essential that the EU fishing quotas are based on scientific advice, but the application of the quotas should take account of social and environmental impacts and include measures to address the hardship that can be caused.</p><p>The adoption of more sustainable fishing practices should be supported not only through help and advice to the fleet but through fishing rights. Trading rights should not be regarded simply as a market-driven means to promote more efficient operations but ought to be controlled to encourage those who operate in the most sustainable manner.</p><p>The marine environment is very important to Scotland. Two thirds of UK fish are landed here and we have done much to protect our marine environment through Scottish legislation, but there is only so much that can be done at this level.

I thank the voters of Motherwell and Wishaw, because it is an honour and a privilege to represent them.</p><p>My constituency has of course been very ably served for the past 12 years by Jack McConnell, whose illustrious career has now taken him to the House of Lords, with the title of Baron McConnell of Glenscorrodale. I am sure that everyone here will join me in thanking our longest-serving First Minister for his enormous contribution to this Parliament and the wellbeing of the people of Scotland. [Applause.]</p><p>Over the next few years, Scotland will face enormous challenges. To meet those challenges, we must work with the rest of the UK and others internationally to build a greener, more sustainable environment and economy. The promises of consensus and co-operation from the Scottish Government will carry little weight if every problem is to be addressed by blaming Westminster and asking for more powers. That is the road to conflict, confusion and calamity. The public want a Scottish Government that will solve the problem, not pass the blame.</p><p>Therefore, the Scottish Government&#8217;s first priority must be to ensure the best use of the powers that it has. I welcome the plans for more modern apprenticeships, which are important to the economy and to the people of Motherwell and Wishaw. The policy of no compulsory redundancies is also crucial. However, to achieve that across the whole public sector, the Scottish Government must ensure that services are adequately funded.</p><p>On independence, the First Minister says that the Scottish Government is</p><p>&#8220;not rushing this journey ... We shall keep travelling, and so get ever closer to home.&#8221;</p><p>That constant, drip, drip, drip approach sounds like a form of torture that is designed to sap our willpower and destroy our ability to resist. That said, there is a strong case for an extension of powers such as on capital borrowing. As Richard Baker said, we support an increase in the proposed limits on short-term and capital borrowing. We also support capital borrowing powers being introduced in April 2012. As the cabinet secretary has already informed us, that could now come this year. Given the degree of consensus, that should not become a pawn in the pursuit of independence, which was played down in the election campaign but moved to centre stage immediately afterwards. In this modern world, independence is something of a relative term. The world is interdependent and we are all subject to global forces.</p><p>From that perspective, the question is not about independence but about the most appropriate level of democratic decision making for each issue. Borrowing is a good example of that. Clearly, there are borrowing powers that are best exercised at the local level, at the Scottish level and at the UK level. Questions remain, however, about the borrowing methods and the circumstances and outcomes that merit such borrowing.</p><p>As a former North Lanarkshire councillor, I am well aware of the advantages of being able to borrow capital to invest in and fund worthwhile projects such as the upgrading of Clyde Valley high school, in my constituency, which was promised by the Scottish Government under its Scotland&#8217;s schools for the future programme. It has now been suggested that Government support will change from capital to revenue funding, which would seriously undermine the plans that have been made and would add to the cost. I would be grateful for a reaffirmation of the Government&#8217;s support for the original plan to finance the project.</p><p>The fact that my party is in opposition and the SNP is the party in power should not make the SNP the party of arrogance and disregard for people&#8217;s wishes. The Scottish public deserve more than lip service being paid to consensus; the people of Scotland deserve respect from their Government. They have elected us to help them to realise their ambitions, aspirations and self-respect.
