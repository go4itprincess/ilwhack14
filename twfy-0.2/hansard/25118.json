I share his enthusiasm for the designation of a national tree for Scotland. I am most grateful to members for their valuable speeches during the debate, and it is only right to acknowledge the contribution that Mr Hamilton made by lodging the petition with the Parliament and getting us to this point, as members said.</p><p>It is a shame that Joan McAlpine has had to leave, but I also thank her for leading a previous members&#8217; business debate on the subject, which helped to influence the debate. Her motion invited us to recognise</p><p>&#8220;the significance of the Year of Natural Scotland&#8221;</p><p>and to create a legacy that would include</p><p>&#8220;the declaration of an official national tree after due public consultation&#8221;.</p><p>In closing that debate, I raised three questions:</p><p>&#8220;First, what is a national tree for? Secondly, what does it mean if we decide to adopt a national tree? Thirdly, what process should we go through ... if we were to choose and adopt a national tree?&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 22 May 2013; c 20206.]</p><p>I will address the last question first.</p><p>Members may recall that, at the time, a number of online votes were being run by, among others, the Woodland Trust Scotland and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh to identify Scotland&#8217;s favourite trees, flora and fauna. As they were votes rather than formal consultations that were endorsed by Government, I asked the Forestry Commission Scotland to set up a formal consultation. It asked two fundamental questions:</p><p>&#8220;Should there be a national tree for Scotland?&#8221;</p><p>and, if so:</p><p>&#8220;what species would you like and why?&#8221;</p><p>After a three-month consultation that started on 3 October 2013 and concluded on 3 December 2013, we received, as Angus MacDonald said, more than 4,500 responses. In response to the first question, there was an overwhelming yes, with 95 per cent of everyone who was asked supporting the concept.</p><p>Following that endorsement, the people&#8217;s choice was the Scots pine&#8212;more than 52 per cent chose that majestic tree as a clear winner. For the record and for Sandra Stevenson&#8217;s benefit, I say that the second choice was the rowan and the third choice was the holly, which are both attractive trees. I quite understand why Sandra made the rowan one of her choices.</p><p>I return to the three questions that I posed in May. The first was: what is a national tree for? At its simplest, consultees said that a national tree is a clear symbol of our affinity with Scotland&#8217;s trees, woods and forests and of their importance to us all.</p><p>My second question was about what it means if we decide to adopt a national tree. It means that we have a clear symbol, similar to the renowned Scots thistle, that has been chosen for and by the people of Scotland and which will be a legacy for generations to come.</p><p>I remember with affection the launch of the consultation at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. We had poets, artists and a group of schoolchildren from Stockbridge primary school, who brought an energy, passion and enthusiasm to the proceedings that demonstrated the vision and longevity of the designation. Patricia Ferguson was right to identify the potential to use such an exercise to promote our environment and help people to connect with it.</p><p>The national tree is a symbol that can be used to promote and market Scotland and our magnificent environment&#8212;especially our trees, woods and forests. We should not forget that they cover 18 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s land, which is some 1.4 million hectares. That represents 45 per cent of the total forest resources in the UK.</p><p>A formal designation of the national tree of Scotland will take place in the coming months, as part of events to mark the year of natural Scotland. All members will have the opportunity to have their say.</p><p>Why is the Scots pine a great choice? I guess that the name has a lot to do with it for many people, but the Scots pine has a lot to offer, as a number of members have said. It is steeped in Scotland&#8217;s culture. As the date is close to Burns night, it would be remiss of me to overlook our national bard, Rabbie Burns, who mentioned the Scots pine&#8212;or the Scots fir, which is how it was known then, as Jamie McGrigor said&#8212;in many of his poems and songs.</p><p>The total area of Scots pine in Scotland is about 130,000 hectares, as Angus MacDonald said, which represents some 250 million trees. As other members have said, the trees are home to some of our most iconic species, such as the pine marten, the red squirrel, the capercaillie and the wildcat. The trees are also home to one of our unique birds&#8212;the Scottish crossbill, which is not found anywhere else in the world.</p><p>The Scots pine is the key component of our Caledonian native pinewoods, the remnants of which are all in the Scottish Highlands. The core area of that hugely important habitat is about 18,000 hectares, and we are actively working to see larger areas restored.</p><p>As Jamie McGrigor said, there are many old granny pines&#8212;that is the name that is given to very old Scots pine across the country, which are so old that it is difficult to tell their true age. I am a gentleman and I would never ask a lady her age, but Jamie McGrigor identified one such tree in Glenloyne that is almost 600 years old. It was interesting to hear that there are older examples elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the fact that the Scots pine is one of our most important productive tree species. It is valued for its excellent timber qualities and, as members have said, it is used in many historic and modern buildings across Scotland.</p><p>The designation of a national tree for Scotland will not only create a symbol and shine a spotlight on the great importance of Scotland&#8217;s trees but provide a stimulus for inspiration and innovation. The national tree is a reminder that forestry is a great success story in Scotland. We have a modern and vibrant industry that contributes some &#163;670 million per year to the economy and more than 31,000 jobs.</p><p>I can announce&#8212;a number of members, including Ms Ferguson, picked up on this idea&#8212;that, to promote the national tree, I have asked Forestry Commission Scotland to make provision for a new grant to be created for innovative projects and events that raise the profile of the Scots pine, our new national tree. That will include a separate fund for schools, and more detail will follow in due course. It is vital to get the idea of a national tree into schools and to get schoolchildren conversant with it and what it stands for, because of the link to conservation.</p><p>Forestry Commission Scotland will explore links to new and on-going initiatives, such as a national tree day, national tree week and a Scots pine conference that is designed to explore the tree&#8217;s place in Scotland&#8217;s culture, our heritage and our economy. The fate of the tree has an important bearing on those matters. Unfortunately, the tree faces disease threats, as Joan McAlpine said. The Government is actively addressing that.</p><p>In 2014, the world&#8217;s spotlight is on Scotland, as we welcome the Commonwealth games to Glasgow and global golf fans to Gleneagles and as the people of Scotland have the opportunity to determine Scotland&#8217;s future in September. The Scots pine&#8212;with its rich colours, ancient history, vibrant ecology and valuable timber&#8212;is a superb and fitting symbol for our country. We know that it plays a huge role in tourism marketing and in marketing Scotland&#8217;s environment more generally.</p><p>I am pleased that the consultation respondents and the members here agree that the Scots pine is a worthy symbol to designate and that it will help to highlight the significance of our trees, woods and forests in Scotland.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:39.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870128", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Tree"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Angus MacDonald for bringing his motion to the chamber for debate.

We will work closely with Scottish retailers to help them to understand their responsibilities. Coupled with a pragmatic approach from local authorities, we do not expect a significant number of cases in which enforcement action will be necessary. However, we want to ensure that local authorities have an option that provides a realistic threat of enforcement action without the need for court action and which avoids costs for all sides. Amendment 1 would remove that proportionate and cost-efficient enforcement option. The Scottish Government therefore cannot accept it.</p><p>As I explained to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, which Murdo Fraser convenes, in last year&#8217;s consultation on carrier bag charging, we proposed enforcement through civil penalties. No consultee objected to that. However, in preparing the proposed regulations in the summer, it emerged that the enabling powers did not allow for that. We therefore introduced the fixed-penalty provisions at stage 2, following discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and retailer representatives. COSLA strongly supports the fixed-penalty option on efficiency grounds. The Scottish Grocers Federation supported the fixed-penalty provisions in its recent representations on the carrier bag charging regulations. Although it would prefer no new penalties, it favoured civil sanctions over criminal penalties and said:</p><p>&#8220;This would give local authorities (or other &#8216;enforcement authorities&#8217;) access to a more proportionate and effective enforcement option than would otherwise exist.&#8221;</p><p>As Murdo Fraser said, the Scottish Retail Consortium opposes fixed penalties as a matter of principle. However, we believe that fixed penalties can provide a helpful alternative to court action for this type of offence and will help to ensure a level playing field for businesses that comply with the legislation.</p><p>Section 32B sets out a fixed-penalty regime in some detail and addresses most of the points that the Scottish Retail Consortium asked to be included. In particular, I highlight that enforcement authorities will need to take account of guidance, which will help to ensure a consistent and proportionate approach to enforcement; that anyone who receives a fixed-penalty notice can make representations to the enforcing authority if they disagree and believe it to be unfair; and that anyone who wants to force the enforcement authority to decide whether to take the matter to court can do so by simply not paying the penalty.</p><p>We note the SRC&#8217;s suggestion that the fines should go to a consolidated fund. Its proposed amendment would allow ministers to prescribe how any funds that are raised were to be applied, but dialogue with stakeholders would be needed before a decision is made on whether and how to exercise that power.</p><p>We also note the SRC&#8217;s suggestion that the provisions should be in scope of the primary authority provisions in the bill. Obviously, such a move would require consultation, but this might indeed be the sort of area in which a primary authority approach would be helpful. There is already a requirement in primary legislation for enforcement authorities to take account of guidance. Section 32B includes a similar requirement for action on fixed penalties.</p><p>Murdo Fraser mentioned the Environment and Rural Development Committee and Richard Lochhead&#8217;s and Rob Gibson&#8217;s membership of it. Our carrier bag charging proposals will reduce bag use and prevent a highly visible, damaging and expensive component of litter and marine litter.</p><p>Unlike the environmental levy that was proposed in 2005, our proposed charge will cover all single-use bags and not just plastic bags, which will prevent switching to materials that have a higher carbon impact, in particular paper. The issue was a major reason why the Environmental Levy on Plastic Bags (Scotland) Bill was rejected.</p><p>We looked in detail at the economic impacts, to ensure that regulations were designed to minimise negative effects. The world has moved on since 2005&#8212;unlike the Tories, perhaps&#8212;and globally there is a greater appetite to tackle the issue, not least in the European Union, which is putting forward a requirement for member states to tackle single-use plastic bags.

I also thank the external stakeholders who have taken the time to engage in the bill process and have shared their knowledge and views during scrutiny.</p><p>As members will, I am sure, highlight, regulation is essential in order to protect our people and environment and to help businesses to flourish and to create jobs. The critical issue is how we best deliver those necessary outcomes. Regulatory reform is a cross-Government agenda that makes a key contribution to the Scottish Government&#8217;s purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth, as expressed in the Government&#8217;s economic strategy. I am pleased to be at a point where we have a bill that will truly make a difference to Scotland, and will bring benefits to our environment, businesses and communities.</p><p>In contrast to the approach in other jurisdictions, where deregulation may be an objective, the purpose of the bill is to streamline regulation and make it more effective. The bill deals with four distinct but connected themes. Part 1 of the bill will help to reduce unnecessary burdens on business. Business has provided examples of growth being constrained by inconsistent application of regulation across Scotland through different forms, different fees and, in some cases, different timescales. The bill includes provisions to define and implement national standards and systems, and will introduce a duty on regulators to contribute to the achievement of sustainable economic growth through their mainstream regulatory activity.</p><p>Regulators will be required to take account of sustainable economic growth where appropriate, and be more accountable for decisions. I will at this point quote section 4(1), which states:</p><p>&#8220;In exercising its regulatory functions, each regulator must contribute to achieving sustainable economic growth, except to the extent that it would be inconsistent with the exercise of those functions to do so&#8221;.</p><p>I make that point because regulators will be supported in that by a new statutory code of practice that will be consulted on shortly.</p><p>It is right to place on regulators the duty to contribute to sustainable economic growth alongside existing or balancing duties. As is made clear in section 4(1) and, specifically in respect of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, in section 38, the bill does not prioritise sustainable economic growth over other regulatory objectives. There is no conflict; instead, there are potential opportunities. The move will ensure greater transparency, and will provide a line of sight to the Scottish Government&#8217;s purpose, which is essential if we are to have consistent delivery across all regulators.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s economic strategy includes a commitment to better regulation in recognition of the fact that, although regulatory outcomes in themselves contribute to sustainable economic growth, how regulators carry out their work in practice, and how they interact with those whom they regulate&#8212;and vice versa&#8212;can also make a significant contribution to supporting business, and hence contribute further to sustainable economic growth. Good regulators seek to understand those whom they regulate by, for example, taking economic and business factors appropriately into account when they carry out their regulatory activities.</p><p>Part 2 of the bill will support SEPA&#8217;s transformation programme and improve the application of environmental regulations in practice across Scotland. The bill will introduce the first statutory purpose for SEPA that is focused not just on the environment, but on health and wellbeing and sustainable economic growth in support of the Government&#8217;s purpose, which is a simplified and integrated framework for environmental regulation to help to unwind complexity, and to give SEPA and the criminal courts new enforcement tools that will have real teeth. Such measures will allow SEPA to target its activity where risk and potential benefits are greatest.</p><p>The way that SEPA works with business and other stakeholders can make a direct contribution to a favourable business environment. I realise that there has been much debate about the point, but I must stress that a good environment is integral to a good economy. As the First Minister said at the world forum on natural capital in November,</p><p>&#8220;Natural capital is one of the ways in which we can tell whether our economic growth is truly sustainable. You can&#8217;t do that if you&#8217;re only thinking about taxation, spending and GDP on a year to year basis, without considering the resources and assets which underpin our prosperity and promote our wellbeing.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed, only this week we had a very constructive discussion at the Scottish biodiversity committee about the natural capital assets index, which of course is a valuable addition to our efforts to go beyond gross domestic product as a measure of success, and to augment the national performance framework.</p><p>Equally, the health of Scotland&#8217;s communities and environment contribute to, are interlinked with and are dependent on the achievement of sustainable economic growth. Economic growth that exceeds the limits of our environment or which damages social and community cohesion is ultimately unsustainable. There are initiatives such as the development of a circular economy that can deliver growth while reducing our resource take.</p><p>Part 3 of the bill further demonstrates the value of achieving the balance in helping to improve the performance of planning authorities by establishing a legislative link between planning fees and performance. On the one hand, we want to be sure that increased funding leads to improved planning performance by authorities; on the other, we recognise planning&#8217;s contribution to protecting and enhancing Scotland&#8217;s natural and built environment to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s people can enjoy a better quality of life.</p><p>By speeding up the process of resolving legal challenges, part 3 will also potentially reduce delays to offshore marine energy projects and will, as a result, help Scotland to achieve its 2020 renewables targets and help to promote growth in that vital industry. The Scottish Government is committed not only to maintaining a business environment that supports sustainable economic growth, but to enhancing Scotland&#8217;s natural and built environment as an asset for growth.</p><p>During parliamentary scrutiny of the bill, we have faced some questions about transparency and accountability. Following amendments at stage 2 and 3, all directions, guidance and codes will be published and, thanks to an amendment that has just been agreed to, Parliament will also have the opportunity to consider an annual report on the operation of part 2 of the bill. That welcome parliamentary input will add value to the Scottish Government&#8217;s better regulation programmes and will help to ensure that future regulation can be proportionate, consistent, transparent, accountable and targeted.</p><p>As well as working closely in partnership with our stakeholders on delivery of better regulation, we are also sharing knowledge and experience across the United Kingdom and the devolved Administrations. Through that partnership approach, we can drive best practice here in Scotland, where our views and experiences can inform others and help to shape future agendas&#8212;for example, in Brussels, where so many regulations are set.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I hope that, in bringing my speech to a close, I have helped with the time for debate. This Government is fully committed to developing better regulation to support sustainable economic growth and to improve protection of our precious environment.

I welcome this debate and the opportunity to discuss how we can respond collectively to the threats and opportunities that Scotland is facing from a changing climate and increasingly unpredictable weather. The latest evidence from the intergovernmental panel on climate change sends a stronger than ever warning that human activity is changing the global climate. The events of the past few weeks are a stark reminder of the importance of action both in preparing for our increasingly unpredictable weather and in moving towards low-carbon living. Rob Gibson was absolutely right to pick up on those issues.</p><p>In November, I attended the United Nations climate summit in Warsaw, which took place against the background of the devastating Philippines typhoon. At Warsaw, the international community agreed what is now a very tight timetable towards a new climate treaty to limit global warming to 2&#176; Celsius to be signed in Paris in December 2015. However, despite the global commitment to reduce emissions, climate change is already presenting challenges for Scotland&#8217;s distinctive biodiversity and habitats, our built environment and infrastructure, and our remote and, indeed, coastal communities, as Rob Gibson identified. The inertia of the climate system means that some degree of further climate change is inevitable over the coming decades.</p><p>The UK&#8217;s first climate change risk assessment, published in 2012, shows the risks to and opportunities for Scotland from a changing climate. We must prepare for those changes to minimise the impact and take advantage of the opportunities, although I suspect that in some cases the opportunities will be smaller than the negative impact of climate change. Our Scottish climate change adaptation programme provides the framework that will build Scotland&#8217;s resilience to the changing climate.</p><p>I am aware that the committee heard evidence from stakeholders representing a wide range of interests; to name but a few, they were the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Transport Scotland, SEPA, NFU Scotland, Scottish Environment LINK, Scottish Natural Heritage, the sustainable Scotland network and the Scotch Whisky Association. That emphasises the wide-ranging nature of the challenge, which presents both threats and opportunities for Scotland&#8217;s economy, environment and people. That is why we are committed to consulting on our first statutory Scottish climate change adaptation programme.</p><p>No one organisation can address that in isolation. There are complex interactions between and within sectors. Success will depend on organisations, businesses and communities across Scotland accepting responsibility and working in partnership if we are to create a Scotland that is increasingly recognised as an attractive, environmentally conscious and climate-resilient place in which to live, work and invest. In doing so, we will be helping to create a more successful country for all and supporting the foundations for long-term economic prosperity. Our adaptation programme provides a framework for everyone in Scotland to contribute towards the delivery of the objectives within their own organisation, business or community.</p><p>The programme reflects the cross-cutting nature of the climate change challenge in the Scottish Government. It draws on action across ministerial portfolios, and my ministerial colleagues were involved in its preparation. I meet regularly with my ministerial colleagues to discuss climate change, and that engagement will continue.</p><p>A number of issues were raised by the committee and respondents to the consultation, not all of which can be covered in the context of this short debate. I have provided a written response to issues that were raised by the committee, and the analysis of the consultation responses was published on the Scottish Government website on 10 January. I will respond now to some of the issues that were raised by the convener in his opening speech. I also intend to pick up on some of the issues that were raised by the committee in my closing speech. In particular, I will clarify in my closing speech the monitoring and reporting arrangements for the programme as well as key issues around flooding, ecosystems and our natural environment. I would welcome members&#8217; views on those issues during the debate.</p><p>The recent festive period illustrated the pressures that severe weather can create. In general terms, the events, which we considered a number of times in the chamber last week, are examples of the adaptation programme in practice, as they involved dealing with issues such as flooding and disruption to transport and energy networks. The Parliament recognised the excellent work of responders, who were informed of and prepared for potential flood risks through the excellent SEPA and Met Office Scottish flood forecasting service. With the help of such systems, they were able to work together effectively to reduce and manage the impacts of the flooding on the affected communities. In addition, the public were directly warned and informed through the floodline direct warning service. I have asked SEPA to consider what more could be done to bring forward the published flood warning strategy.</p><p>Tomorrow, at a pre-planned flooding summit with local authorities, I will help to launch SEPA&#8217;s new flood risk and hazard maps. They are an essential tool in supporting the development of flood risk strategies across Scotland, with actions that will help to target efforts to plan and invest in reducing potential impacts in vulnerable areas. This is a long-term programme of work that involves people collectively taking an innovative, joined-up, multi-agency, strategic response to the longer-term challenges that climate change provides.</p><p>In addition, the Resilience Advisory Board for Scotland, which is the national forum that brings together Scotland&#8217;s statutory and voluntary emergency responder organisations to discuss cross-sector working, will meet on 22 January. Members will discuss lessons learned from the experience of activations in response to recent weather events.</p><p>The important role of the preparations that are made by individuals and communities is recognised, and the Scottish Government has published guidance for communities on community emergency planning on the ready Scotland website. An example of community emergency planning in action during the recent period of severe weather is the great work of members of the Eyemouth resilient communities group in the Scottish Borders. I am sure that Claudia Beamish is familiar with its work. When the community was threatened by flooding in December, the group took part in a multi-agency meeting with statutory emergency responders and it subsequently played an active role, in partnership with Scottish Borders Council, in checking on residents in the harbour area of the town. Through our adaptation programme, we will continue to develop and promote resources that support such capacity building in communities, and through our support for adaptation Scotland we will continue to ensure that there is wider engagement with communities on the objectives of the programme.</p><p>The convener picked up on social justice. Through the adaptation programme, we will continue to support measures to understand the effects of climate change on people, homes and communities and to build communities&#8217; resilience against climate change impacts, and particularly impacts on vulnerable people. We will reflect progress in future adaptation programmes and in our annual reports to the Parliament.</p><p>Wider engagement will be key to delivering our adaptation objectives. Local authorities and other public bodies, businesses, voluntary organisations and communities will be central in helping Scotland to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Our support for adaptation Scotland is a key mechanism through which we are building partnerships and support to deliver our objectives. We are also forging partnerships across the public sector. I chair the public sector climate leaders forum, which includes leaders from across the public and third sectors. Councillor Stephen Hagan is vice-chair of the forum, as well as representing the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. Working together, the members of the forum aim to provide strong and visible leadership across the public sector and beyond, and to ensure that climate change action is driven more consistently across the sector as a whole.</p><p>We are also building partnerships to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change. ClimateXChange exemplifies the partnership approach as it builds on the strengths of each of its partners, ensuring that our response to climate change is based on the best possible scientific evidence.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Climate Change Adaptation Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

Where we can build in measures that provide some spine for what we are trying to achieve, it will be helpful to do so.</p><p>I want to pick up briefly on as many as possible of the points that committee members made. I take on board what Claudia Beamish said about the national performance framework and the other NPF, which is the national planning framework 3. Those are important; we need to consider how the planning system can help to reinforce our intention to make Scotland as resilient as possible.</p><p>Claudia Beamish and Alex Fergusson touched on issues that relate to the farming for a better climate programme. I have written to the committee about that extremely important programme. The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment wants our efforts in that regard to be enhanced, which will not only help with mitigation but will make our farming sector resilient to events such as those to which Alex Fergusson referred. He was right to say that it is about not just flooding&#8212;on which we have been focusing recently&#8212;but that it is also about heat and, in some areas, severe snow, as my constituents and those of Alex Fergusson and Claudia Beamish know well from their experience last year.</p><p>On the SUDS issue that Sarah Boyack raised, we feel that we have a reasonably good track record on those issues in Scotland at least, but we are not complacent. I plan to meet key stakeholders to consider what more can be done on sustainable drainage systems. I have taken the point on board.</p><p>Patrick Harvie referred to the international dimension. He is absolutely right that this is not just about a domestic agenda. Much of our economy would be vulnerable to impacts on the food supply chain. As consumers, we must all take that on board. The next climate change risk assessment that will be undertaken at UK level will focus more on the international dimension; that will feed through to the Scottish Government&#8217;s planning. We will get the evidence on that. I have had some interaction with the Met Office on impacts that might be felt in our key international development partner countries, including Malawi, in order to understand what impacts they face. Those impacts will be severe on the current trajectory on which we are as a planet.</p><p>Angus MacDonald made important points about partnership working. He was absolutely right. In respect of equalities, in the climate justice agenda at home and abroad, we know that often lower-income communities are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. They are usually in lower-quality housing, which is sometimes built on flood plains, so they are at risk. We must take into account equalities issues in reaching conclusions on what strategy we should use, and we must prioritise and target our help at those who are least able to help themselves.</p><p>Jamie Hepburn asked how we are using data in our resilience programme. Ready Scotland&#8217;s, Traffic Scotland&#8217;s and SEPA&#8217;s floodline services are absolutely vital in informing the public about the actions that they can take, such as avoiding journeys where possible, taking alternative routes to work or to meet relatives, or preparing their property for the imminent risk of flooding. Those services are crucial, so we will do as much as we can to ensure that take-up is enhanced. If there was a silver lining to the cloud that came over the festive period, it was the increased take-up of the floodline service, which I was delighted to see. Up to 18,200 people are now registered with the service; that compares to up to 125,000 properties that are known to be at risk from flooding. We are getting there slowly but surely, so I encourage all members to make as many of their constituents as possible aware of the services and to get them to sign up to them where possible.</p><p>I am conscious of the time, so I will close.</p><p>We know that Scotland has to become a more resilient society; that is a key priority for the Government. We are working closely in partnership with local authorities, SEPA, Scottish Water, power companies and the emergency services to ensure that we are doing all that we can to target our efforts and to reduce the risks to our society from changing climate.</p><p>Our adaptation programme will continue to support activities such as SEPA&#8217;s flood risk awareness-raising activities, including floodline. Our natural environment is vulnerable to changes in climate&#8212;it is not just about people&#8212;and we know that many species are threatened by climate change. Some impacts may be irreversible, but we will do what we can as a society to address them. We estimate that Scotland&#8217;s natural environment is worth up to &#163;23&#160;billion per year to the country. That puts in perspective the importance of protecting our environment from the impacts of climate change.</p><p>A number of members mentioned land use. We have a lot of work going on on the regional land use framework pilots; I hope to report back to Parliament on that in due course. We have a solid evidence base, which will continue to develop, for understanding the impacts of climate change on our society. We are already working with the UK Government and other devolved Administrations to develop a further climate change risk assessment, as I mentioned in relation to Mr Harvie&#8217;s point, and we are working with ClimateXChange, which Angus MacDonald mentioned, and the adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change to take forward our strategy.</p><p>Obviously, we are aware that the issue of climate change will become more and more significant for our country, and we are developing our adaptive capacity. I thank organisations including Adaptation Scotland that play an important part in shaping some of that work, and which will continue to support our activity.</p><p>The consultation responses and the committee&#8217;s work are very valuable to the Government, and we have taken on board many of the messages. We will work on finalising our adaptation programme in the near future; I will seek to show the committee and members that we have listened to the points that have been raised and that we will do what we can to ensure that we have a strategy that makes Scotland the most resilient country we can make it; that helps us to adapt to the effects of climate change; that helps us to protect Scotland&#8217;s much-loved natural environment; and which&#8212;of course&#8212;makes us a more resilient country to live and work in.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Climate Change Adaptation Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that they do.

However, over the Christmas and new year period such scenarios were particularly challenging for the families and businesses that had to deal with the impacts and for the people in the responder organisations that are tasked with dealing with the consequences. Our thoughts are with all those people&#8212;thankfully, small in number&#8212;whose Christmas and new year were adversely affected by the weather, whether through short periods of lost power, property flooding or disrupted travel.</p><p>Particular credit must go to the many hundreds of staff across the police and fire and rescue services, local authorities, utility companies and other key organisations, who sacrificed big elements of the Christmas and new year period to ensure a safe and secure festive period for so many people.</p><p>The Scottish Government resilience operation had already been active earlier in December, working on weather issues in partnership with agencies and organisations such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Transport Scotland, Police Scotland, power companies and local authorities, before we experienced the severe weather that impacted on the festive period.</p><p>Thanks to the resilience partnerships&#8217; work across Scotland, responders were given an early warning by the Met Office, in the week before Christmas, of the potential for severe weather. That put all the relevant organisations at national and local level on alert and allowed them to warn the public and inform them of what was expected, what they could do to protect themselves and what mitigating action was being taken by the authorities, including the targeted deployment of staff and resources to the areas that were most likely to be affected.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s resilience room was activated and the emergency committee held 15 meetings from Christmas eve until this week, including on Christmas day, hogmanay and new year&#8217;s day, with involvement throughout from ministers across relevant portfolios and with close involvement from the First Minister. That co-ordinated effort, with the regular sharing of detailed information on the location and level of risk faced by areas across Scotland, helped to ensure that local authorities, the emergency services and the communities that they serve could put in place crucial protection measures and prepare for the worst of the weather impacts.</p><p>Such measures included the use of demountable defences in Oban, which stopped floodwater reaching the heart of the town, and the deployment of Dumfries and Galloway&#8217;s mobile flood pod, which I saw for myself last week and which provided flood protection equipment, including flood gates, to properties in Dumfries and Newton Stewart.</p><p>No one in the Parliament would expect Scotland to be immune from severe weather during the winter months. However, what we have experienced so far, although it is not unprecedented, has been particularly unusual. To compare the recent spell with the numerous periods of stormy weather in the past, the Met Office&#8217;s national climate information centre has done an analysis of the number of weather stations in Scotland that have registered winds over certain thresholds since the start of December. That suggests that December 2013 was one of the stormiest months in Scotland since January 1993. Temperatures for the month were well above average, especially in Scotland&#8212;indeed, for Scotland and for the UK overall, it was the mildest December since 1988.</p><p>With respect to rainfall, it was Scotland&#8217;s wettest December according to records dating back to 1910. Many areas saw nearly twice the average rainfall, and there were few dry spells that would have allowed saturated land to drain and high river, loch and reservoir levels to reduce. For example, Callander received some 540mm of rain in December&#8212;that is 21 inches of rain, or 240 per cent of the average for the area&#8212;with more than 20mm of rain on 18 days.</p><p>We will no doubt face further spells of challenging weather before winter is over. Vigilance remains the key word and our resilience operation will continue actively to monitor the weather and work with partners to identify potential threats and respond accordingly over the coming weeks.</p><p>A widespread flood risk was continually present across the festive period. Indeed, flood warnings have been continually in place for parts of Tayside since mid-December. As at 12.45 this afternoon, seven flood warnings and three flood alerts were still in place in Scotland, despite the relatively improved weather picture over the past few days.</p><p>Although most of the weather that we saw was in line with normal winter expectations, it was unusual to see front after front without a sustained break that would have allowed saturated ground and river catchments to recover from the abnormally high levels of rainfall. That effect was combined with the effects of tidal surges in the west and east, and, in places, very strong winds, which created periods of coastal flood risk.</p><p>Some smaller catchments are particularly responsive to severe rainfall events, as I saw when I visited Jedburgh in my capacity as a regional member. Parts of Dumfries and Galloway, the Borders and Ayrshire saw some of the worst flooding in living memory, while communities on large parts of the west coast, in the islands, along the various east coast firths and in the north-east experienced the damaging effects of storm surges, high tides and severe gales.</p><p>The joint SEPA-Met Office Scottish flood forecasting service was active in providing early guidance on flood risk to local responders, which was invaluable in allowing them to put in place measures to respond to potential flooding. Unfortunately, it was not possible to prevent flooding everywhere, but the efforts of our responders consistently helped to mitigate its impacts. I heard at first hand how important that early notification was during my visit to see the effects of flooding in Dumfries and in visiting Govan police station to witness the preparedness efforts against coastal flooding.</p><p>In addition to undertaking work proactively to support the emergency responders, SEPA engaged directly with the public through its excellent floodline direct warning system, providing flood warnings and alerts to the public that allowed them to make informed decisions about how to manage their own potential flood risk. Over the past month, SEPA issued a total of 360 flood alert and flood warning messages, which meant that there were almost 100,000 text or telephone alerts to customers registered with floodline. Since mid-December, SEPA has had 1,250 new registrations to its floodline service&#8212;an increase of 7 per cent&#8212;meaning that almost 18,200 people across flood-vulnerable areas of Scotland are now registered for that valuable service. It is an invaluable resource, and I encourage members to publicise it to further increase registrations.</p><p>I am sure that members will also support me in reiterating my thanks to emergency responders across Scotland. Despite their own personal commitments and desires for the festive period, they were consistently available and active in taking proportionate responses to identified flood risks and protecting our communities. That preparedness was essential and invaluable, but, in terms of flood risk management, it is only part of the picture. Next week, I will host a summit with local authorities and other key partners, such as Scottish Water and SEPA, at which we will take stock of the work that will culminate during the latter stages of 2014-15 to produce the first ever round of flood risk management plans. Those are informed by SEPA&#8217;s work on producing our first ever national flood risk assessment and the new flood risk and hazard maps that SEPA will publicise next week, which identify the sources and receptors of flood risk, including by mapping velocity and the depth of flows to inform local responders. That work will inform flood risk management strategies throughout Scotland and will support us in targeting efforts to plan and invest in the reduction of impacts in areas that are vulnerable to flooding.</p><p>Investment is essential to support efforts to manage and, where possible, reduce flood risk. In the light of this demonstration of the potential impacts that flooding can have on communities, businesses, transport networks and individuals, I reiterate that flood risk management is a priority for the Scottish Government. Only a relatively small number of properties have been damaged by localised flooding, and we have not experienced the significant damage or disruption that have been seen in other parts of the UK, to which I extend my sympathies. The benefit of the flood warning and flood risk management actions demonstrates value from our investment.</p><p>We have continuously maintained and protected our support for SEPA and, in conjunction with our partners in the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, we have maintained the element of the local authority settlement that is identified for flood protection. The Scottish Government has continued to invest in supporting actions to reduce flood risk, including protecting SEPA&#8217;s budget at &#163;37.5 million and increasing it, in challenging financial circumstances, to &#163;39.5 million in 2015-16. Local authorities can also apply for funding for large new flood protection schemes using capital funding worth &#163;42 million a year. That investment is making a difference and will stand us in good stead. We will aim to maintain it as we move forward, recognising that climate change raises an expectation of more frequent severe weather events, not least because of recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections of 0.26m to 0.83m increases in global sea levels, which would see our sea defences come under ever-increasing pressure.</p><p>Over the immediate Christmas period, around 26,000 customers experienced power disruption due the extreme high winds. However, the majority of those customers in locations right across Scotland were reconnected within a few hours and very few were without power for more than 24 hours. During the rest of the festive period, a small number of customers&#8212;hundreds rather than thousands&#8212;suffered power outages at various points but power was restored to almost all of them within hours, which was a remarkable effort given that it was achieved despite very testing conditions.</p><p>Both Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy Power Distribution deal with harsh conditions every winter in Scotland and, as a result, they were well prepared for the situation that arose. The 875 linesmen, engineers, contractors and tree cutters and the more than 140 call centre staff who, in many cases, gave up their own time deserve our thanks for their efforts in very challenging conditions. [Applause.] Both companies deserve our praise and recognition for their tremendous efforts in Scotland over the festive period. My colleague Fergus Ewing has written to the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets to show the Scottish Government&#8217;s support for the efforts of Scottish Power and SSE, which must be properly recognised in the post mortem that Ofgem is currently undertaking.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s transport network stood up remarkably well to the severe weather conditions and, through the swift action of dedicated staff, disruption was kept to a minimum. Inevitably, given the storm force winds and terrible sea conditions, our ferry services were worst hit, but operators tried to be as flexible as possible and to make journeys when it was safe to do so. That included CalMac Ferries taking the unprecedented step of running special sailings to North Uist and Harris on Christmas day and, again, we should recognise and applaud the public spiritedness of CalMac staff. [Applause.]</p><p>Transport Scotland&#8217;s traffic control centre was active in monitoring the situation. Keith Brown, the Minister for Transport and Veterans, was involved throughout, and the multi-agency co-ordination team was called up to help manage emerging issues.</p><p>In recognition of the financial burden that severe weather incidents and their impacts can place on local authorities, on behalf of the Scottish Government, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, John Swinney, formally triggered the Bellwin scheme on hogmanay.</p><p>As I said, the weather that Scotland has faced over the past two weeks may not have been unprecedented, but it has been particularly unusual and presented challenges for responders and the communities that they sought to protect. The same could be said about the response of the many authorities and organisations involved in keeping Scotland running. It was not an unprecedented response&#8212;they are all well practised in working in partnership&#8212;but it was unusual and, indeed, exceptional, given the scale of the response and the sacrifice of many who gave up their festive celebrations to make sure that others could enjoy theirs.</p><p>We always look to learn lessons, but we can be proud that when a severe test was presented Scotland&#8217;s responders demonstrated that they were resilient in the face of that challenge.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22827562", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Severe Winter Weather"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to update the Parliament on the impacts across Scotland of the severe winter weather that we have experienced over the festive period, and to give details of the tremendous work that has been carried out by the emergency services, other responders, local communities and individuals to mitigate the impacts of the storms during the past two weeks.

The flood warning systems that it has in place are of huge value, as I heard directly from responders in Dumfries and elsewhere. For operators of key industrial sites such as Grangemouth, having the ability to predict, within very tight margins, at what time of day flood waters will hit has been hugely helpful, just as it has been for local responders.</p><p>On flood risk plans and the new maps that are being produced, I met David Sigsworth, James Curran and colleagues this morning to get an update. They met the December deadline&#8212;just&#8212;for providing the maps. That was a challenging task that involved the marshalling of a huge amount of data from local authorities. In some cases, local authorities said that, in effect, the requirement to provide data to underpin the maps doubled the amount of data that they have to store at local authority level. That gives members an idea of the scale of the task that is involved.</p><p>It will be challenging to meet the deadline to have the maps finalised and the action plans put in place, but we are still aiming to meet it. If there are resource issues, the Government will try to do what it can to assist SEPA. There is a capacity issue with the number of quality hydrologists who are available to us. In the past, we have tried to pump-prime the number of hydrologists coming through the university sector to underpin the workforce that we need.

First, however, I should wish the zoo a happy anniversary on its 100th year of operation. The zoo is operated by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and is one of Scotland&#8217;s most successful and beloved visitor attractions, as members have said. Many generations of Scots have enjoyed visits to the zoo in the 100 years since it opened; I count myself and my son among them. No doubt many members of the public in the gallery have also attended the zoo.</p><p>The zoo now welcomes more than 600,000 visitors each year and has more than 1,000 animals in its collection, including many rare and endangered species. However, Edinburgh zoo is much more than a successful visitor attraction; it is a leading centre in Europe for conservation, education and research, and has been at the forefront of new approaches that have focused on improving the welfare of the animals in its care. It works collectively with many other zoos and conservation agencies in the UK, Europe and around the world in co-ordinated conservation programmes, to help to ensure the survival of many species that are under threat.</p><p>Because Edinburgh zoo&#8217;s work is low profile and does not generate headlines, many people will be unaware of its quality and importance, which is why this debate is so important. Last year, for example, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland received an award from the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums for its breeding and conservation work with the critically endangered Polynesian tree snail, which I was not aware of, I must confess. The snail, many species of which are sadly extinct in the wild, is being reintroduced to Tahiti. That demonstrates the zoo&#8217;s international role in helping other societies deal with biodiversity issues.</p><p>The RZSS was also highly commended for its groundbreaking work on and advances in zoo and wildlife medicine&#8212;including the surgery that Cameron Buchanan touched on, which demonstrate the welfare advantages of keyhole surgery to assess and treat gall bladder and liver disease in Asiatic black bears, which result from the illegal bile-farming trade in Cambodia and Vietnam.</p><p>Edinburgh zoo and the Highland wildlife park, which is also operated by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, are part of a European network of zoos under the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria. With 345 member institutions across 41 countries, the association operates a two-tier breeding programme, a European studbook and a programme for endangered species. Staff at the zoo and the wildlife park manage no fewer than 12 studbooks under those programmes, covering species such as the gentoo penguin and the west African crowned crane.</p><p>The zoo supports a wide range of targeted research projects over six key areas: conservation genetics, ecology, nutrition, population management, behavioural research and veterinary research. For example, it carries out applied research and collaboration projects on various aspects of zoo animal nutrition.</p><p>My colleague Alex Salmond, the First Minister, recently met Professor Chris West and Professor Jeremy Peat, respectively the chief executive and chair of the board of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. At that meeting, the First Minister conveyed the Scottish Government&#8217;s support for the society&#8217;s work&#8212;in particular, its contribution to global giant panda conservation.</p><p>In September this year, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and Edinburgh zoo, the proud custodians of Tian Tian and Yang Guang, also successfully hosted the giant panda research symposium, which was attended by some of the world&#8217;s top scientists and researchers. Those experts came together for the first time to discuss and formulate a five-year plan of action for global panda research and breeding. The plan will have significant implications for how giant pandas are cared for in China and in zoos around the world.</p><p>As part of the 10-year loan agreement that brought Tian Tian and Yang Guang to Edinburgh zoo, the society is involved in a programme that will enable comprehensive research on and study of giant pandas to be conducted at Edinburgh zoo by dedicated keepers, researchers and others with expertise across a range of fields. The programme will create a series of joint projects with the zoological society and its China Wildlife Conservation Association partners, which will cover vital giant panda research areas such as embryology, immunology and veterinary medicine.</p><p>At the meeting, the First Minister also discussed the RZSS&#8217;s commitment to Scotland&#8217;s native species. The society is a valued member of the national species reintroduction forum, which advises on current and potential reintroduction projects for species that were once part of Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity, as well as providing a code of best practice for such reintroductions.</p><p>The RZSS and the Scottish Wildlife Trust are important players in the partnership that is running the Scottish beaver trial, which members have mentioned. The trial commenced in 2008 and is a five-year project that is being conducted at a site in Knapdale in Argyll. It aims to examine the suitability of the European beaver for reintroduction, on a national level, to the Scottish landscape, given the various challenges that Colin Keir and others have mentioned. I paid my own visit to the trial site at Easter. I was very impressed with the work that has been done there and&#8212;best of all&#8212;I was lucky enough to spot a beaver kit swimming in the wild in a Scottish loch. That was quite a thrill for me and for all those who were there to witness it.</p><p>The RZSS also provides vital support for the work that is going on in relation to the population of beavers that live in the Tay catchment. The society&#8217;s practical experience in animal handling and its veterinary and genetics work are adding greatly to our understanding and knowledge of the Tayside animals, which are from a different genetic line to those in the official Argyll trial.</p><p>The Trossachs water vole project, with which the RZSS is also closely involved, also commenced in 2008, in the Aberfoyle area of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park. The project has proved to be a great success, with water voles now breeding throughout suitable habitat areas along the Duchray Water and the Kelty Water and colonising many new sites up to 4km from their original release areas</p><p>In addition to its involvement in native species reintroduction, the RZSS is, as has been mentioned, also a key partner in the new Scottish wildcat action plan. Much is riding on the plan to safeguard the future of one of our most charismatic native wildlife species, of which we know far too little. The zoo is playing a huge role in helping us to understand it and the RZSS&#8217;s involvement has included funding and leading research to monitor Scottish wildcats on estates within the Cairngorms national park, as part of the Cairngorms wildcat project. The project, which is a partnership between a variety of interested organisations, was recognised for its innovation at this year&#8217;s prestigious nature of Scotland awards.</p><p>Moreover, the RZSS has been delivering, through its education team at the Highland wildlife park, a schools outreach programme featuring species such as the native Scottish wildcat. The park itself is a wonderful place for visitors to see that elusive and iconic creature, which is the only free-living native forest cat in the British isles. I understand that the park welcomed two new additions to its resident wildcat population earlier this year, so congratulate it on what is a particularly significant success, given the important role that Ness and Einich may play in future captive wildcat breeding projects for their reintroduction into the wild.</p><p>The Scottish Government would like to take this opportunity, for which I again thank Colin Keir, to recognise the many achievements of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and Edinburgh zoo, in the zoo&#8217;s centenary year. I certainly believe that the zoo will continue to meet and, indeed, to exceed its rather modest mission statement, and I hope that it continues to inspire and excite its visitors with the wonder of living animals and&#8212;as David Torrance, Colin Keir and Cameron Buchanan all mentioned&#8212;to connect people to wildlife and conservation. That is particularly important for children; indeed, I am glad to see so many children in the public gallery for this debate.</p><p>Finally, I hope and expect that the zoo will continue its excellent work to promote the conservation of threatened species and habitats both at home and abroad.</p><p>13:02 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:00 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22742616", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Edinburgh Zoo"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "&#8220;Follow that&#8221;, as they say.

Scotland&#8217;s national parks are two of our greatest national assets and are very important for Scotland. I fully recognise their success&#8212;which was outlined by Claire Baker, Sarah Boyack, Claudia Beamish, Alex Fergusson and Christine Grahame&#8212;in protecting species and habitats, promoting tourism, and providing social and economic benefits to the communities that they serve and to the rest of the country.</p><p>Recently, I had the pleasure of chairing two meetings with the national parks and their partners to review progress with the latest five-year partnership plans. I was struck by the extent to which both national parks have a broad range of partners in the public, private and third sectors with which they are working to deliver both locally and on a national scale.</p><p>I met the Scottish Campaign for National Parks and the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland at the beginning of September to discuss the &#8220;Unfinished Business&#8221; report. The meeting included Charles Strang of the APRS, who lives in Yetholm in the Scottish Borders and who is particularly passionate about the Cheviots as a candidate for a national park, and Mr Mayhew. We had a candid exchange of views on the report&#8217;s main recommendations. I welcome the opportunity provided by Claire Baker&#8217;s motion to share my views with members today.</p><p>First, there is the report&#8217;s proposition, which is repeated in the motion, that there should be a long-term national strategy for future national parks in Scotland. I fully understand where the SCNP and the APRS are coming from on that. Nearly half of the report sets out the trials and tribulations of the national park movement in Scotland over the past 65 years. As Alex Fergusson noted, the language used in the report&#8212;for example, &#8220;The Long Struggle&#8221; and &#8220;Unfinished Business&#8221;&#8212;says it all: the SCNP and the APRS think that there is a lot of catching up to do, which I acknowledge. That is why they are now calling for a long-term strategy in which at least seven areas of Scotland would be earmarked for future national park status.</p><p>There are two main reasons why I cannot agree to such a strategy at this time, the first of which is about resources in the current economic climate. It cannot have escaped the attention of the SCNP and the APRS that these are difficult times and that there are considerable pressures on public finances at present. We have suffered an 11 per cent drop in our resource budget and a 26 per cent cut in capital. As members have acknowledged, we simply do not have the resources at this time for new national park authorities, which would of course require set-up costs and a recurrent cost thereafter.</p><p>Secondly, I have said to the SCNP and the APRS that I appreciate that my decision will disappoint them, but I do not think that the suggestion of earmarking areas for possible future national park status is a good one at this time.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22742012", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Many interesting and positive comments have been made about national parks in Scotland.

I will explain why, because I appreciate that that might concern the member.</p><p>In essence, the approach suggests that areas be identified for possible future designation. The Scottish Government&#8217;s sense is that there would be a real danger that that would encourage the various communities to engage in a quasi-bidding process to demonstrate support for seeking national park status. I do not think that such a process was envisaged in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000&#8212;I acknowledge Sarah Boyack&#8217;s close involvement in that&#8212;and I do not think that it is what members would want, either.</p><p>To take such an approach would also be somewhat irresponsible because it would create expectations of designation and would inevitably lead to disappointment for those whose areas were not selected. There was considerable disappointment in Harris, for example, when it was not designated as a national park.</p><p>I will now say a little about the Scottish National Party&#8217;s national park commitment in our 2011 manifesto. I am sure that members are aware of that, although it was not directly raised today. The point that I would like to make is that it is a commitment to engage in discussions with communities and not a commitment to declare a national strategy and let communities respond to that.</p><p>It is instructive to consider the experience of Harris. In 2009, the community in Harris voted in favour of pursuing national park status as a means of addressing population decline and a lack of employment. However, the then Minister for Environment made it clear that she would not consider such designation unless the local authority was supportive. In 2010, Western Isles Council conducted a thorough year-long study of all aspects of what was proposed, including for example the role of a Harris national park in relation to planning, but it concluded that a convincing case had not been made for national park status for Harris.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22742012", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I understand the member&#8217;s point, and I will come on to explain the wider strategy.

It therefore makes absolute sense, from an individual commercial as well as a national economic perspective, that we protect those resources not just for now but for future generations.</p><p>As I said in evidence to the RACCE Committee,</p><p>&#8220;SEPA&#8217;s primary purpose is and will remain the protection and improvement of the environment.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 5 June 2013; c 2323.]</p><p>That includes the sustainable management of natural resources.</p><p>At present, both SEPA and the businesses it regulates operate in an unnecessarily complex legislative landscape. Much of that is down to the iterative way in which regulation has been developed over the years, particularly given the significant requirements created by Europe. It has resulted in complexity and a lack of transparency for regulated sectors and businesses. The new framework that the bill will deliver will be easier for regulated businesses and SEPA to understand and administer. That will lead to efficiencies for both and, it is hoped, improved compliance levels.</p><p>As a result of the bill and as part of our wider better environmental regulation programme, SEPA will change the way in which it prioritises its regulatory activities. That will ensure that its resources are directed towards the most important, highest-risk activities that have the greatest actual or potential environmental impact on communities. Most of all, the bill will protect our environment and, in the round, reward and encourage good behaviour. Let us help to prevent non-compliance rather than mop up breaches after the fact.</p><p>The bill is not a leap into the unknown. We already have an example of better environmental regulation in the way in which the water framework directive has been implemented in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will come on to that point, and I hope that Jenny Marra will understand as I develop my speech just how we will take forward the approach.

I hope to explore those issues further as I develop my speech, but I will happily come back to Ms Marra&#8217;s point later.</p><p>The implementation of the water framework directive has enabled the creation of a single permissioning structure and simpler, more consistent procedures. That is similar in approach to the model that we intend to introduce for the other regimes. The benefits of that approach have included: excellent stakeholder engagement; close working between the regulator and the regulated; a better understanding of regulations; and a simpler, more efficient regulatory service. The European Commissioner for the Environment, Janez Potocnik, praised Scotland&#8217;s approach as an exemplar when he visited the Royal Highland Show earlier this year.</p><p>Improving regulation is an important agenda not only in Scotland but elsewhere in the United Kingdom and across Europe. However, it is important to recognise that, while the agenda elsewhere is focused on deregulation or a &#8220;bonfire of red tape&#8221;, our agenda is clearly focused on better regulation and on ensuring that things work effectively for regulators and those that they regulate. Our vision is for Scotland to be a world leader in environmental protection, and I believe that the best way to achieve that is through creating a system of consistent, proportionate and targeted regulation that works.</p><p>The statutory purpose for SEPA that the bill will introduce will give recognition to the broader role that SEPA has and recognise the importance of the environment to our economy and to the health and wellbeing of our communities. It is important to note that, although the purpose is new, the need to balance environmental, economic and social considerations is not. As we heard in the evidence to committees, balancing judgments are already taken by SEPA, Scottish Natural Heritage and other regulators on a daily basis. The new statutory purpose for SEPA will formalise what is already current practice and will help to provide a line of sight from the Scottish Government&#8217;s purpose to what our public bodies deliver.</p><p>Let me reiterate for the record that we reject the argument that our agenda is about sacrificing the environment to promote economic growth, as some have suggested. As is right and proper, SEPA&#8217;s primary purpose is, and will remain, the protection and improvement of the environment. Section 38 of the bill gives primacy to the function of environmental protection, including the sustainable management of natural resources. That will always be at the top of SEPA&#8217;s hierarchy of responsibilities. However, the approach reflects the fact that we cannot look at issues in isolation.</p><p>The fundamental principle of sustainable development is that it integrates economic, social and environmental objectives. SEPA&#8217;s new statutory purpose acknowledges the three elements of sustainable development but gives clear primacy to the environmental element. I want to be clear in placing that point on record.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The bill includes a number of measures that are required.

Although the term &#8220;sustainable development&#8221; may not be used, the three pillars&#8212;if you like&#8212;of sustainable development are included in the bill in a clearer and more explicit way than would be the case if there was simply a reference to &#8220;sustainable development&#8221;.</p><p>Let me be equally clear that the duty to contribute to sustainable economic growth will not replace the duties that bodies have as regards sustainable development. Ministers will continue to give guidance on sustainable development in line with statutory obligations.</p><p>The bill will also give SEPA a wider, more strategic range of enforcement tools to deploy. Combined with the new sentencing options that are being given to the criminal courts, those will play a key role in tackling poor performance and non-compliance. The polluter-pays principle is already widely accepted and supported. The proportionate enforcement powers that we propose will ensure that the offenders pay the price for remedying damage that is done to the environment.</p><p>All responsible businesses, large and small, will benefit from an effective environment protection system for Scotland. By focusing resources on the greatest environmental harms, SEPA can more effectively target lawbreakers, support non-compliers to become compliant with regulations, and protect communities and our natural environment. To put the new enforcement tools in context, SEPA&#8217;s approach has been, and will continue to be, about achieving the right outcomes. Sometimes that needs enforcement tools, but sometimes it does not.</p><p>This morning, I opened a conference in Peebles at which the focus is on the approach that we have taken in Scotland to reducing diffuse pollution. That approach has involved SEPA in a programme of partnership working with the rural sector. There is always the need for a regulatory backstop but, to achieve the maximum benefit for water quality, SEPA has worked closely with the sector and farmers through a campaign to provide advice on compliance with the diffuse pollution general binding rules and to improve performance.</p><p>The outcome of that approach has been encouraging, with 79 per cent of farms that have been revisited by SEPA having improved their performance without the need to revert to enforcement measures. That is a clear example of the proportionate and effective approach that SEPA has taken and wants to continue to take in other areas. The conference has attracted interest from Government, regulators and the rural sector across the rest of the UK. Further, our approach has been quoted by Commissioner Potocnik as an exemplar in Europe, and a recent Chinese delegation is considering how the approach could be adopted in China.</p><p>Let me be clear that, where individuals and businesses deliberately or negligently damage the environment, the powers in the bill will enable SEPA to take robust enforcement action. Criminality will not be tolerated. During a visit to a waste site on the outskirts of Edinburgh earlier this year, I was horrified to hear evidence of serious threats of violence being made against SEPA officers and in some cases their families, as well as evidence of stalking of SEPA officers on social media. That is totally unacceptable. I can therefore confirm that the bill will be supported by a stage 2 amendment that will make such behaviour a specific offence.</p><p>As I said at the outset, I welcome the vital contribution that stakeholders have made to the development of the bill. I also acknowledge and appreciate that there are diverse and strongly held views on a number of areas that the bill covers. We are committed to working with stakeholders, and I encourage all stakeholders to continue to engage to help shape the work. The bill is largely an enabling bill, and much of the detail will be set out in regulations. Our door remains open for stakeholders to help shape the development of those regulations and their associated guidelines.</p><p>The bill is not about introducing new regulations; it is about strengthening the effectiveness of regulations that the Parliament has approved. It is about delivering better regulation. We have strong stakeholder support for much of that work, which will deliver greater regulatory consistency and transparency, efficiency benefits for regulators and the regulated, and protection of the Scottish public, businesses, communities and the environment. However, some will not benefit from the work: serial poor performers, who are a burden on their competitors and a risk to sustainable economic growth and all that it stands for.</p><p>I commend the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill to the Parliament and I urge members to support the principles underlying it at decision time.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I point out to Ms Beamish that, as I hope to explore further, section 38 establishes SEPA&#8217;s three areas of responsibility: health and wellbeing, which represents the social dimension; sustainable economic growth, which represents the economic argument; and, above both, environmental protection and the sustainable management of natural resources.

I know from my recent visit to the Galloway forest that Aileen McLeod takes a very keen interest in forestry issues and that interest has been demonstrated by the depth and quality of her speech.</p><p>Aileen McLeod&#8217;s motion invites us to recognise the establishment of Scotland&#8217;s first woodlot licence and the value of encouraging initiatives that enable more people to share in the benefits of Scotland&#8217;s trees, woods and forests and through that to contribute to the stewardship of our woodland resources. I should say that I commend the collaboration between the Scottish Woodlot Association and Mr Carrick-Buchanan and will watch its progress with great interest. Breaking new ground and establishing new ways of working require commitment and I am glad to hear that, although the collaboration was initially viewed as a pilot, the aspiration is for it to become a longer-term arrangement.</p><p>Given that our nation has used and benefited from several native Canadian trees such as the Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, it is perhaps appropriate that we seek to learn from Canadian forest management techniques. I acknowledge Alex Fergusson&#8217;s comment that we should perhaps have invented the idea ourselves, but it is great that it has come to light and I thank the association for bringing it to our attention. Although the Canadian woodlots model has not been imported in its exact form from British Columbia to Dumfries and Galloway and although the scale of the woodlots is perhaps smaller in Scotland, the two approaches share a number of similar aspirations, including a desire to increase people&#8217;s involvement in forestry and improve the condition of unmanaged woods. Indeed, that latter point is crucial, given how diseases such as Dothistroma pine needle blight can thrive in poorly managed conifer plantations. This is therefore a very practical measure that can be taken.</p><p>The association&#8217;s website illustrates the desire of both parties involved in the first licence to make the project work and the clear ambition to reintroduce sustainable forest management to areas of forest that, for whatever reason, have been neglected in the past. I am therefore pleased and greatly encouraged by the fact that private woodland owners are embracing this novel initiative. With 60 per cent of our country&#8217;s woodlands in private ownership, there is much scope to develop these kinds of models and apply them more widely with, as a number of members have pointed out, a number of benefits to people and our environment.</p><p>Private sector support has been echoed by Scottish Land &amp; Estates, which has told me that it supports this initiative and wants to explore it further with its members. In fact, it has commended the Scottish Woodlot Association for its pragmatic approach to developing this idea. I also applaud the way in which the pilot has sought to marry up people interested and skilled in managing forests with areas of woodland that need such management. It is an example of how to make the best use of another of our country&#8217;s greatest assets&#8212;its people&#8212;in the stewardship of our natural resources.</p><p>If managed appropriately and sustainably, our trees, woods and forests can deliver significant benefits. They provide, as Mike MacKenzie, Alex Fergusson and Joan McAlpine have pointed out, economic value from timber products and jobs; provide health and wellbeing benefits to those who use and enjoy them; and are, of course, home to some of our country&#8217;s iconic and important wildlife such as the red squirrel and the capercaillie. Our challenge is to ensure that such benefits are available to people across the country, whether they be owners, managers or users. I greatly welcome the fact that, although the issue has been raised in a south of Scotland context, Jean Urquhart, Mike MacKenzie and Rob Gibson have shown support for the initiative and I hope that it is taken forward elsewhere in the country. The link between people and their forest land is a core element of the Scottish Government&#8217;s land use strategy, a key objective of which is to promote</p><p>&#8220;Responsible stewardship of Scotland&#8217;s natural resources delivering more benefits to Scotland&#8217;s people&#8221;,</p><p>and this project is as good a demonstration as we can find of that objective in practice.</p><p>The commitment to engage people in ways that best suit the participants and circumstances is also a core focus of the Scottish forestry strategy, which has at its heart the principle of</p><p>&#8220;Forestry for and with people.&#8221;</p><p>The initiative that we have been debating is an excellent example of what we hope to achieve through the strategies, led and supported by enterprising, energetic and enthusiastic people. It adds to the growing number of approaches that are being taken by woodland owners, whether they are private, community or public woodland owners. It is very good to see such diversity developing. I am also greatly encouraged by the leadership that is being demonstrated by the private sector in helping to deliver our collective ambition to make the forestry resource</p><p>&#8220;a central part of our culture, economy and environment.&#8221;</p><p>For the record, I hope that it will be taken into account that it is also possible for community owners to adopt the model and to deploy a similar approach to facilitating woodlots. Perhaps acquiring part of a site that is woodland is not necessarily the core function of their community ownership model, but that is a good way of ensuring that that asset is managed properly and that we can&#8212;to address a point that Joan McAlpine raised, I think&#8212;try to reverse depopulation in some communities in which that has been a significant issue.</p><p>The particular woodlot initiative that we are discussing marks another step in our collective journey to help urban and rural people and their communities to become better connected to the land. The strengthening links between Scotland&#8217;s land and its people will help to build resilient communities and make the most of our rich natural assets for all Scotland&#8217;s people to flourish.</p><p>I will use my remaining time to make a couple of plugs. As we have talked about trees and Joan McAlpine is in the chamber, I remind people that the consultation on Scotland&#8217;s national tree is still open. We would welcome any further inputs into that consultation. I also welcome the point that Joan McAlpine made about opportunities to engage young people in the sector. There are important opportunities for training and getting young people into the sector and developing their skills.</p><p>Alex Fergusson, Mike MacKenzie and Jean Urquhart talked about small-scale, decentralised forestry operations and the Scandinavian model. Indeed, Jean Urquhart talked about family forestry. Those were all important points. The initiative offers an opportunity to strengthen and facilitate that agenda.</p><p>I agree 100 per cent with Mike MacKenzie&#8217;s point about the use of timber in construction. That is why I strongly encourage the development of the wood first initiative in our second report on proposals and policies as a means by which we can try to make more use of timber in the construction process. Mike MacKenzie is absolutely right about its low-carbon potential.</p><p>Aileen McLeod made valid points about the linkage to tourism and the fact that the 7stanes project across the south of Scotland is a tremendous asset.</p><p>Tackling Phytophthora ramorum in larch might not be directly linked to what we are discussing, but, as I mentioned, there is a general message regarding Dothistroma, which is that by managing the forests more appropriately we can manage disease risks in a changing climate.</p><p>I will take up Aileen McLeod&#8217;s offer to meet the Scottish Woodlot Association at a time that suits it. I am very interested in hearing more from it.</p><p>In conclusion, I greatly look forward to following the progress of the first woodlot initiative in Galloway, and most important, I look forward to discovering how it can be taken forward more widely.</p><p>I thank Aileen McLeod for bringing the issue to the chamber.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:38.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715934", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Woodlot Association"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am most grateful to members for their valuable speeches in this debate and congratulate Dr Aileen McLeod on bringing forward this important issue.

Indeed, the debate has been of great quality and has shown the different perspectives that people have on the issue.</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises and values the important work, including that of the Dogs Trust, that many animal welfare charities and organisations undertake in rescuing and rehoming unwanted animals across Scotland. If nothing else, the debate has highlighted the importance and value of owners voluntarily microchipping their dogs. Indeed, a number of members mentioned the support available from the Dogs Trust to fund the cost. I hope that the media coverage of the debate will at least pick up on that and remind people of that opportunity.</p><p>As Claire Baker and Kenneth Gibson identified, we have long recognised the benefits of microchipping. That is why we recommended it as best practice in our &#8220;Code of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs&#8221;, which was published in 2010. Microchipping can prove an invaluable tool in helping to reunite lost, stolen or straying dogs with their owners and, potentially, to reduce the number of healthy dogs being put to sleep. I agree with members that that is an extremely distressing consequence of dogs not being microchipped or reunited with their owners.</p><p>The Scottish Government is also aware that many welfare organisations, groups and individuals in favour of the introduction of compulsory microchipping in Scotland believe that it will help to tackle the problem of puppy farming and the many health and welfare problems that it creates, which Claire Baker referred to earlier. They also consider that compulsory microchipping could prove helpful in raising a better awareness of the duty of care that owners have to their pets, thereby fostering a culture of more responsible ownership. Indeed, the very horrific incidents that Jenny Marra and Nanette Milne referred to illustrate why we need a culture of responsible dog ownership in this country.</p><p>My colleague Richard Lochhead MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, met Nanette Milne and representatives of the Dogs Trust in May this year to discuss compulsory microchipping of all dogs in Scotland. At that meeting, the Dogs Trust highlighted the recent YouGov poll to which Claire Baker referred, which showed that 82 per cent of the Scottish adults surveyed support the introduction of compulsory microchipping for all dogs in Scotland. The Dogs Trust also advised that it currently offers free chipping by appointment at any Dogs Trust centre and will offer a free microchipping scheme for a limited period in Wales and England in advance of compulsory microchipping. The Dogs Trust has assured the Scottish Government that, if compulsory microchipping is introduced in Scotland, it would offer a similar free chipping scheme here for a limited period.</p><p>At that meeting, the Scottish Government agreed to issue a formal consultation on the introduction of compulsory microchipping for all dogs in Scotland. However, we still have some concerns, particularly about the cost and practicalities of enforcement, which I will outline. The effective enforcement of compulsory microchipping for all dogs could prove relatively resource intensive. I understand that, currently, local authority animal welfare officers cover a wide range of duties in addition to dog welfare and not every local authority has the resources available to offer a dedicated dog warden service in its area. Indeed, Jenny Marra pointed out that some dog owners are not aware of local authorities&#8217; ability to enforce dog control measures, which is interesting indeed. Although compulsory microchipping would reduce the financial burden that local authorities currently face when dealing with stray dogs, it could create a new burden in terms of the allocation of available resources to enforce new legislation.</p><p>The Dogs Trust has committed to offering a free chipping scheme in Scotland for a limited period should compulsory microchipping be introduced. We appreciate that that generous service would help those on lower incomes to microchip their dogs, but we still have some concerns about the on-going associated costs for dog owners in ensuring that their details are accurate and up to date. It is important to note that at present costs vary between database companies, but owners who are having their pet chipped might not be aware of that factor, nor have a choice about which database company their details are registered with. My understanding of what is happening in England and Wales is that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Welsh Assembly Government have no intention of operating a central or local authority database. Similarly, we would continue to rely on existing commercial databases; at least, that would appear to be the likely outcome. However, it is important to remember that at present microchipping costs vary.</p><p>Irresponsible owners who allow their dogs to be out of control are already required to microchip their dogs if they receive a dog control notice under the Control of Dogs (Scotland) Act 2010. I, too, congratulate Christine Grahame on bringing forward that legislation, which makes it easier for local authority-appointed authorised officers to monitor and enforce dog control notices that have been issued.</p><p>I should also say that earlier this week the Justice Committee took evidence on provisions contained in the UK Government&#8217;s Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill. The Scottish Government is seeking to extend, by way of a legislative consent motion, provisions to Scotland that would explicitly make attacks on assistance dogs an aggravated offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and would ensure that courts assess the character of the owner in determining whether a dog poses a danger to public safety. That is obviously an important point in relation to guide dogs and other dogs that assist people with disabilities.</p><p>The Scottish Government is fully aware of the move towards compulsory microchipping throughout the rest of the UK. We understand that England plans to bring in compulsory microchipping for dogs as part of its wider dog controls in 2016. As others have said, Wales plans to make regulations to ensure that all dogs are microchipped by March 2015.</p><p>We are aware that compulsory microchipping has been in force in Northern Ireland since April 2012, after having been made a requirement for obtaining a dog licence under the Dogs (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland) 2011.</p><p>At the British Veterinary Association&#8217;s annual Scottish dinner in June, my colleague Richard Lochhead made a speech reinforcing the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to consult on compulsory microchipping and announcing that that would take place by the end of 2013. The precise detail of the timetable has to be identified, but that gives an indication of the timing of the consultation. The consultation is currently being drafted and in it we will seek the views of the Scottish people, Scotland&#8217;s local authorities, animal welfare charities and organisations and all other interested parties, particularly on the issue of enforcement and the potential impact of introducing compulsory microchipping in Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Government will continue to work on this issue to the timescale that we have announced and will consider what is best for Scotland before it makes a decision. If we decide to go ahead with compulsory microchipping for all dogs, we would expect to be able to introduce it around the same time as in England.</p><p>13:11 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dogs (Compulsory Microchipping)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Claire Baker on bringing to the chamber today an important subject for debate.

I set on record once again my thanks to the four parliamentary committees that scrutinised the draft RPP2, and to the many stakeholders who contributed their views to that process and who continue to keep the profile of climate change action high. WWF Scotland&#8217;s Twitter campaign earlier this month is the latest example of that and, as I have said, I am proud to live in a country where so many people care about climate change.</p><p>The two documents that I am publishing today tell two parts of the same story: our progress to date and our ambition for the future. The report on the annual target for 2011 shows that between 2010 and 2011, Scottish emissions fell sharply, by 9.9 per cent, to 51.3 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. That was the biggest single year-on-year decrease since regular reporting of emissions began in 1998. The fall is bigger than the increase that was experienced in 2010 as a result of the record cold weather that year.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s target for 2011 requires that greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed 53.4 megatonnes. Our unadjusted emissions are some 2.1 megatonnes below that limit. However, our targets are measured using adjusted figures in the net Scottish emissions account, which factor in the emissions allowances that have been allocated to the Scottish installations that participate in the European Union emission trading system&#8212;primarily our thermal power stations and other heavy industry. Using those adjusted figures, the net Scottish emissions account for 2011 was 54.25 megatonnes, which exceeded the annual target by 0.85 megatonnes.</p><p>To have missed the 2011 target is extremely disappointing, particularly given circumstances in which actual emissions&#8212;as opposed to adjusted emissions&#8212;are at record levels below the 1990 baseline. Without wishing to get bogged down in technicalities, I note that the level of the emissions baseline is critically important. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 is framed in a way that requires emissions targets to be set in absolute terms&#8212;53.4 megatonnes, in the case of 2011. However, work is being carried out continually to improve the accuracy of the actual emissions data that we use&#8212;the greenhouse gas inventory. That means that, although the targets are fixed, in effect we have a floating baseline.</p><p>Circumstances have been such that our understanding of Scotland&#8217;s emissions baseline has changed considerably in recent years. Revisions to the three editions of the greenhouse gas inventory that have been published since Parliament set the annual targets for 2010 to 2027 have added more than 2 million tonnes of extra emissions to almost every year since 1990, and in the region of 2.8 megatonnes to 1990 itself.</p><p>Those changes do not represent new emissions; rather, we have identified emissions that were not known about when Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets were set, which has made reaching those targets much more challenging. However, the challenges posed by those changes in baseline should not mask the achievements that Scotland has made and continues to make.</p><p>Our adjusted net emissions have fallen by 25.7 per cent since 1990, which is considerably more than the 23.9 per cent envisaged for 2011 when the annual targets were originally set. Similarly, the annual targets for 2010 and 2011 require that net emissions reduce by 0.46 per cent year on year. The actual reported reduction was 2.9 per cent, which is more than six times as much. In fact, it is worth noting that, had the 2011 annual target been updated to reflect the higher baseline in the 2011 inventory, it would have been met with around 1.26 megatonnes to spare.</p><p>When we look across Europe we see that, on a like-for-like basis, Scotland has achieved greater cuts in emissions than any member state in the EU 15 and has significantly outperformed the average for the EU 27. The trend is going in the right direction. We are determined to do more and ensure that emissions fall even more quickly, to secure a truly low-carbon future. The package of proposals and policies set out in RPP2 and the commitment that they represent is an important part of that.</p><p>However, it is clear that the basis on which this Parliament set Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets has changed significantly over the past few years. That is something that the Scottish Government will keep under review.</p><p>The impact of the latest data revisions is also felt in the level of emissions reported for 2010. Whereas last year we reported that the net Scottish emissions account for 2010 was 1.06 megatonnes above that year&#8217;s annual target, the latest inventory has adjusted that up to 2.27 megatonnes. We set out in the draft RPP2 that we intended to compensate for the excess emissions in 2010 by delivering greater emissions cuts over the long term. Our approach remains the same for 2011 emissions and for the final version of RPP2.</p><p>Making the low-carbon transition is a long-term project, and, as I have indicated, the long-term trend is a good one. Our current policies, plus the proposals outlined in RPP2, have the potential to outperform our emissions targets to 2027 by more than 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, even before we factor in the impact that stronger action in Europe would have. If the EU were to increase its 2020 emissions target from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, the package of measures in RPP2 would have the potential to outperform our targets by more than 18 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets were based on the assumption that the EU would make that move and, as a consequence, strengthen the cap on its emission trading system. When this Parliament passed the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, we were looking forward to the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, in the expectation that an international deal would be agreed that would precipitate the EU moving to a target of 30 per cent. As yet, unfortunately, the disappointment of Copenhagen and faltering progress at subsequent international climate change negotiations have prevented that move from happening. We believe that, given that it is set to overachieve against its 20 per cent target, the EU can, should and will improve its current position, and we will continue to press for that.</p><p>The final version of RPP2 that we are publishing today has been revised to take into account many of the recommendations that were made in respect of the draft version. The changes are too numerous to go through individually this afternoon, but they are set out in the written statement that I have laid alongside RPP2. I have also written to Rob Gibson, Murdo Fraser, Maureen Watt and Kevin Stewart, as conveners of the four committees that scrutinised the draft report.</p><p>RPP2 remains a broad-ranging and complex report but we have tried, where we can, to include more information to better explain the points of complexity. We have also responded to concerns that it was difficult to read across from RPP1, so we have added tables in the sectoral chapters summarising progress relating to the proposals and policies.</p><p>The importance of behaviour change was a subject that witnesses and committees returned to regularly during the scrutiny period. Clearly, any efforts to reduce Scotland&#8217;s emissions depend heavily on the way people choose to consume goods and energy. Many of the policies and proposals in RPP2 seek to tackle behaviours in one way or another. Although it is not possible to detail each and every action, we have sought in the final document to give a better sense of the co-ordinated approach that the Scottish Government is taking.</p><p>The report now reflects the publication of the low-carbon behaviours framework and the way in which we are using the latest social science research in our new individual, social and material, or ISM, tool. This is a developing field and, given the strong interest in this work, I have committed to publishing a report in the autumn that will highlight the progress that we are making.</p><p>I mentioned that we have tried to improve clarity across RPP2. One aspect of the draft report that was criticised was that, although it contains three &#8220;technical potential&#8221; proposals in relation to housing, transport and rural land use that consider further emissions abatement in the 2020s, there are currently uncertainties about how best to achieve that abatement. It is reasonable, in a document that looks out to 2027, to include such elements of top-down modelling. However, I accept that, in an attempt to reflect that those measures are currently work in progress, the draft report probably included insufficient detail about the basis on which they had been made. The measures still represent work in progress, but we have sought to include more information about the modelling and assumptions that inform our analysis.</p><p>I turn now to what I believe is the most fundamental aspect of RPP2&#8212;that is, the package of proposals and policies itself.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s net emissions reduced by 25.7 per cent, or 18.7 million tonnes, in the 21 years between 1990 and 2011. Unadjusted emissions fell by 21 megatonnes&#8212;more than Northern Ireland&#8217;s total emissions in 2011. As certain witnesses pointed out during the scrutiny of the draft report, those reductions were, in many ways, the easy part. Despite that, RPP2 details proposals and polices that have the potential to reduce Scotland&#8217;s emissions by a further 23.5 million tonnes over the next 15 years. Any fair-minded person would acknowledge that that represents a significant gear change.</p><p>Some members of the Opposition have&#8212;for political convenience, one can only assume&#8212;dismissed the notion that Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets have from the outset built in an assumption of a greater contribution from Europe. The fact that that contribution has yet to happen, coupled with the changes that have been made to how our emissions are measured in the first place, has significantly moved the goalposts in the time since our climate change targets were set. Again, any fair-minded observer would recognise that.</p><p>However, RPP2 shows that, based purely on policies that the Scottish Government already has in place, we can achieve emissions reductions of 40.1 per cent in 2020&#8212;short of the 42 per cent target set in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, but only by less than the difference in emissions between 2010 and 2011. With the contribution of the additional proposals in RPP2, emissions could be cut by 43.3 per cent, even in the absence of higher EU ambition prior to 2020. If the EU strengthens its target to 30 per cent, as this Parliament anticipated in 2009, we could achieve a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 47.1 per cent by 2020.</p><p>Some committees and stakeholders have called for RPP2 to be strengthened, for more measures to be added and for additional commitments to be made. I would respond that RPP2 shows how Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets can be met and does so with a package of proposals and policies that are credible, deliverable and, importantly, fair. It would be easy to add speculative measures that we believe may have future potential but which are currently not well enough understood, even from a modelling perspective, to allow us to make anything more than an educated guess about the emissions abatement that they might deliver. To do that would not be credible, but that does not mean that we have shut the door on new opportunities.</p><p>When RPP1 was published, there was criticism that we did not ascribe specific emissions abatement to peatland restoration. We took the view at that time that the science was not sufficiently developed to make a reasonable estimate. Two years on, our understanding has increased greatly and peatland restoration therefore features as a full proposal in RPP2.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee highlighted the emissions abatement potential represented by marine ecosystems&#8212;so-called blue carbon. The draft RPP2 did not mention that, simply because our understanding of the emissions science in that area is in its infancy. It is still too early to estimate how much abatement blue carbon could offer, but we have amended RPP2 to signal that that is something that we are starting to look at. I hope that that can be developed further for RPP3, just as happened with peatland restoration between RPP1 and RPP2.</p><p>There have been calls to increase the rate at which we are retrofitting Scotland&#8217;s housing stock with insulation and other measures to help improve their energy efficiency. RPP2 sets out our ambitious plan to tackle fuel poverty, reduce carbon emissions and support jobs through our home energy efficiency programmes for Scotland. That work is supported by funding of around &#163;200 million per year from the Scottish Government and energy companies&#8212;the funding is in line with the recommendations in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee report on fuel poverty in February 2012. As well as reducing emissions, those programmes will assist many vulnerable and low-income households. Scotland&#8217;s performance in driving up insulation levels, working in partnership with local councils, has demonstrated our credibility in delivery.</p><p>There have also been calls on the Scottish Government simply to regulate more&#8212;to make people do things, rather than encourage them to do things. There is certainly a place for regulation, particularly where it helps to create market certainty for investors. For example, biodegradable municipal waste will be banned from going to landfill by the end of 2020&#8212;the first such ban anywhere the United Kingdom.</p><p>However, for behavioural change to be truly effective and long lasting, we need to offer the people of Scotland a fair deal, to help make low-carbon choices as attractive and easy as possible. I believe that the support that we are giving energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and waste and resource efficiency across the public and private sector, strikes that balance. We are coupling that with investment, both public and private, in decarbonising our energy and protecting and growing our natural carbon sinks.</p><p>The Scottish Government is facing a real-terms cut of more than 25 per cent in the amount of capital funding that is available to it between 2010-11 and 2014-15. There are many tough choices to make about where best to spend the money that Westminster decides to make available to us, but despite that, the Scottish Government has committed more than &#163;1.1 billion to low-carbon action over the current spending review period.</p><p>We need to do more, of course, and RPP sets out where and how we can do more. Where opportunities arise to go further or faster, we will take them, and we will seek to secure whatever additional funding we can, even in difficult budget conditions, to add to the &#163;1.1 billion that we have already committed.</p><p>I am therefore pleased to announce that, as an initial step, we will make available up to &#163;2 million this year to carry out condition surveys to help accelerate local authorities&#8217; work to upgrade the energy efficiency of street lighting. I can also confirm that the Scottish Cabinet has agreed that the forthcoming budget in September will contain additional funding for climate change action beyond the allocations already announced.</p><p>As I noted when we debated the draft report in March,</p><p>&#8220;RPP2 is the most comprehensive outline of measures for reducing national emissions that we know of anywhere.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 26 March 2013; c 18249.]</p><p>It shows how Scotland can meet its climate change targets despite the many challenges that we face. It underscores the Scottish Government&#8217;s continuing commitment to this agenda, even when it appears to have fallen down some other Governments&#8217; list of political priorities&#8212;even those who aspired to be &#8220;the greenest Government ever&#8221;.</p><p>I urge members to endorse RPP2 and, rather than simply calling for more ideas and plans, to support the Scottish Government in working to deliver more and to build on our strong foundations.</p><p>Scotland can be proud of the progress that it has made and what it has achieved. RPP2 shows how we can achieve even more, going beyond the easy wins and taking on the challenge of making low carbon mainstream.</p><p>I look forward to tackling that challenge together with my ministerial colleagues, businesses and public sector organisations, non-governmental organisations, and families and individuals across Scotland. I hope that members across the chamber will join that effort positively and support the Government in working together for a low-carbon Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695096", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Report on Proposals and Policies)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today, I am publishing both the final version of the Scottish Government&#8217;s second climate change report on proposals and policies&#8212;RPP2&#8212;and the statutory report on the annual emissions reduction target for 2011.

However, they then started to be successively revised upwards and, in the last three sets of figures, under the greenhouse gas inventory, that revision has been significant.

The bipartisan approach that colleagues from all parties have taken sets a good example of how the Parliament can operate. Given the known complexities of crofting law, which I have recognised, who would have thought that a satisfactory conclusion was possible before the summer recess? Yet here we are, facing that very prospect.</p><p>At its most fundamental level, the bill does what it says on the tin: it will allow owner-occupier crofters to apply to decroft their land and it will grant the Crofting Commission the power to issue decrofting directions. It will also give retrospective effect to the legislation, to ensure that owner-occupier crofter decrofting decisions that the commission has taken previously are competent. The bill will also provide a right of appeal for people who might have been dissuaded from appealing a decision after the commission announced in February that it could no longer accept such applications.</p><p>When the issue was brought to my attention, my initial reaction was to consider why the legislation was framed in such a way. I considered whether there was an alternative administrative solution, as some stakeholders suggested. However, rather than dwell on the past or give further consideration to workaround solutions that might fail, I quickly concluded that a robust fix was required. I decided that it would be far better to focus on a legislative fix, which would leave no doubt that the legislation delivers the initial policy intent.</p><p>Given the range of legal opinion, it was clear that the existing legislation did not deliver the policy intent. There was evidence that people were being adversely affected. A solution therefore had to be put in place quickly, which is why I asked Parliament to consider an expedited process for the bill. The Parliament agreed to such an approach.</p><p>The process has been successful, but it has also been challenging. The strict timetables and the need to ensure that all matters were carefully considered and that stakeholders had an opportunity to contribute were particularly important. The expedited process was justified in this case, because owner-occupier crofters were disadvantaged, but that does not mean that it should become the norm.</p><p>Some people called for emergency legislation, but I wanted to ensure that the Parliament would have the opportunity to consider the bill carefully and to apply an appropriate level of scrutiny. I am satisfied that the Parliament has gone through that necessary process, to ensure that the bill will deliver its purpose. The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee and a number of learned legal witnesses concluded that it will do so.</p><p>I have no doubt that the bill will deliver what is intended, and I am pleased that there is broad consensus on that. However, I recognise that there have been differing views on how the legislation should be drafted. I addressed such views, along with other issues, during stages 1 and 2.</p><p>We now have an opportunity to ensure that we help owner-occupier crofters who have been unintentionally disadvantaged as a result of a flaw in the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. Therefore, I want to focus on the bill and its intentionally narrow scope. I also want to take the opportunity to explain briefly why the Scottish Government has not lodged any amendments.</p><p>Before stage 2, I considered carefully all the issues raised in the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report. The Scottish Government responded in writing to that report on Tuesday 11 June and set out its position on the various issues raised.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report recommended that the Scottish Government give appropriate consideration to whether any of the issues raised required amendments to be brought forward. I gave detailed and careful consideration to the views of Sir Crispin Agnew and others on drafting, and I sought an appropriate level of assurance that the bill is fit for purpose. Following due consideration, I concluded that the bill as drafted achieves its purpose and that it provides the necessary clarity and legal certainty to solve the problem that it set out to address. That view was supported by the committee in its stage 1 report.</p><p>The committee also recommended that the Scottish Government give careful consideration to the views expressed on a number of matters, including the definition of &#8220;decrofting direction&#8221;, the application of section 25 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993, and the protection of access to croft land. Again, the Scottish Government has addressed those issues in its response to the committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>I welcome the committee&#8217;s support for the provisions on retrospection. The bill will ensure that all 159 decrofting directions and the 44 cases held in abeyance are competent. In addition, the Crofting Commission has said that it will deal with all outstanding decrofting applications as quickly as possible, for which I am grateful.</p><p>As I have said previously, the ability to decroft should not provide an opportunity to speculate on croft land to the detriment of crofting. We all have a responsibility to ensure that crofting remains sustainable for future generations, because no Government can do that alone. We need to establish and maintain cross-party support to ensure that crofting remains sustainable and continues to deliver benefits.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s stage 1 report and the Scottish Government&#8217;s response also addressed issues that are not included in the bill. I am all too aware that there are other issues to be addressed, both legislative and administrative, but that will not happen overnight. We all need some time to take stock and to ensure that what we do next is right for crofting and for remote and rural Scotland. That will take some very careful consideration, and it is only right that such consideration involves the key stakeholders.</p><p>I do not think that another committee of inquiry on crofting is required, but I do think that the other issues highlighted during the course of the bill need to be addressed carefully, fairly and objectively if we are to ensure that crofting continues to provide cultural, social, economic and high-nature-value farming benefits. That is why I gave an undertaking to the Parliament during stage 1 of the bill that my officials will</p><p>&#8220;investigate, in consultation with stakeholders, what the best method might be for dealing with the outstanding issues&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 6 June 2013; c 20857.]</p><p>Stakeholders should therefore expect contact from my officials to arrange a discussion on the next steps for crofting.</p><p>I will not try to cover all the points here, but I can assure the Parliament that all issues were carefully considered. I am still a relatively new minister, with a direct portfolio interest in crofting, but I have already had the opportunity to visit the crofting counties on a number of occasions and I have seen for myself the benefits that crofting delivers: strong communities working together to ensure that land is worked in a beneficial and sustainable way; innovative crofters contributing to the economic vitality of local economies across the crofting counties; the breathtaking landscape, environment and hospitality that we can all enjoy as a result of crofters&#8217; hard work and stewardship of Scotland&#8217;s countryside; and the particular, strong contribution to the cultural diversity of this great country, whether that be in our island communities or on the mainland. Those attributes align very closely to the Scottish Government&#8217;s purpose and reflect the national outcomes and priorities that we are delivering.</p><p>The bill will not solve all the challenges that crofting brings, but it does ensure that one particular decrofting issue is resolved as quickly and fairly as possible. There has been a concerted team effort in the development of the bill, and I would like to thank those who have played a part in getting us to this point.</p><p>First, I thank the members of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee and their clerks, who with their characteristic good grace took on the challenge of the expedited process and ensured that appropriate consultation and scrutiny of the bill took place.</p><p>I also give my sincere thanks to all those who gave evidence and contributed to Parliament&#8217;s deliberations on the bill. That includes the Crofting Commission, the Scottish Crofting Federation, NFU Scotland, Scottish Land &amp; Estates and other organisations, legal specialists in crofting law and other individuals. I am extremely grateful to them all for their contributions.</p><p>I also thank officials, both in Parliament and in Government, who have worked tirelessly to give us a bill that meets its purpose. Finally, I thank members across the chamber for the consideration that they have given to what is a complex area of law.</p><p>We have worked together to get this far, and I hope that, once again, we can all work together to ensure that the bill is passed for royal assent and is put on the statute books as soon as possible to bring to an end the uncertainty that has caused such difficulty for individuals. I commend the bill to the Parliament.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694410", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to open the stage 3 debate on the Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, especially because it is clear to me that there is strong support for the bill across the Parliament and that owner-occupier crofters should soon be able to apply to the Crofting Commission to decroft their land.

It is clear that there is agreement across the chamber on a range of issues relating to the bill. Given what happened during stage 3 of the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill, I am particularly pleased that Parliament has not been suspended during any part of today&#8217;s proceedings&#8212;at least, not so far.</p><p>Joking apart, we all recognise that crofting is swamped in complex and, it could be said&#8212;I have said it myself&#8212;impenetrable legislation. To complicate that legislation further must be a last resort for any Government. That is why the Scottish Government introduced a bill with standalone provisions to allow owner-occupier crofters to identify easily what decrofting provisions in the 1993 act relate specifically to them. It is the most straightforward and efficient way of dealing with the issue while delivering the policy intent that provisions should be similar for owner-occupier crofters and tenant crofters; the provisions are not exactly the same because of tenancy issues.</p><p>Many owner-occupier crofters are awaiting the solution offered by the bill, including those who have previously received a decrofting direction and who want to relax in the knowledge that the land remains decrofted; those who have applied to decroft land and are stuck in limbo until their application can be processed by the Crofting Commission; those who want to apply to decroft land for specific purposes but know that their application cannot be processed; and, not least, the Crofting Commission itself, which simply wants to get on with the job of regulating crofting but needs the tools to do so.</p><p>At decision time today, we will have the opportunity to pass a bill that addresses those issues and treats owner-occupier crofters in a way that is similar to the way in which tenant crofters are treated in relation to decrofting. I am pleased that that appears to be the approach that all parties are taking today. That was the intention of the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010, and we should put right the situation today.</p><p>As I indicated when I opened the debate, the ability to decroft should not be to the detriment of crofting. I will therefore ask the Crofting Commission to pick up on a point that was raised about keeping under review the effects of decrofting by tenant crofters and owner-occupier crofters. If there is any foundation to concerns about speculation, we can consider our options to tackle them.</p><p>Members raised a number of issues today and I will address them as best as I can. Once again, Jayne Baxter made a thoughtful speech&#8212;I am sorry that she is not in the chamber&#8212;in which she raised the continuing concerns of the crofting law group about a number of issues. [Interruption.] There she is&#8212;I must have missed her. Those points were also picked up by Jamie McGrigor and Tavish Scott and perhaps others&#8212;I apologise if I do not mention them. I recognise the concerns that have been expressed during the passage of the bill and I look forward to working with the crofting law group and other stakeholders to address any issues that have been raised. I certainly look forward to hearing the messages that will come out of the conference in September.</p><p>Alex Fergusson raised the issue of a rebuttal of the concerns that have been raised about the drafting approach possibly having unintended consequences. I put on the record my thanks to Mr Fergusson for trying to look out for my interests&#8212;I appreciate that. To reassure Mr Fergusson, I note that the Scottish Government has carefully considered whether the approach that has been taken in the bill will have unintended consequences. The Scottish Government considers that the bill has helped to highlight issues that needed to be dealt with, such as the decrofting of croft houses, which might have been overlooked had we continued to take the approach outlined in the 2010 act. As I have tried to explain, the bill has been drafted in such a way because we want to match as best as we possibly can the provisions for tenant crofters and owner-occupier crofters. I appreciate that, to some, the legislation looks unnecessarily unwieldy and complicated, but in drafting it as we have done, we have guaranteed that the provisions for owner-occupier crofters are closely matched to those for tenant crofters and pick up on Parliament&#8217;s intent in 2010 to deliver similar treatment under the law to tenant crofters and owner-occupier crofters. Although I appreciate that the purists wanted to simplify the legislation further, we are satisfied that it will deliver as well as it can similar provisions for owner-occupier crofters and tenant crofters.</p><p>Alex Fergusson also raised the lack of interaction with the 1993 act, which probably arises from the same issue. In reality, the bill inserts new provisions into the 1993 act and, in relation to section 25 of the 1993 act, it amends existing provisions to make the section relevant to the situation of owner-occupier crofters.</p><p>Jayne Baxter also said that ministers need to be vigilant in monitoring. I am not sure whether she picked up what I said earlier, but we have asked the Crofting Commission to monitor the effects of the legislation, and I look forward to hearing feedback from it.</p><p>Tavish Scott made a very good point that the debate should really be about the quality of the beef, lamb and other things that crofters produce. I certainly agree that the quality of beef and lamb from the crofting counties is second to none and should be celebrated.</p><p>Nigel Don raised the issue of retrospection. I hope that, in limiting the provisions to those 159 owner-occupier crofters who have already been issued with a decrofting direction and those whose applications are being held in abeyance&#8212;who might have missed an opportunity for appeal&#8212;we have kept the bill as tightly defined as possible to minimise any unintended consequences.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor picked up on the cost of advertising. I am certainly happy to look at the cost to crofters, which has been raised recently, to see whether there is any way in which we can overcome the issue. I certainly give him my assurance that we will take that forward.</p><p>Claire Baker raised some interesting and important points about the general thrust in terms of small farming units being particularly sustainable, given their low carbon footprint and so forth. We look forward to taking forward any ideas that may come out of the international movement that she mentioned.</p><p>As I said, the bill demonstrates the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s ability to address issues quickly and effectively. It represents the culmination of cross-party support for a necessary change to legislation. I again thank members across the chamber for that support and for taking such a constructive approach.</p><p>We must vote the bill through now, and then we must carefully consider how to progress the other matters that have been raised by members and stakeholders. That will require commitment from a lot of people, but I am confident about what we can achieve, because we have demonstrated through the bill that we can work together when it matters most. I am sure that the bipartisan approach that has been taken has been warmly welcomed by crofters themselves.</p><p>I hope that at decision time, members will ensure that the bill is passed for royal assent to allow owner-occupier crofters once and for all to apply to decroft their land, as was intended.

As a consequence, the topic of crofting often inspires emotion and debate, and the Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill is no exception, even though there is general agreement on its purpose.</p><p>Those involved in crofting will know that the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 has already been amended by the Crofting Reform etc Act 2007 and the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. We are now seeking to amend it further through the Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, but for very good reasons.</p><p>I am sure that those involved in the introduction of the 2010 act did not imagine for one moment that we would be here today addressing an unintended consequence of it, but crofting legislation is renowned for its complexities&#8212;as minister with responsibility for crofting, I can certainly vouch for that.</p><p>As many members know, the issue is with the provisions allowing crofters to apply to decroft land. The 2010 act was intended to allow decrofting by both tenant and owner-occupier crofters, but legal advice received by the Crofting Commission said that, in fact, the act does not provide for decrofting by owner-occupier crofters. Therefore, on 25 February this year, the commission announced that it could not accept any further decrofting applications from owner-occupier crofters.</p><p>When the flaw in the legislation was identified, there was widespread support for solving the problem, and solving it quickly. The Scottish Government listened to the concerns raised. It then took swift action to bring forward this bill to ensure, first, that owner-occupier crofters could once again apply to the Crofting Commission to decroft their land and, secondly, that the direct impact on those affected would be addressed as quickly as possible.</p><p>As I indicated to Parliament on 28 March this year, there are known examples of people being negatively affected by the flaw in the legislation. Some are unable to start building their houses until the land is decrofted, and deadlines for completion are approaching because of time-limited planning consent. Others are unable to decroft to increase the size of their house site to provide sufficient garden ground. A young crofter is unable to proceed with acquiring part of an owner-occupier crofter&#8217;s croft because of the uncertainty around being able to decroft part of his new croft to build a house. A young crofting couple who are planning to start a family are unable to decroft a house site to sell in order to finance a larger house while remaining on the original croft. Those are just a few examples of real people being directly affected by this decrofting issue.</p><p>This bill, once enacted, will provide a solution for those people and many more in similar circumstances. That solution is required urgently to ensure that owner-occupier crofters are given similar rights and are treated in a similar way to tenant crofters and landlords.</p><p>Before I go into the detail of the bill, I welcome the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report, which was published on Friday 31 May. I congratulate the committee on its thorough consideration of all the issues raised. Bringing forward legislation quickly does not mean that parliamentary scrutiny should be compromised. In fact, I place enormous importance on both stakeholder engagement and parliamentary scrutiny. For that reason, in a moment, I will cover the main issues raised in the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report.</p><p>The Scottish Government has taken time carefully to consider the best way forward and has produced a bill that meets the key aim of allowing owner-occupier crofters to apply to the Crofting Commission to decroft. That aim attracted widespread support during stage 1. The original intention in the 2010 act was to align decrofting by owner-occupier crofters with decrofting by landlords, which comes under the vacant croft provisions in section 23 of the 1993 act. However, that intention does not work because of section 23(10) of the 1993 act, which provides that, if a croft is occupied by an owner-occupier crofter, it is not vacant. The existing legislation does not work as intended.</p><p>The bill will remove decrofting by owner-occupier crofters from the vacant croft provisions and insert new stand-alone sections 24A to 24D into the 1993 act. Some people have suggested retaining the link between owner-occupier decrofting and the vacant croft provisions, even when the croft is not vacant. However, in the Scottish Government&#8217;s opinion, the new provisions that we propose will provide a greater degree of clarity and legal certainty.</p><p>The bill sets out what the Crofting Commission can do when it receives an application to decroft. The commission can of course grant or refuse the decrofting application. However, if the Crofting Commission is already taking action against the applicant for a breach of crofting duty, the bill provides for the commission not to consider the decrofting application in the meantime. That mirrors the equivalent rules for landlords of vacant crofts.</p><p>Section 25 of the 1993 act sets out the matters that the commission must take into account when determining a decrofting application. The bill will apply most of section 25 to owner-occupier crofters in as similar as possible a way to how it applies to tenant crofters and landlords. However, the bill purposely leaves out the provisions in section 25 that relate only to tenants, such as the provisions relating to a crofter&#8217;s right to buy.</p><p>The bill will also extend to owner-occupier crofters the existing right of a tenant crofter to decroft the site of the dwelling-house, where they have not already decrofted a house site. There was of course a question over what to do with the 159 decrofting directions that were already issued by the commission and&#8212;I can update Parliament on this&#8212;the 44 applications that are currently held in abeyance. The observant will have noticed that the figures have changed slightly from the earlier announcement in Parliament on 28 March&#8212;the number of outstanding applications has reduced from 50 to 44 as a result of checks undertaken by the Crofting Commission at our request, which have verified that six of the outstanding applications did not in fact relate to owner-occupier crofters.</p><p>I turn now to the issue of retrospection. In the bill, the Scottish Government has proposed retrospective provisions that will allow the legislation to apply to cases from 1 October 2011, when the definition of owner-occupier crofter was introduced. The provisions will place those involved in the 159 cases where they expected to be&#8212;and, crucially, where Parliament intended them to be&#8212;and will allow the 44 outstanding applications to be fully processed as soon as the bill comes into force.</p><p>The bill will also make consequential modifications to the 1993 and 2010 acts, as a result of new sections 24A to 24D, mainly by adding cross-references to the new provisions. The consequential modifications will ensure that the new provisions work as intended alongside the existing legislation. That is an important safeguard.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a well-known fact that crofting tenure forms an important part of our environmental, cultural and social heritage and that crofting traditions are close to the hearts of so many.

However, I hope that I have set out today the rationale for keeping the bill tightly defined to ensure that we get a quick solution for the benefit of constituents in Mr Scott&#8217;s constituency and elsewhere.</p><p>As I said, the consequential modifications will ensure that the new provisions work as intended. They will also ensure that the crofting register provisions in the 2010 act will apply to decrofting applications submitted by owner-occupier crofters in the same way as they apply to other decrofting applications. The consequential and retrospective provisions were largely welcomed at stage 1, and I welcome the committee&#8217;s support for them in its stage 1 report.</p><p>Lastly, it has been suggested that some people might have intended to appeal against a decrofting decision but decided not to do so as a result of the Crofting Commission&#8217;s announcement in February. We have therefore included a right of appeal for applications that were determined within the 42 days before the commission&#8217;s announcement, which is in line with the normal appeal arrangements. Again, I note that the committee in its report welcomes and supports that provision.</p><p>I turn to some of the concerns that were raised at stage 1. Concern was expressed that passing the right to decroft the site of a dwelling-house from one owner-occupier crofter to another might lead to speculative development. In fact, that is already the position with tenant crofters and it does not appear to have created any issues. However, the matter can be considered further if it becomes a problem.</p><p>Some have criticised the fundamental drafting of the bill.

If I do not address Mr Fergusson&#8217;s point, I will let him come back in later.</p><p>Some stakeholders have indeed suggested alternative drafting that would be shorter and might, perhaps, deliver the policy intention. However, with the greatest of respect to the eminent lawyers that Mr Fergusson mentioned, &#8220;perhaps&#8221; is not good enough. We have to be clear. The bill addresses a flaw in the legislation. That being the case, we have to be sure that what we do will address the key issue in respect of decrofting and provide the same treatment of owner-occupiers as is provided for tenants. That is why the Government&#8217;s bill is drafted in the way that it is.</p><p>Our view that the bill will resolve the issue is supported by others. During the committee&#8217;s stakeholder evidence session, Sir Crispin Agnew said:</p><p>&#8220;I think that the bill will solve the particular problem by making it clear that the Crofting Commission can decroft owner-occupier crofts.&#8221;</p><p>During the same session, Derek Flyn of the Scottish Crofting Federation said that legislation is needed and that the bill appears to answer that need. We heard the Crofting Commission&#8217;s view that</p><p>&#8220;the bill addresses and solves the problem&#8221;.</p><p>There was also support from others including Scottish Land &amp; Estates and the National Farmers Union Scotland, which recognises the need for legislation to deal with the problem quickly. However, I recognise the point that Mr Fergusson makes. It is perhaps something that the committee will come back to.</p><p>On consultation, some have questioned whether there was sufficient time for proper consideration of the bill. In the circumstances that we faced, the Scottish Government had to strike a balance between dealing with the issue urgently while carefully considering the options and ensuring that key stakeholders had the opportunity to contribute. Our stakeholder consultation was very short indeed compared with normal procedures, but that was entirely due to the urgency of the issue.</p><p>We heard at stage 1 that NFU Scotland considers that it</p><p>&#8220;had ample opportunity to respond&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;the consultation with regard to the draft bill has been fine.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 15 May 2013; c 2200, 2194, 2203.]</p><p>The Crofting Commission&#8217;s view was that the consultation had worked, as the problem itself is &#8220;very defined&#8221;. I therefore believe that the right level of consultation was applied to the bill under the circumstances and given the tight focus of the bill.</p><p>I note that the committee welcomed the Scottish Government&#8217;s attempts to seek stakeholders&#8217; views once the problem had been identified and once the bill had been published. I also note the committee&#8217;s view on public consultation on any further changes to crofting law.</p><p>On the individual cases of crofters who are affected by the inability to decroft, I note the committee&#8217;s recommendation that the Crofting Commission should process the outstanding applications as swiftly as possible, and that should apply also to any applications that it has not been possible to submit in the interim. As I said to the committee on 22 May, section 6 provides for the legislation to be effective immediately following royal assent. That will enable the commission to process the 44 outstanding applications, and any newly submitted applications, as early as possible.</p><p>I recognise that a number of issues have been raised that are outwith the scope of the bill. I also recognise the need, as indicated by the committee in its stage 1 report, to address those other issues in the future, and I assure members that they will be addressed. I give an undertaking that, subject to the bill&#8217;s parliamentary passage, once it has been enacted, my officials will investigate, in consultation with stakeholders, what the best method might be for dealing with the outstanding issues. Depending on the outcome of those investigations, the Scottish Government will consider what further legislation might be required as we develop our future legislative programme.</p><p>However, I encourage members to focus on the issues that are relevant for this bill and to work towards a mutually agreeable way forward. That will ensure once and for all that owner-occupier crofters can apply to decroft their land. The scope of the bill is deliberately tightly focused on owner-occupier decrofting. Any deviation from that would fail to respect the expedited approach agreed for it.</p><p>As always, I will leave further scrutiny of the bill to the Scottish Parliament. I have no doubt that the committee and the Parliament as a whole will continue to apply the high standard of scrutiny of legislation to which we are accustomed, irrespective of the tight timescales that apply to the bill.</p><p>I am grateful to all who have contributed to bringing us this far. That includes stakeholders, who assisted in the early stages by providing information, those who gave evidence to the committee and, not least, the committee and its clerks. I thank my own officials for their hard work.</p><p>I look forward to continuing to work with all parties during the remaining stages of the bill. I hope that the committee will be reassured by my confirmation that appropriate consideration is being given to all views expressed on the bill in advance of stage 2 next week.

There is general consensus on the need for action, irrespective of the detail, which we will go through at stage 2 and stage 3. It is also gratifying to note that there is broad agreement that the bill will deliver the necessary changes and ensure that owner-occupier crofters are treated equally to tenant crofters and crofting landlords.</p><p>I said earlier that crofting often inspires emotion in debate.

It is therefore important that those involved in crofting know exactly where they stand.</p><p>The bill clarifies where owner-occupier crofters stand on decrofting. It removes the legal doubt on decrofting that a number of members mentioned. Irrespective of the merits of the cases that have been put forward by different lawyers&#8212;a number of whom we have seen in and outwith the committee&#8212;who have valid but differing views, the fact that there is that uncertainty and that so many eminent lawyers cannot agree, even on the need for the bill, shows the need to clarify and put to rest this issue, so that crofters can get on with their day-to-day lives.</p><p>I have listened with great interest to the points that members have made. It has been argued since February that new legislation to address the issue is unnecessary. That is not the view of the Scottish Government, nor, it would appear, of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee. It has also been argued that the scope of the bill should be expanded to deal with matters other than owner-occupier decrofting, and I will try to use my time effectively to refer to as many of those matters as I can.</p><p>Other issues have been raised today and in the course of the evidence that was given to the committee. Brian Inkster has provided a shorter bill. However, length is not the only consideration, as I mentioned earlier. We need to ensure that the issue is fully addressed and in my and the Government&#8217;s opinion the bill will do that.</p><p>The form of drafting minimises the doubt about owner-occupiers having similar decrofting rights to tenants. I made the point in an intervention that, to my understanding, although the provisions for tenant crofters to decroft might not be perfect, they work reasonably effectively and there is a degree of clarity about how tenant crofters can decroft. That is being progressed administratively by the Crofting Commission in good order, to the best of my knowledge. Replicating those procedures for owner-occupiers might not be perfect&#8212;it might not be the neatest legislation in the world&#8212;but it gives a degree of clarity that both owner-occupiers and tenants will have the same rights.</p><p>The bill should address multiple owners of the same croft, as they cannot decroft. Many people have made the point and I have listened to that view. There is an issue relating to the definition of owner-occupier crofters, which is currently outwith the scope of the bill, although I am sure that we can look at it once the bill has been, I hope, enacted. As I said earlier, we intend to engage with stakeholders and take stock of the full range of problems. An 80:20 principle may be at play&#8212;probably 20 per cent of the issues that we could identify in existing legislation cause 80 per cent of the problems that we face daily. I hope that by prioritising we can work out which issues we need to take forward and then consider what the best approach to dealing with them is.</p><p>I heard members today mentioning issues such as codification and the need for consolidated legislation, or consolidated plus, to take amendments into account. We hope to engage with stakeholders, including the cross-party group on crofting, the Scottish Crofting Federation and the Crofting Commission, on those matters, to see what the most appropriate way of going forward is.</p><p>However, as I have made clear, the bill&#8217;s scope is deliberately narrow and focused to reflect the problem&#8217;s urgency. In my opening remarks, I committed to giving further consideration to other issues that have been raised during the committee&#8217;s consultation and will inform Parliament if any legislative steps are to be taken.</p><p>On specific points raised in the debate, Alex Fergusson highlighted the inability of multiple owners to decroft. The commission does issue decrofting directions in respect of crofts with multiple owners, but I am sure that the member is aware that, under the existing legislation, decrofting requires the unanimity of those on the croft to act collectively as a landlord. It might not be perfect but at least there is provision for people in that situation to decroft and, obviously, we can consider the issue in due course.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will do my best to use the time to full effect, because members have raised so many interesting points in the debate.

We believe that the actual figure might be slightly higher, at 808, but if it will assist, we can clarify the exact number for the committee and members as we move towards stage 2. The issue is another that falls outwith the scope of the bill but which we recognise needs to be addressed, and I hope that members whose constituents are affected will note that. The bill deliberately has a tight focus to address a key issue and our view is that, unfortunately, any deviation to cover such a substantive issue would not necessarily respect the expedited procedure that is being applied to the bill, on which there is clearly a consensus to address the existing decrofting issue.</p><p>I am certainly happy to consider Claudia Beamish&#8217;s point about decrofting directions in advance of stage 2 as she suggested. It is a good example of an area where we might be able to have on-going dialogue.</p><p>Rob Gibson and Claudia Beamish described the bill as unnecessarily complex. We have considered the drafting issues as closely as possible and think that, as a number of committee witnesses have verified, the bill as drafted achieves its purpose. We are committed to drafting the legislation as plainly and as accessibly as possible and recognise the complexities in dealing with crofting legislation. Nevertheless, I hope that I have clearly explained why this particular drafting has been used and that we want to be as clear as we can about giving parity of treatment to tenants and owner-occupiers.</p><p>Tavish Scott fairly asked whether the point should have been picked up in 2010. Obviously, I agree with him, but we are where we are. As Alex Fergusson said, the matter is probably a good indication and measure of the complexity of crofting law.

Applications are at various stages of development; some will be able to go forward almost immediately once the bill is passed while others might take up to eight weeks after royal assent is given, but I hope that the whole backlog will be cleared over the summer. A further 31 applications have been made and returned to the applicants at this stage&#8212;we hope that the commission will be able to start on them quickly once royal assent is received. I hope that that clarifies the matter for the member.</p><p>Tavish Scott mentioned the case of the crofting couple in Shetland. I am sorry to hear of their difficulties and that the Land Court indicated that they cannot appeal through it against the policy of the commission. As we do not have all the facts of that particular case and it is a live case, I cannot comment on it too much, but I highlight the fact that the 1993 act contains a wide range of appeal opportunities, some of which may apply in their case.</p><p>Rhoda Grant mentioned that crofters cannot cultivate crofts with their families as a result of the duty on crofters in the 2010 act. There is nothing in theory to prevent a crofter&#8217;s family from assisting the crofter by working the croft, but the crofter must be responsible for ensuring that the duty to cultivate the croft is met. I hope that there may be more scope there than perhaps the member indicates, but if she is willing to write to me about a particular case, I can always undertake to have a look at it.</p><p>It is also open to a crofter to apply to the commission to sublet a croft and, since 2011, it has also been open to an owner-occupier to apply to the commission for a short-term let of a croft of up to 10 years.</p><p>Nigel Don very fairly raised a point about the transitory provisions in the bill. I reassure him that full consideration was given to the effect of those transitory provisions when developing the proposed legislation. We will continue to consider any points as they arise during the bill process, but I take on board the concern that the member raised and I will ensure that I will take a personal view of that.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor commented that further amendments may be required to the bill, with particular reference to Sir Crispin Agnew and Brian Inkster&#8217;s comments. We are aware of the drafting concerns, but I hope that in addressing the points that were raised earlier about the particular form of the drafting, I clarified that we picked a form that replicates the provision for tenant crofters and that, therefore, we believe is relatively stable and appears to work in processing applications. We cannot guarantee that there will not be a problem, but in seeking to do it this way, we hope that we have minimised the risk of a problem arising in relation to owner-occupier crofters.

If we look back over the long history of the struggle for land reform, from the 18th century clearances to the crofting acts of the 19th century and to the 21st century Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, we can see the pain and heartache that that struggle has cost, and I am sure that those feelings will be reflected in the debate.</p><p>I hope that the debate will demonstrate that there is a settled will or consensus that land reform is needed, even if the detail still needs further discussion and scrutiny.

We need to consider how to move the agenda forward in the best possible way, and I would warmly welcome the opportunity to work in partnership&#8212;if we could&#8212;to harness the wisdom of all, inside and outside the chamber, to a noble purpose.</p><p>Our desire for a mature discussion with civic Scotland is a key reason why we set up an independent land reform review group and my amendment emphasises that simple fact. However, we intend to respect the broad thrust of Labour&#8217;s motion which, with our minor amendment, we intend to support. In that spirit of consensus, I trust that Labour can, in turn, support our amendment.</p><p>When the First Minister last year announced the formation of the group, chaired by Alison Elliot, he set out his desire for the review</p><p>&#8220;to deliver radical change for both rural and urban areas&#8221;</p><p>of Scotland. The group is independent and has a clear remit set by the Government. I know that all members here today will join me in thanking Alison Elliot for her work and that of her colleagues in reviewing a wealth of submissions and for their commitment to taking forward the next stage of the review. I also thank Sarah Skerratt and Jim Hunter for their much valued contributions to the group&#8217;s work.</p><p>The group has travelled the country and met a wide variety of individuals and business representatives, who contributed their views. It has consulted on the key issues and collected 484 responses&#8212;I understand that that is the updated figure. That high response level from individuals and organisations shows the interest in land reform, and the responses will form a rich resource for all our work&#8212;including that on agricultural tenancies, to pick up on Patrick Harvie&#8217;s point.</p><p>As the motion acknowledges, the group published its interim report last month, and what stands out is that the issue is far from simple and that there is no one-size-fits-all panacea for all the challenges that we face. The group is planning the review&#8217;s next phase, with the final report due next April. It will look at the community right to buy in the Highlands and learn from the application of the absolute right to buy in the crofting areas in order to make recommendations for the whole country. I reiterate that we want community ownership to be expanded across the whole of Scotland, and the group will seek to set out what needs to happen to facilitate that.</p><p>A key theme will be land reform in urban Scotland. As that is closely associated with the developing community empowerment and renewal bill, we will ensure that that bill takes on the review group&#8217;s ideas in furthering the Scottish Government&#8217;s desire to empower urban and rural communities and in resolving problems identified with current legislation.</p><p>The proposed land agency is another key consideration and I am intrigued by the possibilities that it might deliver. The group will look at community engagement with landowners and community energy projects and at how we ensure that the right support and advice are in place for community landowners. It will recommend how the community right-to-buy legislation, which currently makes life unnecessarily difficult for communities in a number of respects, can be simplified and amended to be more accessible, and further work will be commissioned on common good land, taxation, public interest issues and issues with regard to the Crown Estate.</p><p>That vital work will require further resource, and I can announce today that I have agreed with the chair of the group that it can be expanded from its original three members to five. We have already appointed Ian Cooke, a director with Development Trusts Association Scotland, as vice-chair to ensure that there is expertise on the community sector, and I can also announce that we have appointed John Watt as the second vice-chair. As a recent director of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Mr Watt has a wealth of experience on state aid and public sector support for communities, and he is already an adviser to the group.</p><p>Two additional appointments will be announced in due course to complete the expanded group, but I should inform the Parliament that Richard Heggie and Malcolm Combe have been appointed as additional group advisers and will provide invaluable advice in the next phase. Those moves will ensure that the group is fully resourced to carry out phase 2 of its review, and the additional expertise available will allow it to come up with clear, informed and workable proposals in its final report.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692971", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will be happy to address that point later in my speech, and I certainly agree with Patrick Harvie that the land reform agenda should not be constrained.

I confirm that one of the research papers that the review group will commission will be on taxation. As part of its phase 2 work, the group will consider the evidence contained in the research paper and may make recommendations to Government on that as part of its final report. Obviously, we will look at any recommendations that the group makes.</p><p>On the point that Malcolm Chisholm and Alex Fergusson made about the Government&#8217;s involvement in the group, we are of course involved in any review in a number of ways. Richard Lochhead and I met the review group and were consulted for our views on land reform issues. We have provided the secretariat, we have paid for the independent communications support, which was provided by an agency, and we have been involved in consultation on the group&#8217;s membership. We have supported the review group with the necessary resources as requested, so we have had some involvement. However, I make it clear that we have always seen the group as being independent of Government. We wanted to see what the group came forward with; we did not want to interfere in the process.</p><p>If I have time, I will come on to the points that were made by others, but I had better plough on.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to radical land reform is clear, as I set out in my opening speech. I reiterate that we value the work of the independent land reform review group, which is chaired by Dr Elliot. As I said, the review group will help us to move forward the process of land reform in what will be a radical and thoughtful way. The group will tell us where we need to amend the previous Administration&#8217;s land reform legislation&#8212;which I acknowledge was well intentioned but which, I think we all agree, has some flaws&#8212;to make it easier for communities to buy land. Indeed, I assure members that I share the frustrations that many people have about the process of community land registration, to give just one example.</p><p>We expect that the review group will make radical recommendations for change in a wide variety of areas in both rural and&#8212;to pick up Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s point&#8212;urban Scotland. I said that we intend to explore how to take forward any early recommendations through the community empowerment and renewal bill. The group will also look at whether a land agency could unlock community ownership for a wider range of communities and potentially provide brokerage where there is a problem with conflict between different uses. We welcome that as an area for further exploration.</p><p>Of course, the land reform review group is only one part of our commitment to land reform. We have already committed to a review of agricultural tenancies, which will be informed by the work of the tenant farming forum and the land reform review consultation. The separate agricultural holdings review will deliver a pledge that was made in our free-standing 2011 manifesto for the farming sector.</p><p>We will continue to work directly with communities that are thinking about buying their land. We will encourage them to consider community ownership, support them in the application process and approve community buy-outs of land. We have already supported many communities with funds for acquisitions.</p><p>We think creatively about the assets that we hold on the public&#8217;s behalf. As an illustration, the first example of a community-led woodland croft project is on Mull&#8212;in Mr Russell&#8217;s constituency&#8212;where nine woodland crofts have been established. Through the national forest land scheme, Forestry Commission Scotland can already make land available to local communities to establish woodland crofts to help to support local development. We are supporting new entrants to farming on the national forest estate.</p><p>I mentioned the land fund earlier, but it is worth noting that we resurrected that fund, which was closed under the Labour Administration.</p><p>I hope that the debate has provided members with the opportunity to appreciate the work of the independent land reform review group. We want all our people to appreciate the land that is their heritage. We want all our communities&#8212;if they want the opportunity&#8212;to have more control of their destiny, and land reform is one of the key ways in which to enable that.</p><p>I think that I have taken all my time, Presiding Officer, so I will stop there.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692971", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members for what has been a short but fascinating debate that has reflected the cultural impact of land ownership and the passion that it inspires.

I hope that members will support the work of the land reform review group and, in due course, an agricultural holdings review, to help us to make a real difference across Scotland. I hope that we can look back on this day as the day when a consensus formed and Parliament set out on a constructive path with, I hope, unity of purpose to deliver on land reform.</p><p>As I have a bit more time than I thought, I will refer to a couple of points that colleagues made. Christian Allard and Roderick Campbell gave good examples of where community land ownership affects areas that are outside the Highlands and Islands heartlands: in Westhill in Aberdeenshire, and in the east neuk in Fife. We have tried to stress that the agenda goes beyond the heartlands in the Highlands and Islands. One important aspect of the review group&#8217;s work, as Alex Fergusson acknowledged, is to consider how we extend community ownership to areas outside those heartlands and what the barriers are that have reduced the number of projects.</p><p>Rhoda Grant seemed to call into question the need for an independent review. I remind her that, for her party&#8217;s manifesto for the 2011 elections, the Labour Party committed to a land reform review. We have delivered a review, and it is incumbent on us to see what it produces. We will treat it as an independent group and, where we can, we will take on board the points that it raises.

First, what is a national tree for? Secondly, what does it mean if we decide to adopt a national tree? Thirdly, what process should we go through&#8212;as Bob Doris and others have commented&#8212;if we were to choose and adopt a national tree? During the debate, we have had several extremely useful speeches that have helped to address those questions.</p><p>As Joan McAlpine said, and as other members have echoed, the designation of a national tree would help to highlight the value that we place on our trees, woods and forests. It would reinforce the messages that are associated with the year of natural Scotland, the primary objective of which is to highlight Scotland&#8217;s wealth of fantastic natural assets. Trees are obviously a key part of that.</p><p>My second question is what it would mean if we were to adopt a national tree. Again, members have helped to answer that question, giving examples of how we could celebrate our national tree&#8212;for example, as part of our cultural heritage, for its contribution to our landscape and in educating children more about the environment in which they live. As part of the year of natural Scotland, we have already been able to inspire people to take more interest in our wildlife by identifying the big five that are being promoted through the SNH &#8220;Big 5&#8221; app&#8212;one is the golden eagle, and the others are the otter, the seal, the red deer and the red squirrel. Scots pine is a key species among the Caledonian native woodlands, which support the red squirrel, the pine marten, the capercaillie and the wildcat, as a number of members have mentioned.</p><p>Thirdly, we would need to consider the process for choosing and adopting a national tree. I felt Annabel Goldie&#8217;s pain when she spoke about the process that she had to go through regarding the golden eagle, which sounded particularly traumatic. As others have said, we would not be the first country to consider such things. For example, like Joan McAlpine, I understand that before the President of the United States signed a bill designating the oak as the USA&#8217;s national tree in 2004 there was a national poll. Although I agree that the Scots pine seems to be the obvious choice for Scotland, I foresee an interesting debate if advocates of the Scots pine are forced to defend their choice against proponents who argue that the autumn beauty of the rowan and the graceful splendour of the birch merit a mention. Who knows? Perhaps we could have not just one national tree for Scotland, but the big three.</p><p>We shall consider all those matters in the light of the Public Petitions Committee&#8217;s consideration of the petition, which we expect to receive shortly.</p><p>However, I fear that I need to inject a less welcome note into the discussion&#8212;Alison Johnstone has already touched on the matter to a degree. Regretfully, we must accept the fact that ash dieback is present in the UK and is likely to spread further. Unfortunately, that is just one of a number of tree health problems&#8212;which Alison Johnstone correctly identified&#8212;that we are facing. Dothistroma needle blight is affecting pine trees, including Scots pine, especially in the north and east of the country, and we have Phytophthora ramorum on larch, mainly in Galloway and Argyllshire. The mortality rate from Dothistroma among Scots pine is alarmingly high and presents a real concern for us. In fact, the rate is higher than for Corsican pine and lodgepole pine. Action plans for those three diseases have been developed by the Scottish tree health advisory group and are now being implemented.</p><p>Earlier this week, the independent expert United Kingdom task force on tree health and plant biosecurity, which includes three academics from Scottish universities, published its report on how best to address the tree and plant disease threats that we face. I am now discussing its recommendations with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson, and it is likely that we will meet shortly to discuss the matter further.</p><p>There is an important link between tackling tree health and the aspirations behind the idea of designating a national tree of Scotland. That is because awareness raising is an important element in the range of tree health-related measures that we need to take. The process of designating a national tree could help in making people more aware of the threats and what they can do to prevent the diseases from spreading&#8212;for example, washing their boots after visiting woodlands for a walk.</p><p>I will respond to a number of points that were raised in the debate.</p><p>I agree with Joan McAlpine that our woodlands are key places in which to work and play and for children to understand the natural environment around them. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is keen to explore further how we develop forest schools, and I want to take that forward.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson and Annabel Goldie strongly recommended a wide consultation on selecting a national tree. I take that point on board.</p><p>Rod Campbell mentioned that new symbols can bolster identity. Jean Urquhart, I think, made the similar point that symbols can unite people rather than divide them. That is an important part of having a national tree, a national bird or any other national symbol that we might care to mention.</p><p>Mike MacKenzie made moving reference to the use of Scots pine in the construction trade. The Forestry Commission has the objective of improving the percentage of building materials that are formed by timber to lock in carbon in building design.</p><p>The key point is what we do to take the process forward. I am waiting for the submission from the Public Petitions Committee. We are very sympathetic to the concept of having a national tree, but I want to see what recommendations the committee, based on the consultation that it has done, can give us in relation to a process for going forward.</p><p>On timescales, I am optimistic. I hope that, should we decide to designate a national tree, we are talking about a much shorter timescale than having to wait for the referendum and, indeed, for Scotland to become independent in March 2016.</p><p>I welcome the debate. I am excited about the idea of identifying a national tree for Scotland and, in light of today&#8217;s discussions and the committee&#8217;s deliberations, I will think hard about how best to take the matter forward in a way that ensures that we reap the potential benefits without incurring disproportionate costs associated with the designation process.</p><p>I thank members for their speeches.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:52.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Tree"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to members for their valuable contributions to the debate.

The crucial point is that the number of days allowed for an appeal in section 6 is deliberately different from that allowed in section 16 because the appeals relate to quite different situations.

An enforcement notice will be issued only if the Scottish ministers are satisfied that the person in question has failed or is failing to comply with any requirement that has been imposed by regulations. A seven-day appeal period is reasonable and indeed was accepted for the 2007 act.</p><p>However, section 16 of the bill deals with a situation outwith the control of the person being issued with the notice. No failure to comply with regulations is implied and there is no assumption that it is the person&#8217;s fault that a commercially damaging species has been found on his or her fish or shellfish farm. That is why an emergency action notice is issued and why we consider it reasonable to give the person 14 days to appeal against the decision to serve the notice and the notice&#8217;s terms.

That places a responsibility on all of us to ensure that our marine ecosystems continue to provide economic, social and wider benefits for people, industry and society.</p><p>That responsibility underpins the primary purpose of the bill, which is to ensure that farmed and wild fisheries&#8212;and their interactions with each other&#8212;continue to be managed effectively as both sectors thrive. Critically, we wish to maximise their combined contribution to supporting sustainable economic growth in rural areas, but with due regard to the wider marine environment. Many and varied interests use and enjoy Scotland&#8217;s marine environment, and the quality of the environment is a key element of the market appeal of farmed salmon, trout and shellfish. Maintaining that shared pristine marine environment requires good neighbourliness.</p><p>Last week, I chaired the first meeting of the refreshed ministerial group on sustainable aquaculture. I hope and believe that the group will continue to be a forum where such consensus on shared issues can be reached. I have formed an interactions working group as part of the MGSA, and I believe that the group represents a new opportunity to move forward the shared agenda and to put aside some of the friction of the past. I expect the group to establish closer productive working relationships between wild fish interests and farmed fish interests, both locally and Scotland-wide, and to consider more broadly the significant benefits that both sectors can bring to rural and remote communities.</p><p>To what do those benefits equate? Well, we are dealing with a &#163;600&#160;million aquaculture sector that employs some 1,800 people in aquaculture production and almost 3,000 people in salmon processing. Similarly, game and coarse angling supports 2,800 full-time equivalent jobs and is worth &#163;134&#160;million in expenditure to the Scottish economy.</p><p>Much has been said&#8212;not least by the RACCE Committee&#8212;about the individual interests and positions that have been taken by stakeholders. I believe that that highlights the need to ensure that we get things right. I want to underline our intention to balance the many interests in the public interest, rather than responding in isolation to single-issue campaigns.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee and others have asked for reassurance that the Scottish Government has actively engaged with stakeholders on the provisions in the bill. I confirm that stakeholder engagement has been an important part of our work since the consultation began and will continue to be so long after the provisions of the bill have been implemented.</p><p>For example, the wellboats working group has recently been established. Members of the group include wellboat operators, representatives of the fish farming companies, academics, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals&#8212;in respect of its Freedom Food Ltd assurance scheme&#8212;and the code of good practice management committee. The wellboats working group will work to establish the technical requirements for filters to control sea lice on all wellboats operating in Scotland, and for the facilities that will be needed for the new bigger wellboats that will be used in the future.</p><p>Colleagues have on occasion thrown&#8212;I am sure with good intent&#8212;what might usefully be described as a lifeline to save me from what they considered would be unintended consequences of the bill. Although I am always grateful for any such well-intentioned efforts to save me from danger, I consider that in this context the efforts have not been required. The bill has been developed over considerable time with substantial input from others and has rightly been subject to considerable scrutiny by Parliament. I assure members that, in formulating our amendments, we have given serious consideration to, and acted on, the issues that were raised. In my opinion, the bill is fit for purpose.</p><p>Part 1 of the bill will strengthen the regulatory framework for the fin-fish sector. Our aim is to support that industry as it continues to deliver its sustainable growth&#8212;using a 2011 baseline&#8212;of 50 per cent in volume to 2020 and beyond. That means a further 32 per cent growth from now.</p><p>During the passage of the bill, it was suggested&#8212;unfortunately, Tavish Scott is not in the chamber&#8212;that the provisions on farm management agreements are tantamount to micromanaging salmon farms. Although I share the desire to avoid micromanaging the sector, which Tavish Scott suggested might happen, I have not been convinced by that argument. I believe that the bill will not result in micromanagement; I stand by my conviction that the bill is balanced and proportionate.</p><p>The provisions will require that all fish farms in a farm management area be party to a farm management agreement or a farm management statement. Such agreements or statements must specify arrangements for a number of critical matters relating to fish health and welfare; namely fish health management, management of parasites, movement of live fish on and off farms, harvesting of fish, and fallowing of farms after harvesting.</p><p>At present, 98 per cent of fish farms are signed up to the industry code of good practice and are parties to agreements or statements. If the bill is passed, the provisions will apply to all marine fin-fish farm operators and will set the criteria that we consider are essential for managing the health of farmed fish within an area.</p><p>The issue of public reporting of sea lice has been discussed at considerable length during the progress of the bill and again today. I fully recognise that it is an issue of great concern to members. I hope that, even if members do not agree with the Government&#8217;s position, they will agree that we have clearly and consistently explained it.</p><p>We remain convinced that voluntary public reporting is the right route and that the proposals that the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation has committed to taking forward&#8212;which it helpfully reaffirmed in a recent communication to all members&#8212;are appropriate from all perspectives: transparency, compliance, science and justifiable commercial interest. However, I repeat the commitment that I gave earlier to review the success or otherwise of the voluntary arrangement in the current session of Parliament. Crucially, we already have powers under the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007 to implement a mandatory reporting arrangement, should that prove necessary.</p><p>Part 2 of the bill will improve the governance of district salmon fishery boards and strengthen management of salmon fisheries. Those are the first steps in delivering our manifesto commitment to modernise the management structures for salmon fisheries and freshwater fisheries, which is a complex area that has been the subject of numerous reports and investigations over the years. The committee took considerable interest in the issues on which more work was needed and provided helpful comments on what the forthcoming review should cover. Work is under way to scope the independent review that will be undertaken. My intention is that it will commence this summer, and I look forward to engaging with colleagues across Parliament and with all other interested parties on that.</p><p>Part 4 of the bill will introduce provisions to ensure continued protection of good water quality, which is necessary for a sustainable shellfish industry. We believe that the sector has potential, if it is managed with sensitivity to the environment. The shellfish industry, especially in respect of mussels, is looking to expand from a 2011 baseline by 100 per cent by 2020, which is another 80 per cent growth from now.</p><p>Work is under way to build on those provisions, with the aim of consulting on draft regulations for introduction in the autumn. The regulations will introduce a system of quality standards that will bring together environmental standards for good water quality with the food hygiene standards that are required for high-quality shellfish products. That will be a first in Europe and will help to cement Scotland&#8217;s reputation for the quality of its produce.</p><p>It is a rare treat for any minister to be praised by the Opposition for introducing legislation, so I shall treasure Alex Fergusson&#8217;s comments during the committee&#8217;s consideration of the Solway cockles provisions. That reflects the genuine consensus that there is a serious issue that merits Government action. I was pleased to see widespread coverage in the media of police and Marine Scotland officers stepping up the patrols to tackle illegal cockling on the Solway Firth. I am sure that we would all prefer to deter people from illegal and potentially dangerous cockling than to use the powers that we seek in the bill, but it has, regrettably, proved to be necessary to take decisive steps to address the issue.</p><p>It would perhaps be remiss of me, while speaking about Solway cockles, not to mention the wider improvements in enforcement measures that are included in the bill. The Fisheries Act 1705 makes certain provisions for the</p><p>&#8220;good subjects of this Kingdom&#8221;,</p><p>or the people of Scotland, to fish in the seas around our coastline. That act of the old Scottish Parliament perhaps underlines how important Scotland&#8217;s seas are to the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is very kind of you, Mr Fergusson.

One thing that I did not mention earlier but which I would like to mention is that I came to the post late in the pre-legislative stage of the bill, and I thank Stewart Stevenson for all his early work in his ministerial capacity. The road that we have travelled since then has not been without its challenges. There have been occasions on which the debate has been less constructive, as the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee noted in its stage 1 report.</p><p>The bill provides us with the legislative tools to ensure that farmed and wild fisheries and their interactions with each other continue to be managed effectively, maximising their combined contribution to supporting economic growth but, crucially, with due regard to the wider marine environment. The bill also provides a foundation on which to move forward and better manage our relationships and build trust.</p><p>The refreshed ministerial group on sustainable aquaculture has engaged the minds of our stakeholders, and there is a tide of optimism that proactive activity will take place over the coming months and years. Members of the MGSA helped to inform many of the provisions that we have debated in the past few months. The group met for the first time a couple of weeks ago, as I said earlier, and everyone is keen to look forward and not back. They recognise the need to address any negative perceptions that may have emerged, and there is also genuine acceptance that the debate has often excluded the many positive activities that take place. It is important that we do not lose sight of the many good examples of local engagement that already exist.</p><p>Improved governance arrangements for our fisheries boards and enhanced salmon management through the bill, coupled with the planned fisheries management review, will bring many opportunities. I encourage all our stakeholders to reflect on how they might better promote those and other positive examples of their work. As I speak here today, I am confident in saying that the bill is proportionate and strikes the right balance.</p><p>Time forbids me from saying too much, but I would like to turn to a few points that were made in the debate. Important points were made on carcass tagging by both Angus MacDonald and Alex Fergusson, who sought clarity about the timescales that are involved. The consultation will run for the standard 12-week period, and we will look to run it in parallel with the notification to the EU. The EU approval timetable is for the EU to determine, of course. It can be up to 18 months, but only if the EU has issues with what is proposed. I hope that it will be faster than that.</p><p>Rob Gibson made an important point about the potential for GM feed to get into the food chain. The Government intends to bring forward a debate as soon as possible after the summer recess to assess food authenticity and food labelling in recognition of the issue that the member has raised. I welcome his support for the management review that we propose as phase 2 of this important development of the wild fisheries and aquaculture sector.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor asked what evidence we have to demonstrate why transparency is a risk. I recognise that the point that Graeme Dey made is open to challenge from others because more than one factor is involved, but it indicated that publication of sea lice data damaged the Irish aquaculture sector. However, I will certainly look more closely at that.</p><p>On the measures that we have discussed today, I recognise that some people have reservations about the approach that we have taken to the voluntary reporting of data. Those reservations were evident in the earlier debate. However, I sincerely believe that encouraging the voluntary sharing of information&#8212;not just in the context of sea lice&#8212;along with appropriate explanatory text, is the right way forward. To repeat what I said previously, we will not seek to legislate where we do not need to, and I believe that this is an example of that. It is clearly for others to demonstrate that the Government&#8217;s support for voluntary measures has been well placed&#8212;I think that we all know who I mean. Equally clear is our existing ability to progress through secondary legislation if the voluntary approach does not work as expected.</p><p>Claire Baker raised the issue of how we will test whether the approach has worked. The publication of data will show us that, because if there is a persistent pattern of sea lice infestations in fish farms across Scotland, we will know that the approach is not working to drive down the numbers. I will certainly keep her informed on what we are doing in that regard.</p><p>I was pleased to support the amendments that Jim Hume lodged in relation to training on equipment that is used in fish farming. I thank him for his willingness to engage on the drafting and for the opportunity to explore what might best deliver a result on which we could all agree.</p><p>I want to end the debate on a really positive note. Everyone here recognises the enormous benefits to Scotland and the people of Scotland of successful and thriving aquaculture and wild fisheries sectors that can develop. The improved governance arrangements for our fishery boards and enhanced salmon management through the bill, coupled with the planned fisheries management group, will bring many opportunities. I therefore encourage all stakeholders to reflect on how they might better promote those. Now is the time to look forward, to be positive and to begin to build relationships that allow us to prosper in future. We have a clear implementation plan. There is much to do and the bill provides the foundations for that.

As a fellow South Scotland member, I know that Aileen McLeod has been involved with the Mull of Galloway Trust and its proposals to purchase the Mull of Galloway estate from the Northern Lighthouse Board. I understand that, as an independent ballot assessor, Aileen McLeod oversaw the historic count that demonstrated the community&#8217;s overwhelming support for the trust&#8217;s proposals for the purchase under the community right-to-buy provisions. It must have been an exciting moment for everyone involved and a monumental evening for the trust and the community of Kirkmaiden.</p><p>I congratulate the Mull of Galloway Trust, especially its directors, Donald Mccolm, Stephen Hardy, Maureen Chand and Kathleen Mary Hardy, as well as all those who were involved, including the community of Kirkmaiden, on what is a highly significant community buyout. I was not aware of the news about Steve and Kathleen Hardy, but I certainly wish them well as they fight the scourge of cancer&#8212;I am sure that we all share that sentiment, and they have my best wishes for sure.</p><p>The community buyout proposal has been successful. As members have acknowledged, the Scottish land fund announced today that the Mull of Galloway Trust has been awarded &#163;388,500 towards the purchase and development of the lighthouse estate. I am delighted that the trust can now complete the purchase and take forward its plans for the development of this locally important asset.</p><p>As Aileen McLeod and others have stated, the community buyout has great potential in helping to develop a critically important tourist complex in a remote area of Scotland. The buyout will make a significant economic contribution to a remote rural community&#8212;the 20 jobs that have been mentioned are hugely significant for an area of this scale&#8212;and it will help to maintain and increase employment opportunities to counter the trend of young people leaving the area to find work. It will also increase volunteering opportunities and community involvement, and it will improve community cohesion.</p><p>I believe that the proposals will make a real and long-lasting difference to this remote south of Scotland community. The proposals are firmly rooted in the community&#8217;s needs and aspirations for development, which bodes very well for their success. Successful projects such as a community buyout do not just happen but take dedication and commitment&#8212;qualities that the trust has demonstrated in spades.</p><p>Three themes run through such successful projects, as we have heard during the debate. First, an especially important theme is the need for strong community support behind a project. As we have heard, the trust ballot secured a phenomenal result, with a 63.8 per cent turnout among the 551 eligible voters in the community. As Alex Fergusson, Aileen McLeod and others have said, an overwhelming 98.6 per cent of those who cast a vote voted in favour of the trust&#8217;s proposals. The trust should be congratulated on achieving those outstanding figures.</p><p>Strong community support has also been a feature of other buyouts, as communities have rallied and stood firmly behind their buyout proposals. In 26 of the 36 other ballots that have been conducted under the community right-to-buy provisions of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, more than 90 per cent of voters voted in favour of the community buyout proposals, with two communities&#8212;Salen and Bridgecastle&#8212;each securing 100 per cent. Those are impressive figures, which we politicians can only envy.</p><p>Those figures show the impressive community support that has been generated in communities that have had the opportunity to purchase land and land assets. It is important to remember that such opportunities are not confined&#8212;as Aileen McLeod, Joan McAlpine, Alex Fergusson and others reminded us&#8212;to communities in the Highlands and Islands but are available throughout Scotland. Such support is fundamental to the success of community buyouts: it secures community buy-in to the community-led proposals; it engages people in their community and its future development and success; and, importantly, it provides a strong foundation for a community body or community group to take forward its plans.</p><p>A second theme has been partnership working. To acquire the estate and to develop its proposals, the trust is establishing and using a number of partnerships, including partnerships with other third sector organisations and with the public sector. Those have already played a significant role in developing practical and workable proposals, and they will also mean that the trust has access to a wide support network. I understand that fundamental links between the Mull of Galloway Trust and the South Rhins Community Development Trust have helped to bring about the evolution and development of the land buyout. The two organisations plan to work together after purchase to develop the plans for the estate. That is a very positive suggestion.</p><p>Together, the Mull of Galloway Trust and the South Rhins Community Development Trust complement each other&#8217;s roles and experience: one is a company that was founded in 1999 and has extensive knowledge from running the Mull of Galloway experience, which received recognition when it secured the Dumfries &amp; Galloway Life tourism award in 2011; the other is a newly incorporated company that was founded to acquire property at the Mull of Galloway and to become a community landowner. That partnership is an excellent example of local organisations working together to share their experience for the greater benefit of their communities and to ensure that the assets that are acquired will be an integral part of the wider economic development landscape. They provide an example that other communities should look to.</p><p>A third theme is the use of professional advice and support. The Mull of Galloway Trust has drawn on advice from a range of professional advisers, including Dumfries and Galloway Social Enterprise Network and the highly regarded Destination Dumfries and Galloway. The development proposals and business plan clearly show the difference that such advice can have on developing practical, realistic and workable proposals. I urge other communities to look at how they can utilise advice from professional advisers and draw on their knowledge.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased that the trust has been awarded funding from the Scottish land fund to help to realise the project. The land fund&#8212;delivered by the Big Lottery and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for the Scottish Government&#8212;is about ensuring that rural communities throughout Scotland can achieve increased sustainable economic, social and environmental development through the experience of acquiring, owning and managing land and land assets. I encourage other rural communities that are interested in acquiring land and land assets to consider using the fund. There are now many examples of how the fund has been applied, from the purchase of local shops or land adjacent to village halls to larger-scale land buyouts&#8212;and, of course, the occasional lighthouse, too. The people of Kirkmaiden have a lot to look forward to.</p><p>In the time remaining, I will pick up a couple of points that were raised by members. I was particularly interested in the suggestion that the foghorn might become the equivalent of the 1 o&#8217;clock gun&#8212;I would certainly like to see that. Like Alex Fergusson, I think that I will add the Mull of Galloway to my bucket list of destinations to visit. I am more than happy to accept an invitation from Aileen McLeod to visit the facility to see how the community is getting on with the project. On the point that Aileen McLeod and Joan McAlpine raised about communities outside the Highlands and Islands&#8212;to be fair, everyone echoed this sentiment&#8212;I want the message to go out loud and clear from here that communities not just in the south of Scotland but in other parts of Scotland, too, should benefit from the land fund. I also echo the sentiments about the work of Sarah Skerratt&#8212;Joan McAlpine mentioned her, as did others&#8212;which is a very important body of work.</p><p>Community land ownership will make a real difference to the Mull of Galloway, as it already does to communities throughout Scotland. As I have said before, this is one of rural Scotland&#8217;s success stories, but we want to do and achieve more, and I want to reiterate that point today. I am sure that, in the future, community land buyouts and wider land reform will be a main driver for investment, regeneration and economic sustainability for all Scotland. The Government is determined to empower communities throughout Scotland to grasp the opportunity to take control of their own destiny.</p><p>I commend Aileen McLeod for moving the motion today and I echo members in commending the Mull of Galloway Trust for its hard work. It is nice to see that paying off.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:56.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691196", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mull of Galloway"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I thank Aileen McLeod for securing the debate.

I echo the points that have been made about the species champion roles, which are proving to be highly effective.</p><p>As we have heard from Mary Scanlon and others, freshwater pearl mussels are dangerously close to extinction. However, despite freshwater pearl mussels&#8217; low numbers in absolute terms, Scotland&#8217;s rivers are a global stronghold for the species. For example, as others have said, in Scotland at present there are 106 known populations of freshwater pearl mussels, which equates to around half&#8212;rather than a third, as Mary Scanlon said&#8212;of the world&#8217;s populations, which is why we in Scotland have a special responsibility for the species.</p><p>The importance of the freshwater pearl mussel goes beyond its rarity. The presence of rare freshwater mussels is an excellent indicator of water quality. The mussel needs pristine water to survive, and its continued presence in our river systems is a sign that there is clean, fresh water, which we all need; in many ways, the species is a bellwether for the condition of our ecosystems.</p><p>As Mary Scanlon, Jamie McGrigor and Richard Lyle have acknowledged, the life cycle of the mussel is itself fascinating. Not only do pearl mussels live for more than 100 years, the very youngest pearl mussels cannot survive without living on fish gills and they therefore have a symbiotic relationship with our freshwater fisheries. As Richard Lyle and other members have said, young mussels harmlessly attach themselves to the gills of juvenile salmon or trout over their first winter, before detaching themselves to live in the river bed. They therefore have a close relationship with salmonids, which themselves are a vital part of the ecosystems of Scottish rivers.</p><p>The freshwater pearl mussel inhabits coarse sand and gravel beds of fast-flowing, non-calcareous streams and rivers, which are ones that are not alkaline. There are approximately 69 recruiting or viable populations with juveniles present in Scotland, mostly in the north and west, as others have said, with scattered records of the species elsewhere. Few viable populations occur elsewhere in the British isles or even the rest of Europe.</p><p>Turning to the conservation status of the species, I note that a &#163;3.5&#160;million LIFE+ programme nature project called pearls in peril is being led by Scottish Natural Heritage. It runs from 2012 to 2016 and in Scotland focuses on 19 special areas of conservation that have been identified as the most important for the freshwater pearl mussel&#8217;s continued survival. The project aims to improve water quality and physical habitat for the benefit of the freshwater pearl mussel and to communicate with local, national and international audiences to raise awareness of freshwater pearl mussel conservation issues. A national survey of freshwater pearl mussels to determine the status of the species has just begun and is expected to be completed by early 2015.</p><p>On-going projects include assessing the success of reintroducing freshwater pearl mussels to rivers that once supported them. The hope is that it will be worth while seeding more rivers, which is a point that I think Jamie McGrigor made. Further research is being undertaken into the relationship between freshwater pearl mussels and their host salmonids. SNH and SEPA are sponsoring a PhD student at the University of Stirling who, among other things, is investigating the effects of high flows on freshwater pearl mussels and what rainfall increase related to climate change might mean for the species. Management measures aimed at enhancing salmonid fish stocks are also important, as those fish are an essential link in the pearl mussel&#8217;s life cycle.</p><p>Other works that have been undertaken and which inform our strategy for the conservation of the species include, as Rob Gibson said, the river basin management plans that were published in 2009. Those set out objectives to reduce the impacts of diffuse pollution from agriculture on our water environment. Given the pearl mussel&#8217;s need for purity of water supply, those objectives are critical to its future.</p><p>Certain key catchments, which contain some of Scotland&#8217;s most important waters in the context of conservation, are failing to meet environmental standards due to the impact of diffuse pollution. That is an on-going challenge, to which we are responding. Those catchments have been identified by SEPA as priority catchments, and it is especially important that we take action to improve their water quality.</p><p>In the first river basin planning cycle, 14 priority catchments were selected, using a risk-based approach. Three of those&#8212;the South Esk, in Angus, and the Dee and the Deveron, in Aberdeenshire&#8212;have important freshwater pearl mussel populations.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690522", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freshwater Pearl Mussel"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Mary Scanlon for her motion and for raising awareness of the importance of the state of the freshwater pearl mussel.

The information has been discussed with land managers and immediate mitigation measures have been put in place, where possible. The work has been carried out with the support of local land managers, NFU Scotland and associated fishery boards and catchment groups.</p><p>I have spoken at length about what we are doing to conserve the freshwater pearl mussel. We also need to protect the species against illegal activity, which in some cases irretrievably damages entire populations. The legal framework that protects freshwater pearl mussels is strong. Freshwater pearl mussels are a UK biodiversity action plan priority species and are included on the Scottish biodiversity list. The species is listed in annex 2 and annex 5 of the European habitats directive and in schedule 5 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p><p>As members said, since 1998 it has been an offence to intentionally or recklessly kill, injure, take or disturb freshwater pearl mussels or damage their habitat; to possess mussels or pearls collected since 1998; and to sell or advertise for sale freshwater pearl mussels or their pearls, unless that is done under licence from the Scottish Government.</p><p>Crimes against freshwater pearl mussels come in two forms: pearl fishing and illegal works. As I think Mary Scanlon was the first to acknowledge, the irony is that the main problem for those who want to steal pearls from our Scottish species is that very few mussels actually contain a pearl. That means that hundreds of mussels are needlessly and wastefully pulled from the river bed, including immature mussels, which would not be capable of yielding a pearl, only to be discarded dead on the riverbank. That is a disgusting waste. As mussels are slow growing and can live for 100 years, it is easy to see how such thoughtless destruction can wipe out a whole colony in one go. That is why we must pursue people who perpetrate such despicable acts.</p><p>However, the vast majority of damage comes from illegal works carried out in or around rivers. Anyone who wishes to carry out work must first obtain appropriate licences and must then carry out the work under the supervision of SNH and SEPA, as required. The requirement is non-negotiable, and land managers must realise that there is no excuse for ignoring it.</p><p>It is frustrating that incidents that damage freshwater pearl mussels could be avoided in all cases if consultation with SEPA and SNH took place and the proper consents and licences were obtained. The catastrophic chain of events in the river Lyon need not have happened if someone from the firms involved had taken responsibility for ensuring that proper processes were in place.</p><p>SNH has part-funded a special investigations officer in the national wildlife crime unit, Charlie Everitt&#8212;he is in the gallery today. His priority function is enforcement against freshwater pearl mussel crime. I think that Rob Gibson said that there have been 45 offences in the past five years, but it is encouraging that, in the past two years, the number dropped to four cases and then to two cases, so I hope that the national wildlife crime unit&#8217;s work is having an effect.</p><p>Charlie Everitt has led an NWCU operation to ascertain whether there is a demand for pearls under the counter in Scottish jewellers. It appears from that work that pearls are not in high demand in Scotland. However, it is clear that there is a demand somewhere for pearls. I am advised that work has been done with the UK Border Agency to help to detect trade out of the UK and gather information about foreign markets.</p><p>The partnership for action against wildlife crime&#8212;PAW Scotland&#8212;is finalising work with various organisations on the reporting of suspicious activity. It is also preparing briefing materials and maps for wildlife crime officers in targeted police stations. It is even exploring the use of genetics as a new forensic tool. I hope that that addresses some of Alison Johnstone&#8217;s points about detection.</p><p>As part of a large LIFE+ project, moves are afoot to recruit a riverwatcher to launch riverwatch schemes in north and west Scotland, where the species is strongest.</p><p>As I said, the species is threatened not only by pearl fishing but by pollution and illegal riverworks. Time is against me, so suffice it to say that I will be happy to meet Mary Scanlon to explain what measures are in place in relation to hydro power schemes and to talk about SEPA&#8217;s work on environmental impact assessment.</p><p>The concern that has been expressed about a watering down of SEPA&#8217;s duty to protect the environment is quite unfounded. I hope that as work on the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill unfolds, people will realise that it is about making regulation more coherent, transparent and easy to understand and not about diluting the impact of regulation.</p><p>This is the year of natural Scotland. I am grateful to Mary Scanlon for her attention to such an important species. We all have a duty of care towards our native species, and although the freshwater pearl mussel might not have the charisma of the red squirrel or provide the spectacle of the sky-dancing hen harrier, it is a species of global conservation concern, which plays a vital role in the ecosystems of our rivers. It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that the species is protected for future generations, as part of our natural heritage.

Some issues are parallel with those in the rest of the UK, but the main area of difference is the level of risk.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate allows us to address what can be done both here and in Whitehall, and I am grateful to the convener of the Public Petitions Committee for raising the issue and to Chic Brodie for bringing the debate to the chamber so that we can air the facts and invite comment from members on the way forward.</p><p>I highlight that there are significant differences, as alluded to by Jackson Carlaw, between the level of flood risk in Scotland and that in England, which has a much greater number of properties at risk. According to SEPA&#8217;s most recent assessment of flood risk, in Scotland approximately one in 22 properties is at risk, whereas in England the figure is as many as one in six. However, although there are fewer properties at risk in Scotland, in absolute and relative terms the overall impact of flooding on properties is as devastating here as it is elsewhere. Therefore, it is important that any agreement reached with the Association of British Insurers meets the needs of Scottish policyholders.</p><p>If Scotland were independent&#8212;just to get Jackson Carlaw and Alex Johnstone excited&#8212;we would be better placed to negotiate a deal with the ABI that is in Scotland&#8217;s best interests. In the meantime, we will have to continue to make representations on the issue to the UK Government in order to achieve the best solution possible for Scotland in the circumstances, recognising that although the ABI regards the Scottish Government as a stakeholder, we do not directly participate in negotiations.</p><p>It is clear at this stage of the negotiations and with the imminent expiry of the statement of principles that it will take time to put in place any proposed solution. Transitional arrangements for Scotland will have to be put in place until such time as any proposed solution can be implemented. That is another reason why I have asked Richard Benyon to make sure that Scotland is kept informed of progress on the negotiations. Unfortunately, although I welcome his recent letter in response to my letter, his response still leaves us in the dark as to what those transitional arrangements might be. However, having discussed the issue today with Mr Benyon, I am at least confident that the issue is being treated as a matter of urgency and that a preferred solution is being developed.</p><p>As Chic Brodie said, last year we commissioned a piece of work to assess the potential impact of the expiry of the statement of principles, which was undertaken by the University of Dundee. It identified that the groups that are particularly vulnerable to any increase in the cost of flood insurance are people on low income, the elderly and those in local authority or housing association rented properties. Access to affordable insurance is likely to be even more difficult for those groups now that the UK welfare reform changes are being implemented and people are seeing their income squeezed further.</p><p>In the meantime, we will continue to invest in flood risk management in Scotland, in order to reduce the risk of flooding as much as possible, which will make it easier for policyholders to get flood insurance cover. In partnership with SEPA, local authorities and Scottish Water, we are working hard to reduce flood risk in Scotland. SEPA identified 243 potentially vulnerable areas in the national flood risk assessment, which highlighted the communities that are most at risk of flooding.</p><p>SEPA is developing new flood risk and flood hazard maps that will be published later this year. The maps will build on the initial flood risk assessment and provide all the bodies involved in flood risk management with better information for decision making. The better the information that we have on flood risk, the easier that it will be for insurance companies to ensure that flood insurance premiums more accurately reflect the actual level of risk.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Chic Brodie alluded to that point, which I will come to.

In practice, our experience is that some of the schemes that are being introduced are rapidly increasing in cost, so it is difficult to predict the exact cost of remedying each potentially vulnerable area, including the ultimate capital cost. We are having on-going interaction with particular projects to try to identify what the outturn costs will be.</p><p>As Chic Brodie indicated, it is important that insurance companies can access the Scottish flood defence asset database. That will enable them to take account of the reduction in risk that the construction of flood defences affords when they set premiums and the level of insurance excesses that are payable, which can be extremely high in some cases.</p><p>Chic Brodie asked for my feedback on that issue, and I am delighted to tell members that SEPA has now received responses from all 32 local authorities, none of which places any significant constraints or restrictions on the use of data from the flood defence asset database by any of the existing member categories, which include members of the Association of British Insurers. That means that the financial benefits to households of lower insurance premiums should be faster in coming forward when investment is made.</p><p>The Scottish Government is currently seeking to fund further research on a blueprint for property-level protection provision through local authorities in order to find the best system to enable homeowners, residents and businesses to protect themselves. The fact that individual property owners and occupants are responsible for protecting their own properties is often overlooked. My office in Hawick is currently being fitted with such measures, and I was impressed by Scottish Borders Council&#8217;s service.</p><p>Earlier this year, I launched, along with SEPA, the first targeted coastal flood warning schemes for the east coast of Scotland. Those will benefit coastal communities from Eyemouth to Arbroath, and the new system will enable people to take action to protect their possessions and properties before flooding occurs and will reduce the damage costs as a result. Additional flood warning schemes are under development: the one for Stonehaven should be operational in autumn this year and the one for the Moray coast in spring 2014. Those additional schemes will take the total number of flood warning schemes in Scotland to 249.</p><p>The Scottish Government is continuing to invest in flood protection schemes. As part of that commitment, it looked at the mechanism for funding large-scale flood protection projects, in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, and agreed that, for the current spending review period, the flooding component of the general capital grant should be targeted at major new projects. The distribution of that funding is currently being agreed between COSLA and the Scottish Government. Three schemes were successful in bidding for funding in the first round of applications&#8212;Galashiels, Forres and the River Ness&#8212;and a second round of applications will be carried out later this year.</p><p>As part of the general capital grant, the Scottish Government currently funds local authorities to the tune of &#163;42 million per annum as we attempt to overcome decades of underinvestment. We have raised funding from an average of &#163;5.5 million per annum from 1999 to 2007 to &#163;42 million per annum in 2007-08 onwards, and we have committed to continue that funding until 2015.</p><p>In February we published the surface water management guidance, which is an important step towards a collaborative approach to the management of surface water flooding in Scotland. It was developed jointly by the Scottish Government, local authorities, Scottish Water and SEPA through the Scottish advisory and implementation forum for flooding and will help the bodies that are involved in managing surface water to work more effectively together.</p><p>The Scottish Government will continue to work in partnership with SEPA, Scottish Water and local authorities to protect more communities from flood risk. The creation of 14 new local plan districts brings together the key players in each area and enables them, in partnership, to take strategic co-ordinated decisions on how best to target their resources in a cohesive way. Those partnerships will develop local plans to tackle flood risk, which will target resources where they will be most effective in reducing that risk.</p><p>The Scottish Government will continue to make representations to the Westminster Government to encourage it to reach an agreement that ensures that flood insurance is available and&#8212;crucially&#8212;affordable in Scotland. In an ideal world, such an agreement should also reflect the lower risk of flooding in Scotland.</p><p>That will, in combination with our continuing work to manage flood risk, create a safer, stronger and more secure environment for Scotland&#8217;s citizens and businesses now and in the future.

It has been interesting and helpful to hear members&#8217; views on flood insurance. I thank members for their many insightful contributions; I will pick up on issues that members raised before I make some closing remarks.</p><p>Interesting points have been made. Maureen Watt said that new developments can disturb the water table. The issue should be dealt with as part of the planning process, but I will ask my officials to consider whether there is more that we could do to ensure that it is considered at an earlier stage.</p><p>Elaine Murray talked about property-level flood protection. The issues in that regard are well known, which is why the Scottish Government will fund further research on property-level protection with a view to ascertaining the best system for individual householders. A one-size-fits-all approach does not work. Flood guards are no good if the water comes up through the floor&#8212;I think that it was Alex Johnstone who talked about water coming up through the sewers. As I said, my Hawick office is in a flood area, so I myself have taken property-level prevention measures.</p><p>Chic Brodie suggested that the new SEPA flood risk maps have been delayed. The maps were always planned for the end of 2013. I confirm that they are on schedule; we anticipate that they will be ready by the end of this year.</p><p>Sarah Boyack talked about the need to quantify the cost of flood protection. I partly addressed the issue in my opening speech. The new flood risk management plans, which will be provided by the end of 2015, and the local flood risk management plans will provide indicative costs of the flood risk management measures that are in the plans, as well as prioritising those measures.</p><p>Of course, the 2009 act helps Government and COSLA to judge which applications from local authorities represent the most strategic investments, which need to be prioritised at national level. I reassure Alex Johnstone that Aberdeenshire Council will be treated like any other council when it makes an application, regardless of its capital or current reserves.</p><p>John Wilson and other members made important points about insurance for low-income households. The Scottish Government encourages people who rent in the public housing sector to take up insurance-with-rent schemes, where such schemes are available. I recognise that that is not always possible.</p><p>I turn to some of the more substantial points that have been raised. A number of members mentioned the flood re scheme, which is the front runner among the options that might be available to the UK Government and ABI. I know that the UK Government wants a scheme that involves some form of pooling. It is possible that legislation will be required if there is agreement on such a scheme across the industry and Government. That would cause the delay that I mentioned in the context of the need for transitional arrangements to cover the gap. I am reasonably optimistic that a solution will come and, having spoken to the UK minister today, I am reassured that the Government is working hard to find a solution.</p><p>A number of members raised the subsidy issue. It is worth pointing out that, although an individual household in a high-risk area might be subsidised to the tune of &#163;450, the subsidy across all policyholders is in the relatively modest region of &#163;6 or thereabouts per premium. However, although it does not place a huge burden on individual policyholders, it would be desirable to avoid it if at all possible. Under the flood re scheme, that informal arrangement would essentially be formalised.</p><p>Members have highlighted a number of local flooding situations. I reassure the chamber that I will take on board examples of double flooding as in Stonehaven and Comrie, and I will ask my officials to look at those incidents and assess the scale of the impact of double flooding. In response to Annabelle Ewing, I will certainly speak to the ABI about her reasonable suggestion of looking at Comrie as a case study, as it would certainly inform our thinking. On Sarah Boyack&#8217;s point about a licensing scheme, we certainly want such a scheme to come forward as soon as possible.</p><p>With regard to the points raised by Professor Crichton himself, I am happy to write to the ABI to emphasise the lower flood risk in Scotland and see whether that will have an impact. As for building standards, I note that they already require mitigation for new build but I acknowledge that the main issue is the older buildings that are flooding and what happens thereafter. We feel that the insurance industry is probably best placed to assess individual properties and determine the measures that are required. Introduction of such a requirement in building standards legislation would add a significant burden and it should be relatively simple for the insurance industry to require appropriate resilience work to be carried out as the condition of a claims settlement. Nevertheless, we will continue to look at the issue.</p><p>With regard to members&#8217; questions about the Scottish Government&#8217;s discussions with the ABI, I point out that we have had positive discussions with Aidan Kerr and have asked the organisation to look at the extent to which individual property-level prevention schemes might be taken into account in setting premiums and ensuring successes. As with neighbourhood watch schemes and, say, the installation of a burglar alarm on a property, such prevention schemes should be taken into account in reducing individuals&#8217; premiums and as a means of encouraging people to take further action. We must also acknowledge the industry-wide problem of some insurance companies cherry picking premiums and deliberately leaving out those at higher risk of flooding, and I hope that any solution will eliminate such a risk.</p><p>As I am aware that time is passing, I will move to my closing remarks. The range of this afternoon&#8217;s debate has shown the consensus in the chamber for flood insurance to be both available and affordable to those at risk of flooding. The devastating impacts of flooding are bad enough where people have insurance&#8212;I have seen that devastation for myself in places such as Stonehaven&#8212;but the prospect of families and businesses suffering from flooding and having no insurance cover to help repair and replace their property is appalling.</p><p>I am sure that, as the constituency member for Stonehaven, Nigel Don will know that according to the Scottish flood forum&#8217;s assessment one in 10 people affected by that flood were not covered by insurance. Since becoming a minister, I have met many people who have endured the recent storms and flooding, and I have seen at first hand the damage and distress that the floods have caused. I have seen communities such as Stonehaven at their best despite nature doing its worst.</p><p>In the aftermath of the recent flood in Stonehaven, the Scottish flood forum has, as I have pointed out, advised that 10 per cent of those affected did not have flood cover and that many of those with flood insurance face excesses of between &#163;2,000 and &#163;10,000. In fact, from what Alex Johnstone has said, it sounds as though those excesses might be even higher.</p><p>Despite the current public spending constraints, it is clear from the many flooding incidents in 2012 that a long-term programme of work is needed to address flood risk, particularly when the potential impact of climate change is taken into account. We should make no mistake: as members have pointed out, we have a minimum of three or four decades of change in our weather and climate to come.</p><p>I assure the chamber that the Scottish Government will continue to work in partnership with SEPA, Scottish Water and local authorities on measures to reduce the risk of flooding from all sources, and I should take a moment to acknowledge the work that SEPA, local authorities and Scottish Water have already done in helping to reduce flood risk in communities across Scotland. Their continued commitment to protecting communities wherever possible is essential and their work makes a real difference.</p><p>The Scottish Government has taken a number of steps towards achieving our goal. For example, the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 streamlined the decision-making process for new flood prevention schemes by removing the necessity for central Government approval where there is local consensus. The act also places new duties on all responsible authorities to co-operate and act to reduce overall flood risk. In addition to the flood risk assessment that has already been published, the act requires SEPA to produce new flood risk and hazard maps by the end of 2013&#8212;I made that very point to Chic Brodie&#8212;and the first national flood risk management plan by the end of 2015.</p><p>The flood risk management plan that is under development will set out the national strategy for managing flood risk and the measures to be undertaken. The research that we commissioned in 2012, which I mentioned earlier, made it clear that it is important that the people and businesses in flood risk areas of Scotland&#8212;particularly the most vulnerable groups&#8212;have access to affordable flood insurance while flood protection measures are being identified and developed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a timely debate.

I look forward to continued engagement with members and stakeholders on those issues and I am confident that together we can deliver a brighter future for Scotland&#8217;s crofters.</p><p>However, today I am grateful for this opportunity to inform Parliament of the Scottish Government&#8217;s intentions to address a particular issue that has come to light in relation to crofting legislation&#8212;specifically, the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. The issue concerns owner-occupier crofters&#8217; ability to apply to the Crofting Commission to decroft their croft land.</p><p>Decrofting, which is provided for in sections 23, 24 and 25 of the 2010 act, means removing the land in question from crofting tenure and the provisions of the 2010 act. It can be applied for in relation to all or part of a croft and might be used, for instance, to allow for a house to be built on decrofted land, which can help to facilitate the handing down of a croft from one generation of a crofting family to the next, or it may enable the building of a dwelling for a new entrant to crofting, on a croft that does not currently have such provision.</p><p>The 2010 act was the first crofting act to make specific reference to owner-occupier crofters, even though crofters had, for many years, enjoyed the right to buy their crofts. The 2010 act rectified that situation by explicitly distinguishing between tenant crofters and owner-occupier crofters.</p><p>Unfortunately, a flaw has come to light in the way in which that distinction applies in the case of decrofting of land. It was the Scottish Government&#8217;s intention that tenant and owner-occupier crofters should be treated equally, and we believe that that was also the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s intention during the passage of the 2010 act. However, as some members will be aware, the Crofting Commission has received legal advice that sets out that, in fact, the 2010 act inadvertently limits the circumstances in which owner-occupier crofters can apply to decroft land. That being the case, the Crofting Commission has decided to suspend the processing of such applications from owner-occupier crofters&#8212;a decision which was, of course, not taken lightly.</p><p>Since the problem came to light, the Scottish Government, along with the Crofting Commission, has taken a number of steps. First, in the matter of due diligence, it was necessary to confirm our belief that the will of the Scottish Parliament was indeed that owner-occupier crofters, as well as tenant crofters, should be able to apply to decroft. That required us to check carefully the documentation relating to preparation of the 2010 act.</p><p>Having satisfied ourselves on that point, the Scottish Government naturally considered whether it would be possible to overcome the flaw in the 2010 act without recourse to legislation&#8212;I know that others have done their own analysis on that point. It had been suggested to us that ministers could simply direct the Crofting Commission to continue to process and sign off on applications. Unfortunately the advice to ministers is clear that no such solution exists under the terms of the 2010 act. That means that in order to correct the flaw in question, an amendment to the crofting legislation is required.</p><p>The Scottish Government has also had discussions with stakeholder organisations, including the Scottish Crofting Federation and the National Farmers Union of Scotland, as well as with the commission itself, of course. In the light of those discussions and our analysis, I inform Parliament that the Scottish Government intends to introduce a bill as soon as possible after the Easter Recess to address the issue. I intend to propose a timetable for the bill that will enable Parliament to consider carefully the proposed changes, while ensuring that the matter is resolved quickly.</p><p>While we are opening the doors for owner-occupier crofters to decroft their land, we should recognise the vital and important role that croft land plays in the life of this country, and of the crofting counties in particular. Crofting brings multiple benefits to our nation; it supports the social and cultural fabric of many communities and it maintains agricultural production in the Highlands and Islands, which it does in a way that delivers the environmental benefits that come from extensive grazed livestock systems. Moreover, although comparatively few crofters are full-time, crofting makes a significant contribution to the economies of the crofting counties.</p><p>Given the important benefits that crofting provides, members will want to be assured that in supporting the forthcoming bill that I am announcing today they will not be opening the floodgates and allowing massive decrofting to take place. I am happy to give that assurance.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s precise form will have to be worked out with the parliamentary draftsman, as there is more than one potential way to draft the bill to address what is a rather technical issue. However, our clear intention is that the safeguards that apply to other forms of decrofting, including the need for approval by the Crofting Commission, will also apply in owner-occupier crofter cases.</p><p>I know that several members have been contacted by crofters who are, quite understandably, concerned about the issue and I have also mentioned that the commission has suspended processing of such applications that are in the pipeline. That was the only decision that the commission could reasonably take in the circumstances, based on the legal advice that it had received, although I am aware that the effective moratorium has left nearly 60 crofters in the uncertain position of not knowing when or even whether their decrofting application might be approved. There are also more than 170 cases in which the commission had in good faith already granted approval to decroft before this problem came to light. In the Government&#8217;s view, it is essential that their situation be addressed as part of the solution. I hope that Parliament will support us in that.</p><p>I am very grateful to members who represent crofting counties and to others for the details that they have sent me or my officials on the impact that is being felt by crofters. That information has been a very helpful supplement to the information that I have had from the commission itself, and all of it has contributed to the Government&#8217;s conclusion that the legislation should be amended.</p><p>Although I cannot discuss the specifics of individuals or families involved, I can give examples of the impacts that owner-occupier crofters face. Some are unable to start building their houses until the land is decrofted; however, because time-limited planning consent has been granted, deadlines for completion might be approaching. Others are unable to decroft to increase the size of the house site in order to extend their houses and provide sufficient garden ground for them.</p><p>One young crofter feels unable to proceed with acquiring part of an owner-occupier crofter&#8217;s croft because of the uncertainty of being able to decroft part of his new croft to build a house for himself to live in. A young crofting couple who are planning to start a family are unable to decroft the house site so that they can sell it to finance a larger house while retaining the original croft land. There are other examples of owner-occupier crofters being unable to decroft potential wind turbine sites or other parcels of croft land for development in the knowledge that personal financial investment will be required.</p><p>I believe that those examples demonstrate the importance of addressing the issue quickly but effectively. Any move to request expedited parliamentary consideration of a bill is not taken lightly, but on the evidence of the difficulty that is faced by crofters, I believe that in this instance such a move is necessary.</p><p>I am therefore grateful to Parliament for this opportunity to announce the Scottish Government&#8217;s intentions in relation to the decrofting issue in the 2010 act and hope that the announcement gives some comfort to crofters that a solution is on its way. I understand the very real concern that exists in the crofting communities and look forward to receiving Parliament&#8217;s support in the coming months to resolve the issue, in the interests of owner-occupier crofters who are being disadvantaged and in the interests of crofting as a whole.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688207", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Decrofting of Owner-occupied Croft Land"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, crofting is very much valued by this Parliament, by this Scottish Government, and by me, as the minister who has responsibility for crofting.

Those detailed and thoughtful submissions are a vital part of the scrutiny process for the draft report.</p><p>The fact that four parliamentary committees took evidence on the draft RPP2&#8212;only two took evidence on RPP1&#8212;signals the growing recognition of the relevance across all parts of Scotland&#8217;s society and economy of acting on climate change. I am not aware of any subject other than the annual budget that would find six different Government ministers giving evidence to committees.</p><p>I put on record my recognition of the effort that the four committees have made in completing what has been an important but demanding task within the time constraints set down in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. The 60-day timeframe stems from the desire expressed by Parliament that there should be a defined period for scrutiny of each RPP before the reports are finalised. However, I appreciate the challenges posed by exploring such an all-encompassing subject and I would be happy to work with the Parliament to learn the lessons of the two RPPs to date and to consider whether there may be ways to improve the process for RPP3, which I reassure members&#8212;who are probably suffering stress from this exercise&#8212;is not due until at least late 2016.</p><p>The last thing that a minister wants is an important piece of their work to be picked apart and criticised, albeit constructively. However, I believe that the Parliament&#8217;s scrutiny of the draft RPP2 has been an extremely valuable process. Fresh eyes have added fresh perspectives and the final document will benefit as a result. The draft RPP2 is a complex and wide-ranging document, and the breadth of the recommendations reflects that. The Parliament will appreciate that, although we may not be able to respond to everything, there are some areas that we are already working on.</p><p>There were comments about the clarity of the data in some instances and it was noted that certain approaches that were taken in the first RPP are absent from the second report. Murdo Fraser referred to that. In many cases, those were editorial choices in attempting to simplify the document, but I am happy to reconsider how the data is presented in order to make it clearer.</p><p>In particular, committees have asked for more information to be provided about the three proposals that outline the technical emissions abatement potential in housing, transport and land use. Those proposals are intended to illustrate the emissions abatement that our modelling shows could be achieved in the longer term. More requires to be done to work through the possibilities associated with those proposals to improve our understanding and to narrow down the various ways in which they might be delivered. As we look towards 2027 and beyond, certain elements of RPP2 will, understandably, be work in progress. However, we will certainly reflect on what more we might be able to say about the technical potential proposals in the final report.</p><p>Many members and stakeholders emphasised the importance of behaviour change. Indeed, we have heard about that in the first four speeches in the debate. Whether that is the behaviour of individuals or organisations&#8212;or, to pick up Kevin Stewart&#8217;s point, communities&#8212;that is important in seeking to cut emissions significantly.</p><p>I am pleased that the principles set out in RPP2, which have been built on in the subsequent publication of our low-carbon behaviours framework, have been widely welcomed, but I appreciate the desire for the Government to demonstrate how it is turning the theory into action.</p><p>A programme of work is commencing to roll out the framework&#8217;s individual, social and material&#8212;ISM&#8212;tool to Government officials and delivery partners to help define and refine the behavioural aspects of our policies and proposals to deliver the greatest change. We will publish a report in the autumn highlighting the progress that has been made.</p><p>Finally, there have been calls for reassurance that appropriate governance and monitoring arrangements are in place to ensure that sufficient progress is maintained in delivering the action that we need. Although the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 certainly does not lack reporting requirements, the Government is happy to reconsider the use of milestones in the RPP in order to drive achievement. I emphasise the commitment that we have made to ensure that the senior civil servants responsible for the policy areas covered by RPP2 have individual and specific programmes of work to ensure deliverability and accountability.</p><p>RPP2 is the most comprehensive outline of measures for reducing national emissions that we know of anywhere. As the report describes and as I have explained in committee, revisions to the data used to calculate past and future emissions have significantly increased the challenge that faces us versus what we anticipated when we set our climate change targets as a Parliament. Despite that, RPP2 sets out a package that can meet those targets, delivering more emissions abatement than even our independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, suggested is possible.</p><p>Scotland is already a leader on emissions reductions in Europe. Our emissions cut of 24.3 per cent from 1990 is the biggest fall of any of the EU-15 member states and is higher than the average reduction of 14.3 per cent seen across the EU-27, which includes the accession countries from eastern Europe.</p><p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act requires an emissions cut of at least 42 per cent in 2020. RPP2 shows that we can get to 42.8 per cent even without the assistance of a stronger European Union target. If the EU does move, the RPP shows that that will help Scotland to achieve an emissions cut of up to 46.6 per cent in 2020.</p><p>When this Parliament passed its Climate Change (Scotland) Act in 2009 it was in the hope&#8212;even the expectation&#8212;that our ambitious stance would be followed by others. In fact, progress on an international climate deal has been disappointingly slow in the past few years. It would have been easy, in response, to set less demanding annual targets or use older data, allowing us to cross comfortably low hurdles, but we have not done that.</p><p>Similarly, it would have been easy in the face of Westminster&#8217;s cuts to the Scottish budget to deprioritise climate change, but we have not done that either, as testified by the &#163;1.1 billion committed over the current spending review period specifically to support low-carbon action.</p><p>That continued commitment is delivering progress such as: continuing to lead the United Kingdom on renewable power with 36 per cent of electricity consumption met from renewable energy, exceeding the 2011 target of 31 per cent and the UK&#8217;s own figure of 9 per cent; more than doubling the installation rate for loft insulation from 40,000 homes in 2008-09 to 104,000 in 2011-12; and reversing the declining woodland planting rate by increasing it from 2,600 hectares in 2009-10 to around 9,000 hectares in 2011-12, protecting that important carbon sink.</p><p>The Committee on Climate Change recognised that positive action in its recent Scottish progress report, and RPP2 shows where we can achieve even more in the future. Proposals will be turned into policies, but the RPP does not seek to nail down how every measure will be delivered over the next 15 years. RPP2 maps out where many of the opportunities lie, but there must continue to be flexibility about how those are realised.</p><p>I am not the first climate change minister to remind this Parliament that the Government cannot deliver this agenda on its own. Partnerships with the public and private sectors will be important and the actions of individuals and families will be vital.</p><p>RPP2 signals that the Government will not shy away from regulation where appropriate, but if we want to maintain the enthusiasm of the people of Scotland and their commitment to reducing emissions, we need to ensure that the effort that we expect of them is fair. Before regulating, it is right to seek to give people choices and to encourage and support households and businesses to use energy and other resources more efficiently, saving money as well as cutting emissions.</p><p>I think that the RPP2 gets the balance right. It is ambitious and wide ranging. It sets out a clear path for meeting our climate change targets while allowing flexibility to respond to future events. We are already laying the foundations for Scotland&#8217;s low-carbon future and the RPP2 shows how those foundations can be built on.</p><p>I have a bit more time, so I want to pick up on one point. Murdo Fraser requested information about how small and medium-sized enterprises might be assisted. We will respond in due course to the many points that the conveners raised, but I can highlight the fact that, as of April this year, the Scottish Government is establishing resource efficient Scotland, integrating current energy and resource efficiency advice and support for business and the public sector into one streamlined programme. The intention is that about &#163;7 million of investment will be used under that programme to improve annual administration efficiency savings. I hope that that will help with the issue that Murdo Fraser raised on behalf of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Rob Gibson, Murdo Fraser, Maureen Watt and Kevin Stewart for their comments and the work of their committees in considering the draft second report on the Scottish Government&#8217;s climate change proposals and policies, which we have all come to call RPP2.

I also thank members for the constructive tone in which all have engaged in the debate.</p><p>Many members have spoken with a great deal of conviction&#8212;as exemplified by Claudia Beamish in her closing speech&#8212;about ensuring that a specific course of action is taken, and they have expressed concern that RPP2 does not commit to certain long-term policies right now. I recognise that some members have also suggested that RPP2 has an overreliance on proposals rather than policies. I am aware that that has also been a criticism from people outside the chamber; that view has been part of the narrative of evidence sessions.</p><p>However, I urge colleagues across the chamber to get the issue into some sort of perspective. The difference in the position for Scotland in 2020, between the scenarios where only policies are implemented and those where proposals are also implemented, equates to about 2.3 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. With a 20 per cent EU-wide target, the balance of abatement from policies alone and the impact of net emissions trading&#8212;adding those together&#8212;amounts to an additional reduction of 4.1 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is more than 2.3 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. If the EU target of 30 per cent is adopted, the impact of policies and net trading will amount to a slightly higher reduction of 6 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. That, again, is much more than the 2.3 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent that we will depend on from proposals.</p><p>Hence, the majority of the abatement to 2020 under all scenarios is delivered by policies, with potential to add more from the proposals that are outlined in RPP2. That is just for the period up to 2020, for which we know we need urgent action if we are to achieve our interim targets.</p><p>On what will happen if there is no 30 per cent target across the EU&#8212;unfortunately, Jayne Baxter did not let me intervene to address this point&#8212;the Commissioner for Climate Action, Connie Hedegaard, has acknowledged that the EU will probably hit about 27 per cent in terms of actual climate change mitigation by 2020. Therefore, I am reasonably optimistic that, by 2016, the EU will perhaps move to a 30 per cent target. However, I accept that we need to take measures to allow for the possibility that that does not happen.</p><p>As I have said, the majority of abatement to 2020 will come through policies rather than proposals. Although there is a natural tendency to focus on the absolute targets in tonnes that are our statutory annual targets&#8212;I acknowledge that we will need to push for the EU-wide ambition to meet the statutory 2020 target&#8212;it is unfortunate that the nature of our annual target framework has locked in a now out-of-date understanding of Scotland&#8217;s actual emissions. As was pointed out earlier, we now know that our baseline was higher than we had originally thought. Given that the latest data make it clear that the baseline was a good bit higher, I welcome the fact that the Climate Change Committee, in the form of Ute Collier, who gave evidence to the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, has also acknowledged that point.</p><p>Another issue to get in perspective&#8212;aside from the accepted movement in the starting line&#8212;is the following: if the EU moves to a 30 per cent target and we implement proposals and policies, we will reduce emissions by 46.6 per cent against the revised higher 1990 baseline, even allowing for the fact that we started from a higher position. That would give us a considerable amount of headroom, as I hope members will appreciate. If we do not implement proposals at all, we will still lower emissions by 43.4 per cent from the revised baseline, provided that the EU adopts a 30 per cent target.</p><p>In the absence of an EU-wide target at 30 per cent&#8212;if the EU target instead continues at 20 per cent, which is the current position&#8212;Scotland will see its emissions fall by 42.8 per cent, as Marco Biagi pointed out, provided that proposals become policies.</p><p>Even if proposals do not, for whatever reason, become policies&#8212;I apologise because this is getting complicated&#8212;emissions are projected to fall by 39.6 per cent, which is a point that Marco Biagi also made. Members should bear it in mind that the EU Climate Change Committee targets were set on the basis of assumptions about the old emissions baseline and how much it was thought a country such as Scotland could deliver. The committee explicitly assumed in its calculations that a 30 per cent emissions target for the EU would be in place. We have stuck with the CCC&#8217;s annual targets, even though we could have used a legislative route to adjust the targets to reflect improved science. Alex Fergusson referred to that.</p><p>As Richard Dixon of Friends of the Earth Scotland put it:</p><p>&#8220;The Government could have changed the 2020 target and all the annual targets in between to make up for the fact that the baseline was different&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 20 February 2013; c 1764.]</p><p>Dr Dixon went on to state that he welcomed the fact that the Government had decided not to mess with the numbers, but to go with them.</p><p>We have not sought to escape the statutory annual targets, and achieving them will be difficult. I was certainly pleased to hear most members acknowledge that. However, it is crucial to a rational debate to emphasise that, to the best of our knowledge at this time, we may see emissions fall by 39.6 per cent against the higher baseline emissions figures in the worst-case scenario, and at best we may even see a decrease of 46.6 per cent by 2020. If the EU does not move to a higher ambition, we project a 42.8 per cent decrease. I hope that gives members some room for optimism. Yes&#8212;we still have to go further to get to the 43.7 per cent that we must achieve to get the tougher annual statutory target because the baseline has moved.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will do my absolute best, Presiding Officer.

The key for the Scottish Government is to build confidence within the communities that we trust them to protect the environments in which they live.</p><p>We also fully appreciate the social and environmental value-added benefits that high nature-value farming brings. Because of that, we will do all that lies within our power to create and maintain an environment in which the crofting way of life has a sustainable future. It is regrettable that the sustainability of crofting is being put at risk by the current UK Government&#8217;s position on CAP reform negotiations, especially given that crofters currently depend on &#8364;11.6&#160;million of single farm payments each year. Crofting tenures predominate in the 85 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s land that is in agricultural production that is designated as LFA, and which will in the future be covered by the new designation of &#8220;areas of natural constraint&#8221;.</p><p>While it is represented at EU negotiations by the UK Government, Scotland receives the fourth-lowest single farm payment per hectare of member states, and the lowest in the UK by far. Pillar 2, in which Scotland already receives the lowest payment in the EU&#8212;again from within the UK&#8212;is also key to many crofters who are involved in conservation farming and is vital for agri-environment projects. I was therefore extremely disappointed on behalf of our crofters that the UK Government chose not to argue, as 16 other member states did, for additional pillar 2 funding.</p><p>Maintenance of coupled payments for those who are engaged in livestock farming is also essential. To date, the UK Government has taken a different view&#8212;despite clear advice to UK ministers from our own Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment on their importance to Scottish agriculture.</p><p>Rob Gibson raised a point about abattoirs, about which he was absolutely correct.

Perhaps we can discuss them at a future date. I am conscious that time is pressing, so I apologise for having to rush on with my speech.</p><p>Parliament agreed to set up the crofting register under the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. My recent visit to Barra highlighted the fact that there would be value in local meetings to explain the mechanism for registering crofts in order to ensure that crofters can, under the new register, for the first time have legal certainty on the extent of, and interests in, their croft. I have asked my officials to ensure that local meetings be arranged to assist crofters in understanding the process of, and the requirements for, registration. Those meetings will take place in sufficient time for groups of crofters to access the 24 per cent reduction in voluntary registration costs that the Government offered in the first year of registration, at a cost of up to &#163;100,000.</p><p>The newly constituted board of the Crofting Commission, with a budget of &#163;2.5&#160;million per annum, is mainly made up of people who croft. That is important because it means that the commissioners are ideally placed to understand crofting issues. It is worth noting also that the franchise for the elections to the commission included 16 and 17-year-olds, which is relevant today. Scottish ministers will look at how we can support the commission&#8217;s vision on how crofting can be effectively regulated for the benefit of all.</p><p>I turn to some specific points in the motion. The Scottish Government is committed to providing on-going support to crofting. The crofting cattle improvement scheme, which is situated on the outskirts of Inverness, provides good quality high health-status bulls to groups of crofters at an annual cost to Government of &#163;400,000. That is vital in areas where no alternative hiring facility exists and where it is neither practicable nor cost effective to keep bulls and overwinter them. The scheme has dual benefits for participants and knock-on benefits for the rest of their communities. The hire cost is heavily subsidised and the progeny of the bulls that are used in the scheme are invariably healthy, heavy and attract premium prices at market.</p><p>As well as providing an affordable means to hire bulls, the Government has proved its on-going commitment to the scheme by modernising the facility to make it safe and future-proofed. As well as the higher livestock prices that will be achieved by crofters, other social and environmental benefits also accrue from the scheme.</p><p>Also in relation to food production, earlier this year we were delighted to support with &#163;112,000 for the period to 2015, as part of the food education programme, phase 2 of the crofting connections project, which has been mentioned by a number of members. The Scottish Government recognises the role that active crofting plays in maintaining population, which ties in to Jean Urquhart&#8217;s point about the health of crofting affecting the culture and health of communities. The Government has continued to support that role through provision of grants for construction and improvement of croft housing through the croft house grant scheme, which has a budget of &#163;2.6&#160;million per annum.</p><p>However, the nature of crofting has changed and, although some 8,000 crofters are agriculturally active, we should recognise that comparatively few crofts are large enough for sufficient family income to be generated from agriculture alone. The &#8220;Committee of Inquiry on Crofting&#8212;Final Report&#8221; of 2008 recorded that</p><p>&#8220;on average crofters derive about 20% of their net income from agriculture&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>that relates to the point that John Finnie made about how crofters need more than one job. However, the link to agricultural activities is of great importance to the crofting way of life, and the Scottish Government offers our support for that.</p><p>In the time that remains, I want to respond to some of the substantial points that have been raised. On owner-occupier decrofting, we recognise that the fact that owner-occupiers are unable to decroft their land is a matter of great concern to many members and, in particular, to many crofters. I have already asked my officials to investigate the issue as a matter of urgency. We are taking legal advice, and I can assure Parliament that we are prepared to take any necessary steps to ensure that owner-occupier crofters can apply to decroft their land in the same way as tenant crofters and landlords. If legislative change is required, I will look to Parliament for support to encourage smooth passage of that legislation.</p><p>Regarding Jean Urquhart&#8217;s point about Brian Inkster&#8217;s suggestion that ministers could use section 1(3) of the 1993 act, I am told that the commission&#8217;s legal advice is that legislation does not provide for owner-occupiers to decroft. Instructing the commission to accept such an application would amount to instructing the commission to act unlawfully. Therefore, if ministers were to issue guidance to the commission that it should resume the approval of such decrofting applications, we would in effect be asking the commission to act unlawfully.</p><p>On Tavish Scott&#8217;s suggestion that crofters have been told to take their own legal advice, the Scottish Government has never given advice that crofters should take independent legal advice. The commission published legal advice on its website recently.</p><p>Rhoda Grant said that crofters cannot build on croft land because it needs to be decrofted in order for them to secure a loan. The Scottish Government proposed legislation on standard securities over tenanted crofts in the draft bill in 2009, but crofters did not accept that. The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers had accepted safeguards in the draft legislation for crofters to provide standard security over tenanted land.</p><p>I would like to ask Tavish Scott to clarify where his 3,000 figure came from. Not all owner-occupiers have applied to decroft. The Crofting Commission has indicated that 179 decrofting directions have been issued and 59 applications are held in abeyance; the figure of 3,000 is not one that I recognise. Since the Crofting Commission published its legal advice in February, we have been working very hard to address the issue, which should give Tavish Scott an idea of the timescales involved. I am grateful to the member for raising the issue with me, and I can assure him that we take the matter extremely seriously and will address it in due course.</p><p>Regarding Raasay, I recognise that a degree of concern has been expressed in the chamber. I acknowledge to Rhoda Grant and to others that we made a mistake. Unfortunately, that mistake was made without ministerial involvement, and we have taken steps to rectify it, as Dave Thompson indicated. I can assure members that that process should not happen again.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will take Jamie McGrigor&#8217;s points on board.

However, we will consult soon on a new draft Scottish planning policy and on the third national planning framework main issues report. That will allow us to hear a full range of views on how areas of wild land character and relative wildness throughout Scotland should be protected within the planning system.</p><p>Some 20 per cent of the land area of Scotland already has a statutory protection and&#8212;I think that Claire Baker referred to this&#8212;40 national scenic areas have been established. National scenic areas are often overlooked in this debate, but they are designated precisely because of their outstanding scenic value in a national context. We also have the two national parks, which Claire Baker also referred to, which were designated with all-party support as iconic landscapes because of their outstanding natural heritage, distinctive character and identity.</p><p>There is a lot of overlap between those already designated areas and certain areas of wild land character. Some half of the broad-brush wild land search areas that were identified by SNH in 2002 are already protected by being in an NSA or in a national park. There are no commercial wind farms in our national parks and NSAs, and the planning system provides the necessary protection to ensure that wind-farm developments do not impact adversely on such areas.</p><p>Given that time is pressing, let me say a little bit about SNH&#8217;s work in mapping wild land, which first started in 2002 and is relevant to the debate. As Mike MacKenzie mentioned, capturing a subjective quality such as wildness, which can be found in many places including in urban areas, is challenging. Measuring wildness is inherently difficult, because people respond differently to the quality of wildness according to their experience and their expectations. However, it is possible to capture and map basic characteristics such as ruggedness, slope and elevation that contribute to certain types of wildness. SNH has used modern mapping tools to improve upon the broad-brush search area for wild land of 2002. In 2012, SNH consulted on a map of relative wildness covering all of Scotland, which will be of great help in the forthcoming review of Scottish planning policy.</p><p>As members will be aware, not all applications for onshore wind farms receive consent. Indeed, in 2012-13 only 21 per cent of those multiple turbine projects that were referred to reporters were actually approved or allowed. Therefore, it is not true to say, as some have said in the discourse, that all wind farms immediately gain approval as soon as they go to the reporters&#8212;far from it. Some proposals do not even make it past the scoping stage due to a range of factors and planning constraints, or they are withdrawn before application or refused at local level. Reporters give careful consideration to issues of landscape.</p><p>I will move on, because time is pressing and I want to pick up on a number of points about species. I recognise Murdo Fraser&#8217;s genuine interest in the Scottish wildcat. He has submitted a number of parliamentary questions on the issue, to which I have responded. Media reports last year highlighted that there might now be only 150 breeding pairs of Scottish wildcats left in Scotland. I heard the figure that Murdo Fraser mentioned with interest. Although I agree that the indications are that wildcats are rare and are under considerable threat, we need to be careful about drawing conclusions from estimates of population size and different types of information.</p><p>Hybridisation with domestic and feral cats, to which Murdo Fraser referred, poses the greatest threat to the Scottish wildcat, along with the close proximity to feral and pet animals, which exposes the species to novel diseases such as feline influenza. Loss and fragmentation of habitat, which Joan McAlpine mentioned in relation to adders, is another issue for the wildcat that we are concerned about.</p><p>To reassure Murdo Fraser in one respect, the Scottish wildcat conservation action group is apparently already storing frozen gametes, which offers the potential to do the work that he mentioned.

In Scotland, we are fortunate to have an abundance of water that is suitable for aquaculture and fishing. I am pleased that the committee agrees that the bill improves the framework for the aquaculture and freshwater fishing sectors&#8217; sustainable development&#8212;in the short, medium and long term. Both aquaculture and freshwater fishing provide jobs, often in remote and fragile economies, investment, exports, and rural vitality and social cohesion.</p><p>The committee asked about the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007 and to what extent its aquaculture provisions have been successful. In our view, the management regimes that are monitored by the fish health inspectorate are working well. Aquaculture&#8217;s code of good practice&#8212;independently audited, with compliance of 98 per cent&#8212;is guiding the industry on its statutory responsibilities and day-to-day good practice. However, this bill is not about updating the 2007 act. It has been drafted to further enhance the existing regulatory regime to ensure that it is effective for 2020 and beyond, and to provide a platform for sustainable growth with due regard to the environment.</p><p>The provisions within the bill provide: new legal measures for fish farm operators, including statutory farm management agreements or statements; provisions for obtaining samples from fish farms; requirements for technical equipment standards and control mechanisms for the operation of wellboats; moves to improve the management and governance of district salmon fisheries boards, making them more transparent and accountable; safeguards for the shellfish industry, with measures to ensure that shellfish waters continue to be protected from pollution once the European Union shellfish waters directive is repealed in December this year; and powers to impose charges in connection to services that are provided by the Scottish ministers in the carrying out of fish farming and fisheries functions. Also included are additional enforcement powers to support sea fishery officers in carrying out their monitoring and investigation duties, and the extension of fixed-penalty notices to respond to issues of regulatory non-compliance.</p><p>I welcome the committee&#8217;s endorsement of proposals for the aquaculture sector, including to place farm management agreements and statements on a statutory footing. We will work with the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation to ensure that the new regulatory system is implemented and managed to best effect. I also welcome the committee&#8217;s endorsement of proposed powers to improve further the containment of fish. My officials will work with wellboat interests to ensure that regulations to manage the sector are proportionate, reasonable and, where possible, transferable. Reflecting the committee&#8217;s interest in the matter, I will also encourage the wellboat industry to explore the potential for wellboat development, manufacture and maintenance in Scotland.</p><p>I have repeated on a number of occasions that not everything that we require to achieve needs legislation to deliver and work is, therefore, being developed alongside the bill. We have noted the recommendations of the committee in respect of sea lice data. The Government already has access to the information on sea lice levels that we need to meet our current regulatory requirements, as well as access to industry data to undertake and inform our scientific work.</p><p>In that regard, I am pleased to announce today agreement to joint funding, totalling &#163;1 million, for a programme of research between the Scottish Government and industry, overseen by the Scottish aquaculture research forum. The programme will have at its core a project to assess the impacts of sea lice and salmon of farmed origin in the wild in Scotland. The industry also acknowledges that data needs to be available to reassure the public and to aid the management of local fisheries&#8212;that is a key area of interaction.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685405", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have said on record and I am happy to reiterate that, where appropriate, we will use the affirmative procedure to ensure that there is adequate consultation on any secondary legislation that is made.

I accept that there are commercial confidentiality considerations that come into play, but I believe that we have the balance right in terms of seeking a greater degree of public awareness of the health of the stock in our fish farms, allowing inspectors to inspect the data and ensuring that we have the appropriate level of enforcement actions to deliver improvements in the situation around sea lice contamination.</p><p>I am encouraged by the SSPO&#8217;s voluntary proposal to increase the number of areas in which there is public reporting of sea lice levels from six to 30. I consider that to be a significant development that can be further developed in time. I will keep the new scheme under active review through the ministerial group on aquaculture, mindful that the Scottish ministers already have the power to legislate in the area, if necessary, through the 2007 act.</p><p>The committee welcomed my plans to reinvigorate the ministerial group on aquaculture and supported the current role that is played by the stakeholder reference group. Both of those groups have been established for the longer term and will be key to improved relations and engagement between the aquaculture and wild fish sectors. I am currently considering how best we might replicate a group with a structure similar to the ministerial group on aquaculture for the wild fisheries sector, to ensure similar engagement among stakeholders and interest groups on wild fishery matters.</p><p>The bill is the first step in delivering the Government&#8217;s commitment to modernising management structures for salmon and freshwater fisheries. I welcome the committee&#8217;s endorsement of that view. There are two themes in this part. First, the bill will deliver immediate improvements to the openness, accountability and transparency of district salmon fishery boards. Many boards are already carrying out the requirements that we are making statutory, and the bill will drive forward best practice in good governance. We will work with the Association of Salmon Fishery Boards to give guidance on implementation, mindful that boards are of varying size and capacity.</p><p>The second theme is the enhanced management of salmon fisheries. The bill looks to improve the collection and sharing of data and information on fisheries to help promote science-based management. It will provide ministers with access to the full range of management measures&#8212;specifically, annual close time orders&#8212;so that they can act in cases of national interest, local failure or absence of management. The bill will strengthen the consenting process for certain freshwater activities, introducing the ability for ministers to attach conditions to consents and to require monitoring.</p><p>I am pleased that the committee has largely endorsed the package of measures that I am introducing. While there is broad agreement on the principles, I acknowledge that there are differing views on the precise detail of some of the provisions and how they will be implemented. Carcass tagging is one example. The bill provides an enabling power for the creation of a scheme on that, but there are mixed views about what the scheme should look like. We will discuss the issue of individually numbered tags with stakeholders and consult fully on options for a scheme before bringing forward secondary legislation.</p><p>There has been some comment about what is not in the bill. Some have argued that it lacks ambition and that it focuses exclusively on salmon to the detriment of other fisheries. On that point, the Government is committed to supporting the development of all types of fisheries; only this week I awarded &#163;17,000 to the Angling Development Board of Scotland to roll out a Scottish Qualifications Authority level 3 qualification that covers game, coarse and sea angling.</p><p>I assure members that our ambition is not limited. The past century has seen numerous attempts by various Governments to modernise the legislation on freshwater fisheries, which is a complex and emotive area. There has been progress, but not the major step change that the committee rightly notes is needed. Many significant issues need to be addressed, and the committee&#8217;s report highlights a number of specific areas that need more work.</p><p>I can confirm that I will take that work forward in the context of a major review of salmon and freshwater fisheries management in Scotland, which will perhaps be regarded as long overdue. Officials have started the process of scoping that review and I hope that it will get under way this summer. I can confirm that it will include all fisheries in Scotland, not just salmon fisheries. I anticipate the review considering in depth a number of key issues for the sector, including management of netting interests, the operation of close times and how fisheries management should be funded. The review will be conducted independently of Government, and I am pleased that the committee shares my vision for its outcome: a management system that is robust, sustainable and fit for purpose in the 21st century. I believe that it is imperative that all those with an interest use this unique opportunity to get matters right.</p><p>I welcome the committee&#8217;s recognition that the sea fisheries provisions bring Scotland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom as regards marine enforcement powers. However, we will look at the one or two minor points highlighted in the evidence and report back to the committee on our conclusions.</p><p>We recognise the tremendous potential that the shellfish sector has for increased production because of the demand for our quality products. I am therefore pleased that the committee welcomes the bill&#8217;s proposals for a framework to give continued protection from pollution to shellfish growing waters. I recognise that the provisions will provide only baseline protection in the process and I agree that both the Government and our agencies must continue to work with the sector and other stakeholder interests to ensure that proportionate measures are taken to deliver continued protection.</p><p>I welcome the committee&#8217;s support for our proposals to lodge amendments at stage 2 to strengthen the law on illegal cockle fishing, not least because of its current significance in the Solway. In addition, we continue to work with other agencies that are enforcing the law in respect of illegal shellfish harvesting to find solutions to other aspects of the issue.</p><p>We must manage our resources wisely. The bill gives ministers the power to charge for fisheries functions undertaken by Marine Scotland. Ultimately, if something is being provided that is of benefit, then it is right that the beneficiary should pay a fair contribution for that benefit. I am glad that the committee recognises that we would not bring forward a charging order without consulting those affected. I can confirm that a charging order will be subject to the affirmative procedure to ensure appropriate scrutiny of it.</p><p>I note the recommendation that we publish statistics on the use of fixed-penalty notices and I give a commitment to publish such statistics, anonymised, on an annual basis. We will also consider publishing statistics for other non-compliance activities to provide a complete picture.</p><p>I want Scotland to continue to be a great place to do business and we want new enterprises to be attracted to Scotland. We want both indigenous businesses and new businesses coming into Scotland to grow, but we also have a duty to protect our natural resources for the long term. That is why we seek, through the bill, to ensure that the marine environment is protected while realising the benefits of a successful and growing aquaculture industry, developing side by side with the wild fisheries in Scotland. I emphasise that the bill is not a blueprint for assured growth, but it aims to ensure that there is an effective and proportionate regulatory framework to facilitate that growth. I look forward to the debate that will follow and to hearing members&#8217; views on the bill&#8217;s provisions.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685405", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are persuaded that there is a wider public interest in the health of our fish farms in terms of the quality of the stock.

Many members highlighted the importance of that exercise, and I recognise and support that view. Further issues are progressing in discussions with the sectors concerned and voluntary arrangements are being made, such as on the issue of sea lice data.</p><p>I will try to address some of the specific points that have been raised. The honourable Jamie McGrigor has just been mentioned. He and Claire Baker picked up on the same point about growth targets and the potential difficulties in sustaining a certain level of growth. It is important to highlight the fact that the growth targets are those of the industry. They are based on 4 per cent per annum growth between the 2009 baseline and 2020. Because we are now using a 2011 baseline, it is now a 32 per cent growth that we need to achieve between now and 2020. I recognise that the 50 per cent figure is perhaps a bit out of date. Nevertheless, we are already progressing well from the baseline, and we are making good progress towards the 50 per cent target.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson and Graeme Dey raised a point about verification. Stewart Stevenson referred to Label Rouge, and there are other independent accreditors of the quality of farmed salmon and trout. There are industry pressures to improve the health of the salmon that is produced in Scotland&#8212;it is not purely down to the SSPO or other organisations; there are outside voices that ensure that consumers of quality products take an active interest in the health of the fish.</p><p>The data that are published are sense checked by the Scottish Government and Marine Scotland, although our inspectors have accessed individual farm records&#8212;Alex Fergusson referred to that&#8212;under the regulatory regime. Food Certification International Ltd, which provides the product certification scheme for Label Rouge Scottish salmon, carries out visual inspections of fish for sea lice as part of its inspection checklist. I hope that that addresses some of the concerns that have been expressed about data.</p><p>Graeme Pearson, Alex Fergusson and other members raised the very important matter of cockle fishing. I welcome Graeme Pearson&#8217;s contribution to the debate, which was based on his experience as a police officer. I am happy to report that we have been working with criminal justice partners, including the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, on proposals that we will introduce at stage 2 to deal with illegal cockling. That will build on suggestions made by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary in its evidence.</p><p>Turning to the possibility of a legal cockle fishery, which was also raised by Alex Fergusson and Graeme Pearson, my officials are happy to meet any groups or individuals with proposals for a sustainable fishery on the Solway Firth, subject to an appropriate scientific assessment that the stock can be harvested sustainably. Measures to combat illegal cockle fishing, including a multiagency approach, are taking place, but I accept that they could be further improved. Discussions are taking place on that. Those measures, coupled with the possibility of a sustainable legal fishery, will help to prevent a further tragedy like the one at Morecambe Bay, to which a number of members referred.</p><p>Claudia Beamish, Angus McDonald, Richard Lyle and Margaret McDougall all spoke about climate change&#8212;another very important subject. When proofing the bill, we will want to ensure that it takes climate change into account. Climate change is a key driver behind our taking powers to amend the annual close time orders, the requirement to monitor management measures and the examination of powers to consent introductions of salmon into rivers.</p><p>I add to that the work on the Dee and other rivers to which a number of individuals referred. River restoration funding is being deployed to improve tree cover along river habitats in order to improve the shade for salmon and reduce river temperatures.

That is probably the defining issue in the debate for the committee and for the many stakeholders who contributed to that discussion. It is important to differentiate public reporting from regulation and the need for data for compliance and research&#8212;those data requirements are handled separately. On public reporting, I recall a starting point of six regions&#8212;I think that Angus MacDonald referred to that. The Government is persuaded that the enhancement of 30 areas is proportionate as an incremental response by the fish farming industry, but I reassure members that the new voluntary arrangements that the SSPO is putting in place will be kept under review. We have powers under the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007 to require the publication of data if we need to do that, but I would much rather seek a voluntary approach and avoid the Government being heavy-handed with legislation.

The report, &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8212;The Draft Second Report on Proposals and Policies&#8221;, is in accordance with sections 35 and 36 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, and builds on the package of measures set out in RPP1, the first report on proposals and policies.</p><p>The report updates the analysis, while extending the timeframe to cover targets for 2023 to 2027. The draft is available for consideration by the Scottish Parliament for 60 days, after which we will publish a final version. An online consultation facility is available on the Scottish Government&#8217;s website.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that climate change poses one of the greatest threats to the world as we know it. Global mean temperatures continue to rise and we know that global pledges for emissions cuts will be insufficient to limit global warming to 2&#176;C. Left unchecked, global emissions trends put the world on a path towards 4&#176;C, or possibly more, of warming within a century. Let us be clear that such a change will deliver damaging impacts on populations across the globe and introduce new security risks associated with international resource conflicts. Colleagues, we have a moral responsibility to act.</p><p>We think of climate change as a problem that is far off in time, and only in far-off places, but we are already seeing evidence of Scotland&#8217;s climate changing. In 2011, rainfall in Scotland was some 36 per cent more than the average for the period between 1961 and 1990.</p><p>The experience of recent years has shown that climate change and severe weather events are impacting negatively on many aspects of our society, including increased frequency of flooding with impacts on residential areas and business premises; disruption to travel; increased health risks; lower agricultural productivity; and threats to biodiversity, including new plant and tree pests and rising river temperatures affecting spawning salmon</p><p>Acting both locally and globally to reduce emissions by moving to a low-carbon economy is self-evidently crucial to reduce the potentially severe economic and social impacts of climate change on present and future generations. We can be justifiably proud of our overall progress to date, which has been achieved despite the obvious constraints on policy in this place arising from key powers being reserved to the Westminster Parliament. Our climate change act is the most ambitious piece of climate change legislation anywhere in the world and, unlike the United Kingdom, we have set statutory annual targets, which include emissions from international aviation and shipping.</p><p>Let me repeat that the Scottish Government is fully committed to the greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that the 2009 act sets. We have set challenging targets, and it is to the great credit of the Parliament that we remain committed to achieving them. We accept that human interventions have created and worsened climate change. Our responsibility to future generations is to take action in response. The challenge is by no means easy. It would have been far easier to set targets that ignored climate science or which showed a lower level of ambition that would be straightforward for ministers to meet, but that is not our chosen path.</p><p>Last October, I reported to Parliament that our first climate change target for 2010 had been missed, largely as a result of increased energy demand for heating, due to the exceptionally bad weather that Scotland experienced in quarter 1 and quarter 4 of that year. That was replicated in England and Wales. The package of measures that is set out in the draft report shows that it is possible to compensate for that shortfall as we move towards becoming a truly low-carbon economy. While we set out to meet annual targets, we are charting a course to meet our obligations on cumulative emissions, too.</p><p>On where we see our role in addressing climate change, Scotland does not lack ambition. As a nation, we can all take pride in that. We sit at the top of the emissions reduction table for the European Union 15, all of which are Kyoto protocol signatories. In 2010, Scotland&#8217;s unadjusted greenhouse gas emissions had fallen by 22.8 per cent compared with 20.8 per cent for the UK, 8.5 per cent for the EU 15 and 14.3 per cent across the EU 27. Scotland&#8217;s progress shows what can be achieved with a strong political commitment, ground-breaking legislation and a comprehensive framework for action. After adjustment for the EU emissions trading system, Scotland&#8217;s emissions fell by 24.3 per cent by 2010&#8212;more than halfway towards meeting the 42 per cent reduction target set for 2020 in the climate change act.</p><p>Indeed, the draft RPP2 identifies ways in which Scotland could deliver significantly more emissions abatement than our independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, suggested was achievable and an appropriate Scottish contribution to global action. Of course, the Committee on Climate Change&#8217;s figures also assumed an EU-wide emissions reduction target of 30 per cent for 2020, which has yet to be realised.</p><p>My ministerial colleagues and I have a collective responsibility to take action across all areas of Government. As we move through the next decade and beyond we need to intensify our efforts to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, support the uptake of low-carbon vehicles, invest in improving public transport and in sustainable and active travel, and reduce the waste that we produce and be smarter about what we do with it. We also need to make the most of opportunities that are afforded for good stewardship of Scotland&#8217;s ecosystems. That will involve deploying best practice in agriculture while improving the ability of our peatlands and woodlands to lock in carbon.</p><p>We are making significant progress on many fronts. In transport, we are following through on our manifesto, developing the infrastructure to support electric cars and increasing the proportion of transport spend that goes on low-carbon, active and sustainable travel. In our homes and communities, our national retrofit programme builds on a highly successful area-based programme, which has already seen more than 700,000 households across Scotland being offered assistance through the universal home insulation scheme.</p><p>We are on track to achieve 10,000 hectares per annum of new woodland planting, which will quadruple Scotland&#8217;s woodland planting rate from a low point following transition to the current Scotland rural development programme. As part of that approach, more than 9,000 hectares were planted in 2011-12&#8212;almost three times the total planting that was achieved across the rest of the UK.</p><p>We are laying firm foundations for much greater, long-term, transformational change in how we generate and use energy. Decarbonisation of electricity generation will be a key driver of our progress towards a low-carbon economy. By 2011, renewables generated 36.3 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s electricity needs, smashing our 31 per cent interim target years ahead of schedule and putting renewables on track to produce equivalent to 100 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s electricity demand by 2020.</p><p>We can go further. Earlier today, in Aberdeen, the First Minister announced an ambitious new decarbonisation target for Scotland for 2030, of 50g of CO2 per kWh. The target is in line with the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change and Westminster&#8217;s Energy and Climate Change Committee, which said:</p><p>&#8220;It is right to prioritise the decarbonisation of the electricity system because this is likely to deliver the most cost effective route to meeting our 2050 climate change targets.&#8221;</p><p>Today we also publish our draft outline heat vision, which describes our ambition for a largely decarbonised heat sector by 2030 and sets out how, by using low-carbon and renewable heat sources, we can supply heat to consumers efficiently and cost effectively, reducing emissions and addressing fuel poverty. We also need to reduce demand for heat by better insulating our buildings and changing our behaviour so that we use less energy for heating.</p><p>The draft RPP2 contains a comprehensive package of proposals and policies, which can deliver the required emissions reductions to meet our climate change targets. However, our society&#8217;s transition to a low-carbon economy does not require action just by Government. Scotland needs partnerships between the public sector and private and social enterprises. We need communities to engage and take action together. Most important, we need the participation of individuals and families across Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Government fully recognises its role in leading the transition, helping the people of Scotland to make informed choices about how we live and work and ensuring that we seize all opportunities that a low-carbon future offers to Scotland&#8217;s economy and society. I am confident that a low-carbon economy will bring significant economic benefits and opportunities for our communities, businesses and industry, while helping to protect our environment and wildlife.</p><p>The draft report that I present today sets a pathway to realising those benefits. Parliament now has the opportunity to help to build that pathway. I welcome the opportunity to engage with members today and at the committees that will consider the draft RPP2.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to a low-carbon future has provided certainty and is delivering jobs and investment across Scotland. However, we cannot be complacent in our approach. The report demonstrates that we are setting stretching targets for ourselves and are committed to doing all that we can do to deliver action to ensure that those targets are met. We are very clear about the scale of the challenge. I commend to members our draft report and its updated strategy for action to deliver on Scotland&#8217;s ambition for emissions reductions.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682688", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Second Report on Proposals and Policies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today, I lay before Parliament the Scottish Government&#8217;s draft second report on proposals and policies for meeting Scotland&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.

I mean no disrespect to the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee.</p><p>I am particularly grateful to the committee for the opportunity to debate our progress on the Scottish biodiversity strategy. If the committee had not called the debate, I would have been strongly tempted to do so. My first official duty after being appointed as Minister for Environment and Climate Change was to chair the British-Irish Council environment ministers meeting on biodiversity and to take part in a bioblitz at Vogrie country park.</p><p>Scotland is blessed with a rich and diverse natural environment, and the people of Scotland treasure our native animal and plant species and enjoy our stunning and varied landscapes, diverse geology and many special places and sites of interest, all of which have their own complex webs of life. Biodiversity sustains our lives. Our natural environment helps to define not only our national identity but our quality of life.</p><p>The Scottish biodiversity strategy, which was set out in the 2004 document, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Biodiversity: It&#8217;s in Your Hands&#8221;, remains a strong document, which is why we decided to supplement and reinforce it rather than replace it.</p><p>As it says in the motion, international biodiversity targets for 2010 were missed around the globe. In Scotland, SNH made a detailed assessment and we can be proud that we have made good progress towards the United Nations target to significantly slow biodiversity loss. However, everyone agrees that there is much more to be done. In particular, there is agreement across the EU and at UN level on two key points. First, we need to address the pressures on biodiversity, rather than simply try to reverse damage. Secondly, we need to be more explicit about the need to protect nature, so that it can continue to support and enrich our lives and underpin our economy.</p><p>We have always known that we are part of the natural world, for obvious reasons, and that we need to protect nature if we are to secure a healthy and prosperous future for our country. Now we have increased understanding of how nature sustains us and the connection between biodiversity, healthy functioning of the natural environment and benefits to individuals and society. The 2011 national ecosystem assessment represents a key challenge to ensure that we sustain nature in a condition that, in turn, can sustain our lives.</p><p>New international targets at UN and EU levels accord equal status to the prevention of the loss of species and the preservation of the benefits from nature, which are referred to as &#8220;ecosystem services&#8221;. Consideration of ecosystem services must be part of how we plan all policies that impact on the natural environment. The natural environment is a treasure in its own right, with tremendous intrinsic value, and it underpins our welfare and our economy.</p><p>Biodiversity plays an essential role in achieving the Government&#8217;s vision of a smart, sustainable Scotland and lies at the heart of our economic strategy. Our natural environment plays a vital role in Scotland&#8217;s prosperity and national identity. It supports our tourism, distilling, farming, forestry and fishing industries. It adds variety to our urban green spaces and contributes hugely to our health and wellbeing.</p><p>I know how important the environment is to the region in which I live. Few people have expressed the relationship better than John Muir, who was in many ways the founder of the modern conservation movement. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul alike&#8221;.</p><p>John Muir was a Scot, who left these shores and whose influence is spread across the world.</p><p>Protecting nature has always been a global issue. In response to new international targets and our increased understanding of the links between the natural environment and prosperity, the Scottish Government published a consultation paper last summer, to provide renewed focus and impetus for the Scottish biodiversity strategy up to 2020. The paper covered a lot of ground, but six main chapters presented proposals, which I will broadly describe.</p><p>First, we must ensure joined-up prioritisation and co-ordination of action at catchment level, protect biodiversity and enhance services to communities, such as flood prevention. Communities and land managers should be fully involved in the planning process and planning exercises. Secondly, we must ensure that the value of our natural capital is sustained and enhanced, by recognising that value across the Scottish Government and its agencies. Thirdly, we must build on the existing good work in the health and education sectors and make greater use of the natural environment to achieve effective outcomes. Fourthly, we must continue to make progress on protected areas and priority habitats and species. Fifthly, we must reflect on continued progress in the freshwater environment and the land use strategy and promote integrated land and water use, planning across whole catchments. Sixthly, we must reflect on the substantial progress in the marine environment as a result of the marine conservation strategy for Scotland and consider particular issues of coastal and island ecosystems.</p><p>There were 76 responses to the consultation paper and I am grateful to the organisations and the smaller number of individuals who responded. Overall, there was a positive response to the broad direction of the strategy. I am sure that members will pick up on points that respondents made. I will quickly mention two common areas of concern.</p><p>First, many respondents thought that the consultation paper had gone too far in the direction of a functional view of nature. I think that that partly reflects the nature of the paper, which is, in the main, a guide to decision makers at various levels of government and is not a work of poetry. However, we should state more clearly the intrinsic value of biodiversity.</p><p>Secondly, many respondents were concerned that there was not enough detail about specific delivery targets and actions. It is the nature of the biodiversity strategy that delivery relies on a huge range of actions, decisions, policies and strategies that have an impact on species, diversity and natural capital. The plans, decisions and actions are carried out by many delivery partners, and the strategy is designed to be reasonably high level, thus it cannot and should not reflect all that complexity.</p><p>I agree, however, that we need to say more about delivery alongside the publication of the strategy. We shall develop a delivery agreement whereby delivery partners will sign up to their roles and responsibilities for delivering the strategy. We need a broad range of actors to achieve progress in the delivery of the strategy, so we shall also create a biodiversity monitoring committee that will sit under the established Scottish biodiversity committee, which I chair. It will be the responsibility of the monitoring group to agree a set of key targets and performance indicators, building on such initiatives as the natural capital index, and to discuss how to ensure that progress is made. We need to drive forward action to deliver the strategy and protect our precious diversity.</p><p>I recognise, however, that there is much that the Scottish Government can still do to improve Scotland&#8217;s response to the biodiversity challenge. We need to move further in aligning policy in a wide range of areas to the biodiversity agenda and in ensuring adequate protection. We must take opportunities to achieve other goals in an effective and low-cost way through improvements to the natural environment. Much can also be achieved by local government agencies and other public bodies. I urge those bodies to look for improved ways in which to work together and to step up their response to the biodiversity duty.</p><p>As with other policy areas, however, the Government cannot and should not be expected to achieve alone the desired outcomes for biodiversity. We look forward to continued valuable contributions from the wildlife and nature charities through their campaigning work and their many actions on their own land, because many have significant landholdings, much of which helps innovation and land-management practices in respect of biodiversity. We want local biodiversity action partnerships to provide a model for effective encouragement and co-ordination of local action. We urge local communities to seize opportunities to manage and improve their local environment. Businesses are rising to the challenge, but they could do more as part of their wider civic responsibilities. We need landowners and managers to work with us in the knowledge that protecting nature is part of their role and their future, and they need to appreciate the many ways in which conservation can aid economic development.</p><p>It will take a huge effort jointly to achieve our 2020 challenge, and I am keen to hear in the debate from members across the chamber about the points that they want to see addressed in our biodiversity strategy.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681867", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Biodiversity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise for my late arrival for the debate, Presiding Officer.

I want to pay her a compliment&#8212;if that is the standard that we can expect from her, she will be a valuable addition to the chamber. I thank her for a considered speech.</p><p>We heard great examples from Aileen McLeod about Dumfries and Galloway&#8217;s biosphere approach. Angus MacDonald made a particularly interesting speech in which he highlighted that biodiversity is extremely important in urban areas or, at least, in authorities with rural areas that we would not normally identify with having an important role in relation to a national approach to protecting our biodiversity. There is clearly a richness of activity that points to the enthusiasm of so many people for our nature; it also points to the complexity of delivery and, indeed, the need and importance for localism in order to deliver.</p><p>I will take time to respond to some members&#8217; detailed points before I make my concluding remarks. A number of members, including Rob Gibson, Alison Johnstone and Claudia Beamish&#8212;I apologise if I have missed anyone out&#8212;made various references to bee health and the presence of neonicotinoids in our environment. We are awaiting advice from the UK Advisory Committee on Pesticides, and we will look at its report and its advice to ministers to see what approach we will take in Scotland. I recognise the seriousness of the issue, and I hope to report back once we have formed a view about how to proceed.</p><p>I am more than happy to visit Angus MacDonald&#8217;s constituency to see the Jupiter project. Unfortunately, I missed the start of the project presentation at his event, so I would be glad to find out more about it&#8212;it certainly sounds interesting.</p><p>Claire Baker&#8217;s point about the landfill communities fund is fair. I heard reference to the fact that there are difficulties in capacity building among communities in order to make them aware not only of what is available but of how to go about applying for funds and to give them support in that process. With the climate challenge fund, we are trying to help spread the range of projects to more deprived communities and to give them support, and we will perhaps need to take a similar approach in other areas.</p><p>Nigel Don made reference to the approach taken in Kent. We would not want to shut down the options for developers to make contributions in the form of additional enhancement to local biodiversity, but we certainly would not be looking at the mechanistic approach that seemed to be taken in the case that he referred to&#8212;I would be concerned about that if we did.</p><p>It is sad that Elaine Murray has had to leave, but I am happy to meet her and Mr Home Robertson to hear their concerns about the health of the red squirrel population and to discuss the issues she raised on vaccinations.</p><p>I may have appeared prickly about Jim Hume&#8217;s point about nursery capacity, but it was fair and I identify with it. I hope that we will progress that in the on-going work of the stakeholder group that we are forming to look at tree and plant health issues, and I would welcome his views on that.</p><p>Annabelle Ewing, Alison Johnstone, Claudia Beamish and others made references to education, which is an important aspect. Forest schools were specifically mentioned, which I know are successful&#8212;that is an example of the progress being made through bilateral meetings. I am considering how we can promote biodiversity and climate action through education and curriculum for excellence, and I happy to keep Parliament informed about that.</p><p>Alison Johnstone made a point about intrinsic value versus the ecosystem services approach. That was a common theme in the responses to the consultation. We strongly believe that there is a balance to be struck. I agree that we have a responsibility to protect biodiversity for its intrinsic value, but we must also recognise and highlight the benefits that it brings to wider society, as I said in my opening remarks and in response to a point that Claudia Beamish made.</p><p>As a number of members, including Richard Lyle, mentioned, the natural environment is worth more than &#163;20 billion to the Scottish economy annually. It is easy to see how that figure can be arrived at when we consider the fact that we had &#163;4.2 billion-worth of whisky exports in 2011. That is only one example of a product that is dependent on the quality of our environment and the value of our ecosystem to generate wealth for the country. We will try to do what we can in the strategy to identify the intrinsic value of biodiversity, but it is important to take a twin-track approach.</p><p>Fiona McLeod made a valuable comment. I welcome her and other members&#8217; comments about the value of peatlands. We are making a decisive investment in peatlands to evaluate the impact that they can have on our carbon emissions.</p><p>Scottish Natural Heritage and other public and private bodies will develop and implement a plan for the management of peatlands, which will include restoration. We recognise the importance of restoring peatlands in ways that will give value for money. That reflects the multiple benefits that peatlands in good condition can provide. They relate to flood management, CO2 emissions and, critically in the context of the debate, biodiversity. The Scottish Government is providing a total of &#163;1.7 million of initial funding for that.

Unfortunately, however, that satisfaction was tempered by what was not contained in the direction from Ofgem. A move away from the charging status quo was welcome to many generators on the Scottish mainland, but project transmit failed to deliver a meaningful conclusion for the islands.

We understand the transformational potential of those technologies, which relates not just to the energy that they will produce but to the opportunities that they offer in bringing together skills from our existing offshore energy industries and our onshore engineering sector. By harnessing those skills, we will lead the development of new and revolutionary technologies.</p><p>To reap the economic benefits, we are committed to developing technologies, not only through a sensible application of renewables obligation certificates but through the broader range of actions that underpins this developing sector. That is why Scottish Enterprise established the &#163;70 million national renewables infrastructure fund for developing facilities in support of the offshore renewables supply chain. It is focused on securing vital elements of the offshore wind supply chain, such as turbine and jacket manufacturing.</p><p>In the Highlands and Islands, public and private sector investment exceeding &#163;70 million is already under way or has been committed to a range of port developments, including those at Nigg, Scrabster, Hatston and Lyness, to further support offshore renewables.</p><p>As I heard in Doha, giving the right signals and demonstrating political consistency and leadership has been a critical factor in many companies from around the world coming to Scotland and seeing it as the location in which to develop energy technologies for the 21st century.</p><p>As regards the use of section 185 of the Energy Act 2004, we remain to be fully convinced that, as it currently stands, it can bring the certainty that we and marine energy developers seek. The fact that the powers are short term and partial is not ideal in the context of the nascent technologies that are currently being tested around our coasts. Revising the section 185 power to make it effective will form part of our discussions during the passage of the new electricity legislation. The Scottish Government recognises that Ofgem has yet to conclude its deliberations on the charging regime, as Mary Scanlon said, and that it has a most important role to play in protecting consumer interests.</p><p>Investment in low-carbon technologies also makes economic sense when it is set against future cost volatility. Only last week, the UK Committee on Climate Change demonstrated that between 2020 and 2030 annual household energy bills would increase by only around &#163;25 if the UK power sector largely decarbonised. In contrast, a trajectory of rising carbon and wholesale gas prices, which the coalition Government might lock us into in a dash for gas, would increase those same bills by &#163;120 in the same period&#8212;an almost fivefold increase for consumers.</p><p>High transmission charges across Scotland, but in particular in the islands, are a relic of the old energy world and outmoded economic thinking. The real world is one in which vast renewable resources occur at the periphery of our country. An enormous opportunity is within our grasp: those resources could help the whole of Europe to meet its electricity needs.</p><p>Such resources can bring economic opportunity and innovation to rural communities and provide plentiful energy while minimising the exposure to unpredictable shifts in global energy costs that we would see if we were to remain wedded to carbon-intensive electricity generation. All we need now is a charging regime that recognises the geographic reality. The Scottish Government&#8212;working with island councils, HIE and indeed DECC&#8212;will continue to press for that now and in the future.</p><p>I congratulate Rob Gibson once again and thank him for giving such an important subject an airing in the chamber.

However, for the record, I do not agree with its use of &#8220;remedial&#8221;.</p><p>Although we can all be proud of progress that we are making on tackling climate change in Scotland, I accept that we can and must do more. Early next year, we will present to the Parliament our second report on proposals and policies, which will look forward to our targets for 2023 to 2027 and will refresh the actions that we identified in our first report to address our emissions, to compensate for excess residential emissions that occurred in 2010 and&#8212;obviously&#8212;to keep us on track.</p><p>I assure members that we are working closely with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities&#8212;a point that Ms Beamish makes in her motion&#8212;and local authorities on climate change issues. Indeed, I have already met and next week will meet again Councillor Stephen Hagan, COSLA&#8217;s spokesperson, to discuss how we can best work together on this most important challenge.</p><p>I move to the substance of the debate. Against a recent background of stark reports on climate change from the United Nations Environment Programme, the International Energy Agency, and Lord Nicholas Stern, around 200 nations, which are parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change&#8212;UNFCCC&#8212;met during the past two weeks to continue negotiations on international action to tackle global climate change. Many will say that not enough was achieved at this year&#8217;s conference, and I certainly share those frustrations in some areas. However, there was some positive progress that lays the foundations for more concerted action in the years to come.</p><p>I acknowledge the positive leadership that the European Union displayed at the conference because many of its member states were key players. I was pleased to be able to join UK ministers Ed Davey and Greg Barker alongside John Griffiths from Wales on the ministerial team as part of a highly effective UK delegation, which was ably supported by the UK ambassador.</p><p>The EU showed leadership by pledging with some other countries to a vital second period of commitment to the Kyoto protocol to run from 2013 to 2020. Keeping the Kyoto protocol&#8217;s architecture in place is a crucial part of the transition to a new global treaty that will take effect in 2020. That second period of commitment by the EU and others will account for only 14 per cent of global emissions, and might cover only 10 per cent by 2020, which shows how important it is for the new global treaty to cover all parties.</p><p>The EU has promised to deliver a 20 per cent cut in emissions by 2020, but it will pass that target, perhaps to the extent of delivering a 27 per cent cut. In any event, the EU&#8217;s offer to increase its 2020 target to 30 per cent still stands if other countries show equivalent ambition. It is time for other countries to match the EU&#8217;s offer. We welcome the opportunity to review levels of ambition in 2014 and we will push for higher ambition. Not enough international action to limit global warming to 2&#176;C has been pledged, and there are concerns that global warming will reach 4&#176;C or higher. Lives are already being lost and the impact of a 4&#176;C rise in global temperatures does not bear thinking about.</p><p>I turn to Scotland&#8217;s contribution to the UN climate change agenda. Scotland&#8217;s high level of ambition on climate change, our promotion of the jobs, investment, trade and growth opportunities of a low-carbon economy, and our commitment to championing climate justice all mean that Scotland has a strong and positive message for the international community. With Scotland&#8217;s &#163;3 million climate justice fund&#8212;hailed as a world first by Mary Robinson&#8212;climate justice is an area in which we can lead world thinking and action. Our approach truly illustrates Scotland striving to be a model of international best practice on climate change. It also helps to establish trust between developed and developing nations.</p><p>On 28 November, I was delighted to announce the first five successful projects under the climate justice fund. The successful projects will be based in Malawi and Zambia and will deliver a range of climate adaptation outcomes, with an emphasis this round on water management. They will particularly help the women of Malawi and Zambia.</p><p>I met Mary Robinson at the conference last week and, after a useful discussion, I was able to announce that Scotland will host an international climate justice conference next autumn. That was warmly welcomed by Mrs Robinson and non-governmental organisations.</p><p>Having met the Malawian minister at last week&#8217;s conference, I know that Scotland&#8217;s work on international development is making a real difference to some of the world&#8217;s most vulnerable people. Scotland has a real opportunity to bring together our leadership on climate change and renewable energy, and our expertise in research and development to assist developing countries.</p><p>The UN has been impressed with Scotland&#8217;s leadership in the low-carbon economy, and, earlier this year, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon invited the First Minister to contribute to the UN sustainable energy for all initiative. My predecessor as minister met the UN&#8217;s Assistant Secretary General in June and, last week, I met the director of the UN development programme&#8217;s environment and energy group to forge an agreement on the next steps in Scotland&#8217;s partnership with the UN on its sustainable energy for all initiative.</p><p>The Scottish Government has committed to developing a toolkit that will draw upon Scotland&#8217;s experience in Malawi and in other countries to allow communities to develop community-based renewable energy schemes on-grid and, crucially, off-grid. For example, just 7 per cent of Malawi&#8217;s population have access to electricity. Our partnership with the UN will help to empower communities, improve access to education and employment, and lead to a better quality of life. Those values are at the core of the UN sustainable energy for all initiative, and we are pleased to support the work.</p><p>While I was at the UN conference, I spoke on a panel with the Qatari energy minister at the world climate summit. As well as Mary Robinson, I met representatives of international NGOs including Christian Aid, the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, the Third World Network, CIDSE&#8212;Coop&#233;ration Internationale pour le D&#233;veloppement et la Solidarit&#233;&#8212;which is a group of Catholic development agencies that includes the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, and the UK Youth Climate Coalition. The response to Scotland&#8217;s messages on domestic action, pushing for higher ambition from other countries and supporting developing countries through the climate justice fund was positive.</p><p>I met with the European Investment Bank and global Scots and heard of the opportunities for Scotland to strengthen links with the region. I also had bilateral meetings with ministers from Europe and around the world to share good practice from Scotland and encourage other countries in their efforts to tackle climate change. With Ed Davey, I attended EU ministers&#8217; co-ordination meetings and kept in touch with the other UK ministers on the delegation, Greg Barker and John Griffiths.</p><p>I represented the UK at the launch of a solar power project by the Qatari Government and at the embassy at an event that focused on carbon capture and storage. The Gulf states made a positive presentation at the conference on their progress on carbon capture and storage initiatives, which was of considerable interest to me.</p><p>I have talked about the compelling moral, environmental, and economic reasons for acting on climate change. In fact, the low-carbon economy and, in particular, our renewable energy sector, has shown that it can deliver countercyclical growth, with a pipeline of &#163;9 billion of future projects during these hard economic times. We can show countries that are not investing in low-carbon that they are missing out on valuable economic growth at the time when they probably most need it.</p><p>However, we must continue to try to persuade political leaders and the public to look beyond the economic rationale. The moral case for acting on climate change overrides narrow economic self-interest, and it is the moral case that is at the heart of climate justice.</p><p>Global emissions are at an all-time high and time is very short to agree actions to limit global temperature rises to 2&#176;C, which politicians from around the world have pledged to do.</p><p>Domestically, Scotland is providing a strong case study of the potential of sustainable, low-carbon growth. By leading technology development, regulation and finance we are attracting major investment from leading international and Scottish companies. The low-carbon economy, which cuts across all sectors, could rise to 10 per cent of gross domestic product and 5 per cent of jobs by 2020. As the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee concluded, we can achieve our target of being able to meet 100 per cent of our electricity needs from renewables by 2020, and in 2011 we were ahead of schedule to achieve that.</p><p>We must not forget that we are already more than halfway to achieving our target to cut emissions by 42 per cent by 2020. Between 1990 and 2010, emissions in Scotland fell by 24.3 per cent.</p><p>It is clear that climate change and the need to adapt to our changing climate is not just an issue for developing countries, although they suffer disproportionate effects. At home, regular land slips and flooding cause massive and traumatic disruption to people&#8217;s domestic and working lives, as I have seen in Comrie and Jedburgh.

That is something else that we can cite to encourage other nations.</p><p>I want to move on, because I want to leave enough time to address some of the points that members have raised in the debate. Scotland is, we hope, acting as an international model through the example of our world-leading climate change target of a 42 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. Our targets go further than those of many other nations, including the UK, and even further than those of Germany and Denmark, which are widely regarded as being extremely ambitious. That should be recognised in the discussion on missing the annual target.</p><p>The reporting of targets is key to the UN process, and we are committed to setting a strong example for other nations. Exceptional weather conditions meant that our target for 2010 was not met. However, it is easy to meet unambitious targets. We have set stretching targets and are learning lessons as we strive to achieve them. In April 2013, we will launch our &#163;200 million-a-year national retrofit programme to tackle fuel poverty, reduce emissions and support jobs.</p><p>In Doha, I learned of innovative action that is being taken elsewhere&#8212;that is one of the benefits of attending these events&#8212;including an electric vehicle programme in Quebec and the encouraging progress on carbon capture and storage in the Gulf. Of course, Scotland has huge potential to store CO2 from across Europe in the North Sea.</p><p>As well as taking an active role in the UK delegation, I took part in a number of other engagements to highlight Scotland&#8217;s low-carbon economy and support for developing countries. The strength of the renewables industry in Scotland attracted significant attention when I spoke at the world climate summit, and the agreement to partner with the UN development programme on the sustainable energy for all initiative highlights the value of Scotland&#8217;s expertise and our commitment to climate justice.</p><p>The evidence is clear that global action is needed now and, in the crucial years leading up to a global deal in 2015, Scotland has an important role to play as an exemplar in encouraging other nations to raise their ambition. The evidence is compelling and we hope that we can persuade others to make the same commitment that we have to this vital agenda.</p><p>In the time that is remaining to me, I will turn to some of the points that members have made. Alex Johnstone and Claudia Beamish made important points regarding links to eco-schools and the need to empower our schoolchildren to take forward these messages. I believe that that was picked up by other speakers. I encourage members to direct schools&#8212;particularly secondary schools&#8212;towards the junior climate challenge fund, which has just been launched. That is an important opportunity for people to learn team-building skills for work and to contribute to an environmental outcome. That should be beyond party politics and we should get all our schools&#8212;in Montrose and elsewhere&#8212;to engage in it.</p><p>Alex Johnstone was right to say that residential emissions were one of the reasons why we missed the 2010 target. I do not share his view about nuclear power&#8212;I am sure that he will forgive me for saying that. On my being a defender of the union, I merely point out that I was showing courtesy to the UK delegation. However, it was remiss of me not to highlight the fact that small countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Finland all played a substantial role in the negotiations at Doha. The UK had a lot of influence, but so did a number of small, independent countries.</p><p>I agree with much of what Malcolm Chisholm said. When he spoke about the &#8220;business as usual&#8221; figures, he was referring to a chart that David Wilson presented to the sustainable Scotland network conference. That was a work in progress, and I assure Malcolm Chisholm that we have made a lot of progress since then. That set of figures was shared with stakeholders to inform the discussions and get ideas from them. We have picked up a lot of those messages.</p><p>It is worth highlighting that the new building regulations will result in a 75 per cent reduction in carbon emissions from buildings in comparison with 1990 benchmarks. Although the increment has been more modest than the Sullivan report initially suggested, we are still getting a 75 per cent reduction, which should be welcomed across the chamber.</p><p>Rob Gibson is a strong advocate of peatlands and I recognise his contribution to that debate. He is absolutely right that the projects at Forsinard and elsewhere will help us to calibrate the impact that peatlands can have in addressing carbon dioxide emissions. The Scottish Government agrees with him about the dash for gas as well, which is why it is right to pursue renewable energy as a main plank of our energy strategy.</p><p>Graeme Dey was correct to highlight that we rely to a great extent on the impact of individuals&#8217; behaviour. I commend him for raising that point. I direct members to the climate challenge fund, the junior climate challenge fund and the work that the Carbon Trust can do for businesses. There are many ways in which we can support individuals, communities and businesses to make the right kind of decisions.</p><p>The Government has had a successful advertising campaign to address the 10 key green behaviours that all of us can follow in order to make an impact on the agenda.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680069", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Nations Climate Change Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scotland has a wealth of natural resources and expertise in developing renewable energy technology, and the low-carbon economy is worth up to \u00a323 billion per annum in Scotland.

As members will be aware, Scottish emissions in 2010 exceeded the level that was required by the annual target that was set under the 2009 act. Many people will remember that 2010 was a challenging year for all sorts of reasons&#8212;not least the two exceptional cold snaps, which were a major factor but were not the only reason why emissions rose in 2010. The report today sets out clearly what influenced emissions in that year.</p><p>Progress towards Scotland&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets is measured against the level of the net Scottish emissions account, which incorporates the following: greenhouse gas emissions from Scotland, including international aviation and international shipping; emissions removals through carbon sinks such as forestry; and accounts for emissions allowances by Scottish industries in the European Union emissions trading system.</p><p>The net Scottish emissions account for 2010 is calculated as being 54.7 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The Scottish target for 2010 was 53.6 megatonnes, which means that the target was missed by 1.1 megatonnes. Naturally, I and all members of the Scottish Government are disappointed that Scotland has missed its first climate change target. The 2010 increase in greenhouse gas emissions was the first year-on-year increase that has been experienced in Scotland since 2006, so we should not lose sight of what has been achieved to date.</p><p>I, this Parliament and Scotland&#8217;s people should be heartened that Scotland&#8217;s emissions have fallen by 24.3 per cent since 1990. Looking forward, the long-term trend shows that emissions in Scotland will continue to reduce. Provisional figures from the United Kingdom Department for Energy and Climate Change suggest that domestic gas consumption in the UK as a whole decreased by 25 per cent between 2010 and 2011, and I expect that that will be reflected in Scotland&#8217;s 2011 emissions data.</p><p>It is the trajectory that is critical, so I am confident that we remain on track to deliver the 42 per cent target by 2020, and to deliver our long-term target of 80 per cent reductions by 2050. Parliament will appreciate that we must all take the action that is necessary to achieve that end.</p><p>Our world-leading climate change targets are an inspiration to many. When it voted unanimously to pass the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, the Scottish Parliament acknowledged that meeting such ambitious targets would be challenging. Year-to-year fluctuations in factors that are beyond our control are inevitable. As I have said, the trend remains strongly downward, which is key. I can assure members that Scottish ministers remain fully committed to delivering Scotland&#8217;s ambitious and world-leading greenhouse gas emission targets, despite the budget constraints and challenging financial environment in which we are all operating.</p><p>In January, the UK Committee on Climate Change acknowledged that Scotland has made good progress on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, including action on energy efficiency in buildings, use of more efficient vehicles, and promoting schemes for farmers. I visited last week Upper Nisbet climate change focus farm, near Jedburgh, to see a mixed farm adapting that is its approach.</p><p>My ministerial colleagues and I have a collective responsibility to take action and are working together to develop a low-carbon economy to ensure Scotland&#8217;s prosperous future. To help to build on the fantastic work that was undertaken by my predecessor, Stewart Stevenson, in tackling climate change, I am holding a series of bilaterals with colleagues to identify where we can achieve more. Achieving the transition to a low-carbon economy is crucial to this Government, which is why it is identified as a strategic priority in our economic strategy and why the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth announced a green stimulus package.</p><p>Today&#8217;s report identifies the key factors that influenced Scottish greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, and there are a number of things to consider. As I stated earlier, prolonged extremely cold weather at the start and end of 2010 had a major impact on emissions. It is worth recalling that the average temperature for the six months covering January to March and October to December 2010 was the coldest in almost a century&#8212;in fact, since 1919. As a consequence, domestic heating emissions rose and the consumption of heating fuels increased as people heated their homes to keep warm and safe. The figures show how greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector increased by 15 per cent, which equates to more than 1.1 megatonnes of emissions.</p><p>There are also significant underlying data changes to consider. Historic emissions data have been significantly revised upwards due to new data being made available, and to changes in the methodology. As a result, the latest revision to industrial-process data increased Scottish emissions by a further 1 megatonne in 2010. The 2010 weather was exceptional, but there may well be other cold years to come, so this early experience highlights the need not just to plan to meet the targets, but to build in contingency where we can. One part of that will be improvement of the energy efficiency of our buildings, which is why the national retrofit programme is at the heart of the sustainable housing strategy for Scotland, which the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment launched earlier this year, in June.</p><p>We agree with the UK Committee on Climate Change&#8217;s recommendation that it will be necessary to accelerate the pace of emissions reductions in order to meet longer-term targets. Implementation of policies and measures across all sectors of the economy will be necessary to ensure that emissions continue to fall at the right pace. It is important to stress that the Scottish Government already has a comprehensive package of policies and measures in place to deliver emissions reductions. Policies such as the green deal, the climate challenge fund and Scotland&#8217;s zero waste programme, along with European Union-wide policies such as new car CO2 emission standards, will help to drive down emissions in Scotland.</p><p>We are also continuing to invest in low-carbon initiatives that will help to create multiple benefits, including emissions reductions, for the people of Scotland. The Scottish Government has invested almost &#163;300&#160;million in domestic energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes between 2007-08 and 2011-12, with a further &#163;250&#160;million planned investment over the next three years. On transport, the Scottish Government has since 2007 invested &#163;93&#160;million in active travel, &#163;8&#160;million in low carbon vehicles, &#163;8.8&#160;million in green buses and more than &#163;9&#160;million in freight facilities. A further &#163;26.25&#160;million will be invested in cycling over the next three years and the future transport fund will support the transition to low-carbon travel and freight.</p><p>Since 2008, the Scottish Government&#8217;s climate challenge fund has made 542 awards to 394 Scottish communities to support low-carbon action at local level. By 2015, the fund will have awarded an incredible &#163;68.6&#160;million to community-led projects.</p><p>The Scottish Government is also ahead of schedule on its renewables targets, with 35 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s electricity needs coming from renewables in 2011, which beat our interim target of 31 per cent. Scottish Renewables claims that that activity displaces 8.36 megatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. Early growth in 2012 suggests that we are moving further towards our target of the equivalent of 100 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s electricity demand being met by renewables by 2020. Between April 2011 and July 2012, &#163;2.3&#160;billion-worth of new renewable energy projects was completed in Scotland, which has created more than 4,600 jobs.</p><p>In forestry, the Scottish Government is reversing the declining woodland planting rate to protect that important carbon sink. Our action helped nearly to double the planting rate to about 5,000 hectares in 2010-11, with a further increase to around 9,000 hectares in 2011-12. We aim to achieve a planting rate of 10,000 hectares per year from 2015, and progress for 2012-13 looks very encouraging indeed. Yesterday, I announced plans to invest &#163;1.7&#160;million in the restoration of Scotland&#8217;s peatlands as part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s green stimulus.</p><p>I am confident that a low-carbon economy will bring significant economic benefits and opportunities for our communities, businesses and industry while helping to protect our environment and wildlife from the effects of climate change. That is a high priority for the Government. A low-carbon economy will make much more effective use of our resources while reducing the amount of energy that people use in their homes and in schools, workplaces and public buildings. A low-carbon economy will improve air quality in our public places by reducing traffic pollution, and it will benefit our biodiversity as a result of measures ranging from peatland restoration and tree planting through to increasingly sustainable land use. A low-carbon Scotland will be a better Scotland.</p><p>Later this year, we plan to present to Parliament our second report on proposals and policies, which will look forward to our targets for the years 2023-27 and will refresh the actions that were identified in our earlier report. Where we can, the Government will deliver more, not just at home but internationally. That is why Scottish ministers are championing climate justice and strengthening support for developing countries through our &#163;3&#160;million climate justice fund.</p><p>However, the issue is not just about action by Government; it is important to recognise that the Government can lead directly on only some actions. Scotland also needs partnerships between the public and private sectors and it needs communities to engage and to take action together. All of us, as individuals, need to consider what action we can take to make a difference. That is why we must work together to facilitate opportunities for people&#8212;young or old, rural or urban, deprived or affluent&#8212;to play their part. I look to the Scottish Parliament to support the Government in achieving that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674569", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Annual Target Report)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

We all share that sentiment.</p><p>I thank David Stewart for bringing this important subject for debate today. All the speeches have highlighted the transformational impact that the community ownership of land can have on communities, in this case on the Isle of Gigha. I congratulate the islanders and particularly the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust on their achievements and wish them every future success in their efforts to deliver a sustainable economic future for the island. Let it be an inspiration to all of us.</p><p>Gigha provides an excellent example of a community that recognises and grasps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Through determination and vision, it has succeeded in transforming its community. Gigha has developed a vibrant and enterprising community whose confidence in its future is increasing and, crucially, whose people are in control of their destiny. As we have heard, Gigha has an increasing population and &#8220;virtually full employment&#8221;, as Stewart Stevenson has just mentioned. It also has better housing and living conditions and a full community life in which the community and the people in it are brought together. I could go on.</p><p>However, Gigha is not alone. Other communities throughout Scotland have recognised the importance of community ownership for their future development and success, and they have taken steps towards community ownership of land and land assets. Community Land Scotland&#8217;s members, many of whom are in the Highlands and Islands, now have&#8212;as David Stewart said&#8212;some 500,000 acres of land in their ownership. That is 2.6 per cent of all the land in Scotland. Nevertheless, Stewart Stevenson is right to say that the Government would like to see more communities follow that example, and we have provided financial support for that process. To pick up on a point that was well made by John Mason, we want the process to extend to urban areas as well.</p><p>Let us remember that community ownership is not only for the Highlands and Islands, where the movement started. There is also a great deal of activity in lowland Scotland, and more than half of all the applications to register a community interest in land under the community right to buy are in the lowlands. They are scattered throughout the area, with some counties such as Perth, Renfrew, East Lothian and Roxburgh each having three or more registered interests. However, some counties&#8212;for example, Selkirk, Lanark and Kincardine&#8212;have none, and I therefore urge communities in lowland Scotland to consider seriously whether a community buyout would help to transform them, too. There are plenty of examples of communities from which to draw experience and inspiration, but there should be more.</p><p>Learning by example is important and was important for Gigha in the early stages of its buyout. As Claudia Beamish stated and other members have repeated, had a couple of residents not visited Eigg, where they were able to see the results of a buyout, Gigha&#8217;s future might have been quite different. As the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust notes on its website, &#8220;they came back inspired&#8221;. Ensuring that communities across Scotland share that inspiration is, therefore, important.</p><p>Community buyouts do not just happen; they take vision, dedicated individuals and teamwork, resilience, community support and resourcefulness. Communities also require support. A wide range of assistance is available to help communities through the process, and Gigha has acknowledged the important role that was played by the public sector, through Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Argyll and Bute Council, in funding the buyout as well as in providing assistance in developing its plans.</p><p>David Stewart asked about housing. The correspondence between my colleague Margaret Burgess, the new housing minister, and Mike Russell, the constituency member, indicates total funding from the Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council of about &#163;2 million for refurbishing 29 houses. I am also aware of a current application for funding for new build on Gigha.</p><p>Support for communities continues to be an important theme that runs through community buyouts. There are significant resources to help communities through the process, whether from the Scottish Government, Highlands and Islands Enterprise or local authorities.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674292", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Reform (Isle of Gigha)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with Claudia Beamish&#8217;s kind words regarding Andrew Riddell from East Lothian.

It is clear that we all agree that Keep Scotland Beautiful is to be congratulated on the success of its annual national spring clean campaign and on its valuable contribution to our environment.</p><p>The growth in the number of volunteers who take part from 11,500 in 2007 to more than 117,000 this year is a fantastic achievement that we should celebrate. The Scottish Government has supported the national spring clean with &#163;116,000 of funding from our delivery partner zero waste Scotland. The fact that the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment launched the 2012 national spring clean&#8212;in March, alongside schoolchildren in Portobello&#8212;reflects the value that is placed on the event.</p><p>Graeme Dey is right to highlight the issue. Few things can be as corrosive to our pride in our communities as the preponderance of litter on our streets and in our beautiful countryside. I identified with all the points that colleagues have made.</p><p>Littering and fly-tipping are problems that continue to blight many communities. In the Scottish household survey for 2011, 25 per cent of residents who responded agreed that litter was a serious problem for them. The fact that about one in 50 of the population officially participated in the 2012 national spring clean underlines the strength of that feeling.</p><p>More than 75,500 of the participants were schoolchildren. Claudia Beamish was right to highlight the significance of eco-schools. Many schools have signed up to the international eco-schools programme, which encourages whole-school action for the environment and includes a mandatory topic on litter. That is important in relation to the education point that George Adam and others made. The Scottish Government funds Keep Scotland Beautiful to support that programme, in which Scotland is a world leader. Tomorrow, our 1,500th green flag will be officially awarded to Mearns Castle high school in East Renfrewshire.</p><p>Events such as the national spring clean are a great way not only of tackling litter head on and removing a blight from our streets, parks and lanes but of helping to raise public awareness. However, the litter that the national spring clean volunteers pick up should not be there in the first place. Graeme Dey and others, including Chic Brodie, were right to highlight that we need to change the culture. Littering is totally unacceptable and should be seen as such by all and not just by the majority of the public, whom I genuinely believe see it in that way.</p><p>During my local village&#8217;s litter pick this year for the floral gateway competition in the Borders, colleagues and I picked up litter from the verge of a local B-road. We passed a couple of cars that were filled with young men who were in their 20s. When we turned back along the same route a mere 10 minutes later, we found that three cigarette packets and a can of Coke had been left behind. That truly infuriated me, and my behaviour has probably never been closer to resembling that of Victor Meldrew&#8212;I think that I even said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p><p>While children help to clear up litter, those who should know better are creating more of it. Tackling that point really matters. As well as being an unnecessary eyesore that can deter visitors and investors&#8212;others have made that point&#8212;litter can cause a risk to health. If valuable materials that could have been recycled are wasted, that is a loss to society.</p><p>I assure the Parliament that the Scottish Government is committed to tackling the problem and that I take the issue seriously. As Graeme Dey said, the Scottish Government has tasked zero waste Scotland with producing a state of the nation evidence report on litter. A steering group that involves Keep Scotland Beautiful is guiding research that is investigating the wider cost of litter to society, analysing litter enforcement trends and the effectiveness of current legislation, and considering how best to influence littering behaviour and successful approaches to tackling the problem. That report is due early next year and will provide a powerful basis for our approach to tackling littering, which is antisocial and damages our habitats.</p><p>In parallel with that work, zero waste Scotland has launched two new funds to help to address the problem further. It is funding a new &#163;250,000 litter prevention innovation fund for local authorities, community groups, landowners and businesses that will support local innovative approaches to tackling and preventing litter. It is also repeating last year&#8217;s successful &#163;75,000 fly-tipping small grants scheme, to help communities to tackle and prevent fly-tipping.</p><p>Those schemes can help local organisations to make a real difference to their environment. For example, last year, Friends of Possilpark Greenspace in Glasgow was awarded just over &#163;5,000 to clear fly-tipping from the park, and the organisation re-landscaped the area to make it more inviting for the local community. Through studying the impacts of those grants, we hope to establish what works and does not work in the hope that we can learn something from that.</p><p>Zero waste Scotland has also made &#163;500,000 available to support the roll-out of more recycle-on-the-go facilities throughout Scotland, along with guidance about how to make the most from installing those facilities in public places such as shopping centres and high streets. The new bins allow people to recycle while they are out and about, taking away the excuse that there is nowhere to put the waste and helping to turn problem litter into materials that can be used again. We are keen for the number of such facilities to be increased substantially.</p><p>Richard Lochhead wrote to all councils last month to highlight the opportunities and remind the councils of their enforcement powers to penalise people who litter. I encourage all councils and the police to make use of those powers to impose fixed-penalty fines of &#163;50 for littering. It is vital that people understand that littering is unacceptable, antisocial and a criminal offence. I do not know about other members, but I have been shocked to hear people occasionally say that littering is in some way excusable because it helps to keep someone in a job. I have heard that uttered by members of the public, and it shows that attitudes must change.</p><p>Zero waste Scotland is also piloting deposit-return and reverse vending of drinks containers to see which approaches are most effective. It is hoped that, as well as driving recycling, giving containers a value will reduce the proportion of them that become litter.</p><p>Reflecting the harm that irresponsibly disposed-of carrier bags can do, we are consulting on proposals for retailers to charge 5p for a single-use carrier bag, with the proceeds going to charitable good causes. We want to encourage people to reuse their bags whenever possible, and experience from other areas shows that that measure is highly effective in reducing the number of bags that are used and left as litter.</p><p>Litter such as carrier bags causes problems not just on our land. Our forthcoming marine litter strategy will address the problems of marine and coastal litter, which have been referred to by Chic Brodie and others and which give cause to annual beach-clean events organised by bodies such as the Marine Conservation Society.</p><p>In the next couple of years, Scotland will host high-profile events such as the Ryder cup and the Commonwealth games. We all want the watching world to see Scotland&#8212;one of the world&#8217;s most beautiful countries&#8212;at its very best. We will continue to work with zero waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautiful and others to tackle litter, to deliver a cleaner, greener Scotland and to keep Scotland beautiful.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:32.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672585", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Keep Scotland Beautiful"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank my colleague Graeme Dey for securing this members&#8217; business debate.

The fortnight is our annual celebration of Scotland&#8217;s wonderful larder. Events throughout the country have created a real buzz about our local food and drink, and such efforts are critical in supporting local economies throughout the country.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s food and drink are renowned around the world for their quality.

Food and drink are clearly exceptionally important to this country&#8217;s economic success, but they are equally important to our health and our impact on our environment. &#8220;Recipe for Success&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s National Food and Drink Policy&#8221; recognised that and sought to raise the debate about food and drink in Scotland to a new level.</p><p>I welcome Mike Small and his colleagues to the chamber. He and Fife diet have an important role to play in the debate. Their ground-breaking work has brought new ideas and insight to a wide range of people. To help, they are to be supported by over &#163;800,000 of funding from the Scottish Government from 2009 to 2015 to promote the Fife diet, develop wider support and deliver its local food solutions project. I welcome the Fife diet&#8217;s food manifesto and its cross-cutting community work to promote the development of a food system that better supports environmental sustainability in Scotland, and am delighted to hear that local food in Fife is thriving, with local food networks, farmers and publications such as the Fife Larder all contributing to promoting the outstanding produce that Fife has to offer.</p><p>Nanette Milne mentioned farmers markets throughout the country becoming an increasingly important feature of our food retail landscape. It is a testament to the dedication of Fife diet that it is connecting people to produce on their own doorstep. Indeed, that dedication of people individually and collectively will help to drive our food policy forward.</p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to pursuing collaborative and sustainable approaches to food production and consumption. It recognises that doing so will not only reduce our impact on the environment, but help individuals to lead longer and healthier lives. As part of the recipe for success initiative, we are taking forward a number of the issues that are covered in the food manifesto, including skills development, food education, grow-your-own, environment and healthy and sustainable procurement initiatives. I have time to talk about only a few examples of that work.</p><p>To start with the grow-your-own approach, we have experienced a food revolution over the past few years. Interest in local food is growing, along with a desire to know where our food comes from. The grow-your-own approach is an important part of that food culture. It is an excellent way of getting back in touch with our food roots, origins and provenance. The Government is fully committed to supporting individuals and community groups that are interested in grow-your-own initiatives and projects.</p><p>We recognise that access to land is key to developing grow-your-own initiatives and projects in Scotland. A number of members, including David Torrance, have mentioned the linkages with the lack of supply of food allotments. In May this year, the Scottish Government announced a &#163;600,000 package of funding for grow-your-own projects. A number of the projects that are being funded by that money will directly contribute to considering ways to provide access to land for grow-your-own purposes.</p><p>A number of members have mentioned childhood obesity, which is obviously a key issue. The Scottish Government aims to ensure that every pupil in Scotland benefits from food education by 2016. That will help our youngsters to make healthier choices and ensure that they are more aware of the importance of eating sustainably.</p><p>I am a poor example when it comes to the soup test. I think that I left school with absolutely no knowledge of how to make a bowl of soup, which is a disgrace. I am glad that we are addressing that issue, and I commend Mike Small and his colleagues for raising it.</p><p>In 2010, we funded several pilot projects that led to more schoolchildren than ever visiting farms and producers and learning about the food on their plates. They also often helped to bridge the gap between the city and the countryside. In March this year, Richard Lochhead announced the commitment of a further &#163;2 million to food education in Scotland&#8217;s schools to help every child to learn about the journey that food takes to get from plough to plate. I commend the Co-op&#8217;s from farm to fork project in the Borders, of which I am sure Claudia Beamish is aware, for doing similar work. That is based at the Hirsel estate in Coldstream, which I visited last year.</p><p>The Scottish Government is determined to play its part in rising to the climate change challenge; indeed, we want to lead that challenge. We want Scotland and its communities to be part of the solution. We remain committed to the climate challenge fund and we will maintain funding at &#163;10.3 million per annum between 2012 and 2015. By 2015, we will have provided a total resource of &#163;68.6 million for Scottish communities since the fund was established in 2008. To date, 273 awards have been made from the climate challenge fund to projects that contain a food element in their project plan.</p><p>I will refer to a number of issues that members raised. Under the Scottish Government&#8217;s obesity strategy, we have a long-term plan, to which local authorities, health boards and industry all contribute.</p><p>Claudia Beamish made an important point about the evidence from citizens advice bureaux on the need for food banks and emerging issues. Perhaps that is a damning indictment of the impact of welfare reform on Scottish society.</p><p>Nanette Milne made an important point about eating a seasonal five a day. If we all adapted our diets to that, that would have a huge impact.</p><p>I have referred a number of times to communities. Roderick Campbell made the important point that we are talking not just about individual behaviour but about community action.</p><p>I apologise if I have not picked up all the points that everybody made. I very much enjoyed the debate, in which we heard quality speeches. I look forward to working with all the members present in the months and years ahead.</p><p>13:16 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Diet Food Manifesto"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Stewart Stevenson is in the chamber and it is my first opportunity to speak as a minister, before I move on to address the substance of the debate, I will&#8212;if Claire Baker will forgive me&#8212;take the opportunity to highlight the fact that I admire him hugely for his intellect, wisdom and approachable manner with members, staff, colleagues and stakeholders.

We are often told that information is power, and that is absolutely true. A well-informed population that is given a good quality of education is an empowered population with empowered communities. It is therefore crucial that as a Parliament we focus on ensuring that education provides the people of Scotland with the opportunities to equip themselves with the vocational and life skills that they need to succeed. It is for that reason that the Government&#8217;s post-16 education reform bill is so important.</p><p>On the form of governance, in a previous life I was involved in reviewing the governance of Scotland&#8217;s colleges, and I whole-heartedly endorse the intention of creating better links with employers, communities and stakeholders because there have been weaknesses in the Scottish college sector in the past&#8212;although they were not deliberate but a result of the structures within which the colleges were working.</p><p>I was pleased to hear that Borders College has been designated as a lead college within the Scottish Borders region and is not to be absorbed into a larger region. That was warmly welcomed locally, and it gives local stakeholders the opportunity to work with their local lead college in delivering skills that the Borders economy needs.</p><p>As Marco Biagi outlined, widening access in the post-16 learning world is vital. We must recognise the fact that the secondary sector does not work for all pupils. We know that the traditional learning environment does not provide the right methodology and context for many. The tertiary sector is therefore crucial because it can provide a second chance for the achievement of those people&#8217;s hopes and dreams.</p><p>I am also proud of the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to 25,000 modern apprenticeships and its delivery of more than 26,000 modern apprenticeships in the past year. As other members have said, all those apprenticeships are linked to an employment opportunity.</p><p>I am proud that the Scottish Government has committed to a capital investment programme that includes a new campus for Kilmarnock College. That is a vital investment following the transfer of jobs from Kilmarnock to Fife.</p><p>I have seen for myself the fruits of investment in the Borders with the development of a highly successful modern apprenticeship programme in the textiles sector. It was organised by the Scottish Borders knitwear group training association and is already providing 100 apprenticeships in a fragile rural economy. I hope that it will be an example for others.</p><p>Opportunities for all, with its guarantee to those in the 16 to 19 age group, is a tremendous commitment to Scotland&#8217;s young people. The appointment of Angela Constance as Minister for Youth Employment and next week&#8217;s summit on women&#8217;s employment in partnership with the Scottish Trades Union Congress show the importance that the Scottish Government is placing on unemployment among young people and women, with both groups being adversely impacted by the UK Government&#8217;s austerity programme and welfare reform.</p><p>I am going to disappoint Ken Macintosh slightly by referring to independence. The austerity programme and the lack of action on capital investment&#8212;one of the means that the Labour Party identified by which we could tackle the economic decline&#8212;are very important and could be tackled through constitutional reform. We could also address the cuts to services that impact on Scotland&#8217;s budget through constitutional reform. Welfare reform and its impact on children and other vulnerable groups, particularly the disabled, veterans, families on low incomes and young people, can also be addressed through constitutional reform.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I whole-heartedly commend Clare Adamson for her excellent speech.

A number jumped out at me. First, and positively, most veterans are coping with the transition from a very regimented way of life to civvy street, and support for veterans is recognised as improving in Scotland and across the UK. However, among the 480,000 veterans in Scotland, 35 per cent&#8212;or 168,000&#8212;experience some difficulty. There are an estimated 363,000 adult dependants and 174,000 dependent children, and 16 per cent of veterans are estimated to experience multiple areas of need, which means that 80,000 veterans, 55,000 adults and 25,000 children may be affected. That shows the number of people for whom veterans policy has huge relevance.</p><p>Currently, the Royal British Legion estimates that 6 per cent of veterans face some welfare difficulty but do not yet seek help for it. That suggests that some 29,000 veterans and 31,000 dependants are affected and need support. Therefore, we should warmly welcome the fact that, through ASAP&#8217;s work, people&#8212;including people in areas of South Lanarkshire that fall within my South Scotland region, who might be able to access services in Hamilton&#8212;have access to expert knowledge of armed forces&#8217; and veterans&#8217; issues in respect of employment, finance, mental health, bereavement and other issues that Christina McKelvie referred to.</p><p>In the remainder of my time, I will focus on armed forces week and armed forces day and highlight the need for us all&#8212;regardless of our stance on deployments to particular conflict areas or on the decisions of the politicians who send troops to them, as Christina McKelvie said&#8212;to recognise the tremendous contribution that forces personnel and the wider forces family make to the people of Scotland. Members of our armed forces are hugely appreciative of demonstrations of public support for them, their families, veterans and groups such as the cadets. As my proposed amendment highlighted, personnel who return from service overseas, and while abroad, can be placed under huge pressure, and the concept of the military covenant between the politicians who send them there and our personnel is of huge value to them.</p><p>Knowing that the fact that they do our bidding and put their lives on the line for our safety and security is recognised and valued means a huge amount to them. As I saw in the annual parade of colours at Coldstream last weekend, it is very much appreciated across the political divide.</p><p>Through this debate, we can again show that this Parliament values our armed forces and their sacrifice for us, even if this place does not yet have responsibility for making such deployments.</p><p>Once again, I congratulate Christina McKelvie on highlighting this excellent project and thank all members present for helping to mark armed forces week and for their support for the armed forces community.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670789", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Services Advice Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Christine McKelvie on securing this debate during armed forces week to highlight the tremendous work that is undertaken by the ASAP project, delivered by Citizens Advice Scotland.

In relation to that, I will mention the presentation that was given to us this morning by Donald MacRae, the chief economist at the Bank of Scotland. He said that, over the past 12 months, the Bank of Scotland&#8217;s labour market barometer indicated that Scotland&#8217;s labour market performance is better than that of the UK as a whole. When he was asked what he attributed that to, he cited the strength of the oil and gas sector, the strength of renewables, and he said that he believed that the Scottish Government&#8217;s modern apprenticeship programme had a role in it. He also encouraged a plan A+, as he put it, or, as I would call it, a plan B, to address the fundamental problem of growth in the economy&#8212;that is a message for members of the UK coalition Government. He also suggested that there might be a case for delaying the UK Government plans to restore balance in public sector finances. I would be interested in Mary Scanlon&#8217;s view on that.</p><p>Skills Development Scotland data at the community planning partnership level indicate that in the Scottish Borders area, some 258 modern apprenticeships were completed in April to December 2011. Of those, 83 per cent went on to positive destinations. Historically, it has proved more difficult to generate MA enrolments in the Borders, due to the economy being more than usually dependent on SMEs to provide such opportunities. However, the figures, which show that there are 437 modern apprenticeships in training as at December 2011, indicate that we are on track to get a much better performance in the Borders. I am confident that with a number of local initiatives that are now under way, we have a good chance to meet or exceed what would be a pro rata number of about 500 modern apprenticeships for the area.</p><p>I wish to highlight a crucial issue that is at the heart of the Government&#8217;s motion&#8212;that of replacement demand. We often talk about growth in the economy and the increase in the number of people being employed in a sector. Even when employment in a sector is in decline or static, however, there is always replacement demand: a stream of younger people are needed to replace those who are retiring at the end of their careers. That has been a strong driver in a number of important initiatives. In the Finance Committee yesterday, the Minister for Youth Employment cited the oil and gas sector, which has proactively taken competition out of the labour market and decided to pool its resources to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of apprentices to meet emerging needs. Competition from the renewables sector has obviously played a part in that, too.</p><p>As the minister has visited Hawick Knitwear and the Johnstons of Elgin plant in Hawick, he knows that the Scottish Borders knitwear group training association has pooled together a group of 14 employers&#8212;soon to expand to 23&#8212;who have also set aside their competitive interests in favour of the future of their sector and decided to ensure that they provide a sufficient pool of trainees and apprenticeships. When we met the apprentices, of whom there are a hundred&#8212;it is hoped that that figure will expand to 150&#8212;about 60 to 80 per cent of those the minister spoke to had come directly from Jobcentre Plus, rather than having had word-of-mouth referral or having worked there already. That shows the importance of such schemes in extending opportunities to those who are furthest from the labour market.</p><p>The minister has dealt with most of Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s comments this week but, in response to them, I will quote Graeme Ogilvy, who is the director of the construction industry training board, ConstructionSkills Scotland. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Employers enrol their apprentices onto the programme at the start of the college term in September. That should not stop us hiring young people earlier in the year and giving them a job. Any change would deny these young people the chance of paid employment. You have to ask if that would be useful right now. The Scottish Government is right to keep the eligibility criteria for funding without any qualifying criteria such as time in the job.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I rise in support of the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion.

At your request, the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee looked at the possibility of holding committee meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings with plenary sessions being held in the afternoons, as others have mentioned. You also asked the committee to review ministerial question times.</p><p>Self-evidently, as someone who was elected just last year I found that challenge both interesting and somewhat daunting, as I am a relatively new kid on the block. However, although some procedural aspects are still unfamiliar to me, after a year in the Parliament I have been working here for long enough to form my own view on some strengths and weaknesses of the parliamentary week. I have seen things from my perspective, but I have also tried to see things from others&#8217; perspectives. Although I am disadvantaged by a relative lack of experience in this place, as a new member I have one advantage, in that members who were elected in 1999 may never have been able to look upon the Parliament with the benefit of an outsider&#8217;s view,</p><p>&#8220;to see ourselves as others see us.&#8221;</p><p>We have some excellent debates and we have some poor ones. I welcome in particular the increased availability of time for members&#8217; business, because members&#8217; debates often tackle some of the most interesting subjects. Often the degree of enlightenment can be constrained by speeches being limited to four minutes, so I welcome the allocation of additional time. I will highlight a couple of examples: the debate on the cumulative impact of wind farms, which is referred to in the committee&#8217;s report, and the debate that John Lamont mentioned on rail services between Edinburgh and Berwick. Both subjects were very good and generated stimulating debates, but the debates would have been greatly strengthened if we had been able to have longer speeches with more scope for interventions.</p><p>However, even six minute speeches can be constraining when we are dealing with complex, multifactorial issues or technical subjects, and interventions can be made impossible in those circumstances&#8212;although perhaps too often members resort to using that as an excuse not to take interventions.</p><p>I am new enough to still have that perspective and, based on conversations that I have had with outside voices and stakeholders who gave evidence to the committee&#8212;the convener mentioned a number of them&#8212;I have come to the view that change is needed. We did all that we could to retain a family-friendly ethos, but we needed to strike a balance between realigning the parliamentary week to generate additional plenary opportunities, time for members&#8217; debates&#8212;which has obviously been accepted&#8212;and opportunities for topical and ministerial questions, and allowing sufficient time for members, particularly those from rural areas, to attend constituency events, engage with local and regional stakeholders and work in their constituency or regional offices. The revised proposals meet those tests.</p><p>Moreover, if the committee&#8217;s reforms are adopted that will mark an important step in the evolution of the Parliament. Tony Blair showed his contempt for the Parliament when he infamously described it as having no more powers than an English parish council. Frankly, that said more about him than it did about the Parliament. This place is now a key part of Scots&#8217; everyday lives and has a growing influence on them, as shown in the Scottish social attitudes survey.</p><p>As John Lamont said, regardless of the ultimate constitutional future of Scotland, this place will have to take ever-greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland. Even the somewhat limited powers that were delivered by the Scotland Act 2012 will require additional scrutiny in areas associated with repatriated powers and, especially, regarding the tax powers in areas such as the Scottish rate of income tax, landfill tax and the stamp duty land tax.</p><p>One of the biggest concerns of former colleagues and people in the media and academia who gave evidence to the committee was the evident lack of topicality of matters for debate. As the convener stated, currently we have a wait from Thursday afternoon until the following Wednesday to see the chamber sit, and an even longer wait for themed questions and First Minister&#8217;s question time.</p><p>The lead time for lodging questions further contributes to the lack of topicality and the reduction in perceived relevance to the public, media and other stakeholders. That lack of topicality is not good enough, and the changed sitting times and topical question session will address those shortcomings&#8212;I warmly welcome the bureau&#8217;s acceptance of that.</p><p>Those of us who have ambition for the Scottish Parliament to be a truly national Parliament&#8212;last week&#8217;s debate on Scotland&#8217;s future suggests that that is the majority of us&#8212;should see this as an opportunity to reposition the Parliament in the public eye. As Margo MacDonald said, Westminster dominates the media coverage between Mondays and Wednesdays, with Prime Minister&#8217;s questions on Wednesday afternoons. Only on Thursdays does the Scottish Parliament seem to get much oxygen, with First Minister&#8217;s questions, which is the only bit of theatre during the week. Topical questions and increased scope for ministerial questions have the potential to generate greater media interest if they lead to more topicality.</p><p>I hope that, in due course, the Presiding Officer and the bureau will consider the opportunity for more supplementary questions to be asked. That would be good for ministers but it would also allow members to hone their abilities and to probe deeper into the issues. By its nature, the chamber rota that we all sit on means that we will have to cover only one Tuesday afternoon session every three weeks&#8212;certainly, in the case of the SNP group&#8212;unless we volunteer to do more. Those members who have neither a Tuesday committee nor a place on the Tuesday chamber rota could find themselves largely unaffected by the change in sitting patterns.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parliamentary Reform (Changes to Standing Orders)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

They are playing a significant role in securing the provision of specialist nurses, who are vital not only for paediatric epilepsy patients, but for adults with the condition. I agree with Nanette Milne that the value of specialist nurses cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, although progress is anticipated in the Borders, it is likely that there will be a lack of provision for adults sufferers and the position of those with learning disabilities remains a concern for the future.</p><p>Only seven of the 14 boards meet the standards for people who have epilepsy. Nanette Milne set out the detail of that, so I will not go over it. Unfortunately, Borders NHS Board meets only four of the 16 neurological health services standards criteria, whereas Dumfries and Galloway NHS Board meets 13 of them, so it is not merely an issue of rurality. There are rural health boards that are meeting the standards and others that are not. I know that NHS Borders chief executive Calum Campbell empathises with epilepsy sufferers and that there is a will to do work in the area. However, there is clearly still a lot to do to ensure that patients&#8217; needs are met in future.</p><p>Epilepsy Scotland has provided us with information on progress that has been made in the Borders, such as the appointment of a consultant neurologist and two clinical nurse specialists. However, action is required to</p><p>&#8220;ensure the engagement and commitment of senior management in the future development of its neurology service ... conduct audits to obtain robust data to monitor performance against standards ... ensure that patients with long term neurological conditions, in particular epilepsy, have access to a specialist services which meets their needs&#8221;,</p><p>which is clearly not happening at the moment, and to</p><p>&#8220;provide neurology specific training and education&#8221;,</p><p>as highlighted by Nanette Milne. That action is required to ensure that other healthcare professionals who are in contact with people who might have epilepsy understand the condition and symptoms.</p><p>I am one of the 54,000 people in Scotland&#8212;or one in 97&#8212;who have had epilepsy. I am extremely fortunate that I had it as a child and grew out of the symptoms. Aside from memories of having to undergo electroencephalograms, take bitter pills, which I hated doing as a small child&#8212;I think that phenobarbitone was the nasty piece that I had to take&#8212;and make some unscheduled visits to the sick kids hospital, there have been no lasting effects. I have been very lucky.</p><p>The work of Dr Andrew Elder, a consultant in acute elderly medicine who appeared before the cross-party group, highlights the fact that there is a clear link between dementia and epilepsy. Because we have a rapidly ageing population, that can only present us with even bigger problems in the future. That is why it is so important for us to have specialist services in place.</p><p>Demand for such services will probably grow. As Kenneth Gibson said, not all seizures are the same, so it is vital that there are people with specialist knowledge who can distinguish different types of epilepsy and target the therapeutics appropriately.

In particular, I thank Opposition members for the support that has enabled the debate to be heard. I also thank Veterans Scotland&#8212;Bob McFarlane in particular&#8212;and Poppyscotland for their support in my endeavours to secure the debate.</p><p>People who are part of a generation the majority of whom&#8212;unlike the minister&#8212;have had the good fortune never to have to go to war and experience all its horrors can only imagine what our servicemen and women go through. I put on record my support for all our serving armed forces personnel and all our veterans. The debate focuses on the alarming levels of alcohol misuse in the armed forces, but I do not want that to detract in any way from the vital importance of the armed forces&#8217; work or from the courage, heroism and professionalism that members of the forces demonstrate daily while they are conducting duties on our behalf.</p><p>Indeed, my admiration for our forces inspired me to join the cross-party group on armed forces veterans. The origins of the motion were heartfelt pleas by non-MSP members of the cross-party group, who asked MSPs on the group to seek a debate to raise awareness of the scale of the problem and to encourage the Ministry of Defence to confront the issue.</p><p>When I approached Veterans Scotland to indicate that I was willing to take the matter up on the organisation&#8217;s and others&#8217; behalf, I was made aware of a key study on alcohol misuse, which was undertaken by Dr Nicola Fear, from the King&#8217;s centre for military health research. The study, which is one of several that link alcohol and drug abuse to combat stress, revealed stark and alarming figures. The researchers undertook an extensive survey of 9,990 service personnel, and in the region of 13 per cent of respondents said that misuse of alcohol was a problem for them, either during or after their service. Further, the research indicated that the number of armed forces personnel who are misusing alcohol might be higher in Scotland than it is elsewhere. That is also indicated in the evaluation of the gateways for veterans pilot in Inverclyde, which I mentioned in the motion.</p><p>The King&#8217;s centre for military health&#8217;s study highlighted that, during the period from 1998 to 2004, eight of the worst 10 local authority areas in the United Kingdom for alcohol-related deaths were in Scotland, with the average death rates in Scotland almost double those for the UK as a whole. I do not want to cover ground that has already been widely debated in the chamber to do with the cultural problem that we have in Scotland, so I will leave the analysis of that there. However, I noted that the surgeon general himself cited wider societal change as a factor that influences alcohol consumption in the services. It is my opinion that the unique pressures that are faced by forces personnel fan the flames caused by societal practice.</p><p>Even more concerning is the fact that the study&#8217;s figures show that 26 per cent of respondents aged under 25 felt that alcohol misuse was a problem for them. The figure rises from 11 per cent of those who have not been deployed to combat to 23 per cent of those of all ages who have served in a combat role.</p><p>At the most recent meeting of the CPG in April, I was grateful to the surgeon general, Vice Admiral Philip Raffaelli, for joining the meeting to hear the concerns addressed by my motion and to attempt to allay them. The surgeon general and Jon Parkin, head of veterans services at the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency, suggested that early leavers from the armed forces often have the most problems with alcohol misuse, which coincides with the evidence of the high proportion of young people with that problem.</p><p>If that is the case, it is all the more important that the MOD steps up its efforts to identify problem drinkers in the recruitment process, provide a stronger hand in deterring the adoption of a macho drinking culture during service and provide ever-greater support and signposting advice to individuals to get help. That could avoid the wastage of losing highly trained professional service personnel to problem drinking and the behavioural changes that come with it. Indeed, alcohol may well be a strong contributory factor to many early departures.</p><p>Also at the CPG meeting were a number of CPG members who are serving, ex-serving and associated armed forces personnel, and representatives of agencies such as First Base Agency in Dumfries and Galloway. They raised concerns about the easy availability of cheaply priced alcohol in on-base messes and other facilities, and expressed concern about the effect that subsidised alcohol and the ability to buy alcohol on a mess bill, rather than with cash, had in helping to encourage a binge drinking culture in the forces. Although the days of rum tots in the navy are long gone, the inherent drinking culture remains&#8212;a point recognised by the surgeon general. From anecdotal evidence, we believe that alcohol consumption is often encouraged as a means of decompression for those coming back from combat.</p><p>Although I accept that a degree of responsibility must be shouldered by people such as MSPs who are actively making laws to protect vulnerable people, MOD bases are in effect off-limits to us, to civilian licensing authorities and to health professionals. The bases have their own policing, health and disciplinary procedures. I therefore strongly urge the MOD, as the body responsible for the mental and physical wellbeing of our serving forces personnel, to review the support that it gives to serving forces personnel and to train more senior officers and non-commissioned officers to deal with and support their charges for whom alcohol misuse has become a problem.</p><p>I also encourage the MOD to do more to control the use of cheap alcohol and promotions, if not removing alcohol from barracks altogether, which would not make us very popular. Also, I encourage the MOD to do more to educate personnel properly on the risks that they face in adopting a heavy drinking culture.</p><p>The motion encourages the national health service and the MOD to work together to provide even greater welfare support to veterans. We recognise that various veterans organisations have a strong role to play in addressing the risk of mental health issues in our forces.</p><p>Alcohol, when it is consumed irresponsibly, can destroy lives and prospects for relationships, getting a home or a job. Ultimately, it can destroy people&#8217;s health. Anyone who heard the recent BBC Radio Scotland phone-in on &#8220;Call Kaye&#8221; will have heard first-hand experiences of today&#8217;s veterans and their families, who feel that they were inadequately prepared for life outside the forces.</p><p>While serving, forces personnel benefit from a heightened sense of community, and the support of their comrades in arms is a great comfort while they are deployed. That runs alongside the close network of families left at home, often living in quarters and providing an alternative family for each other. However, it is almost unimaginable for civilians to appreciate the sense of loss that many feel when they leave the armed forces, even when they have not lost close comrades in combat.</p><p>The King&#8217;s study indicates that there is quite a sharp rise in alcohol misuse problems among those who come back from combat roles. I suspect that many combat stress cases go undiagnosed and the sufferers may end up self-medicating with alcohol, having learned while they were in the forces that that is an accepted way of decompressing.</p><p>In February, the UK Government responded to the House of Commons Defence Committee&#8217;s report &#8220;The Armed Forces Covenant in Action&#8221;. The response recognised the work done to provide medical treatment to wounded, injured and sick service personnel in theatres of operation and during rehabilitation at home. I hope that that work will continue. I highlight the &#8220;Fighting Fit&#8221; report from 2010, which says:</p><p>&#8220;alcohol abuse is significantly associated with service in the Armed Forces and there is evidence that it is more common among combat veterans. Mental illness is a root cause of both homelessness and involvement in the criminal justice system.&#8221;</p><p>The MOD proposes to allow serving personnel to carry forward an NHS number through their military career&#8212;traditionally, when people join the forces, they have given up their NHS number, which has made it difficult to track them once they leave. It proposes to implement that policy in England, and will enter discussions with the Scottish Government as well. That will improve our tracking of veterans and give us a better understanding of their medical history.</p><p>The motion discusses those who find alcohol misuse a problem while still serving as well as after they have left active service. I want to draw attention to that, because it is not just a problem of veterans&#8212;the problem starts while people are in the forces.</p><p>I dedicate this members&#8217; business debate to those who have given their lives for us and, crucially, to those who return from serving their country. Many of them continue to fight their own private battles once the guns have gone silent, and they deserve our full support.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667209", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol Abuse (Armed Forces)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members who signed my motion and those who will stay in the chamber during lunch time to hear the debate.

Dogmatic austerity is in danger of killing rather than curing the economic patient. The Scottish Government&#8217;s strategic priorities are clear, and what is also clear is how much more Scotland could do&#8212;I agree with Annabelle Ewing&#8212;if it was independent. If the full range of economic levers was available to us, we could use those powers to improve our circumstances, as our independent neighbours in Scandinavia do.</p><p>However, with the limited powers of devolution, the Scottish Government has proved its worth in the teeth of recession. It may be disputed by opponents, but it is true and factually based to say that Scotland&#8217;s recession was shorter and shallower than the recession in the rest of the UK. We had five quarters of recession as opposed to six in the UK and the decrease in GDP was 5.9 per cent as opposed to 7.2 per cent in the UK.</p><p>The UK economy has contracted by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, which has pitched us into a double-dip recession.

Years of poor lifestyle choices, higher consumption of alcohol, bad diet, a lack of exercise, sedentary working practices and environmental influences will mean that many more of us can perhaps look forward to our later years being affected by one or more chronic medical conditions, compared with those who are 85 or older today. As Gavin Brown said, strong growth is projected in the number of people over that age up to 2031.</p><p>Although many witnesses were reluctant to volunteer areas of spending that we should cut in order to grow spending on prevention, it is clear that we will face some hard choices in the future and that, as the need for acute services falls, some remodelling might be needed.</p><p>We need to engage with stakeholders and challenge civic Scotland to think big and throw aside the silos, whether they are financial or organisational. We need to think carefully about what we can deliver by using funds more creatively so that we can sustain preventative spend in the face of the demographic change that we expect. As we heard in the committee&#8217;s discussions, we must also consider the cost of administering means testing. Many of the witnesses who talked about cancelling universal benefits were unable to quantify the costs that administering means testing might generate. We must look not only at the costs and benefits of services, but at the costs that we avoid by not means testing them.</p><p>In conclusion, the social wage and the protection of the most vulnerable people in our society must not merely be about money.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fiscal Sustainability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I say to Mr Macintosh that the UK was 16th in that list, not sixth.

As members have said, we all know that there is a particularly high prevalence of MS in Scotland, with 10,500 people having the condition. I am also reliably informed by the MS Society that the number of people with MS is particularly high in the south of Scotland&#8212;indeed, 1,700 of those 10,500 sufferers are in the south of Scotland. Jo O&#8217;Neill of the MS Society told me that the Scottish Borders has one of the highest rates of MS.</p><p>I have raised issues with the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy regarding the implementation of clinical guidelines on neurological health to ensure that there is no postcode lottery in the provision of services. As things stand, in the Scottish Borders we have only limited access to specialist multidisciplinary teams of consultants, physiotherapists and nurses. Indeed, the physiotherapy provision that we have is funded by the central Borders branch of the MS Society.</p><p>The relative lack of specialist nursing provision is not directly the responsibility of the Government; the Government funds NHS Borders and the board makes clinical decisions. I want to use this opportunity to highlight the plight of people in the Borders who have MS and to call on NHS Borders to respond in kind. The board does not currently have specialist consultant-level support and there is no purely NHS-funded physiotherapy support, although the board has 0.6 full-time-equivalent specialist nurse provision.</p><p>Appropriate specialist, rather than generalist, provision can have an impact on people with the condition. Information that the MS Society provided to me in August 2011, which probably relates to 2010, suggests that, by treating patients in the home, MS nurses could generate savings of as much as &#163;1,800 per course of treatment, so it would make good financial sense for NHS Borders and other boards in Scotland to invest in such services. I hope that NHS Borders will use its common sense and address the need for specialist provision, given that we know that the south of Scotland has the highest prevalence of MS, according to the MS Society. It is about priorities.</p><p>The MS Society cited a survey, saying:</p><p>&#8220;Over 60% of respondents reported that their MS nurse always helps them when they want to know about different treatments, or their current medication. Over 70% stated that their MS nurse is always the first point of contact when they have any questions about their MS&#8221;,</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;80% said their MS nurse had provided support to their family and carers.&#8221;</p><p>MS nurses are important posts and we should do all that we can do to encourage our local health boards to provide such services. In a report by the MS Society, an MS patient was quoted as saying:</p><p>&#8220;Having an ms nurse has enabled me to remain in work and cope well with the condition ... It is great to have a familiar face who knows who you are and someone who can help you make very important decisions.&#8221;</p><p>I sincerely hope that NHS Borders will respond to that call, and I congratulate George Adam on bringing the debate to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666310", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Multiple Sclerosis Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate George Adam on securing the debate and the MS Society on its work in raising the profile of the impact of MS on those with the condition&#8212;both on the emotional and relationship side of life and on their social and working life&#8212;through &#8220;Fighting Back&#8221;.

The Tories talk of centralisation, which is also ironic given their record of gerrymandering local government boundaries to suit them&#8212;although in practice the electorate saw to it that it did not suit the Tories at all, and the same will happen on 3 May. The Tory manifesto is a poor document that is thin on detail, which is understandable when the Tories have conceded that they are fighting the Lib Dems for the bronze medal in the local government elections.</p><p>In historians&#8217; eyes, the Tories formed possibly one of the most centralising Governments in the history of the British isles. Mr Cameron has continued that theme with his patronising tone whenever he visits Scotland. By contrast, the SNP Government is pursuing a community empowerment and renewal bill and allowing the development of new rail stations through the new station investment fund and efforts to adopt stations.</p><p>When it comes to planning&#8212;especially in relation to renewables&#8212;Conservative councillors show overt and opportunistic cowardice. When any wind farm comes up for discussion, they seem to say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s reject this and force the Scottish Government to make the correct decision,&#8221; rather than treat each application on its merits.</p><p>A former shadow Secretary of State for Scotland and former incumbent in the role of sole Tory MP in Scotland, Mr Duncan, is standing in the Leaderdale and Melrose ward in the Borders. He has called for a moratorium on all wind farm developments, which I presume would apply even when communities fully support developments, as many do in the Borders. Apart from being against communities&#8217; interests, the proposal smacks of prejudice.</p><p>Christine Grahame forced Mr Duncan to admit that he would rather see a new nuclear power station in Lauderdale than compromise on wind power. In the unlikely event that he is elected, I certainly hope that he does not end up on Scottish Borders Council&#8217;s planning and building standards committee.</p><p>When any decision is made in favour of a site that complies with the council&#8217;s planning policy, Tories locally will bleat that it was the bad SNP boy who rang the bell and ran away. They ignore the fact that the decision will have been made on planning grounds by an independent Government-appointed reporter who is a planning professional. We should contrast the Tories&#8217; approach with the Government&#8217;s support for 500MW of community-owned and operated renewables.</p><p>The Tories&#8217; motion refers to subsidiarity. Quite. When will the Tories realise that their mooting of issues such as subsidiarity loses all coherence and credibility when their leader in this place talks about lines in the sand on devolution, regardless of what the people of Scotland want or need? The Tories&#8217; strong support for Calman, which excluded any reference to independence, showed their true colours.</p><p>When the Tories discuss subsidiarity while guffawing at any suggestion that the cabinet secretary from the area of these islands with more than 70 per cent of the fishing fleet should lead fisheries talks&#8212;recognising that such talks should be led by the most appropriate minister rather than placemen from the House of Lords&#8212;we know exactly where they stand. That shows their utter hypocrisy.</p><p>On centralisation, do not the Tories understand that, as the minister said, the concordat with local government has delivered far greater autonomy than they ever considered, let alone delivered? At its heart, that includes the freedom for local authorities to spend more than 90 per cent of all their income, since the practice of ring fencing has pretty much ended. Only limited ring fencing remains for spending on discrete matters such as community police officers, and there are clear links to single outcome agreements.</p><p>Single outcome agreements free up councils to decide how best to deliver outcomes that are agreed and shared with the Government. Perhaps that is why the innovative national performance framework and single outcome agreements are generating much interest from beyond Scotland.</p><p>The Scotsman has derided the Tories&#8217; manifesto&#8212;it branded the term &#8220;local devolution&#8221; clumsy&#8212;so even newspapers that are steadfastly kind to the Tories have their doubts. The proposal is just a somewhat banal attempt by the Tories to rebrand their flop of a policy on the big society.</p><p>They propose directly elected mayors&#8212;surely all should be provosts, Mr Carlaw, or did that not survive the translation from London?

The Conservatives and their Liberal Democrat friends are just as bad, as they all reject a fuel duty regulator.</p><p>I will comment on the bus service operators grant itself. To be clear, past funding mechanisms for buses were not sustainable, and bus operators were essentially subsidised for burning more fuel rather than travelling more miles. As the whole point of a bus service is to provide a public means to get from A to B when there are limited or no alternatives, it is clearly more sensible to subsidise routes where there are limited or no alternatives to taking the bus, and that situation is most common in rural areas.</p><p>First and foremost, the changes to the bus service operators grant reflect that need. By subsidising operators based on the distances that they cover as opposed to the volume of diesel that they burn, we will kill two birds with one stone: it will create a significant incentive for operators to lower their emissions in various ways, and it will make running buses on rural routes more attractive.</p><p>As an MSP for the rural South Scotland region&#8212;I am most familiar with rural East Lothian and the Scottish Borders&#8212;I understand the importance of public transport to people in rural areas, and I am certain that the switch in the BSOG funding mechanism to pence per kilometre will not stand in the way of new rural routes being established.</p><p>With regard to lowering emissions, I am delighted that the Scottish Government's green bus fund, which recently allocated &#163;1.8 million to bus operators across Scotland, will continue to remain in place and will allow operators to apply for grants of up to &#163;1 million for new, eco-friendly buses. As my colleague Sandra White, said, those buses are mainly manufactured in Scotland, because we lead in hybrid bus technology.</p><p>I also hope that the green bus fund will establish itself as another measure that will put operators in a more competitive place from which to offer longer-distance routes.

The Conservatives should be ashamed of that; it is clear that that should not be regarded as a &#8220;union dividend&#8221; for Scotland.</p><p>Gavin Brown talked about the role of the OBR, and I have the greatest respect for Robert Chote, who gave evidence to the Finance Committee today. However, although, as the cabinet secretary identified, the projection is that unemployment as defined by the International Labour Organization will peak in 2012 at 8.7 per cent, Mr Chote could not enlighten the committee on what the regional differential might be in this or other years. In other words, the OBR analysis is not yet sophisticated enough for it to be used to understand the regional impacts of the UK Government&#8217;s budget. That is alarming. I am not blaming the OBR&#8212;that is not part of its remit&#8212;but it is an issue that the UK Government should address and which it has a responsibility to take into account. Indeed, we know that in previous years Eddie George of the Bank of England accepted that unemployment in the north of England and Scotland was a price worth paying to control inflation in the south-east of England.</p><p>Willie Rennie said that people who do not accept the need to reduce the deficit live in cloud-cuckoo-land. That is wrong, because it is not only the level of debt, but the ability to sustain the growth that will help to service that debt that is crucial. In its most recent pronouncements on the UK&#8217;s credit rating, Moody&#8217;s has made it clear that the weak prospects for growth and not just the level of debt are putting the UK&#8217;s rating at risk.</p><p>We have already heard about the 33 per cent cut in Scotland&#8217;s capital budget over the spending review period. Robert Chote confirmed that the projected &#163;1.4 billion cut to the general Government investment figures, which appeared in the paper that was presented to the committee today, reflects the UK Government&#8217;s spending plans beyond 2014. The Government is already talking about potentially cutting further.

I am a member of rail action group east of Scotland&#8212;I welcome fellow members to the gallery and associate myself with John Lamont and Iain Gray&#8217;s comments on their hard work on behalf of the project.</p><p>I support the motion and I am grateful to John Lamont for securing the debate on behalf of the four MSPs who have been closely involved with the issue. I am also grateful to him for accepting my amendments to his draft motion. I thank the minister for coming to both station sites and to Eyemouth, at my invitation, and for the two ministerial meetings that he has had. I know that he has a keen interest in the project.</p><p>The minister faces a 32 per cent capital funding cut over the spending review period. Funding is scarce and it behoves us all to demonstrate the value of investment, as John Lamont said. There is also an equity issue, given that since Reston station closed the region has helped to subsidise rail services elsewhere in Scotland while receiving nothing in return. As I said in my submission to the &#8220;Rail 2014&#8221; consultation, subsidy should be allocated to ensure that Government objectives for cohesion and solidarity, which are the characteristics of growth that we seek in Scotland, are delivered.</p><p>Glasgow City Council and Highland Council each have 58 or more stations in their areas and receive considerable subsidy. I am not suggesting that those areas&#8217; subsidy be reduced, but the case for levelling up areas such as my area needs to be recognised.</p><p>Eyemouth and the surrounding district are in great need of economic diversification and regeneration. John Lamont mentioned the Scottish Agricultural College study, which noted that of the 44 towns that were considered, Eyemouth was one of those most exposed to the impact of the cuts that arise from UK spending cuts. According to analysis by Scottish Borders Council, the area has one of the oldest age profiles in Scotland. The retention of young people in the area is a key problem. There are virtually no private sector graduate jobs and precious few skilled or technical posts in the area. Job density&#8212;if I may use a technical term&#8212;is low and the employment rate has traditionally been significantly lower than the Borders and British averages.</p><p>Further education participation is particularly low. The overall student participation rate for FE in east Berwickshire is below 50 per cent of the Scottish average; it is also below East Lothian and Scottish Borders comparators. The overall participation rate for all levels of post-school education is between 50 and 70 per cent of the average. Access to university and college courses in Edinburgh would help enormously.</p><p>Social housing is badly needed in the area. Berwickshire Housing Association has more than 110 applicants for every new social rented house that is built in Eyemouth and between 60 and 80 applicants for every existing social rented house that becomes available. The railway would unlock investment in open-market housing throughout Berwickshire, with 552 units in the local plan for Eyemouth alone, releasing land for social housing in the process. The project provides a strong fit with the Government&#8217;s economic strategy, in that it would increase solidarity between income groups and improve cohesion by increasing economic growth in an area that traditionally underperforms in that regard. It would support the achievement of rural development objectives and climate change targets, in the context of the report on proposals and policies. In many ways, the project would contribute strongly to the Government&#8217;s wider agenda.</p><p>The advent of local rail services would also bring the possibility of establishing jobs in the tourism and knowledge sectors in the region. It would improve connectivity and drive business and tourism investment in East Lothian and Berwickshire.</p><p>Like any rail service in Scotland, the service would receive a degree of subsidy, but the returns to Government would demonstrate good value for money. I am confident that the STAG 2 study, when it is commissioned, will demonstrate that the assumptions that MVA used were overly pessimistic.</p><p>Many community councils have made strong submissions to RAGES and to me. Eyemouth town council said:</p><p>&#8220;The benefits of a station in Reston are huge both to the economy and to the wider community as a whole. It would mean that our youngsters, the new generation of voters and workers, would be able to remain in the Borders. They could travel for college and University courses. Young people are leaving the area as they cannot afford the travelling costs or the time it takes to commute. This leaves us with an aged retired population, which is not ideal.</p><p>Businesses in the area would also benefit with a quick means of travel to the Capital. Reinvestment may then be attracted to the area&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663697", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Services (Berwickshire and East Lothian)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests.

I also have a role in the Finance Committee; we had a low level of scrutiny of the bill, so there was not much evidence to go on.</p><p>I note that the estimated annual cost of the proposals is &#163;3.85 million against an annual income to Registers of Scotland of &#163;48.6 million, and that it is expected that efficiencies will arise to Registers of Scotland that will partly offset the annual cost. I also note the &#163;19 million cost over the first five years, which puts in context the figures that James Kelly rightly highlighted when he spoke about Registers of Scotland&#8217;s reserves. Registers of Scotland is quite unusual in the public sector in that it needs to be self-sustaining. Its reserves are therefore an important part of its finances and of ensuring that it maintains its on-going operations.</p><p>The benefits from the bill will not just be to property owners, investors and authorities in reducing potential risks from inaccurate information. I will highlight a few benefits that I am aware of, having worked in the property sector, although not as a lawyer like Murdo Fraser and some other members. I have used the data that Registers of Scotland has produced. It is extremely important that the information is accurate, not only to understand who owns the land, but to understand what is happening in property markets.</p><p>Registers of Scotland has substantial reserves, which should keep the costs down. As others have stated, they could perhaps provide some scope for keeping the registration costs down and encouraging voluntary registrations. I noted the minister&#8217;s comment that, in effect, landed estates have a window of opportunity to increase the amount of land that is registered at an advantageous rate. That is an important point to raise.</p><p>I agree with Annabel Goldie on the mapping issues. The suggested tolerances for Ordnance Survey maps of 0.3m to 0.4m might sound accurate to some, but in the context of property they create the opportunity for ransom strips. The strips might be thin but, if there is some doubt about who owns them, they could cause all sorts of problems in securing investment. I agree with James Kelly about the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8217;s excellent degree of thoroughness. Paragraph 78 of the committee&#8217;s report suggests that consideration has been taken of the cost of mapping and that the use of Ordnance Survey mapping should continue, with the understanding that, although it is perhaps not the ideal form of mapping for registration, it keeps costs to a reasonable level.</p><p>Paragraph 77 notes that Ross MacKay of the Law Society of Scotland told that committee that</p><p>&#8220;the difficulty at the moment is that many titles are based on old sasines, which have no maps at all.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 11 January 2012; c 753.]</p><p>A map that is not perfect is better than no map at all. That is something to bear in mind.</p><p>As a community councillor, I was aware of regular problems in my local area to do with buildings at risk. It is difficult to enable the council to take enforcement action to ensure that a building at risk is maintained or improved if we cannot trace who the real owner is.</p><p>On common good land, there is the recent example of a wind farm at Drone hill in the Coldingham area of east Berwickshire. The wind farm had been approved and it was subsequently discovered that Drone moss, a site of special scientific interest, was technically still owned by the local community of Ayton but no one could identify who the legal owners were.

The Scottish Human Rights Commission cites the right to life, the right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to adequate housing and the right to safe drinking water and sanitation. However, adaptation and mitigation measures can themselves have a negative impact on human rights and exacerbate discrimination and inequity. As the SHRC puts it:</p><p>&#8220;For instance, cultivation of biofuels can lead to land use change from forestry to agriculture, diversion of water resources, and cause community displacement.&#8221;</p><p>Amnesty International has welcomed this debate on climate justice and the opportunity that it provides to address important concerns about human rights. It recognises that the Scottish Government understands the link between the environmental consequences of development and human rights. Climate change is more devastating to those who are already economically disadvantaged and vulnerable throughout the world.</p><p>The SHRC states that it is important to note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reaffirmed that parties should fully respect human rights in all actions related to climate change. Its briefing goes on to state that nation states have a responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil human rights in the context of climate change, which has three levels: international, national and local. It goes on to state that nation states should ensure policy coherence at all levels in discharging their legal duties to respect, protect and fulfil human rights.

There has been growth in particular in whisky exports to China and the other BRIC nations&#8212;Brazil, Russia and India.

That view is shared by members throughout the chamber. In my maiden speech, I highlighted the plight of young people in the Borders, who have traditionally had to leave the region to find skilled employment opportunities and even, in some cases, training opportunities. In effect, that has exported unemployment to our cities.</p><p>I therefore very much welcome the creation of the Scottish Borders knitwear group training association, which has been formed by Hawick Knitwear, Hawick Cashmere, Peter Scott, Johnstons of Elgin and several other companies, including Lochcarron in Selkirk. The innovation is aimed at combating the sector&#8217;s biggest challenge of an ageing workforce and no dedicated programmes for recruiting new staff. The scheme will put in place 20 new trainers, 10 assessors and, I understand, initially 50 apprentices, who are being delivered by those employers collectively to address the challenges faced by the whole sector.</p><p>The chamber should warmly welcome that development but, unfortunately, it has not been warmly welcomed by members on the Opposition benches, only one of whom signed my motion on the subject.</p><p>I congratulate the Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Skillset and Skills Development Scotland on the roles that they have played in the scheme.</p><p>Johnstons of Elgin has made new investment in Hawick, and one of its directors said:</p><p>&#8220;I see a bright future for manufacturing of luxury textiles in Scotland and I hope this investment&#8221;</p><p>of &#163;1 million that the company is making</p><p>&#8220; ... in new advanced knitting machines later this year, will mark a new period of progress for us and ... the industry of Hawick&#8221;.</p><p>Some sectors have had a really tough time but the fact that our textiles industry is responding to growing demand for high-end luxury goods and is expanding is a positive sign for Scotland. I invite the minister to visit Hawick when she gets an opportunity to hear more about the project for herself.</p><p>Other examples of the local impact of modern apprenticeships include Greenvale AP, a major food sector employer that is proposing to take on modern apprentices at Chirnside, and Abbey Tool &amp; Gauge, an advanced manufacturing engineering company in Kelso that I have visited and which has recently almost doubled the number of its employees, mainly by taking on new trainees under the age of 20. It is clear that local employers are supporting lots of good initiatives.</p><p>John Park, who, I am sad to say, has left the chamber, made a very good point about the importance of helping those at the margins of the labour force. Last August, I visited a Barnardo&#8217;s care farming programme at Sunnyside farm in Traprain near Haddington. For two days a week, this six-week programme, which has been developed by the farmer for young people across the academic spectrum in East Lothian schools, gives participants an insight into land-based industries and working as part of a team to develop the soft skills required for the world of work. In other words, it prepares people for apprenticeships and other employment opportunities and provides a vital step into the labour market. The programme is designed to support young people all over East Lothian, and those involved are waiting for a decision from East Lothian Council on additional funding to expand it. I should also point out that the young people who took part were in the final months of their secondary education and were on the cusp of the important transition from school to further education or employment.</p><p>Many measures such as those that I have mentioned and the modern apprenticeships deal with the here and now, but I also want to highlight the Government&#8217;s investment in the long term. The Government&#8217;s decisive shift to preventative spending, measures such as the early years change fund and specific programmes such as family-nurse partnerships ensure that children will receive support in their very early years. Such an approach ensures that in the longer term they will have much more positive health, education and employment outcomes, which in turn will give them improved life chances.</p><p>The Government, its partner agencies, colleges and, crucially, employers, some of whom I have mentioned, are doing a lot of work out there. Moreover, a lot of work is being done by the voluntary sector, including Barnardo&#8217;s; YouthLink Scotland, which Chic Brodie mentioned and which is carrying out wonderful youth activities; and Action on Hearing Loss Scotland, which has developed specific programmes tailored to those with hearing difficulties to get them into employment. I commend all their efforts.</p><p>I also commend the Government for its own commitment in these times of severe financial constraints to today&#8217;s young adults and to improving the life outcomes of the young adults of tomorrow. This Government is ambitious for Scotland and our people and, crucially, it has a can-do attitude and a drive to realise those ambitions.</p><p>Finally, as time permits, I will address a couple of points that were made earlier. First, I direct Kezia Dugdale, who seemed to be criticising the minister for not wishing to do more within the powers that we have, to her own party&#8217;s strategy for tackling the employment situation and stimulating growth. Four of the five steps that Labour proposed, which we have heard about repeatedly in the chamber in the past couple of weeks, involve powers that are reserved to Westminster&#8212;for example, the measures on VAT and national insurance. The only one that is in the gift of this Parliament and this Government relates to capital investment, and as we heard in yesterday&#8217;s budget statement, the considerable sum of &#163;382 million has been added to our capital budget.</p><p>Liz Smith and Liam McArthur discussed college sector cuts.

In last week&#8217;s stage 1 debate on the Budget (Scotland) Bill, we heard that the SFT and the non-profit-distributing model are supplementing an otherwise declining capital budget and allowing the Scottish Government to maintain its capital spend, which is providing great sustenance to the construction sector.</p><p>The SFT&#8217;s procurement expertise is delivering substantial savings in commissioning projects. By last June, an estimated &#163;129 million of savings had been identified. Of course, we are aware of the significant savings that are being generated on the Forth crossing budget, which have enabled the Scottish Government to unlock additional funds for matters as diverse as early years services and the digital futures fund.</p><p>The SFT is helping to generate substantial savings. As Colin Keir said, it delivered the project on time and under budget, which is very much to be welcomed. The procurement expertise is bearing fruit in the delivery of projects and in keeping them within their budget, which has been a constant concern in past public procurement projects.</p><p>I am conscious of the time, so I will just commend the Drumbrae project and express my hope that it will bring great benefit to the people of Drumbrae, East Craigs, Parkgrove and Edinburgh as a whole.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660262", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drumbrae Library and Community Hub"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Colin Keir on securing the debate.

The sector already employs 360,000 people in the supply chain, and 6,000 people are directly employed in farming and food production in the Scottish Borders alone. Food and drink is big business and is of huge importance to areas such as the Borders, East Lothian and Dumfries and Galloway. It covers a huge range of businesses, from artisan producers to multinationals. A healthy, sustainable farming sector is crucial to the continued success of the sector as a whole, and we must recognise the value of farming to guaranteeing our food security.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the CAP aims to ensure food security while also generating a range of environmental benefits, addressing the climate change objectives of the EU and member states, and helping to sustain vulnerable rural economies and communities through economic development interventions. Agricultural statistics analysed by the Scottish Government indicate that, across a range of products, commodity prices were buoyant in 2010-11: malting barley was up 40 per cent; lamb was up 21 per cent; beef was up 20 per cent; milk was up 12 per cent; oilseed rape was up 11 per cent; and pork was up 8 per cent. Potato prices, however, are known to have gone down substantially.</p><p>On the face of it, those figures might point to good times for most, but against that good news farmers have faced even greater rises in input prices. The price of fertilisers such as ammonium nitrate has gone up by 31 per cent; the price of red diesel&#8212;which has been crucial, given the wet harvest in many areas&#8212;has gone up 25 per cent; and the price of animal feed has risen by between 19 and 24 per cent. There is also some evidence that cereal prices dipped towards the end of the year, according to NFUS in the Borders.</p><p>Like Mary Scanlon, who is unfortunately not here to hear this, as a consumer I find it depressing that the supermarkets are squeezing margins, especially for our dairy sector producers, and that it is difficult to find Scottish products such as chicken and pork on our supermarket shelves. Brazilian chicken and Danish pork and bacon seem to predominate at the moment. I urge our supermarkets to do far more to support Scottish farming where they can.</p><p>Much of our farming sector is marginal, and the CAP is not helping our less favoured areas sufficiently. As members have said, Scotland&#8217;s funding under pillar 1 is, at &#8364;130 per hectare, the fourth-lowest in the EU compared with that of other member states. It is just 48 per cent of the EU average of &#8364;269 per hectare. CAP reform proposals indicate that there should be a minimum one-third convergence towards 90 per cent of the EU average payment by 2019. If that took place, according to the SPICe research paper, it would require the EU to increase pillar 1 payments to Scotland by &#8364;190 million per annum. By my calculation, if Scotland were to achieve the EU average and reach &#8364;269 per hectare after 2020, that would result in a net additional &#8364;628 million per annum for Scottish farming at current rates. We must hope that the UK Government passes on the estimated &#8364;190 million per annum from the initial phase of convergence between member states by 2019, as that is money to which Scotland is fully entitled under the Commission&#8217;s proposals.</p><p>The SPICe briefing indicates that the Commission intends payments to be distributed more equitably within a member state, with member states moving towards allocations based on a uniform flat rate per hectare at the national or regional level by 2019. Under the current constitutional arrangements, the UK could choose to have different levels of funding in regions within the UK, in which event convergence may not happen to the same extent in Scotland. However, I&#8212;like Aileen McLeod&#8212;fully expect that the people of Scotland, in their infinite wisdom, will ensure that we are independent well before 2019 and that, when Scotland becomes independent, the full economic benefit of convergence between member states will be delivered to Scotland automatically. On the basis of current rates, that could be worth up to &#8364;628 million per annum to the Scottish farming sector. Regardless of how far convergence ultimately goes, it is important that it still allows scope for regional differences within Scotland to reflect different circumstances, levels of productivity and farming uses. Nevertheless, the point remains that Scotland would be guaranteed to gain from the EU policy of convergence to the EU average rate per hectare and would not be forced to remain a fourth-class member as a mere UK region.</p><p>Under pillar 2, the SRDP has delivered a huge number of projects&#8212;there are 6,500 projects that are worth &#163;480 million under the rural priorities scheme alone. However, the level of funding from Europe for rural development in Scotland under pillar 2 is a scandal. In the United Kingdom&#8217;s union and after feeble UK representation in past negotiations, Scotland has been left high and dry with the lowest pillar 2 allocation anywhere in the European Union.

It was, therefore, something of a disappointment that the report that we produced&#8212;which was a challenging one for the Government and one that I commend to the chamber&#8212;was rejected in full. I am afraid that, unfortunately, partisan politics kicked in and our Labour colleagues decided to dissent from the report in its entirety despite being provided with opportunities by the convener to dissent only from the sections that they were uncomfortable with.</p><p>The minority annex that was proposed by my Labour colleagues bore little resemblance to the evidence that was presented to the committee. Indeed, paragraph 2 of the minority annex was particularly partisan, ignoring the fact that there is a new Government economic strategy that clearly sets out the Government&#8217;s priorities for investment. When John Swinney, the cabinet secretary, attended our evidence session in Largs, little attempt was made to raise any concerns with him about the issues that subsequently appeared in the minority annex. I am afraid, therefore, that I must begin on a negative note by saying that I am disappointed at what transpired in signing off the report.</p><p>On preventative spending, I will not cover all the territory that the convener has covered in depth. Suffice it to say that witness after witness emphasised the importance of shifting resources to prevention and of spending now to save later, rather than spending more and picking up the pieces arising from acute health, social, educational and economic challenges. We heard especially passionate and compelling evidence from John Carnochan regarding the impact of early years intervention. Jo Armstrong stated in response to my questioning:</p><p>&#8220;As I said, any politician who is prepared right now to fund initiatives, the outcomes of which will not be seen for 10 or 15 years, if not generations, is making a brave decision.&#8221;</p><p>I agree that it is a difficult context in which to make preventative spending; however, as my colleague, Mark McDonald, said, we are seeing a decisive shift.

Professor Jeremy Peat, from the Royal Society of Edinburgh, also backed that decision, highlighting the challenge of delivering such change against a backdrop of budget cuts. In paragraphs 100 to 111 of the report, the committee goes into some depth on the issue of leadership. Of course, providing leadership is not an issue just for the Scottish Government or for the Parliament as a whole; crucially, COSLA must also provide leadership.

Although I do not represent Glasgow, I am delighted that the games are coming to Scotland and I sincerely believe that the games will play a key role in regenerating Glasgow, which will ultimately benefit Scotland as a whole. Tavish Scott made that important point.</p><p>With regeneration in mind, I think that it is a pity that the Glasgow games are not benefiting from the full consequentials of the Olympic games. I hope that, as a Parliament, we keep up the pressure on that front and ensure that additional funds are made available.</p><p>I am delighted that the BBC is covering the games, which will help to market Glasgow and Scotland as a whole to a wide audience of 2 billion people around the globe and benefit Scotland&#8217;s tourism sector through an estimated 4 per cent increase in tourism traffic in the three years following the games. In effect, that coverage is millions of pounds of free advertising for Glasgow and Scotland, which is to be welcomed. That should help to assuage some of the concerns to which Tavish Scott referred. I am also delighted that, to date, Scottish companies have won 82 per cent of the Glasgow 2014 contracts. I will do my own bit as an MSP representing South Scotland to ensure that businesses there bid for and, I hope, win contracts.</p><p>The games have 17 sports, but their sporting legacy has the potential to extend way beyond that number. I noted in one of the briefings that I saw that there are 13,000 sports clubs in Scotland. In the Borders alone, there is a network of over 200 sports clubs. It is crucial to recognise the role that sport has played. Indeed, in the debate in June, we heard that &#163;1.8 billion of economic activity is generated by sport and that it supports up to 51,000 jobs in Scotland. Clearly, any growth in participation in sport and any growth in sport as a whole will make an economic contribution and not just have a sporting legacy.</p><p>I am deputy convener of the cross-party group on sports, which has discussed whether it is more important to achieve medals or to encourage participation in sport. However, the two are, of course, closely interlinked. A new generation of medal winners will inspire people to take up sport, so the two aspects are not in competition with each other. I am pleased to see that the Scottish sports alliance briefing highlights the importance of the new indicator in Scotland performs. I hope that that will help us to keep track of our performance and improve our record on participation, particularly among adults.</p><p>I was delighted to hear about the progress of community sport hubs. I ask the minister to indicate whether she sees that being reflected across the whole of Scotland and not just in particular areas. I am aware that the Borders has no community sports hubs, but I hope that some are in the pipeline. However, I am pleased to see that there is at least one in Dumfries and Galloway, at Maxwelltown high school.</p><p>It is clear that the issue of legacy has been thought through from the start, which is important. Unlike previous games, the legacy has been a key part of the Government&#8217;s activities in sport. I commend Glasgow City Council for its role in that regard.</p><p>Preventative spend is a subject that has been close to the Finance Committee&#8217;s heart for the past few months. I was particularly pleased to see the figures on increased participation: every 1 per cent increase in participation in sport yields &#163;3.5 million of savings in reducing coronary heart disease, strokes and colon cancer alone. It is good common sense to increase investment in sport, because it benefits not only individuals but society and Parliament by making health savings. I am also pleased to see that the level of spend on sport in Scotland has increased since 2007-08 and that there will be a continual increase until 2014-15, when the games will be held. I hope that that will be a lasting legacy.</p><p>On the prevention agenda, I wonder whether there are issues with how sport is perceived by other disciplines, whether health, justice or regeneration. Perhaps sport is not regarded as having the impact that I perceive it to have. For example, people have been critical of Strathclyde Police for investing in sport, but it is obvious that sport has an important diversionary role for people who are involved in crime. The legacy from getting people involved in sport can also have benefits in reducing crime.</p><p>I am conscious of time passing, but I want to highlight that I am aware through contact with the Commonwealth games team of strands of funding from the Big Lottery Fund and other sources, with micro-grants of up to &#163;2,000 to encourage participation. Just to encourage the minister, I say that since last week, when I met Mr Stewart, who is in the public gallery today, I have heard from a rugby club in the Borders that is interested in taking up some funding. We perhaps need to market that more to the sporting community to make it aware that the funds are available, because there is a lot of demand for support to help to develop volunteer coaches and other means of encouraging participation.</p><p>In closing, I congratulate employers such as the Weir Group, which I understand has had an important role in funding local legacy work. I hope that other employers get involved, too. With regard to the 15,000 volunteers, I very much hope that an army of volunteers from the Borders will head up to watch the sevens tournament at Scotstoun and that they will pack out the team as well as act as volunteers.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657777", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Delivery and Legacy)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you&#8212;duly noted.

I know that the decision to move the project across to be delivered by Network Rail using the Network Rail regulatory asset base has been warmly welcomed by Campaign for Borders Rail volunteers and local government leaders in the Borders and Midlothian.</p><p>That has further increased confidence that the project will be delivered within the budget of &#163;235 million to &#163;295 million, and that it will deliver the desired economic benefits to the region and to Scotland.</p><p>Those who carp from the sidelines, and there are some, should recognise that the project is the largest single investment in living memory in the infrastructure of the Scottish Borders, and that if the vision of those of us who want the railway to be reopened to Hawick&#8212;and ideally, to Carlisle&#8212;is ever to be realised, building the route to Tweedbank is an essential first step. It could thereafter connect&#8212;perhaps at Carlisle&#8212;with the high-speed rail link that the Scottish Government proposes in its infrastructure investment plan.</p><p>Although I recognise current constraints on funding, I fully intend to do the preliminary work to ensure that such an extension is ready and waiting in the wings if capital should ever become available. That would obviously be optimised if we were free of the UK financial straitjacket. Such a project would be transformative for towns such as Newtown St Boswells and Hawick, to name but two.</p><p>Returning to those who carp from the sidelines, I come to John Lamont, who was here earlier to intervene in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s speech, but who I see has disappeared. On 7 October, in the Hawick News, he compared the project to the Edinburgh trams, and claimed that</p><p>&#8220;Hawick taxpayers must not be left to pick up the tab for a Galashiels railway.&#8221;</p><p>With great respect, that is a clear misrepresentation of the funding model. Mr Lamont, and other members in the chamber, may wish to note that he is rapidly getting a reputation as being guilty of&#8212;to quote the CBR; Claudia Beamish also heard this at its annual general meeting&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;riding two horses at the same time&#8221;.</p><p>On the one hand, we are given ill-informed diatribes about the project. John Lamont claimed to pupils from Berwickshire high school on these very premises that the delivery of the project was taking money away from schools in the Borders, the A1, the A68, the A7 and much else. That is, to be frank, misleading nonsense, and he should know that, but sometimes I question whether he does. I assure members in the chamber that the pupils are wiser to that now.</p><p>On the other hand, the pity for Mr Lamont is that his own party leader has expressed verbal support for the project to Campaign for Borders Rail office-bearers, as was reported at the AGM. It is clear that the Tory leader does not believe her party whip, and quite rightly so.</p><p>I am delighted that the Scottish Government is showing the ambition that is distinctly lacking from the UK Government, which proposes only half-hearted attempts to extend high-speed rail north of the midlands. Meanwhile, the UK Government is prepared to find billions for the two-week-long Olympic games and the London cross-rail projects.</p><p>I have read of the criticism from some members&#8212;and heard today in the chamber from others&#8212;that the infrastructure investment plan does not include small-scale projects at a local level. I, too, regard those as vital, but it is clear that there been a misunderstanding of the plan&#8217;s remit. It specifically does not cover projects of less than &#163;20 million in value, as is stated on page 5, and there is a clear intent to refresh the strategic transport projects review in early 2012.</p><p>With smaller projects in mind, I thank the transport minister, Keith Brown, who has shown a keen interest in meeting with RAGES members and local MSPs to discuss proposals for the reintroduction of local services on the east coast main line to Berwick, with investment in new stations at Reston in Berwickshire and East Linton in East Lothian. I look forward to welcoming him on his visit to meet the community and council representatives at both sites, and I encourage him to visit the town of Eyemouth to gain a full understanding of the potential of such a modest investment to regenerate the town and the surrounding communities.</p><p>Of course, while the cost of a capital project is relatively immovable, the extent to which the project can deliver the desired outcomes is perhaps more variable. Those outcomes include enabling the switch from cars to rail and low-carbon transport. I therefore draw the attention of the cabinet secretary and the minister to the concept of community rail partnerships. In a recent presentation to the Campaign for Borders Rail AGM, the Association of Community Rail Partnerships&#8212;which currently does not cover Scotland, although it is keen to do so&#8212;highlighted the impact of such partnerships on securing increased patronage for routes. In some cases, they can boost passenger numbers on a route by as much as 25 per cent, through a modest investment of approximately &#163;30,000 per annum, which is the cost of employing a local rail development officer for a route. They typically do what the rail operators fail to do, which is to identify, scope and market to new market segments, and exploit those opportunities. In the case of Borders rail, that could include charter traffic and tourist traffic to Abbotsford.</p><p>That would be hugely beneficial to the likely success of rail projects such as those in the Borders and I commend such mechanisms to the ministers to ensure that the economic impact of rail projects is maximised. I support the Government motion and welcome the infrastructure investment plan.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657655", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Infrastructure Investment Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will declare interests in respect of some of the subjects that I shall discuss.

We know that benefit cuts and contracting public sector employment will have a direct impact on sales in shops and on general economic activity and will therefore continue to depress consumer spending, as will the 3.2 per cent average increase in pension contributions, as we heard during the debate last week. On Willie Rennie&#8217;s point about pensions, the 5.2 per cent increase is linked to the consumer prices index. There might be a generous cash increase, but it will be wiped out by inflation.</p><p>The UK Government seems hellbent on curtailing investment in sectors such as oil and gas, given its &#163;2 billion tax raid. How will such an approach reduce energy prices for consumers in the longer term? The U-turn on carbon capture and storage will also depress investment in the private sector. Meanwhile, the failure of quantitative easing and project Merlin to encourage greater bank lending is increasingly clear. The announcement of credit-easing measures to release funding for small and medium-sized enterprises was welcome, but it is probably too little, too late.</p><p>Government spending is, of course, a key area and we have influence over that. As Scotland has no scope to borrow, the Scottish economy will suffer the full effects of the UK Government cut to the block grant&#8212;both the cut in resource and the 32 per cent cut to the capital budget. That is having a profound impact on consumer and business confidence and is adding fuel to the fire created by uncertainty over the systemic risk to the banking sector posed by the euro zone crisis.</p><p>It seems that George Osborne has pinned all on trade and exports. Although there have been some marked successes in expanding Scotland&#8217;s exports of food and drink&#8212;especially Scotch whisky, on which we have had some very welcome news&#8212;other markets are clearly depressed. There was some reason for optimism initially, but the downturn in key European markets could place a drag on growth in Scotland and we are already seeing business confidence drop. Across most components of demand, unless the UK changes tack&#8212;and fundamentally so&#8212;we face continued downward pressures.</p><p>George Osborne offers only a limited loosening of capital budgets but, crucially, two thirds of the new capital investment will not be available until 2013 or later, despite the urgent need for stimulus this year and next, and we do not, as others have said, have the detail yet on transfer of resource to capital spend, so the overall impact is unknown at this stage. By contrast, despite a brutal cut of 32 per cent in Scotland&#8217;s capital budget this year, the Scottish Government, through its own switch from resource to capital and through the &#163;2.5 billion NPD programme operated by the Scottish Futures Trust, will support around &#163;9 billion of capital spending over the next three years to deliver schools, hospitals, houses, roads, water infrastructure and much else.

I, too, very much welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s infrastructure investment plan, which provides crucial support for employment.

I have every confidence that that will be the case, but to see one example of where Con-Dem policies harm Scotland at the moment, we need look no further than fuel duty. The cost of fuel has increased by about 16 per cent since the Con-Dems came to office in 2010. That has led to increased financial pressure on farmers and hauliers. It has increased the cost of delivering public services, such as public transport, emergency services and many health and social service activities, which rely on transport. Crucially, the higher cost of fuel has taken money out of families&#8217; pockets and constrained high street spending. It has driven price inflation in productive sectors, as the cost of getting goods to market has increased substantially, and it has hit tourism, as it has become more expensive for tourists from the rest of the UK, Ireland and continental Europe to visit Scotland, particularly those areas that are ill served by public transport.

I have taken the time to visit the Met Office in Edinburgh to see the predictions of its models and I encourage other members to do so. After hearing from the team there, I am convinced that fundamental changes in climate are already in train and that, if we are to blunt their impact, we must act now to limit global temperature rises to 2&#176;C if at all possible.</p><p>If we fail to act, we will literally reap the wind. Not only will there be more frequent extreme weather events, but there will be greater pressure on global food and water supplies in the form of mass migrations driven by changing climates. The human cost of the increased incidence of what we currently regard as tropical illnesses should also not be underestimated.</p><p>As many members have said, developing countries are the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change. By 2020, up to 250 million people in Africa could be exposed to greater risk of water stress, and up to 1 billion people in Asia are thought to be at risk of water shortages by 2050. Some small island states, many of which are Commonwealth member states, face the possibility of complete inundation.</p><p>By 2030, developing countries will require between $28 billion and $67 billion in funds to enable them to adapt to climate change. That equates to 0.2 to 0.8 per cent of global investment flows or only 0.06 to 0.21 per cent of projected global GDP.</p><p>In central and south Asia, crop yields are predicted to fall by up to 30 per cent. Reduced crop yields in tropical areas will lead to an increased risk of hunger and climate-sensitive diseases. They will also put at risk Scotland&#8217;s food security and cause rising food prices in our shops. Although the impact is likely to be locally severe elsewhere in the world, it will affect us all&#8212;even those who have their heads in the sand, such as Lord Krebs, who was mentioned earlier.</p><p>We have a responsibility to address those global issues. Global CO2 levels, as measured by the World Meteorological Organization, have risen to 389ppm&#8212;the highest level recorded since 1750. There is also a worrying upward trend: 2009&#8217;s increase of 2.3ppm was considerably higher than the increases experienced in previous decades.</p><p>Globally, climate change is posing real threats, mainly to many smaller developing nations that are relatively poorly resourced to tackle them, but also to many of our major trading partners. One of those small states is the Maldives and, in December 2009, Scotland&#8217;s First Minister Alex Salmond and the President of the Maldives pledged to work together to tackle the impact of global warming. The Maldives, which lie off the coast of the Indian subcontinent, are made up of nearly 1,200 small islands, none of which is more than 2m or 6ft above sea level. As a result, the country is particularly vulnerable to the sort of rise in sea level associated with global warming.</p><p>When the South Australia Government awarded the First Minister the South Australia international climate change leadership award, it said&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Nations Climate Summit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to support the Government&#8217;s motion.

As Neil Findlay and Roderick Campbell said, public sector staff earn modest pensions. The reality is that the vast majority of public sector workers provide services in the full knowledge that they will never come anywhere close to the earnings of local authority or NHS board chief executive officers.</p><p>The myth of excesses and largesse is widespread among commentators and policy makers alike. The question that must be asked and which still requires an answer is this: why does the UK Government, in order to fund deficit reduction, continue to pursue damaging reforms to public sector pensions, which will, in effect, cut workers&#8217; pay by an extra 3.2 per cent?</p><p>In the face of &#163;3.3&#160;billion of cuts that Westminster has passed down for the spending review period, the SNP Government has done all that it can to protect the pensions of people who work in the public sector. The Scottish Government has faced difficult decisions and, despite all the odds, John Swinney has managed to find the necessary balance to maintain jobs across the public sector and not to add to the burdens on Scottish families.</p><p>The Scottish Government has reluctantly had to ask public sector workers to accept another year of frozen pay. Ministers have led the way by freezing their own wages for the past four years. I wish that things were different for people across Scotland whose wages are not increasing in line with inflation but, as the Finance Committee has heard, the pay freeze is essential to maintain staff levels and to fight off the spectre of mass unemployment.</p><p>I have several questions for the Conservatives to answer in summing up. How many people do the Tories expect to walk away from public sector pensions as a result of the 3.2&#160;per&#160;cent cut to their pay? How many will move into the private sector? How will that affect the pension schemes&#8217; viability and sustainability? Do the Tories accept that, in each of the past five years, Scotland&#8217;s spending on pensions as a share of gross domestic product has been lower than that of the UK? In 2009-10, Scotland&#8217;s figure was 15.1&#160;per&#160;cent, versus 15.7&#160;per&#160;cent for the UK as a whole. That means that pension schemes in an independent Scotland would be in a much better position.</p><p>Which of the following do the Tories believe have helped to support families through the recession? Is it the VAT increase, the national insurance increase, petrol price increases or significant pension contribution increases? Where does Danny Alexander&#8217;s rather tactless letter to the Scottish Government&#8212;in which he threatened to remove &#163;8.4&#160;million a month from the block grant if the contribution changes were not imposed without any meaningful consultation&#8212;fit into Cameron&#8217;s respect agenda? That amounts to a threat of &#163;550&#160;million in cuts over the spending review period to 2015.</p><p>As I said, we are seeing drastic reforms to disability living allowance, housing benefits and public pensions. The UK Government seems to be hell-bent on a ruthless ideological agenda. The truth is that every worker who provides a service on which others rely&#8212;whether in the public or private sector&#8212;is essential to the commonweal and to the economy. No one will dispute that the private sector is a creator of wealth and jobs, but its importance as a wealth creator cannot be viewed in isolation: teachers educate the nation&#8217;s workforce, and nurses and doctors treat employees who fall ill.</p><p>Mary Scanlon&#8217;s motion refers to &#8220;the burden&#8221; of pensions &#8220;on taxpayers&#8221;, but perhaps of greater concern is the growing burden of unemployment benefit as a consequence both of disastrous economic mismanagement by successive UK Governments, and of Tory cuts to public spending at any price to society. It should be clear to all public sector workers that only if they embrace independence for Scotland can they rid themselves for good of Tory dogma and of the slash-and-burn approach to funding our services.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655002", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The first part of Mary Scanlon&#8217;s motion is welcome in that it stresses the value of the public sector.

We paid a heavy price in Scottish lives. Many thousands also returned with horrific injuries and, as Elaine Murray said, post-traumatic stress disorders.</p><p>It is easy to view this discussion and the events in remembrance week through the prism of history. Quite rightly at this time of year, we look back and remember the hundreds of thousands of men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice during times of conflict. However, the consequences of war continue to present society with enormous problems long after the artillery has fallen silent. There is every bit as much need for support for veterans who are returning from present-day conflicts, as Keith Brown and Richard Simpson outlined. My cousin, who is a Territorial Army serviceman, recently returned from Afghanistan, so the issue is very much a present-day one for me.</p><p>Out of respect for the work that such men and women do on our behalf, it is our duty to support them in the countless challenges that they face. I am sure that all members will agree that we as a Parliament have an obligation to support our veterans and their families in whatever ways we can within our devolved responsibilities. Although there might be disagreements about the legitimacy of conflicts past and present, there is almost uniform support for the troops, who conduct themselves with great professionalism and courage.</p><p>It would be churlish to engage in party-political posturing at this time, but I would suggest that although the UK coalition Government is not intentionally creating problems for our veterans, there is a risk that some veterans, particularly those with disabilities, will suffer as a consequence of the reforms to the welfare system. I urge the UK Government to reflect on the impact of those reforms on veterans in particular and, where required, to reverse any decisions that will make life more difficult for the military men and women who have given us so much through their service.</p><p>I am pleased that the Scottish Government welcomes and fully endorses the military covenant. I am sure that the Parliament will welcome the written answer that the minister gave Nanette Milne earlier this year, which set out the details of a new strategy to support veterans and their families, which will be announced next spring.</p><p>The armed forces have traditionally formed an important part of the social fabric of the South Scotland region, which I represent. Indeed, 16 per cent of all Scotland&#8217;s armed forces pensioners live in that region. In the Borders alone, there are 695 registered armed forces pensioners and each year there is a constant flow of new pensioners&#8212;there have been 50 new armed forces discharges in the Borders in the past 12 months.</p><p>Veterans affairs remain a reserved matter in many ways, but the initiatives that the Scottish Government has taken in devolved areas are tremendously helpful; indeed, they are essential steps in the right direction and towards completing the package of care and support that we owe our servicemen and women. I will not go over in detail the various means by which we support veterans, which others have mentioned, but the veterans fund and the extension of the low-cost initiative for first-time buyers have been very helpful. The support to combat stress is of particular benefit. I note that Combat Stress has said that it is supporting 18 veterans in the Borders, but that is very much just the tip of the iceberg, because there are many more who do not come forward for support.</p><p>Liz Smith touched on employability, which I hope we will discuss in further detail in the CPG. We have to do more as a country to support veterans back into work. In many cases, veterans have to deal with mental health disorders or indeed difficulties in adjusting from an institutional environment back to civvy street. We can do much more to recognise the undoubted transferable skills that veterans have, such as their discipline, reliability, ability to work as part of a team and ability to use their initiative in stressful situations. Those are all important transferable skills that the labour market should value. We can do much more to recognise and enhance those skills, to ensure that veterans gain valuable employment.</p><p>We as a society owe our veterans so much. I am very proud that this Parliament and the Scottish Government have recognised the debt that we owe and I hope to play my part, through the CPG led by Alex Fergusson, in ensuring that we do all that we can to address the challenges that our veterans face.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the cross-party group for armed forces veterans, I welcome the debate and certainly welcome its bipartisan nature.

It should shame us all as politicians that in 21st century Scotland far too many people still have little opportunity to achieve their potential&#8212;we share that characteristic with other parts of these isles. Often those individuals are dismissed as failures when, in truth, it is previous generations of politicians who have failed them.</p><p>For far too many young people and their parents, life is a struggle and there is little real hope on the horizon to spark and fuel their ambition. Sadly, our young people can have their life outcomes determined at birth by where they live rather than by their own inherent talents and potential. As Save the Children has stated, breaking the link between growing up in poverty and poor educational outcomes is vital to achieving the goal of raising attainment and ambition for all our young people.</p><p>If we as a Parliament are serious about doing that, I invite everyone in the chamber to welcome and support the Scottish Government&#8217;s initiatives in relation to the Scottish futures fund. In particular, I welcome two elements of the fund. First, the youth talent fund will encourage the very best of talent in all parts of the country. It represents an investment in young people of &#163;50 million, which will help to widen opportunities in the arts and creative apprenticeship programmes for the young, where job opportunities in their area do not match their generation&#8217;s enormous talent and ability. Secondly, the sure start fund, which will also receive &#163;50 million, has at its heart a determination to transform the life chances of thousands of newborn Scots. The SFF therefore includes commitments to provide financial support for young people right through from birth to adulthood.</p><p>The Scottish Government has signalled a decisive shift towards preventative spending measures, which are about investing now to save money and reduce negative social outcomes later. Those measures will be of particular benefit to Scotland&#8217;s young people. In giving evidence to the Finance Committee yesterday, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Centre for Public Policy for Regions supported that shift and praised the Government for that brave decision. That is a view shared by the Labour MP for Nottingham North, Graham Allen MP, who stated in his evidence to the Finance Committee:</p><p>&#8220;As for where the balance lies, I do not wish to flatter the committee, but Scotland has achieved a much better balance than England.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 28 September 2011; c 105.]</p><p>I believe that Parliament should echo those sentiments and I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s wider investments in and commitments to young people. Some have been mentioned already: the spending review will fund a record number of 125,000 modern apprenticeships over the next five years; Angela Constance has mentioned the activity agreements; and the Government&#8217;s &#8220;Putting Learners at the Centre&#8221; paper, published in September, reaffirms the Scottish National Party&#8217;s commitment to young people. We have a long-standing commitment to do everything we can to lessen the risk and harm of unemployment for young people.</p><p>I know all colleagues across the chamber will also recognise the importance of Scotland&#8217;s colleges in delivering the training and skills to help our young people fulfil their ambition. Clearly, in these difficult times, the Scottish Government has been forced to make some difficult decisions, which I acknowledge will be a challenge for the sector. However, the college sector has always been a can-do sector and I hope that by enhancing existing interregional collaboration the colleges will rise to that challenge.</p><p>In light of Ken Macintosh&#8217;s animated intervention earlier on college sector funding, I want to expand on a point I made in the Finance Committee yesterday, when we heard from representatives of the CPPR and the RSE. It is true that over the period from 2011-12 to 2014-15, there will be a 13.6 per cent decrease in college sector funding in cash terms in Scotland&#8212;that is, a reduction from &#163;545 million to &#163;471 million&#8212;but the comparable decrease in funding for the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s spending in England&#8217;s college sector is from &#163;4.3 billion to &#163;3.2 billion, or a fall of 25 per cent in cash terms, even before allowing for the impact of inflation. In other words, the fall in spending on the college sector in England is almost double that in Scotland, despite an implied 25 per cent Barnett consequential.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Raising Attainment and Ambition (Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although members around the chamber might disagree about the means by which to achieve this, we as parliamentarians are all motivated by our strong desire to ensure that our beloved Scotland can be the best country that it possibly can be and a land of opportunity for all who live here.

I am hopeful that the debate will register a cross-party desire for a change of heart on the part of the UK Government. The UK Government&#8217;s current proposals will leave a gaping hole in local TV coverage in a region that, as Christine Grahame said, most needs such coverage.</p><p>In February 2009, as a result of the merger with Tyne Tees Television, some 51 of the 64 staff at Border TV were made redundant, which drastically reduced capacity to cover local news and current affairs and created the gaping hole to which I referred. I do not want to imply criticism of the quality or professionalism of the remaining ITV Borders staff&#8212;the quality of what they do is high, but there is simply too little of it and they are underresourced.</p><p>There is no doubt that the amount of content of relevance to the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway has fallen substantially, so much so that a recent broadcast of &#8220;Lookaround&#8221; focused almost entirely on findings from the inquiry into the death of Raoul Moat&#8212;admittedly an important issue for the Tyne Tees part of the catchment but of little relevance to the Borders, and still less to Dumfries and Galloway.</p><p>The recent election debates debacle to which Christine Grahame referred showed that our needs in the south are subsidiary to those of the majority in north-east England and Cumbria. It adds insult to injury that an England international football friendly was shown instead. As members can imagine, that was not too popular in Selkirk.</p><p>The argument that the later screening, at quarter to midnight, had a similar market share of the audience, at around 7 per cent, ignores a huge drop in audience between peak viewing and midnight. Christine Grahame was right to highlight that.</p><p>My discussion with executives at ITV Tyne Tees and Border at the time revealed that due to the digital switchover, the ability to broadcast different programmes simultaneously had been lost and that to restore it would require significant investment. The loss of that functionality is simply not good enough.</p><p>We regularly suffer broadcasts of irrelevant current affairs content, without sufficient clarification that England-only policies do not apply here. The need for change is compelling. I strongly support Christine Grahame&#8217;s motion. However, I also strongly urge the UK culture secretary and Ofcom to create a Scottish national channel 3 licence when the current licence runs out in 2014.</p><p>Based on discussion with STV executives, I am confident that such a licence would see STV or its successor investing in enhanced local output.

This decision could only have been made by people stuck in London offices who fail to understand the importance of regional news and diversity.&#8221;</p><p>That was said by Michael Moore MP. Given that he expressed that view to Andy Burnham when in opposition, I hope that we will have a response from Michael Moore on the current situation, because he obviously made a very good case for devolving broadcast powers to Scotland in that statement.

None of that information could be passed to me by my parents directly; instead, I gained it through my school and, in the main, by studying outside of school, because the curriculum did not cover a lot about Scotland or even my local area. Aside from a brief period on the Roman invasion, medieval Scotland and the wars of independence, most of what I learned at school was about British history and, to a degree, international history such as the French revolution, the Crimean war and other major world events.</p><p>My fondest memories of school are of history lessons although, unfortunately, I had to give history up at the end of second year due to a clash in the curriculum. I very much welcome the concept that Scottish studies might be woven through the curriculum in various different areas, so that children will be exposed to Scottish history, culture and literature as they go through their schooling and they will not have to leave it all to the choice of their parents whether they have access to a discrete subject.</p><p>I also loved geography. With all the debate about the future of Scotland and renewable energy and some of the dubious claims about wind turbines altering the nature of the landscape, it would do us all some good to reflect on the fact that most of the landscape that we see today is to a degree man-made and influenced by man.

I do not think that that degree of explanation is provided in the current curriculum.</p><p>The teaching of Scottish studies has an important role to play in workforce development for key sectors such as tourism. If we can improve the experience of tourists who visit this country so that they come across people who have an understanding of the areas around them&#8212;so that there are 5.2&#160;million people who can give advice about a local attraction&#8212;that will be a great enhancement to our offering to the world.</p><p>We need to bear it in mind that we are equipping our population to be more confident as well. If people know where they are coming from, they have more confidence in where they are going as individuals and as a country.</p><p>The teaching of Scottish studies is about ensuring that a new generation of Scots know more about their country. In the course of their studies, every child growing up in Scotland learns of the many great inventions that we have given to the world. As Clare Adamson mentioned, it would be much easier to inspire children in subjects such as science if they knew about the many people who came from a similar background and made a significant breakthrough in science, medicine or engineering. It is not a question of teaching people just about battles, the treaty of union and various other historic events; it is about teaching them about how society has developed and the influence that Scots have had on that society over the years.</p><p>Exploring history can reveal interesting parallels to today. English parliamentary records of 1606 show that, when a project of union between Scotland and England was being debated in the House of Commons in London, the opposing party pointed out:</p><p>&#8220;If we admit them&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>the Scots&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;into our liberties, we shall be overrun with them ... witness the multiplicities of the Scots in Polonia.&#8221;</p><p>That was a reference to Poland&#8212;my colleague John Finnie alluded to that issue, too. If we educate people about the history of migrations of Scots to the rest of the world, we can perhaps deal with some of the ignorance and prejudice shown towards those migrating to Scotland today. At that point, some 30,000 families were accepted to have settled in Poland&#8212;possibly more than 100,000 people if their children were there too. That is confirmed by various texts from the early 20th century.</p><p>Thus, many people in Polish towns such as Danzig or Gdansk perhaps owe their ancestry to those Scots who moved there as mercenaries or merchants in the 16th century. That information can play an important part in equipping our schoolchildren today with knowledge of the nature of Scottish society and how our society has influenced other countries, which will perhaps deal with some of the ignorance that still pervades among the adult population about the nature of migrants to Scotland today.</p><p>I will give one last example of why I think that it is important to deal with history. In the south of Scotland, which the Presiding Officer will be familiar with, it is often misunderstood that Scots, or the language of the Angles, was the first language. There was certainly no Gaelic down there, but there was a Welsh-speaking community many centuries before the Angles invaded from the east and the Scots invaded from the north.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652307", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Studies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hear what the member says, but I have to disagree.

As members might be aware, on 14 October 1881, there was a great fishing disaster off the east coast of Scotland. The day is known locally as black Friday, because 189 fishermen lost their lives off the coast of Berwickshire and East Lothian. From Eyemouth alone, 129 fishermen died, leaving 92 widows and 263 fatherless children. The men sailed that day despite dire warnings from the fisher king, Willie Spears, who was a famous man from Eyemouth, and utter disaster followed with a perfect storm engulfing them. It took more than 100 years for the population of Eyemouth to recover, but it was still an important fishing port in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>The significance of the fishing industry to the region and to Eyemouth is reflected in the annual herring queen festival in the town. Tragically, though, as I will discuss further later, no herring at all are landed in Eyemouth today. Graeme Dey referred to the substantial decline since 1998 in the pelagic and demersal fleets. I will focus on Eyemouth to give members a sense of how serious the decline in fishing has been at local level. In 2010, there were just 105 vessels in Eyemouth and district, which is down from 133 in 1990 and 164 in 1980. As recently as 1990, there were estimated to be 75 to 80 vessels using Eyemouth. At a recent meeting with representatives of the fishing sector in Eyemouth before the election, at which Richard Lochhead was present, we were told that an estimated 20 to 24 vessels now use Eyemouth. That puts in perspective the sheer collapse in the number of vessels using what was, and still is locally, an important resource.</p><p>By 2010, just 193 fishermen were left in the whole of Eyemouth and district, which extends well beyond Berwickshire and goes up into the Lothians, including North Berwick, Dunbar and other ports. As Claudia Beamish said, only 148 of those fishermen are full time. That is a decline from 1980, when there were 591 fishermen in the area. That puts in perspective the sheer collapse in the scale of the local industry, which has profound impacts not only on the community of Eyemouth, but on the local fish processing sector, which is entirely dependent on fish being landed in the harbour or being brought to the harbour by road to sustain its activities.</p><p>By 2010, a &#163;5.5 million catch was landed in Eyemouth and district, of which &#163;5.4 million was in shellfish. Of that, &#163;1.4 million was lobsters, and &#163;3.2 million was nephrops&#8212;mainly Norwegian langoustine, which are principally sold to Europe. Although it is a lucrative market that is a dramatic change from past days.</p><p>No herring are landed in Eyemouth now. In fact, on the pelagic side, a total of 25 tonnes of mackerel were landed in 2010. There is virtually no pelagic catch. Haddock and demersal catch was down from 1,123 tonnes at the beginning of the decade to just 103 tonnes by 2010. To highlight the impact of the CFP, I note that 5,952 tonnes of demersal fish were landed in Eyemouth and district in 1980. The pelagic catch was only 2 tonnes in that year because, as other members have said, the herring catch was stopped in the 1970s. Shellfish catch has increased slightly from 1,512 tonnes to 1,902.</p><p>In the 1970s, there was the following description of Eyemouth:</p><p>&#8220;By this time, there were relatively few large markets concentrated in the major fishing harbours ... Eyemouth is the most important fishing centre in the southeast of Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>By the 1980s, that had been downgraded to:</p><p>&#8220;Eyemouth is the largest base for the South East of Scotland fleet.&#8221;</p><p>By the 1990s, Eyemouth is described as</p><p>&#8220;the largest fishing port, in terms of catch volume and value, along the Scottish east coast south of Aberdeen.&#8221;</p><p>Anyone looking at Eyemouth today would struggle to define the town in those terms. In the past year, we have lost four boats, and we are down to about 20 boats. The decline continues apace.</p><p>Like Claudia Beamish, I very much welcome the recognition by WWF Scotland, RSPB Scotland and other environmental bodies of not only the conservation dimension to the debate but the economic value of the sector. Indeed, WWF stresses that it needs</p><p>&#8220;to ensure that the reform improves the health of Scottish seas and the long-term profitability of the fishing industry&#8221;.</p><p>It is often portrayed as being a black-and-white debate, with conservationists versus fishermen, but the conservation bodies recognise that it is no longer that simple and that there is mutual interest in preserving fishing stocks and, as Rod Campbell indicated, ensuring that there is a viable fleet for the future.</p><p>I hope that members recognise the profound scale of impact of the CFP. It has been worse for the area of Eyemouth than the perfect storm of 1881.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On that, we have common cause.

On page 18 is set out the following target:</p><p>&#8220;To match the growth rate of the small independent EU countries by 2017.&#8221;</p><p>Scotland, within the union that is the UK, has suffered a recession that&#8212;although it was hugely damaging&#8212;was shorter and shallower than the recession in the UK as a whole. Gavin Brown said that there is no evidence for that, but the chart on page 26 of the strategy document clearly shows the evidence.</p><p>Whereas between 1976 and 2006 there was a 0.4 per cent performance gap between Scotland and the UK in relation to growth, since 2007 the gap has fallen to 0 per cent. Why is that? Scotland has a degree of autonomy. It does not have nearly as much autonomy as my SNP colleagues and I would like it to have, but it has sufficient autonomy to allow for limited variance from a damaging UK strategy of spending cuts. Capital spending has been accelerated in areas such as infrastructure and housing, which have provided a buffer against damaging decline in the construction sector. Employment in the construction sector was up almost 12 per cent in the year to quarter 1 2011, compared with a small decline in the UK as a whole. Of course, infrastructure investment also contributes to raising the long-term sustainable economic growth rate, so such spending benefits our long-term growth.</p><p>UK employment levels have flatlined, whereas in Scotland there has been more substantial growth in the past year. As colleagues have said, we now have lower unemployment than the rest of the UK. That is a consequence of measures such as the small business bonus scheme and targeting investment by the private sector in areas such as renewables, as well as the different strategy of phasing public spending reductions, particularly in relation to capital investment. The economic strategy makes it clear that private investment is also to be encouraged.</p><p>Scotland has a competitive advantage derived from natural resources, with 25 per cent of the wind power capacity of the whole of Europe and 10 per cent of its wave power capacity, as well as academic and engineering expertise. We know that if the path set out in the renewable energy route map is followed, the renewable energy sector could support up to 130,000 jobs by 2020, many of them in engineering .</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s proposal for opportunities for all, the detail of which Mike Russell has published today. It guarantees those aged 16 to 19 who are not in employment, education or training a place in education or training and it includes the benefits of up to 125,000 modern apprenticeships over this session of Parliament. That will help to prevent a lost generation as a consequence of the economic downturn.</p><p>However, some challenges must be met to ensure that those opportunities are taken up successfully in rural areas, such as the south of Scotland. In the Borders, there was a good take-up in 2010-11, but it was perhaps below what we might have expected on a pro rata basis. In part, that arises from a perceived difficulty in stimulating demand for apprenticeships among SMEs. There are also some issues to do with land-based, construction and care courses, where there may need to be a degree of flexibility regarding the age of students and trainees due to health and safety concerns, age restrictions, insurance issues and the minimum threshold for some courses to be accredited. However, I am confident that some flexibility can be applied on the age issue and that other measures on the enterprise front will assist with rural SME engagement with modern apprenticeships, including the proposals set out in our manifesto to allow modern apprenticeships to be shared by businesses and to encourage them to undertake business plans.</p><p>On investment, like other members I am heartened that the capital spend will be prioritised to maximise the impact on jobs.</p><p>I welcome the focus on growth companies, markets and sectors. Promoting growth in Scottish exports in growth markets, such as China, India and other emerging nations, will be particularly important for the development of sectors such as food and drink, tourism and, of course, engineering with regard to renewable energy. Those are all sectors in which Scotland has a competitive advantage and acknowledged industry expertise.</p><p>I also welcome the proposed strengthening of levels of innovation and commercialisation and of linkages between knowledge providers and the private sector. While progress is being made, I hope that a particular focus is applied to enable growth in investment in this area in sectors of great importance to rural Scotland, such as food and drink, where we have traditionally not done so well on research and development and innovation, and also to encourage knowledge providers in urban centres of excellence to seek to work with businesses in rural Scotland.</p><p>The continued emphasis on providing advice and support to help SMEs to grow, hire staff and take on apprenticeships is particularly welcome, as is provision for improving access to finance for SMEs. As a number of members have said, in the context of the public contracts Scotland procurement website, there is a need for SMEs to gain additional support in successfully winning contracts.</p><p>The continuation of the small business bonus scheme is particularly welcome and has had a massive impact in areas such as the Borders.</p><p>In my remaining time, I will comment on household and economic confidence. I stress the importance of the strategy of agreeing to freeze council tax as part of the social wage and asking for pay restraint from the public sector for two years but, in return, offering an easing of the tax burden and the introduction of universal benefits, such as free prescriptions, to offset some of the pressures on household budgets. In particular, I was delighted that a no compulsory redundancy deal was struck between the local authority and the unions in the Scottish Borders. That will enable the protection of jobs and will give confidence to consumers in the Borders and, I hope, other areas of Scotland that they can embark on their own personal and domestic investment decisions.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650703", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;The Government Economic Strategy&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I correct Tavish Scott&#8217;s comment about there being no growth targets in the economic strategy.

The main thing to highlight is the programme&#8217;s visual impact, as Willie Coffey rightly said. I was a neutral observer of the programme and I watched only one episode&#8212;that was enough for me&#8212;but I was struck by the frequent, low-angle shots from the gutter, which showed cans rolling around in the alleyways, and by the focus on graffiti. I thought that the approach was unhelpful and exacerbated the negativity of the programme.</p><p>The BBC sent us data about the viewing figures and made great claims about the programme&#8217;s popularity demonstrating how good a documentary it was. I interpret the figures slightly differently, The BBC said that the programme had 840,000 viewers on average, which was significantly more than is typical for programmes that are shown at that time of day, which usually attract 230,000 viewers. I congratulate the BBC; it generated a lot of viewing. However, if the BBC is right to suggest that the programme stimulated a debate, why was there a gap of 500,000 between the number of people who viewed the programme and the number of people who viewed the programme about the issues that followed? It is clear that 500,000 people watched the programme for reasons other than those that the BBC claimed.</p><p>There was a degree of exploitation&#8212;albeit perhaps unintended&#8212;of the people of Onthank for entertainment. Members who, like me, use Facebook regularly will have seen hundreds of negative posts about the residents in &#8220;The Scheme&#8221;. We can conclude only that the programme was about entertainment. It was a reality TV show; it was not genuinely about presenting serious issues for debate. I take Ruth Davidson&#8217;s point and I hope that she is right that a genuine debate about the issues will follow, but I suspect that half a million viewers of the programme did not think about the issues and simply enjoyed the programme for entertainment.</p><p>The BBC said:</p><p>&#8220;Concerns were raised around the graphic nature of certain scenes. However, the fact that some people were so shocked surely underlines the need to reveal and inform. Sometimes a powerful image can provoke more response and engagement than any number of words.&#8221;</p><p>That might be true. However, Willie Coffey is right; the BBC exploited negative aspects. For example, the issue to do with the state of the community centre building was presented in a way that almost suggested that the residents who were part of the group that was trying to restore the centre were going about things in a cack-handed way. When people turned up at the drop of a hat to see the person who was inspecting the building, the programme suggested that that was inappropriate.</p><p>Douglas Hamilton, head of Save the Children in Scotland, said:</p><p>&#8220;The only way to understand deprivation is to see it through the lives of those who experience it on a daily basis.&#8221;</p><p>I was disappointed by his comments about &#8220;The Scheme&#8221;, which failed to reflect the exploitative nature of the programme. As Margaret Burgess said, people who visit the estate realise that it is a pretty normal Scottish estate, but anyone who watched the programmes would draw anything other than that conclusion.</p><p>I support Willie Coffey&#8217;s motion and I hope that the BBC will reflect on the criticisms that have been made in the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649905", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;The Scheme&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome Willie Coffey&#8217;s bringing of the debate to the chamber.

The introduction to its &#8220;South of Scotland Competitiveness Strategy 2007-13&#8221; states:</p><p>&#8220;We have become accustomed to referring to ourselves in the South of Scotland as the &#8216;forgotten&#8217; or &#8216;hidden&#8217; part of Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>It is true that the region had largely been ignored. Although I am delighted that much progress has been made since 2007, there is still much to do. The cabinet secretary recognised that in his speech.</p><p>In the introduction to the competitiveness strategy, the alliance identified a number of key points in its approach to regional competitiveness. The document states on page 6 that the rural agenda is about</p><p>&#8220;Diversifying and growing the rural economy in its own right through focusing on growth as opposed to lifestyle businesses, and adding value to the primary assets, services and goods produced in our rural areas by: increasing focus and support on growth and economically significant companies in rural areas ... developing a complementary rural proposition to attract mobile investment&#8221;.</p><p>It will be key for us to develop a truly attractive proposition and address the deficiencies in rural broadband.</p><p>As the competitiveness strategy indicated, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders sit in an area between five key cities: Belfast, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Carlisle. That is an economic opportunity, but we are at a competitive disadvantage because we do not have a 21st century infrastructure.</p><p>Priority 6 of the strategy, which refers to building</p><p>&#8220;a ... high quality sustainable place to live, work and visit,&#8221;</p><p>recognises that there must be a focus on infrastructure such as broadband and the role that it can play in making market towns in the region more vibrant and dynamic, and that there must be support for the development of quality business locations that can compete on a level playing field with urban Scotland. It is important for areas such as the south of Scotland to deliver that kind of strategy and to focus on developing our key market towns. That should be regarded as complementing investment in the physical transport structure, which we have already debated in the current parliamentary session, and the two aspects should work together.</p><p>The Government report &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Digital Future: A Strategy for Scotland&#8221; was published in March. On rural economic growth, it stated:</p><p>&#8220;We recognise that good broadband connectivity is an enabler of economic growth in rural areas. However, we are aware that parts of rural Scotland are not able to exploit or benefit fully from digital opportunities.&#8221;</p><p>I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments about recognising the importance of that issue. It is worth reminding people that there has been investment in the pathfinder project to the tune of &#163;90 million, which has provided connectivity to more than 1,200 public sector sites&#8212;including schools, council offices and libraries&#8212;in seven local authority areas, including the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway.</p><p>The primary objective of the pathfinder project was to deliver high-quality, scalable broadband in order to improve significantly connectivity for Scotland&#8217;s most rural regions. As Elaine Murray acknowledged, the project has delivered high-quality bandwidth for public sector sites. However, I share her concern and perhaps criticism that to date it has not benefited the private sector, in particular the business community.</p><p>In that regard, there is the example of a business in Eyemouth; I will not name it, because I have not sought permission to do so. The business has a number of clients across Scotland and provides back-office call centre data storage for growing businesses. However, its growth is constrained because it can get only limited broadband speeds in Eyemouth. It has expressed its frustration that it has not been possible so far to make greater use of the pathfinder investment to allow the private sector access to the spare capacity that is not currently used.</p><p>I appreciate that procurement, contractual and state-aid issues intervene here and that it is not possible at this time to exploit that opportunity. However, the Scottish Government has announced that it will explore how the pathfinder south network may be utilised for the wider benefit of the community, which will certainly be of considerable value. I welcome the investment in Annan, which is in Elaine Murray&#8217;s constituency, of &#163;0.25 million to assess what can be done there.

I looked at the value of Norway&#8217;s oil fund in April this year and found that it was worth &#163;341 billion. The Norwegians allow themselves to use only 4 per cent of the fund annually, not only to protect its value but to avoid causing inflation in their economy by dumping too much cash into it in any one year.

I know that a number of local housing associations in the Borders are keen to collaborate to save money, share services and release funding for further capital development.

It was obvious that there was considerable mutual respect between the cabinet secretary and those he met, which I think was because the cabinet secretary, like half the Cabinet, represents rural areas. The Government has a high degree of interest in the needs of rural Scotland and a degree of trust has built up between the two.</p><p>During the election, we introduced a farming manifesto, which I am delighted will be implemented across South Scotland, because it is full of initiatives that will benefit agriculture and the associated food and drink sector in the region. Those key employment sectors will make a significant contribution to the regional economy.</p><p>However, I want to focus on the wider economy of rural Scotland. In Scotland as a whole, average house prices equate to approximately eight times median earnings. In areas such as Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire they are eight and a half times median earnings, which is slightly more than average, but in East Lothian they are 10 times median earnings. Population growth is high in those areas, as Helen Eadie mentioned. Scotland&#8217;s population increased by 2.4 per cent between 1999 and 2009. In Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire the increase was 3.5 per cent, and in East Lothian the increase was 10.2 per cent. We can see the link between migration and house prices.</p><p>Unfortunately, the increase in population is serving mainly to increase commuting traffic, given the low job density in those rural areas, and low gross value added, which indicates that the jobs that exist have relatively low productivity. That means that earnings are low, which contributes to people who live in those areas struggling to get on to the housing ladder, given that they face high heating bills and that the cost of travelling to work is high. There is a vicious cycle.</p><p>In areas such as Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire and East Lothian, a higher or similar percentage of school leavers enter higher education, but a lower proportion of occupations require graduate-level skills, which contributes either to underemployment for graduates who choose to stay in rural areas&#8212;they work in jobs that do not necessarily require graduate skills&#8212;or to their having to leave the area as part of an exodus to urban Scotland to find graduate-level employment. Therefore, having viable commuter transport options, which are in short supply in many areas of rural Scotland, are vital to enable people with graduate-level skills to access relevant job opportunities.</p><p>The health and sustainability of rural communities in the broadest sense will depend not only on the vital work that is being done to support the land-based sectors but on developing other sectors in the supply chains and diversifying the wider economy to generate the kind of jobs that will help to retain our young people and help them to have as good a quality of life as people living in urban Scotland.</p><p>Sarah Boyack referred to Scottish and UK Government cuts. I draw her attention to the fact that she failed to reflect on the Labour Party&#8217;s responsibility for generating the fiscal position that we now face. If rural services are being cut in response to that, the Labour Party should take some of the blame.</p><p>To address some of the issues in rural Scotland that I have mentioned in a more general sense, we need to seek a higher level of investment in research and development and innovation in rural areas. Many of our businesses are good businesses, but they are faced with competition from abroad, where there is a greater degree of investment and innovation in product design. To remain competitive, the gap between the level of research and development in rural Scotland and that in urban Scotland needs to close.</p><p>Sustainable transport will be a key tool in addressing some of the shortcomings that we face. I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to invest in the 21st century infrastructure of superfast broadband. That will be vital to enable sectors such as the knowledge sectors and professional services to develop in rural areas and to compete on a level playing field with their counterparts in the cities. Graeme Dey&#8217;s example of a wedding photography business showed the kind of challenges that service sector companies face.</p><p>Cities will always benefit from economies of scale, by virtue of the fact that they have greater concentrations of population, but it would be great to see rural Scotland close the gap and to see vibrant rural economies. Mark McDonald, who is no longer in the chamber, made a good point about the need to ensure the vibrancy of local economic areas.</p><p>In this debate, I want Parliament not just to focus on the traditional remit of the rural affairs department and the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, but to take a wider view of generating the economic opportunities that will provide a sustainable future for all in rural areas, not just those working in land-based sectors.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649004", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Rural Affairs and the Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A couple of months ago, I campaigned with the cabinet secretary in the Borders and introduced him to representatives of the local fishing sector, local farmers and local seafood producers.

Along with a number of our colleagues, I attended an SFT briefing this week in which it was made clear that there will be a &#163;14 billion gap in capital spending in Scotland as a result of the budget allocation from Westminster in forthcoming years, and the implications that that will have for the Scottish Government&#8217;s capital planning were outlined.</p><p>The Scottish Futures Trust has been engaged in the delivery of a number of projects, and members&#8212;not least the cabinet secretary&#8212;have mentioned the savings that the programme has delivered, including on the Forth crossing. The programme includes &#163;2.5 billion-worth of projects and is allied to efforts to deliver greater efficiency in delivery of projects and procurement savings. That is one means of delivering local authority and central Government investment projects at a better price and, through regional hubs, delivering a better bang for our bucks than has been delivered in the past.</p><p>However, there is no disguising the scale of a &#163;14 billion gap. The considerable effort that the SFT has made will not go far enough to deliver all the projects that we would like to see delivered in Scotland or to address some of the issues that my colleague Mike MacKenzie raised concerning the crumbling roads in many parts of rural Scotland.</p><p>I mention the SFT in the context of the fact that the Government has asked for a framework for borrowing powers that recognises that we should have greater freedom to borrow, but within the constraints of prudence. The SFT is a good example of how the Scottish Government and the Parliament are already delivering capital projects in a prudent manner. I hope that that prudence will be evidence that will allow the UK Government to trust the Scottish people and the Scottish Parliament to a greater degree than is presently demonstrated.</p><p>I will skip over the benefits of capital spending, as others have made that point well. However, I reiterate that capital spending is undertaken to deliver long-term sustainable returns. Clearly, long-term sustainable projects should not be funded from present spending and current budgets. We need to think much more clearly about how we fund such projects. As Mike MacKenzie said, borrowing is the sensible route by which to deliver them. That is preferable to proceeding on a pay-as-you-go basis, which is the constraint that we currently face.</p><p>I will focus in the main on revenue borrowing. The Scottish Parliament has often been described as a pocket-money Parliament. According to the most recent GERS report, we currently contribute roughly &#163;55 billion in tax receipts. The current DEL for Scotland is slightly more than half that figure. It is not the case that Scotland does not generate income&#8212;it is about where the income goes and how much of it comes back to us. Clearly, we have the capability as a country to sustain a level of borrowing well in excess of the current proposal of &#163;2.2 billion.</p><p>If the income tax proposals that the current Scotland Bill suggests had been implemented back in 1999, they would have resulted in Scotland having a cumulative shortfall of &#163;8 billion between 2001-02 and 2010-11. In her speech, Maureen Watt mentioned that the most recent GERS report indicated an income tax drop of more than &#163;500 million, which is in excess of the Scottish Government&#8217;s capability to borrow under the bill to fund any short-term shortfall.</p><p>I am concerned that the proposals in the Scotland Bill are entirely dependent on the Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s forecasts for tax receipts, which are crucial. There would be a reconciliation exercise 12 months later, to see to what extent there had been a shortfall or an overcommitment by the Government. In effect, there is provision for borrowing to offset the inaccuracy of the OBR&#8217;s projections, because we will be entirely dependent on the accuracy of its forecasts. That is not the same as borrowing to cope with the effects of the economic cycle, which is what borrowing should be about. The irony is that the Scotland Bill as currently constituted would not allow the Scottish Government to borrow to offset the impact of a temporary fall in tax revenue that was forecast by the OBR. In effect, we will be able to borrow only to deal with the inaccuracy of the original forecast. Given that the UK Government has been habitually overoptimistic in its projection of tax receipts, the annual limit and the total of &#163;500 million will clearly be insufficient.</p><p>As I am running out of time, I will focus on a couple of the comparisons that have been mentioned. Members have already referred to the example of parish councils. However, as someone who comes from Northern Ireland, I find it ironic that, under current legislation, the Northern Ireland Executive&#8212;which is responsible for a jurisdiction with less than one third of Scotland&#8217;s population, as has been indicated&#8212;has greater ability to borrow than the Scottish Parliament. Furthermore, that is part of a package of measures. Recently, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland suggested that Northern Ireland should accept corporation tax powers, which are currently denied to Scotland. In the current climate, Northern Ireland would have a greater ability to compete for jobs than Scotland. I think it was mentioned earlier that up to 58,000 jobs could potentially be generated through the package of measures that are proposed for that country.</p><p>I highlight the example of Norway, which John Mason raised earlier. In the current year, Norway can spend 4 per cent of its oil fund, which is about &#163;13.5 billion. That could pay for 40 of the railways to which Colin Beattie referred earlier.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648395", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill: Borrowing Powers and Growing the Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My colleagues have taken most of my best lines already, so I will pick up on areas that have not been covered in so much detail.

Some 114,000 people in the south determined that I should have the honour of representing them. I thank them sincerely and will strive to repay their faith in me.</p><p>Although I said that I am a migrant, I can trace my roots to farmers from Roxburghshire and Ayrshire, as well as mining stock in Kilmarnock and a manse in Kirkcudbright. I am very much a product of the south and I am especially proud of that.</p><p>For my sins, I am an economist by training, and I want to make my first speech a plea for the Parliament to turn its gaze towards the economic needs of the south of Scotland in the same way that Scotland once turned to the needs of the Highlands in the 1970s and 1980s. Aside from giving Scotland its national bard, Rabbie Burns, and the Borders&#8217; own Sir Walter Scott, the region is perhaps best known for its scenic beauty, with rolling hills, farmscapes, pretty villages and towns. That is one of the region&#8217;s undoubted virtues but it masks many economic and social challenges.</p><p>Unemployment is comparatively low and it is falling, but we have an ageing population and we struggle to retain our young people. Historically, there has been a lack of private sector graduate employment. In fact, outward migration of our young people is one of the reasons why unemployment is so low.</p><p>Although the quality of the south&#8217;s produce is second to none, the region&#8217;s economy suffers from what economists call a low skills equilibrium, with low employer demand for skills, low productivity and low wages. The effect is that, of the three nomenclature of units for territorial statistics areas&#8212;the geographic areas that are used by Europe&#8212;that have the lowest economic output per head in Scotland, two are in the south of Scotland. East Ayrshire, combined with North Ayrshire, has 60 per cent of the average gross value added per head for Scotland. The Scottish Borders has 66 per cent, and Dumfries and Galloway is not far behind on 71 per cent. Economic output per head of population in the city of Edinburgh is 2.6 times that of the Scottish Borders. The Parliament must try to level up the areas.</p><p>In the programme for taking Scotland forward, at the heart of the SNP Government&#8217;s economic strategy are a number of desired characteristics of growth, including the concept of cohesion between the areas of Scotland and the idea that no area would be left behind. That is a welcome change in emphasis.</p><p>Looking at cohesion in Scotland, we see that since 1999, the Scottish Borders has slipped from 78 per cent to just 66 per cent of the Scottish average GVA per head, while Dumfries and Galloway has slipped from more than 80 per cent to its current figure of 71 per cent. That long-term trend, exacerbated by the region&#8217;s severe exposure to rising fuel costs, will take some time to reverse. It might surprise some members, but much of the south of Scotland now has lower economic output per head than comparable areas in the Highlands and Islands. All NUTS areas in the Highlands and Islands now outperform the Scottish Borders, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire. Across the south, we also face high levels of in-work poverty, with many people working part time or reduced hours, or working at more than one job to make their way.</p><p>I would be the last person to ask Parliament to play one region off against another but we need to recognise&#8212;lest we forget&#8212;that the south is Scotland&#8217;s southern gateway and, as such, it could have a huge role to play in Scotland&#8217;s economic success. The south should therefore have a more dynamic economy and stronger society than it has had during recent decades.</p><p>Much of the region lies within a 60-mile radius of Scotland&#8217;s two largest cities but, despite that potential geographic advantage, the local economies of the region languish in the economic doldrums and there is no simple cure for that. Effective distance and peripherality is best measured by drive times and, because of poor infrastructure and public transport, those times cannot compete with areas to the north of and in the central belt. For example, it takes a passenger more than two hours to reach Edinburgh from Hawick on an express bus service. That makes it impractical for people to commute daily to places such as Edinburgh or Glasgow; it also makes it essential that local jobs and the sustainability of economic development are at the forefront of our thinking.</p><p>Despite the union dividend that we are told about, and despite more than three decades of North Sea oil production and wealth, those who lived more than a century ago would probably recognise the roads infrastructure as being the same as they had in their own time. One could argue that the infrastructure of some areas of the region has regressed rather than progressed, as rail services were lost half a century ago. Transport is one of the most important factors that influence investment into the UK, and the position in Scotland is no different. However, the Scottish Borders and Midlothian have a total of zero railway stations. By contrast, the Highland Council area has 58 and Glasgow has 60. In fact, Glasgow has more stations than the total for the south of Scotland, which is 49 if we include the whole of south Lanarkshire in the total for the region.</p><p>I am proud that it will be an SNP Government that, through an innovative funding model, will restore rail to the Scottish Borders and Midlothian in 2014. Once that service is operational, I hope that I can play a role in exploring the further extension of that line to the Borders&#8217; most populous town&#8212;Hawick&#8212;and perhaps beyond to Carlisle.</p><p>I appeal to those in other parties who may be tempted to criticise the Borders railway project to resist the urge to do so, and I urge them to back the project and ensure that it is a success&#8212;just as other recent rail projects have been a success. The people of the Borders need and deserve that success, and the same is true across the south of Scotland. By supporting the project and engaging with it, we can ensure that it maximises the economic return and has the maximum number of passengers.</p><p>Like my colleague Dr Aileen McLeod, I believe that investment in research and development and in innovation is key to the future of the region. In the south of Scotland, we have an abnormally low share of investment in research and development from higher education, further education, Government and business.
