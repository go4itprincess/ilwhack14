It is clear that there is, and has been, cross-party support for most of the committee&#8217;s findings and the recommendations that it made to the Scottish Government. There is obvious recognition of the valuable role that community transport plays in the lives of service users, and of the importance of providing support to those who volunteer or work in the sector in order to keep those lifeline services running, especially in the context of rising demand from an ageing population, as Maureen Watt highlighted in her opening speech.</p><p>Many members emphasised that greater security and reliability of funding, which provides the ability to plan for the future, is vital in order to assure the future of the community transport sector. Inconsistency of funding, regardless of where it comes from, is one of the biggest burdens on the sector and one of the greatest drains on its resources. Greater funding security would allow operators to focus their energies on providing and developing services.</p><p>Gordon MacDonald made a particularly effective speech, especially with regard to the need for three-year funding to replace the one-year system that we tend to have at the moment, as did Joan McAlpine when she highlighted the burden of administration and bureaucracy on the small operators. That was raised with me directly by Coalfield Community Transport, which Elaine Murray mentioned she had visited during the committee&#8217;s inquiry.</p><p>Local authorities have difficult decisions to make about funding priorities for their areas, but questions must be asked about the obvious variation in funding for the community transport sector around Scotland when, as has been made clear, many of the same problems of access to transport exist the length and breadth of the country. The Scottish Government&#8217;s consideration of a grant scheme for replacement vehicles is to be commended; it might go a considerable way towards allowing operators to plan with greater confidence for the future of their services. We look forward to an update from the Scottish Government on those plans.</p><p>As members know, community transport organisations tend to develop organically and to arise in response to perceived local need. The commitment of operators and volunteers to meeting those needs is to be strongly commended&#8212;Dennis Robertson made a notable speech in which he highlighted operations in the minister&#8217;s constituency. The committee heard that the risk is that groups that emerge in isolation can lack the guidance and resources that would enable them to meet their full potential.</p><p>However, there are people in the sector who have the knowledge and background to support groups, which are often very small, and to provide sectoral leadership. The last thing that the committee wants is for the community emphasis of transport groups to be lost, so it is felt that a national strategy would be inappropriate.</p><p>The Community Transport Association in Scotland has been widely acknowledged as the sector expert; the committee knows from evidence that operators depend heavily on the CTA&#8217;s advice and guidance. On that basis, the committee recommended that the Scottish Government support the CTA in taking on an expanded role. I very much welcome&#8212;as will other committee members&#8212;the minister&#8217;s announcement that annual funding support for the CTA will double. That will help the sector to develop a shared vision and, perhaps more important, shared standards of service, while remaining responsive to specific local needs and circumstances.</p><p>&#8220;The CTA State of the Sector Report for Scotland 2012&#8221; provided an interesting and illustrative snapshot of community transport provision. However, the report itself acknowledged that it was by no means comprehensive and that there were many gaps in the data&#8212;that applies not just to quantitative information, such as the number of services or the number of journeys that are provided, but to qualitative issues, which need to be fully understood.</p><p>There is a need to establish beyond anecdotal evidence the impact that community transport has on the health, social engagement and welfare of service users, and the wider impacts that it can have on communities and public services. A deeper understanding of the sector is needed, as was emphasised by Rod Campbell and Margaret McCulloch.</p><p>In its response to the committee&#8217;s recommendations, the Scottish Government said that it proposes</p><p>&#8220;to commission a new piece of qualitative research to collect information from a selection of community transport providers in Scotland on their services, including benefits and costs&#8221;</p><p>and to deepen</p><p>&#8220;our understanding of what services are currently available.&#8221;</p><p>We look forward to getting feedback from the Government on that in due course.</p><p>As many members have said, the challenges for community transport that are associated with driver licensing and its cost are already significant and are growing year on year. There is no easy solution, because the changes to minibus driver licensing were brought about by changes in European regulations. The pool of people who can drive minibuses without obtaining a licence qualification is ever decreasing. The costs that are associated with training an individual to obtain the necessary licence&#8212;as the committee heard in evidence&#8212;can be quite significant, especially for transport providers, for whom an &#163;800 to &#163;1,000 cost represents a significant impact on their available resources. In evidence, the minister said that it would be possible for the Government to provide support to reduce the cost to organisations. The committee welcomed the willingness of the Scottish Government to consider that and recommended that training co-ordination be looked at in the context of developing a wider means of support for community transport in Scotland.</p><p>In its response, the Scottish Government agreed to explore future demand for D1 qualified drivers with the CTA, community transport groups, other minibus operators&#8212;including local authorities&#8212;and training providers and, in the light of that, to look at options for securing D1 training more efficiently. That issue was also raised with me by my local Coalfield Community Transport provider in Cumnock, which suggested that it would make a fine trainer for other community transport providers.</p><p>On joint working, it was very encouraging to see&#8212;throughout the committee&#8217;s own evidence-taking and in the evidence that was heard by the Health and Sport Committee&#8212;that there are good examples of joint working between community transport groups and partnership agencies. Indeed, the benefits of joint working have already been highlighted in high-level reports by Audit Scotland and by the Scottish Government&#8217;s short-life working group on healthcare transport. Duncan McNeil today made a particularly effective speech on that. The Scottish Government has indicated that it will continue to work with regional transport partnerships and NHS Scotland to implement the recommendations of the short-life working group, which are largely echoed by the committee&#8217;s recommendations.</p><p>As we have heard over the course of the afternoon, perhaps the most hotly debated aspect of the committee&#8217;s report is concessionary travel. There is consensus that inequity exists, which is experienced by those who, although they are entitled to concessionary travel, cannot access the forms of transport to which that concessionary scheme applies. We had a good argument going on between Jim Eadie, Elaine Murray, Alex Johnstone, and Cameron Buchanan this afternoon that gave a flavour of the issues that are involved.</p><p>However, there is no doubt that certain people can find it difficult to access services&#8212;they may find it difficult to walk to a bus stop or they may live in an isolated or rural area where there are no bus services. For those individuals, if they lack access to public transport or to a car the choice is between community transport and taxis, neither of which is free. Age Scotland&#8217;s still waiting campaign has done a good job of bringing to the attention of members and the wider public the consequences on Scotland&#8217;s elderly and disabled population of isolation that results from lack of transport. The campaign has called for an extension of the concessionary travel scheme to all community transport schemes.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will endeavour to do that, Presiding Officer.

In 2012, opencast coal production in East Ayrshire represented 15 per cent of the total coal production of the UK&#8212;that is including underground mining. For opencast mining alone, East Ayrshire produced more than 25 per cent of all UK coal and 53 per cent of the coal produced in Scotland. Consequently, the economic and environmental impacts of these activities are highly significant.</p><p>The collapse of two out of the three coal companies operating in the coalfield can only be described as disastrous. The full economic impact of the crisis that is being visited on local communities is currently being assessed in detail and, as I understand it, a report will be published by East Ayrshire Council later this week. What we know now is that some 311 East Ayrshire residents and former Aardvark and Scottish Coal employees have been made redundant and that many more jobs in the local supply chain are under threat.</p><p>In these circumstances, coalfield communities must not be left in the lurch as they were in the 1980s with the wholesale closure of the deep mines. We must diversify the local economy and realise opportunities to develop existing businesses and attract inward investment.</p><p>The minister will be aware of the efforts of East Ayrshire Council and Scottish Enterprise to create a proposition for economic initiatives that will require Scottish Government backing. I hope and trust that that will be forthcoming. However, so long as a viable coal industry can be sustained, we should be lending our efforts to that purpose as a priority. I am grateful to the minister for his strong leadership in that regard and for his swift action in establishing a coal industry task force, mobilising all those&#8212;national agencies and local authorities alike&#8212;who could provide support in getting people who had lost their jobs back into work.</p><p>In my view, the minister has also done well in establishing a good working relationship with remaining reputable companies in the mining sector, particularly Kier mining and Hargreaves Surface Mining Ltd, which have now acquired certain former Scottish Coal and Aardvark sites. Hargreaves has managed to maintain coaling at the Aardvark sites and recruitment is under way to restart operations at the Scottish Coal sites. I understand that as a consequence, as the minister mentioned, 300 to 500 jobs will be created nationwide over the next year.</p><p>That said, it would be idle to pretend that the legacy from previous opencast operators is nothing other than a bitter one. In particular, it appears that Scottish Coal failed to fulfil its obligation in a number of areas. For example, it quickly became apparent to the PACE and local response teams that Scottish Coal had failed to train and certificate levels of competence in its workforce in a way that would have allowed employees to secure equivalent jobs outwith the company. Thankfully, Skills Development Scotland, with the assistance of the Mineral Products Qualifications Council and Hargreaves, is ensuring the acquisition of the crucial &#8220;red tickets&#8221;, as they are called.</p><p>The issue of restoration&#8212;or, more accurately, the lack of restoration&#8212;is proving to be far more problematic. What is clear is that both Aardvark and Scottish Coal failed to restore sites, as they were obliged to do under their original planning consents, and that restoration bonds were not sufficient to cover the costs of restoration put in place. The local planning authority is equally blameworthy in that failure, given its duty to monitor and enforce, where appropriate, planning conditions.</p><p>That is a galling outcome, given the time and effort that I recall was put into drawing up East Ayrshire&#8217;s opencast coal subject plan some 10 years ago. There were adequate tools in the toolbox to ensure that problems did not arise, but they were not used effectively. I support East Ayrshire Council&#8217;s investigation of the matter. I am sure that the review, which is being independently conducted by the former chief planner Jim Mackinnon, will inform Scottish planning policy, which is currently out to consultation.</p><p>I also welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement of a consultation on more effective regulation of the industry, particularly with regards to the financial assurance of restoration guarantees&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696519", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Opencast Mining"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The subject matter of the debate is of vital interest to the communities that I represent in East Ayrshire.

It supports around 1,500 direct, full-time jobs and 3,000 indirect jobs in the Scottish supply chain, and generates approximately &#163;450 million per annum in economic value for Scotland.</p><p>The communities that I represent in the Ayrshire coalfield remain reliant on the good health of the coal companies and their production activities. More than half the Scottish industry&#8217;s employment and output is generated within the Cumnock and Doon valley area of East Ayrshire. The jobs that are provided are well paid. The average salary is more than &#163;42,000, which is approximately 66 per cent above the overall Scottish average of &#163;25,000 or so. That said, there is a dearth of alternative employment in the coalfield area. Scotland&#8217;s index of multiple deprivation shows that more than 30 per cent of the Ayrshire coalfield&#8217;s data zones are in the most deprived bracket. From those statistics, it should be evident that continuation of coal production in the face of current challenges is of vital importance to those communities.</p><p>Members will be aware that two of the four coal companies that operate in Scotland&#8212;ATH Resources plc and the Scottish Resources Group, which is also known as Scottish Coal&#8212;have reported significant financial difficulties related to the low selling price of coal and rising costs. I know that the minister has been heavily engaged in supporting those companies&#8217; attempts to secure current and future operations. I am sure that Parliament would be grateful for any feedback and reassurance that the minister can provide at this time.</p><p>I am also aware that Scottish ministers and Scottish Government officials have been working hard to relieve some of the adverse pressures on the industry. For example, Scottish ministers were instrumental in relieving the extra burden that was placed on coal companies that had switched from transporting coal from extraction sites to railheads by road to using long cross-country conveyer belts. One might have thought that that was an enlightened investment, but the increased electricity consumption that is needed to power the conveyer belt networks breached the threshold set by the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s carbon reduction commitment energy efficiency scheme and incurred massive penalties and future liabilities running into millions of pounds. No allowance was made for the significant reduction in CO2 emissions that was achieved by switching from road transport to conveyer belt. Thankfully, and due in no small part to pressure from the Scottish Government, in his autumn statement the chancellor exempted long conveyer belts from the scheme from July 2013, which will relieve future burdens. However, I understand that Scottish ministers are still pressing UK ministers to relieve the liabilities that were incurred during the scheme&#8217;s first year of operation.</p><p>The Office of Rail Regulation&#8217;s introduction of increased track access charges on a distance basis for coal freight that is to be phased in from 2016-17 is another contrary proposal with potentially disastrous consequences for the viability of the Scottish coal industry and, indeed, the prospects for the future development of clean coal electricity generation in Scotland. It appears that little consideration has been given to Scottish circumstances. For example, the price of coal from English ports and mines to power stations in England might rise by &#163;1 per tonne, but the equivalent rise from Scottish sources could be &#163;4 per tonne. Clearly, the threat extends beyond the mining companies to Hunterston port and Longannet power station. The proposal makes even less environmental sense as it will encourage the modal shift of coal traffic from rail to road. All the evidence that we have suggests that imported coal flows from Hunterston to Longannet will be affected.</p><p>Another pressure on surface coal-mining operations in Scotland relates to restoration bonds. Since the financial crash of 2008, the coal companies have been struggling to secure the bond-type guarantees that local authorities require under section 75 agreements for restoration and aftercare of sites. There are now very few bond providers in the marketplace and their costs have consequently escalated. Again, the Scottish Government is actively trying to find an acceptable alternative model of assurance for planning authorities and coal operators.</p><p>Taken together, that combination of pressures is a severe threat to investment in an industry that is currently producing around 5 million tonnes of coal per annum but has permitted reserves of 39 million tonnes in operational sites across Scotland. Significant though that output might be, the coal resource and the industry have much greater potential. As Scotland still has several centuries&#8217; worth of mineable coal reserves, security of supply is clearly not an issue. It remains an ideal fuel for baseload and for responding to electricity demand peaks on cold winter nights. That potential will be unlocked with the successful full-scale demonstration of clean coal technologies such as carbon capture and storage, which will greatly reduce the carbon impact of fossil fuel power generation.</p><p>Together with our investment in renewables, Scotland could be a world leader in creating a low-carbon future. We have the knowledge and expertise in our universities and industry and the infrastructure in the North Sea. The Summit Power bid to the UK&#8217;s CCS commercialisation programme for a coal gasification plant fitted with a fully integrated CCS system at Grangemouth could be a trailblazer.</p><p>I am absolutely convinced that the Scottish Government has the vision and drive to achieve that ambition.

We have a superabundance of fresh water. Indeed, I am told that the volume of water in Loch Ness is nearly twice that of all the standing waters of England and Wales combined&#8212;that is fascinating fact number 1.</p><p>What is more, our water quality is among the best in the world.

Therefore, in an increasingly water-stressed world, Scotland is well placed to develop into a world-leading hydro nation, as the cabinet secretary ably showed in opening the debate.</p><p>From the evidence that the committee gathered, it is fair to say that there is broad consensus among all stakeholders on the desirability of pursuing the hydro nation agenda, and broad support for the bill&#8217;s intention of doing so. That is reflected in the committee&#8217;s recommendation to the Parliament that the general principles of the bill be agreed to. That is not to say that there are no areas of contention that the Scottish Government will need to address at further stages of the bill. The most prominent of those areas relate to the provisions in parts 1 and 2 of the bill, to which I will confine my remarks.</p><p>Part 1 places a duty on the Scottish ministers to take all reasonable steps to develop the value of Scotland&#8217;s water resources. In itself, that will, of course, sharpen the Parliament&#8217;s focus on holding ministers to account. There is a strong case for consolidating annual reporting to Parliament on the hydro nation agenda and incorporating scrutiny of not only the bill, when it has been enacted, but the implementation of other relevant water-related legislation, such as the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009. We look forward to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s proposals in that regard.</p><p>The main point at issue relates to the definition of the value of water. The bill emphasises the development of the economic value of the resource and does not refer explicitly to the social and environmental elements of value. I agree with the witnesses who argued that the legislation must ensure that any future development of Scotland&#8217;s water resources is entirely sustainable and must seek to protect and improve the natural environment. In its briefing for the debate, the RSPB suggested adding in a sustainable development duty akin to that in the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, which should reinforce that intention. I look forward to discussing such an amendment at stage 2. Similarly, the bill and the hydro nation agenda need to link in with other policies, such as those in our climate change legislation, and the EU&#8217;s blueprint to safeguard Europe&#8217;s water resources, which recommends efficiency measures to save water and energy.</p><p>The Government will need to clear up the current confusion about the purpose of part 2, which will introduce ministerial control of large-scale water abstraction. As members have mentioned, the provisions were a late addition to the bill and were not consulted on. They also relate to an activity that is already subject to the controlled activities regulations licensing regime that is operated by SEPA in circumstances in which a proposed abstraction may have a practical impact on the environment.</p><p>Members have been made aware that the Scotch Whisky Association has expressed concern that the 10 megalitres per day threshold that is set out in the bill may be reduced in future and that the industry&#8217;s growth could be constrained unless it is exempted from that provision. Dealing with the Scotch Whisky Association and its concerns will be familiar territory for the cabinet secretary.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680425", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Resources (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is fair to say that the Water Resources (Scotland) Bill is not the most controversial bill that the Parliament and its committees have considered.

I encourage fellow MSPs to participate in the event.</p><p>I am particularly grateful to have this opportunity to highlight the life and work of William Murdoch, the engineering genius who, among many other achievements, invented gas lighting, which places him in the pantheon of the great pioneers of the first industrial revolution.</p><p>Styled &#8220;The Scot Who Lit the World&#8221; in Janet Thomson&#8217;s excellent book on his life and work, Murdoch was very much a product of the Scottish enlightenment of the late 18th century and a leading member of that remarkable generation of Scots who invented the modern world.</p><p>William Murdoch was born into a family of millwrights at Bello mill in the Ayrshire village of Lugar. Many successful technicians, engineers and inventors of the industrial revolution came from similar skilled artisan backgrounds. William&#8217;s father, John, certainly set his son a considerable example in inventiveness and improvement at the mill. It is even reputed that father and son invented a tricycle that carried John to Cumnock on market days&#8212;60 years in advance of Kirkpatrick Macmillan&#8217;s bicycle invention down the road in Dumfries.</p><p>Of course, in addition to his father&#8217;s tutelage, William also benefited from a formal schooling at Cumnock parish school. Since 1696, every parish in Scotland had been required to maintain a free school and schoolmaster by act of the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>It was at Bello mill that the young William began experimenting with steam and made early attempts at gas lighting. He and his siblings excavated a small sandstone cave next to the mill on the banks of the Lugar water, which William used as a laboratory for his experiments. He placed burning coal into his mother&#8217;s old kettle, attached a perforated thimble to the end of the spout and set alight the gas that was released from the coal, illuminating the dark little cave. Incidentally, the light-giving property of the local caunle coal&#8212;or candle coal&#8212;was well known. A familiar sight in Ayrshire homes of the time was the earthenware container of burning caunle coal placed on top of the fire, giving light as well as warmth to the room.</p><p>Unlike many of his contemporaries, Murdoch does not receive the recognition that his achievements deserve. Certainly, I cannot recall any mention of him in the textbooks on the period. That is the case despite the admiration of his contemporaries, the award of a gold medal by the Royal Society and, indeed, the remarkable honour bestowed at the turn of the 19th century, some 50 years after his death, with the placing of his marble bust&#8212;one of only 16 people so honoured&#8212;in the hall of Scottish heroes at the Wallace monument in Stirling. I suspect that the main reason for his relative obscurity is that his work has been subsumed within that of the inventor of the steam engine, James Watt&#8212;of whom more later.</p><p>At the age of 23, William left his native Ayrshire village of Lugar and walked 250 miles, taking eight days, to begin work with James Watt and Matthew Boulton at the renowned Soho manufactory in Birmingham. Perhaps he had been inspired by an account of the works by another local Lugar man who had visited it the year before: James Boswell, the son of the local laird of the Auchinleck estate. Yes, it was the James Boswell of Boswell and Johnson fame.</p><p>In any case, William quickly became indispensable to the undertaking, becoming the practical go-to man who ensured that the engines worked and kept on working, which was no small feat in the days when mechanical engineering was in its infancy. Invention and innovation went hand in hand with that work, in order to improve the performance of the machinery. However, his terms of employment made it clear that his inventions were the intellectual property of his employers, so William&#8217;s groundbreaking work in, for example, converting steam power to produce rotary motion and the turning of wheels was patented by, and attributed to, James Watt.</p><p>As for gas lighting, for which he is now best known, Murdoch apparently perfected the process for producing and capturing coal gas while based in Cornwall, where Boulton and Watt&#8217;s engines were used in the tin mines. Murdoch&#8217;s house at Redruth was the first domestic residence to be lit by gas. When he returned to Birmingham, he continued experimenting, lighting the interior of the Soho buildings. The first industrial factory to be illuminated by gas was the Philips and Lee cotton mill in Manchester, which was fully lit by Murdoch with 904 gas lights in 1805.</p><p>Incredibly, Boulton and Watt denied Murdoch the opportunity to patent and develop gas lighting, which was not only much cheaper to run than the traditional oil or tallow lighting, but more brilliant, steadier and cleaner in use. The company therefore left the way open for competitors to exploit the market, which predictably boomed in the following decades, from the lighting of commercial properties to domestic and street lighting.</p><p>It is interesting that Murdoch contented himself with producing his paper for the Royal Society and its award of a gold medal in 1808 to him as</p><p>&#8220;the author of the most important or useful discovery which shall be made published ... in heat and light.&#8221;</p><p>Had Murdoch been motivated by fame and fortune, he could easily have achieved both, but his energies were directed towards his work in order to satisfy his intellectual curiosity and solve practical problems, benefiting others as much as, or even more than, himself. He led a productive and fruitful life, while providing a comfortable living for his family. In these days of puerile celebrity culture, he is a role model who deserves to be promoted to our young people.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675979", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: William Murdoch"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This year marks the 200th anniversary of the gas industry in this country, and tonight the Parliament is holding a reception&#8212;hosted by my colleague Mark McDonald&#8212;to celebrate the major contribution that the industry has made and continues to make to Scotland and its economic wellbeing.

An holistic approach is required to meet people&#8217;s needs; therefore, staff now consider the person&#8217;s immediate needs, their personal circumstances and their short and long-term housing aspirations to work out what the best options are.</p><p>Nevertheless, the committee is aware of variation in service provision across the country and wants to see best practice established everywhere.

We were particularly keen to see the preventative focus of the housing options approach being made subject to quality measurement; Malcolm Chisholm alluded to that.</p><p>An overall reduction of 20 per cent in the number of homelessness applications for the latest period over the previous year is, on the face of it, very encouraging. Authorities such as North Ayrshire Council are to be commended for reducing the number of homelessness applications by 50 per cent over a five-year period. However, some concern has been expressed that that could be interpreted as evidence of gatekeeping, with homelessness applications not being accepted and people being sent down different routes, preventing them from getting access to their rights. We have been reassured that that is not such an issue here as it is in England, but we recommend that the Scottish Government and the Housing Regulator monitor the area carefully.</p><p>The particular importance of partnership working in tackling homelessness has been raised by several members and it was made clear throughout the oral, written and informal evidence that the committee received. That means partnership between housing, health and social services in dealing with problems associated with issues such as mental health, substance misuse and family break-ups, preferably through early rather than crisis intervention.</p><p>Margaret Burgess made a telling contribution on the importance of money advice and debt counselling with local authorities and advice organisations working hand in glove.

We are, therefore, all delighted with the minister&#8217;s announcement this afternoon of an additional &#163;150,000.

The majority of witnesses to the committee emphasised the importance of improving the supply of affordable housing in all tenures. Although the committee welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to provide more affordable housing, we agreed that that commitment must be closely monitored, and we intend to assess progress over the coming parliamentary session.</p><p>Work must be undertaken to determine what can be done to encourage private sector landlords to make more housing available to those who are at risk of homelessness.

We heard many speeches on that in the debate.

Why has the educational attainment of looked-after children not improved over the past 10, or even 20, years? The figures are stark: 90 per cent leave school at age 16 or under with few or no qualifications, and fewer than half of them are in positive destinations six months later.</p><p>I agree with the excellent analysis that is laid out in Children in Scotland&#8217;s briefing for the debate. In essence, we need to get the learning environment right. For looked-after children, that will be a very hard nut to crack. For example, support for them in school has tended to be mobilised as crisis intervention when behaviour or performance becomes difficult for teachers to manage, rather than when children start to struggle.</p><p>There have been advances in recent years, such as the appointment of designated senior managers in every school to deal holistically with issues relating to looked-after children. Kevin Stewart highlighted that role, and I have no doubt that it has been helpful, particularly in taking forward multi-agency approaches.

Similarly, I am aware of mentoring schemes, such as those that were run by East Ayrshire Council in association with the local youth advocacy service and funded through the more choices, more chances programme.</p><p>Youngsters who benefited from the schemes said that they felt better about going to school because they had been able to talk through their problems and get them sorted out. Further development of such personalised services could make a significant contribution to improving attendance and preventing exclusion, both of which have a significant impact on eventual attainment levels.</p><p>Such development might be necessary, but it is not sufficient to compensate for the deficiencies in the home learning environment that underlie the disadvantage of looked-after children. In other words, what matters is the quality of parenting. All the research shows that a child&#8217;s intellectual, social and emotional development is determined largely in the first three years of life. Almost by definition, looked-after children&#8217;s early experiences have not only damaged that development but done so permanently. If we are to realise the ambition of closing the gap in attainment between looked-after children and their peers, we must take preventative action early enough to prevent developmental damage happening in the first place.</p><p>To my mind, that requires a twin-track approach to dealing with families at risk and should include the provision of significant support to vulnerable parents who are willing and able to put their child&#8217;s interests first through pregnancy and beyond. Failing that, children must be removed from harmful and abusive situations quickly before irretrievable damage is done and a permanent alternative home found for them as a matter of priority. I would favour a significant expansion in adoption as a means of providing permanence. I recognise that such actions will be seen in some quarters as too tough&#8212;even draconian&#8212;but if we are really serious about getting it right for every child, current procedures, which can be lengthy and drawn out, must be curtailed.</p><p>We can always do more to support looked-after children through the education system and I am confident that the work of the centre of excellence and the Scottish Government&#8217;s looked-after children strategic implementation group will push the agenda forward.

I confess to being turned off by the extreme hostility of opponents such as Struan Stevenson MEP, who not only belittle the benefits that are to be gained from harnessing wind power, but mendaciously claim that the switch to renewables is the root cause of higher fuel bills and rates of fuel poverty. The same folk, mind you, would happily accept the public paying through the nose for a new generation of nuclear reactors, and would pass on a hugely hazardous legacy to future generations.</p><p>Wind power is clearly not an all-encompassing solution that can replace all other forms of electricity generation. However, it will play a significant role in our efforts to tackle climate change and reduce our CO2 emissions, while ensuring energy security in future decades. That said, proponents of wind power tend to dismiss the problems that are associated with wind farm development and to dismiss local protesters as selfish nimbys. I find that attitude equally unacceptable. I have seen for myself, particularly in the south Carrick area of my constituency, the damaging impact that inappropriate siting of turbines can have on the wellbeing of residents and communities who are in close proximity, whether that be from noise, shadow flicker or visual amenity issues. On top of that, there are genuine concerns about the impact on property values and on tourism-related businesses.</p><p>All those problems are compounded and exacerbated by the scale and rapidity of the proposed development. South Carrick is beginning to resemble a new Klondike. It is being targeted relentlessly by all sorts of wind farm developers, large and small, who are keen to exploit the opportunities that have been opened up to them. I am concerned that the impetus of making a fast buck is overtaking a planned development process.</p><p>In these circumstances, I want to see tighter control by planning authorities to prevent what the motion calls &#8220;overconcentration&#8221; of development. The assessment of cumulative impact becomes crucial. I am not convinced that planning authorities are geared up to handle the pressures, so I seek an assurance from the minister that Scottish Government support is all that it should be in the circumstances. With regard to extracting community benefits from wind farm development, again I broadly agree that they should not be limited to what the Klondikers are willing to concede to local communities.</p><p>I would be grateful if the minister could respond to the call that is being made by many people, including Maitland Mackie, to set up planning procedures that are designed to facilitate local consortia of businesses, landowners and community organisations seeking ownership of the renewable energy potential of their own land and landscapes. Surely it makes sense to retain as much as possible of the lucrative returns from wind farm development locally, thereby regenerating rural economies in the process.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656502", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wind Farms (Impact on Communities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "l congratulate Neil Findlay on securing the debate.

I also share his disappointment at the Labour Party&#8217;s apparent lack of concern for the debate and the important issues that it raises.</p><p>As the minister and members will know, John Scott has been a staunch defender of Ayr hospital since he was first elected, and I have joined him on many occasions to help protect the hospital&#8217;s services.</p><p>Four years ago, a great victory was won when, on taking office as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon immediately fulfilled a Scottish National Party manifesto pledge by reversing the previous Labour Executive&#8217;s plans to close Ayr hospital&#8217;s A and E department and centralise Ayrshire and Arran A and E services at Crosshouse hospital. To say that that decision was warmly welcomed in our local community would be an understatement and it certainly established trust and confidence in the new Government.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said with regard to NHS Ayrshire and Arran, even though the board committed itself to maintaining full A and E services at both Ayr and Crosshouse hospitals. Back in February 2008, the board assured the cabinet secretary that it would do so and it continues to provide that assurance.</p><p>The local public&#8217;s mistrust of the board stems from senior management&#8217;s long track record of support for centralising hospital services, usually in favour of Crosshouse. For example, the closure of paediatrics at Ayr hospital predated the A and E issue. In addition, the board&#8217;s conduct of the consultation process on the A and E issue was a model of how not to consult, with its preferred option being presented on a like-it-or-lump-it basis.</p><p>As John Scott has pointed out, the issue took fire again when a stop-press bulletin from management to staff in early September seemed to confirm the public&#8217;s worst fears that the proposal was being considered again. The bulletin stated that savings had to be made in trauma and orthopaedics and that previously rejected proposals to develop a centre of excellence for in-patient trauma services at Crosshouse would be revisited. That would require a review of bed numbers and theatre provision at both hospitals&#8212;and, what is more, the plan was to be pushed forward as soon as possible to &#8220;avoid uncertainty&#8221;. Naturally enough, alarm bells immediately started ringing, given the range of implications that such a development would have not only for the provision of trauma and orthopaedics at Ayr hospital but also for the future of A and E services. One need look only at St John&#8217;s hospital in Livingston for an example of how such a move turns out.</p><p>Like John Scott, I have raised this issue as a matter of urgency with both NHS Ayrshire and Arran and the cabinet secretary and I have received assurances from the national health service that any service redesign proposals would require to demonstrate the service&#8217;s capability to deal not only with orthopaedic A and E cases on both sites but with any orthopaedic care following elective surgery on both sites.

Analysis of the Scottish index of multiple deprivation showed that in the final year of the previous Labour Administration, 34 per cent of the data zones in the Ayrshire coalfield were among the worst 20 per cent in Scotland. That is the highest figure for any coalfield area in Scotland. The figure rose to 40 per cent for employment deprivation or worklessness among those actively seeking work and those who have become dependent on state benefits, and to 42 per cent for health deprivation.</p><p>Geographic access is a big problem in the Ayrshire coalfield area. Although coalfield communities traditionally grew up in small towns and villages around mines that were located outside the main urban areas, the coalfield settlements in Ayrshire are among the most rural in the United Kingdom. As Alex Johnstone said, there is an issue about trying to match up communities in need with communities in which there are opportunities. There is a disconnect there because we do not have adequate transport between such areas.</p><p>Many people have moved away to find work. Communities such as Muirkirk and New Cumnock have suffered significant depopulation, which has accelerated a spiral of decline.</p><p>The jobs base has not recovered from the closure of the pits, and new business formation has been lower than average. Despite the exodus of people, the latest available figures for 2007 showed that 3.1 working-age adults were resident in coalfield areas for every job located there. I think it is fair to say that that is a distinctly poor legacy for the incoming SNP Government in 2007 to inherit.</p><p>Despite those deep-rooted problems, progress has been made in recent years, with the Scottish Government playing a leading role. That has taken many forms, including continued funding of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust, which in turn has supported some 30 projects in Cumnock and Doon Valley in the past year. There have been significant improvements to Cumnock town centre through the town centre regeneration fund. The small business bonus scheme has been a major boost, safeguarding and creating local jobs. The Government provided the bridging funding that was vital in securing the commitment of Prince Charles&#8212;whom the cabinet secretary knows well&#8212;to the Dumfries House Trust. It has also supported, through the sustainable communities initiative, the associated Knockroon development&#8212;the creation of a new village, with all the necessary community facilities.</p><p>Importantly, the Scottish Government has not acted alone. The area has benefited greatly from a progressive SNP-run council, which has invested in, and is continuing to invest heavily in, new and refurbished schools in New Cumnock, Patna, Littlemill and Sorn; in the Cumnock conservation area regeneration scheme, along with Historic Scotland and other funding parties; and in new community centres in Auchinleck, Netherthird and New Cumnock.</p><p>Crucially, investment in physical infrastructure has been accompanied by support for community-led development, including for very large projects such as the Catrine environmental heritage project. The council has backed the Catrine Community Trust to the tune of &#163;230,000, which helped it to secure a grant of &#163;2&#160;million from the Scottish rural development programme for a unique project incorporating heritage-led regeneration and the use of renewable energy to provide a sustainable income stream. The project involves the restoration of a scheduled monument&#8212;the River Ayr weir&#8212;reuse of redundant hydro turbines, and the development of an education and visitor information centre.</p><p>Smaller but no less important projects are springing up across the coalfield communities. Confidence is building and activity is growing. Such activity is proof positive that empowered communities can lead the regeneration process. However, it is particularly important that individuals and groups in our most disadvantaged and fragile communities who make that commitment have access to adequate and appropriate support.</p><p>I echo the calls in the briefings for the debate from organisations such as Planning Aid for Scotland and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations for community capacity building to be at the core of our new national regeneration strategy. I look forward to that emerging in the next few weeks and to the introduction of the community empowerment and renewal bill in the new year.

Gerry wrote to me shortly after the election as follows:</p><p>&#8220;Please let me advise you of my current problem with broadband connections. I have recently been in consultation with my provider Talk Talk at a very high level about the huge bill that I am paying annually to them for broadband and phone&#8212;approximately &#163;500. This is very difficult for an old age pensioner like me and is mainly due to the fact that BT have not upgraded the Lendalfoot exchange which holds approximately 120 lines (only those with about 1000 lines appear to have been upgraded).</p><p>My information from Talk Talk is that it will likely never be upgraded although locals making enquiries over several years were led to believe if they waited it would be done by April 2011.</p><p>I am asking please that you do all you can to put pressure on BT to do something for us. Particularly after all the hype that we have heard about bringing rural customers into line with people in towns and cities of our nation.</p><p>We are not only being discriminated against by receiving an inferior service but are having to pay inflated prices to our providers compared to that which is available to the lucky man. Just take a look at the many adverts on TV for phone and broadband packages. My package would be reduced by 50 per cent! Just another case of how those living in a rural area like ours have to pay so much more than town dwellers.&#8221;</p><p>Naturally enough, I followed up Mr Frew&#8217;s case with BT. The gist of its reply was that although BT is investing &#163;2.5 billion in the roll-out of superfast broadband, it will only be economically viable for it to reach two thirds of the UK population by 2015. The remaining third&#8212;among whom Scottish customers will be disproportionately represented, given our greater rurality and sparsity of population&#8212;will benefit from high broadband speeds only through partnership working between the public and private sectors.</p><p>I recognise that the UK and Scottish Governments appreciate the need for intervention support. I would be interested to hear from the minister whether the Scottish Government has discussed the possibility of a bid for a whole-Scotland project to Broadband Delivery UK, which, I understand, has up to &#163;830 million to distribute by 2017. The Highland pathfinder is welcome, but many of us represent rural constituencies outwith the Highlands or, indeed, the south of Scotland alliance area, so might it not be a good idea for the Scottish Government to use the &#163;50 million from the futures fund to help to put together a joint financial package to fund a big-bang project?</p><p>I understand that the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment is to meet his UK counterpart in the near future to discuss the development of digital infrastructure, and I know from experience that Mr Neil can be extremely plausible and persuasive in promoting the Scottish case&#8212;he defines a fair share for Scotland as being what he asks for. I understand that BT would regard a pan-Scotland project as an ideal scenario. Such a project would bring economies of scale and would ensure future proofing and consistency of technologies.</p><p>There is also the prospect of tapping into European funding. Ms Marra mentioned the Cornwall experience, but I think that she was being a little disingenuous when she suggested that Cornwall was putting &#163;130 million into high-speed broadband because, of that &#163;130 million, &#163;53.5 million came from the European regional development fund. That was combined with a further investment of &#163;78.5 million from BT, which was won on a competitive tender basis. That investment will result in 10,000 businesses in Cornwall being connected to superfast broadband; indeed, 80 to 90 per cent of businesses and homes in Cornwall will be connected by 2014.</p><p>I would be grateful if the minister could give an indication of whether the Scottish Government would be prepared to consider a more radical approach, along the lines that I have outlined, to address the issue of rural connectivity.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Connectivity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to participate in this debate, although other members have already covered much of what I might have wanted to say.

Most of our local authorities have local parenting strategies in place, and there are excellent examples of joint working.</p><p>We provide direct financial support to the key national parenting organisations in the third sector and to organisations that provide relationship support, counselling and family mediation to families who face difficulties. Through the play, talk, read campaign, we encourage closer bonding and engagement between parents and their children.</p><p>I am delighted to inform Parliament today that&#8212;unlike our counterparts south of the border&#8212;we have agreed to continue our support for the excellent and much-valued children&#8217;s book-gifting programmes that the Scottish Book Trust runs in Scotland. We will provide funding that amounts to &#163;1.05 million, which is a substantial investment in the current financial environment. That is tangible evidence of the importance that we place on children&#8217;s literacy and on parents taking the time to read to their children. The Scottish Book Trust has warmly welcomed that investment. Its chief executive, Marc Lambert, said:</p><p>&#8220;The renewal of Scottish Government support for this universal programme is seriously brilliant news for all children, families and carers right across the length and breadth of Scotland ... It demonstrates how, in contrast to England, the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to ensuring that all children have the best possible start in life.&#8221;</p><p>It is just over two years since the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities published the early years framework, which sets out a long-term vision for transformational change in Scotland. We have recently published a comprehensive report on progress on implementing the framework and there are many examples of progress.</p><p>The golden thread that knits together all the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy objectives for children and young people is the transformational change programme called getting it right for every child. If the early years framework sets the agenda, the GIRFEC approach is the methodology for delivering it. GIRFEC has been endorsed by the Parliament and has received support from all parties.</p><p>GIRFEC establishes a common language and a shared way of identifying concerns and the needs of children and young people. It operates across all agencies and provides the framework into which specialist and targeted services can be integrated. That is why GIRFEC is a central part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to improving outcomes for all children. It articulates clearly the need for transformational change across systems, practice and culture to drive improvements.</p><p>The economic case for getting it right in the early years is sound. We have published research&#8212;based on data from the Scottish context&#8212;that shows the potential cost to the public sector of not intervening early in the lives of disadvantaged children. The research shows that, in the short term, savings from investing in early years services and support, from pre-birth to the age of five, could reach up to &#163;37,400 a year per child in the most severe cases, and approximately &#163;5,100 a year for a child with moderate health and social care needs. In the medium term, the savings&#8212;if interventions from pre-birth to age eight are 100 per cent effective&#8212;could be up to &#163;131 million a year across Scotland. In the long term, failure to intervene effectively to address the complex needs of children in early life could result in a ninefold increase in costs to the public purse.</p><p>I do not underestimate the impact that worsening budget pressures will have on the pace and scale of implementation, at both national and local levels, across the early years agenda. However, for this Government, the case for driving forward this agenda with our partners is indisputable, and it deserves full support from all parties in the Parliament.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-7923.3, to leave out from &#8220;with concern&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;the establishment of the Modernising Nursing in the Community Board, which is working with NHS boards to ensure that community nursing services in Scotland are fit for the 21st century, and further notes the increase in public health nurses/health visitors during the current parliamentary session; supports the current flexible use and mix of state, partnership and private provision of nursery school places in line with local needs and circumstances; welcomes the fact that the vast majority of Scottish local authorities and their partners have local parenting strategies in place, and endorses the current financial support to the leading third sector organisations that provide information and support to parents, including family mediation organisations that provide assistance to families in difficulty.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644235", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Early Intervention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take issue with Mary Scanlon&#8217;s analysis of the situation.

I shall endeavour to respond to as many of the points as possible in the limited time available.</p><p>Not the least valuable part of the contributions, and indeed the correspondence that I receive from several members, has been the personal testimony of the constituency cases with which they have had direct involvement. I have found many of those accounts troubling, moving and impressive, and they have been reinforced in the many meetings that I have had as an elected member, and now as a minister, with kinship carers. That is why, as our spokesman on the issues in opposition and now as a minister in government, I have been very keen to push the cause of kinship care.<place-holder colnum=\"31819\"/></p><p>We all know that kinship carers make tremendous efforts in the face of often very difficult circumstances. We owe it to them to work with them to do all that we can for them and the children for whom they care. The Scottish Government's ambition for all children in kinship care&#8212;and, indeed, for all looked-after children&#8212;is that their opportunities should be the same as those of any child. I am sure that there is no difference between the parties on that point.</p><p>The Government moved quickly when we came into power and, in 2007, we published our strategy on \"Getting it right for every child in kinship and foster care\". That gave us a clear plan of action. Since then, we have implemented the Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations 2009, which set out the arrangements for kinship care of looked-after children, and we have published guidance and delivered training to front-line staff in every local authority to support those regulations.</p><p>We have funded Citizens Advice Scotland to provide better advice and information to kinship carers, particularly on maximising benefit entitlement, and we have commissioned the Child Poverty Action Group to deliver training to front-line workers and social work managers to improve their skills and knowledge of kinship care. On that issue, I take the point made by Paul Martin, who made some very pertinent points on how kinship carers may have been treated by local authorities and others.</p><p>We have also funded Who Cares? Scotland to deliver the corporate parent national training programme to elected members and community partners. We want to empower our local representatives on councils to ask the right questions of their senior officials. We have formed the looked-after children strategic implementation group to bring together organisations from across the children's sector to drive forward an ambitious programme of change at the local level. Also, for the first time, we have introduced, through the concordat, systematic financial support for kinship carers of looked-after children.</p><p>The Scottish Government has taken explicit action to counter what we know are poor educational outcomes for looked-after children. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009 introduces a specific provision that increases the existing duties of local authorities to identify, assess and meet the educational needs of a child with additional learning needs. The provision was introduced on 14 November and the presumption is that all looked-after children require support unless they are assessed otherwise.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Support for Children (Kinship Care)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I join others in congratulating Johann Lamont on securing today's debate on children in family and friends' care.

I shall go on to discuss the situation of all kinship carers, including informal kinship carers.</p><p>Whether or not they are kinship carers of looked-after children, we know that kinship carers do it for love, not money but, equally, we all know that financial resources&#8212;or the lack of them&#8212;have an impact on how easy it is to care for a child. We also know that the number of kinship carers has grown more than expected since 2007. There has been an increase of something like 40 per cent in the number of children coming into kinship care, which has been a real concern for local authorities throughout Scotland. However, kinship care is a cost-effective care placement that offers scope for councils to provide a safe, supportive and nurturing environment for children and young people.</p><p>To get the best from kinship care, we need to continue to invest. In the face of the worst public expenditure environment in 60 years, we have been working with local government and the UK Government to make a difference for kinship carers. I do not say that we have achieved enough yet, but, working with local authorities and UK Governments spanning the political spectrum, we have achieved significant progress. For example, through our working with the UK Government, since April, kinship carers have received their kinship care allowance free of tax with some benefiting by up to around &#163;25 a week. From October, kinship care payments that are made under section 22 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and, from April, payments that are made under clause 50 of the Children Act 1975 will be fully disregarded for housing and council tax benefit purposes, with some kinship carers benefiting by up to &#163;50 a week.</p><p>Those improvements will make a big difference for many carers and are a step in the right direction. However, to my mind, the best sustainable solution is for financial support to be provided by the benefits system. When a child enters a household, the benefits system should help to support that child and that placement. We will, therefore, continue to push the UK Government to change the benefit rules, especially those regarding entitlement to child benefit and child tax credit. That continues to be the basis of our policy on financial support for kinship carers. It is why, at Scotland's first ever children's summit, in June, I announced the agreement of the Scottish Government and the <place-holder colnum=\"31821\"/> Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to work together on kinship care to secure further concessions from the UK Government to ensure that the benefits system is the primary source of financial support.</p><p>We also agreed to work with COSLA to explore the non-financial support that kinship carers need and to consider whether we can do more for informal kinship carers. I take the points that Karen Whitefield, Cathy Jamieson and others made in that regard. I am pleased to confirm that, as a result of that work and discussions with kinship carers and stakeholders, the Scottish Government will pilot a national training, support and advice service for all kinship carers, from early in the new year.</p><p>We will also invite representatives from kinship carer groups across the country to a national forum to ensure that we have a strong dialogue with carers from all across Scotland. An important conversation will be to find out from carers what works for them and the children in their care. That will continue to directly influence the training service that we offer.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Support for Children (Kinship Care)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes, indeed.

In fact, some partners have attended parliamentary sessions so often that they may now qualify as honorary MSPs.</p><p>I thank members of the Finance Committee, the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee. The diligent scrutiny of the bill by members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee in particular has helped, as it should, to shape the final form of the bill. There have been a few areas where we have not agreed, but the important thing has been the way in which we have worked together to resolve the issues.</p><p>I thank the committee clerks who have worked so hard to support the work of the committees. Finally, I thank my officials, as well as the Government and parliamentary legal teams, for their work on the bill. They have worked extremely hard on what has been a demanding and challenging bill.</p><p>The Government has undertaken a significant programme of engagement in developing the bill. There have been a number of areas on which we have found consensus with partners: the value placed on the system; updating the system to take account of the European convention on human rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; improving consistency and standards nationwide; and updating and simplifying procedures.</p><p>I am sure that members would agree that it has been difficult to achieve common ground on many issues in the bill. The children's hearings system is highly valued by a wide range of partners and that breadth of interests does not lend itself to achieving consensus on every point. There has <place-holder colnum=\"30957\"/> been no united voice among our partners on many matters and that has been very tricky to overcome.</p><p>When I brought the bill to Parliament in February, it represented the outcome of a lot of hard work to carefully balance the views that the Government had heard. As members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee will know, that balancing act does not stop during the parliamentary process. If passed today, the bill will contain a number of compromises, but even those will not accommodate all the views of all partners. To be frank, it cannot&#8212;on some issues opinion has varied greatly.</p><p>However, the bill has always represented our genuine efforts to improve outcomes for Scotland's most vulnerable children and young people. It will ensure that those making often life-changing decisions are fully and consistently supported by modernised legislation to enable them to deal with the challenges presented today and in the future.</p><p>The system now deals with more than 10 times the number of care and protection cases that there were nearly 40 years ago. The number of children and young people referred to the reporter in 2009-10 was 42,532. Although that represents a reduction of nearly 10 per cent from the number referred in the previous year, it is still 4.7 per cent of the Scottish child population.</p><p>The bill brings change to the system to ensure that it is strengthened for the future. Importantly, it retains and protects overarching elements that are treasured within the system.</p><p>The system will continue to abide by Kilbrandon's principles, protecting the ethos that children who offend and those who require care and protection are equally deserving of being considered as children in need. The welfare of the child continues to be of paramount importance.</p><p>To ensure that our cherished hearings system stands strong for the future, it is imperative that this bill addresses concerns and criticisms that have manifested themselves over the years. The bill will achieve that by introducing new roles and responsibilities that are currently lacking. For the first time, we will have a figurehead to represent panel members and ensure consistency of support throughout the country.</p><p>The bill also strengthens children's rights, which is important. The impact of offence-related behaviour in later life is addressed and, for the first time, the development of an advocacy service specifically for children in the hearings system will be required so that the voice of the child can be heard as strongly as possible.<place-holder colnum=\"30958\"/></p><p>The bill simplifies a number of procedures for those involved in hearings and introduces new processes. Interim compulsory supervision orders, for example, have been warmly welcomed, and the feedback loop has been embraced by partners who are keen to learn about successful interventions that can contribute to better outcomes for children and young people.</p><p>The bill is not the only element of our work. The wider reform programme will provide much of the detail to support the implementation of the framework and the hard work will continue over the coming years as we implement the bill to ensure that Scotland's children and young people can have the best start in life and are ready to succeed.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21104274", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to open this stage 3 debate on the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill&#8212;passing it will be quite a landmark achievement, considering how long it has been in the pipeline, and quite a relief, given that, as a Parliament, we have spent nearly 30 hours considering it.

Amendment 153 requires the involvement in that training of young people who have been in the hearings system. That is a welcome step, especially with regard to their involvement in the delivery of training, although it is not immediately clear to me how straightforward it will be to involve those young people in the development of the training.

As others have said, the stage 2 amendments gave control of area support teams to local authorities, and that gave local authorities direct influence over issues such as the recruitment, selection and appointment of panel members, and decisions over training. As I said at stage 2, that represented a serious attack on the impartiality and independence of panel members, so the provisions had to be removed.</p><p>If those provisions remain in the bill, they will lead to the construction of a system that fails to comply with the ECHR duties that have been placed on the Scottish Government and Parliament as part of the Scotland Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998. Panel members are clear about the independent nature of their role in making crucial decisions about a child's life. In making such decisions, it is vital that the hearing upholds human rights, particularly those in article 6 of the ECHR, which demands that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law\".</p><p>It would have been impossible to meet that obligation if local authorities had responsibility for area support teams. That is because a local authority, which has to implement and pay for the decisions of the children's hearings system would also control the body&#8212;the area support team&#8212;that is responsible for recruiting and servicing the decision maker, or the hearing, that is taking the decision.</p><p>As Margaret Smith and others have said, the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee and members in general have received a large number of representations from stakeholders who had serious concerns about the amendments that were passed at stage 2. I wrote to the committee with a clear explanation of the legal position and the potential consequences of those earlier amendments. Of all the issues in the bill that were debated, this is the most critical and it must be resolved today.</p><p>For the record, if the bill were to retain after stage 3 the changes that were made by amendments 71 to 74 and 78 at stage 2, it would lie outwith the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament in terms of the Scotland Act <place-holder colnum=\"30952\"/></p><p>1998. That is the Scottish Government's unequivocal position. The bill could therefore be subject to referral to the Supreme Court by the Lord Advocate, the Advocate General, or the Attorney General, for consideration of its legislative competence. That would, of course, be a decision for each of those law officers. If such a referral is made, the bill cannot be submitted for royal assent until the Supreme Court has made its decision and the issue of legislative competence is resolved. Such a situation has not arisen since devolution, and we should avoid this bill being the first to trigger such a legal dispute.</p><p>I am convinced that the amendments that have been presented today by Elizabeth Smith overturn those that the committee supported at stage 2, and they provide greater clarity about the powers of the national convener and the role of local authorities in providing local support to panel members. They also allow for the continued contribution of the volunteers that are central to the hearings system without compromising the bill's key principles and objectives to protect the independence of decision makers, improve consistency and introduce accountability.</p><p>As Liz Smith described, the amendments place a duty on the national convener to establish area support teams with the agreement of local authorities; to provide local authorities with guaranteed membership of the teams with an appropriate balance; to include panel member representation in area support teams; to allow for the automatic continuation of CPAC volunteers in area support teams; and to delegate rota management to area support teams.</p><p>Amendment 117 reinstates the powers and duties of the national convener in training panel members. Training is the primary means of developing the skills of panel members to make decisions in a hearing. Those decisions centre on making compulsory supervision orders that place a duty on local authorities to provide support to children, so it is wholly inappropriate to provide local authorities with a level of influence over the training of panel members, who we must remember are lay members, on the decisions that they should be making for children.</p><p>Liz Smith's amendments offer a way out of the situation that we find ourselves in, and I am grateful to her for working with me to find a resolution that guarantees localism in the hearings system while ensuring that the Parliament satisfies its obligations under the ECHR.

It is important to be clear about the value and flexibility of our system. The children's hearings system focuses its efforts and resources on identifying and addressing the welfare needs of the youngest and most vulnerable in our society, whose risks and needs are, in the vast majority of cases, apparent long before their 16th birthday. That has to be right. The idea is attractive in principle, but I cannot support carte blanche inclusion of 16 and 17-year-olds in the children's hearings system.</p><p>I firmly believe that the current system already allows an appropriate measure of flexibility in dealing with such young people. First, 16 and 17-year-olds are already in the hearings system. Supervision requirements can and do continue until children reach the age of 18, and the bill provides for that practice to continue. Secondly, in the context of offending behaviour, courts already have the power in some cases to choose to seek advice from a hearing or to remit a 16 or 17-year-old back to the system for disposal, whether or not they have been in the hearings system before they turned 16.<place-holder colnum=\"30946\"/></p><p>We have a good adult court system and a children's hearings system.

We have taken a real step forward in striking the right balance between taking a proportionate response to the offending behaviour of children and young people and protecting the public. There is much work to be <place-holder colnum=\"30937\"/> done in implementing those complex changes, but the stage 2 amendments provide a robust legal framework.</p><p>Only one of my amendments signifies a slight shift in policy, which is to reduce the time until an alternative to prosecution with compulsory supervision order disposal becomes spent. Spent periods were set out at stage 2 as three months where a case is discharged and six months where a compulsory supervision order is made.</p><p>On reflection, we believe that those time periods depend too much on the disposal of the case. As other members will know, that often does not reflect the seriousness of the offence. I therefore propose that in all cases, regardless of the disposal, an alternative to prosecution should become spent after three months of the grounds being accepted or established. I know from discussions with stakeholders that they support that shift.</p><p>My other amendments bring the bill into line with my stated intentions at stage 2, when I advised the committee that the legislation would be retrospective. The amendments ensure that disposals that are made under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 are brought into the bill.</p><p>Amendment 103 will allow the order that sets out serious and violent offences to differentiate between degrees of seriousness. In particular I am keen that, as was discussed in committee, we are able to differentiate between assault and assault to severe injury. That will allow for full and proper consideration of what it is proportionate to include in the list.</p><p>I understand the intention behind amendment 149, which Ken Macintosh lodged, but I am slightly disappointed to see the amendment, following the sensible and well thought-out discussion on disclosure and public safety at stage 2, which the committee considered in reaching its decision. The amendment does not appear to be in line with those considerations and raises several concerns.</p><p>As I have no doubt that Ken Macintosh will explain, the amendment would allow an individual to make an application to a sheriff to have the fact that they have committed a serious violent or sexual offence removed from their disclosure certificate. I will explain why I am concerned about the amendment's implications.</p><p>The disclosure would come into play only if the individual wished to work with vulnerable children and adults or in positions of trust. If the amendment was agreed to, we would offer a person who had committed a serious crime the opportunity to work with the most vulnerable in our society. The right would be available only to a young person whose criminal behaviour had been <place-holder colnum=\"30938\"/> dealt with by the children's hearings system and not by the courts. The unintended consequence could be that courts would be the preferred route for dealing with young people who committed serious crimes, regardless of the circumstances that led to that behaviour. That could take children away from the best forum that is available to provide the support that they need&#8212;the children's hearing.</p><p>If new evidence comes to light that casts doubt on whether the child committed the offence, the child has the right to seek a full review by a sheriff of the grounds determination that led to the disclosure. If that review succeeds, the information will be entirely wiped from disclosure.</p><p>Amendment 149 contains no criteria to identify the validity of a request for a review, apart from requiring a minimum time to have passed since the grounds were accepted or established. Neither does it contain criteria to assist the sheriff in making a decision, beyond an assessment of assertions from the applicant that he or she will not reoffend and does not pose a risk to public safety.</p><p>I will set the scene for how the amendment could be used. A 15-year-old boy has committed a serious sexual offence that has been dealt with through children's hearings. He might be under compulsory supervision for that offence until he is 18. If Ken Macintosh's amendment was agreed to, that boy could work with vulnerable groups at the age of 17 and his employer would be told nothing of his past offence.</p><p>I understand the intention behind the amendment&#8212;to be fair to those who do not reoffend and who go on to lead perfectly respectable lives. The answer to achieving that is in the work that is under way on weeding rules. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland is reviewing the weeding and retention rules that dictate for how long an offence is disclosed. ACPOS shares my view that the rules are too long and need to be shorter. That work holds the answer to the legitimate concern about how long information should be available for disclosure. Mr Macintosh's amendment seeks to address the same issue but would have consequences that I presume are unintended and which would not be sensible or safe.</p><p>I ask members to consider that disclosure consequences apply only to serious violent or sexual offences&#8212;not shoplifting or childhood pranks. Disclosure certificates would show the information only if the individual wanted to work with vulnerable children or adults or in positions of trust. Amendment 149 is well meant, but it gets the fundamental balance wrong and would risk undermining public safety. Given the points that I <place-holder colnum=\"30939\"/> have made, I urge Ken Macintosh not to move the amendment.</p><p>I move amendment 99.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21104218", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 177A &#8212; Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974: treatment of certain disposals by children's hearings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee for supporting my stage 2 amendments, which tackled the unequal and in some cases disproportionate disclosure of offences that emanate from children's hearings.

The bill provides that the duties under a compulsory supervision order, interim order or medical examination order should be borne by the relevant local authority, which must implement or pay for the measures in such orders. Section 159 applies where such a duty is imposed on a local authority by a children's hearing or sheriff. If the local authority is satisfied that it is not the relevant one for that child, it might apply to the sheriff for a review of the decision to impose the duty on it. Section 160 provides for a right of appeal against the sheriff's decision in such circumstances.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the relevant local authority for the child is the one in which they predominantly live or, if that criterion does not apply, the one to which the child has the closest connection. The determination of the relevant local authority does not take account of a period of residence in a residential establishment or any connection with an area that relates to such a period of residence. Although ministers have powers to adjust the provision further to ensure that changes of residence as a result of compulsory intervention do not result in an inappropriate shift of <place-holder colnum=\"30808\"/> responsibility for the child between local authorities, the child's relevant local authority might legitimately change during the child's involvement in the children's hearings system.</p><p>As we have heard, amendment 144 seeks to add to the list of those from whom the sheriff may hear evidence in determining the relevant local authority for a particular child.

Section 80 provides for those who do not automatically qualify as a relevant person by applying the legal test in section 185 to demonstrate that they have a \"significant involvement\" in a child's life. That significant involvement will allow them to access the same rights and duties as a relevant person. The amendment allows that test to be amended if it is required in future to respond to developments in this area. I consider it appropriate that the bill should be able to accommodate any changes that may be required in the future.</p><p>Amendments 63 to 68 insert similar flexibility in those provisions that protect the rights of those who are not relevant persons or deemed relevant persons but who have a right of contact with the child. As I explained at stage 2, those amendments were lodged in response to a court judgment that confirmed that those contact rights must be afforded an appropriate level of protection. They allow an individual to enjoy rights of participation for the purposes of reviewing a contact direction made by the hearing, and amendments 63 to 68 allow that right to be extended.</p><p>A person who considers that they meet the conditions&#8212;which will be specified using an order-making power&#8212;will have the right to seek a review of the contact direction.

Those who meet the legal test that is set out in that section will automatically become the child's relevant person without the need for consideration of a pre-hearing. Amendment 107 therefore allows further categories to be added to the list of those who automatically become the child's relevant person.</p><p>Although I am confident that the provisions in the bill accurately protect the rights of those in the children's hearings system, these amendments are necessary to provide flexibility around this developing area of legal consideration.

Such a change would undoubtedly lead to a significant increase in the number of inappropriate and unnecessary referrals and would cut across the principles of the getting it right for every child approach and the work on early and effective intervention.</p><p>We have seen a reduction in the number of referrals to the reporter in recent years as a result of the growing practice of multi-agency pre-referral partnerships, which have grown in number under GIRFEC. Children are being helped and supported more quickly and effectively without the need for referral.

Such orders are made by the sheriff in the absence of the child and their parents. We believe that process to be entirely appropriate, given the serious and immediate nature of the situations that are being dealt with. That said, it is crucial that we have in place robust structures to ensure that actions such as those that are directed through child protection orders remain appropriate and proportionate to a child's needs. We achieve that through holding regular reviews in the form of second and eighth day hearings to consider whether the emergency measures that are in place are still appropriate, and what the longer-term needs of the child might be. Both review points are linked to the implementation of a child protection order.</p><p>What happens when the CPO cannot be implemented? We know that the majority of child protection orders, including all CPOs to prevent the removal of a child from a place of safety, are implemented immediately. However, it is simply not appropriate to ignore the fact that that is not the case for every CPO. Allowing an emergency order, such as a CPO, to run for an extended period of time is not acceptable or appropriate. It was with that in mind that we lodged a stage 2 <place-holder colnum=\"30793\"/> amendment, which introduced a six-day timeframe, after which a CPO that had not been implemented would fall. At the same time, Mr Macintosh lodged and subsequently withdrew a similar amendment that proposed a timeframe of 72 hours. I was therefore surprised to see that he had lodged another amendment in advance of today's proceedings that proposed a significantly longer timeframe than that to which he and the committee agreed at stage 2.</p><p>On the timeframe, the six-day period has been identified with the clear support of the Association of Directors of Social Work and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland. That is particularly important as local authorities will have responsibility for implementation of the majority of CPOs. Similarly, the police will have the power to take decisive action to protect a child when a CPO is not in place. The ADSW and ACPOS felt that the stage 2 amendment struck the right balance by allowing sufficient time for agencies to exhaust all necessary avenues when they seek to implement a CPO, while ensuring that a robust and rigorous structure is in place for considering the changing circumstances of a child when it has not been possible to implement an order for an extended period of time.</p><p>I understand that concerns have been raised with Mr Macintosh about the impact that such a timeframe could have on the ability of front-line practitioners to offer the necessary protection to children, particularly when they have absconded to another jurisdiction, for example. I see no reason why the process that we have set out for the protection of children should not be implementable and effective in such circumstances. When a child or family has absconded, whether in Scotland or another jurisdiction, we expect local services to engage with partners, irrespective of the areas in which they operate, so that emergency action can be taken to ensure the immediate care and protection of that child.</p><p>The critical point is that a CPO need not be in place for such action to be taken. Instead, agencies may involve the use of alternative emergency powers on an interim basis, while a Scottish CPO is being sought, if that is appropriate. It is entirely feasible that that process should be applied, especially given our intention to replicate current practice by arranging for CPOs that have been made in Scotland to have effect elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p><p>I have seen no evidence that suggests that a 10-day timeframe would offer any more protection than the six-day period that was identified by stakeholders and accepted by the committee at stage 2. We need to be able to respond to children's needs in a way that is proportionate and appropriate. The suggested extension of the <place-holder colnum=\"30794\"/> timeframe would in no way help us to achieve that: on the contrary, it would increase the potential for CPOs to be implemented in circumstances that may bear no resemblance to those that were considered by the sheriff at the point at which the order was made. That, compounded by the lack of involvement of either the child or their family in a decision that has a significant impact on them over a potentially prolonged period, causes me real concern.</p><p>I recognise that this is a challenging issue and that a balance has to be struck, but I am entirely confident that the bill will best achieve that as it is currently set out.

They are entirely intended to support the best interests of the child, to ensure the maximum protection for children and, in particular, to avoid undue and potentially harmful delays in getting children the type of supervision that they need. Those values are my priority.</p><p>I understand that decisions around this issue require a careful balancing act. Two distinct points of view are before the chamber for consideration today. For my part, I whole-heartedly stand by the provisions in the bill. They allow the sheriff to serve the best interests of the child if he is satisfied that the child's circumstances have changed since the hearing made its decision. Indeed, the decision could have been made several weeks or months before the sheriff <place-holder colnum=\"30782\"/> considers the matter. Although the sheriff may consider that the decision of the hearing was right and justified at the time that it was made, it may be clear to him, having heard several days of representations from all parties, including the child, that the compulsory supervision order or directions within it no longer meet the needs of the child.</p><p>Karen Whitefield's amendments in the group take us back to the current position. The sheriff would be powerless to take any action to ensure that the child had immediate access to more appropriate support, and he would not be able to refer the child to a hearing for a review of the compulsory supervision order. He would even be prevented from using the no-order principle, which is a fundamental tenet of Kilbrandon and the children's hearings system.<place-holder time=\"16:45:00\"/></p><p>The child would have the right to seek a review of the compulsory supervision order, as would the relevant person, but they would need to wait three months to do so. It is rare for a child to seek a review of a compulsory supervision order; a child is dependent on the relevant person doing so on his or her behalf. What if the parenting skills of that relevant person were the reason for the child's being referred to a hearing? Is it right that the child should have to depend on that person to seek a review or that they should have to wait for three months for a hearing to reconsider the circumstances of their life?</p><p>Even more disturbing is the fact that a child could have to wait for up to 10 months for the annual review of their compulsory supervision order, if the relevant person did not seek a review on their behalf. Would it not be better to allow the sheriff to refer the child to a hearing to review the order, as the bill allows? Under the provisions of the bill as it stands, such a review could be available to a child within weeks of a decision by a hearing, but only if the sheriff has the power to refer the child to a hearing.</p><p>There are reasons why I stand by the provisions in the bill. I have lodged amendments that restrict the power of the sheriff to making only an interim compulsory supervision order, an interim variation of such an order or a warrant to secure attendance at a hearing. Amendment 80 in the previous group removes the sheriff's power to make a compulsory supervision order under section 151.</p><p>To make the short-term orders to which I have referred, the sheriff needs to have the power to vary or terminate any order that is in force, to avoid the highly unsatisfactory situation of a child being subject to two orders at the same time. My amendments serve to limit the lifespan of the <place-holder colnum=\"30783\"/> power to 22 days, after which a hearing will review the order and make its own decision. A hearing has always had the power, under section 151(4), to overturn a sheriff's decision. There is no question of undermining the position of the hearing as the primary decision maker.</p><p>I have said all along that use of the power will be rare. I know from current practice that sheriffs respect the hearing's position as the primary decision maker. The number of children whom the power would affect would be minimal, but the impact on the individual child who benefited from its use could be significant. Without such a provision, a child could be left in limbo for too long, subject to a compulsory supervision order that did not provide the support that the child needed. Decisions around such provisions send a clear message to children about whether they are at the centre of the hearings system, as they always should be. I argue that the provisions of the bill demonstrate clearly that children are at the centre.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21101674", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 28 &#8212; Sheriff: pre-condition for making certain orders and warrants"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There has been intense lobbying on the issue over the past week or so.

If it is to work effectively, we need to strike the right balance between collecting useful information and placing new burdens on local authorities.</p><p>It follows that I do not support the amendments to the feedback loop provisions that the committee accepted at stage 2. They would require the provision of quarterly feedback to all panel members on each supervision order that is put in place. We should think about that for a moment. There are around 13,000 children under compulsory supervision at present. To prepare four reports each year for each of them and to provide those reports to each of the three panel members would involve the production of more than 150,000 such reports each year, which I do not believe is proportionate.</p><p>Even if reports were brief and were to be provided on a six or 12-monthly basis, there would still be tens of thousands of them, which would have a significant impact on the workload of social work departments and the delivery of services.</p><p>Of even greater concern than the workload and bureaucracy that would be created is the amount of confidential information about children that would be flying around the system. It is clear that panel members need that information to take decisions at hearings, and there are safeguards in place to ensure that it is handled appropriately&#8212;for example, panel members leave the papers with their reporters straight after the hearings. A whole new system of safeguards would be needed if they were to get more personal information as has been suggested. It is particularly concerning if the information is not directly related to the hearings that they are about to attend.</p><p>It is worth noting that panel members do not want that information, and have expressed concern that the amendments that were accepted at stage 2 would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"place an extraordinary bureaucratic burden on local authorities and divert precious resources away from child protection\".</p><p>They recommend that the Parliament should delete those amendments, and that is what my amendment 97 proposes. In lodging it, however, I was conscious of the calls at stage 2 for the bill to contain more detail about the information to be collected through the feedback loop. I have sought to provide that through my amendment 98, which gives the national convener the power to collect <place-holder colnum=\"30774\"/> information on the implementation and impact of supervision orders, to feed that information back to panel members annually on an anonymised and aggregated basis, and to lay it before the Parliament. I believe that that offers a reasonable and proportionate way forward.</p><p>Ken Macintosh's amendment 98A seeks to make it more explicit that the information that is gathered should include outcome data&#8212;that is, data on how the wellbeing of children has been affected. I see merit in that and I am happy to support his amendment.</p><p>Amendment 5 would remove a provision that was contained in another amendment that was agreed to at stage 2. Section 11A requires children's hearings Scotland to monitor and review the operation of the hearings system. There are clear links between that provision and the feedback loop in that both seek the gathering of information on how the system is working.

The amendment introduces a new order called an interim variation of the compulsory supervision order, which will apply when the child is subject to a compulsory supervision order and, at a review hearing, the hearing defers a substantive decision for the purposes, perhaps, of further investigation.

I have heard a number of interesting suggestions this evening and I undertake either to follow them up or to pass them on to colleagues.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly with Aileen Campbell's assertion that the children of prisoners are often the innocent and forgotten victims of crime, and I congratulate her on raising the subject for debate today.</p><p>The report, which was produced by the children's commissioner and Families Outside, confirms what, I suspect, we know already, which is that the impact of a parent's imprisonment can cause huge sadness and emotional turmoil for children&#8212;a number of members have mentioned that it is akin to a bereavement in the family. The report also highlights that the rights and views of children very often appear to be forgotten or ignored. That is, frankly, unacceptable. However, there is already a great deal happening to address those issues. I will summarise some of the activities that are under way.</p><p>Aileen Campbell knows that the Scottish Government supported her proposed amendment to the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, which would have required courts to have regard to the parental circumstances of an offender when considering sentencing. I am sorry that the amendment was defeated, but we need to move on.</p><p>We are currently revising the guidance on social inquiry reports, which were mentioned by Aileen Campbell, Anne McLaughlin and Richard Simpson. The children's commissioner and Families Outside have provided input into the content of the revised guidance, which will stress the importance of identifying the impact of sentences on families and children.</p><p>At a more strategic level, we are working with our local partners to turn round Scotland's deeply entrenched and intergenerational cycles of poverty, poor health, poor educational outcomes, deprivation and unemployment&#8212;the circumstances and environments in which crime and criminality can thrive. If we can break those cycles, we can get at the very roots of the issues that we are discussing today and reduce the risks of future generations facing the same problems.<place-holder colnum=\"28036\"/></p><p>We are in this for the long haul, but our social policy frameworks on improving outcomes in the early years and tackling poverty and health inequalities are aimed firmly at moving from managing crises once they have happened to an agenda of prevention, early identification, early intervention and multi-agency support that is built around the needs of the individual. As Hugh O'Donnell said, those are the principles that underpin the getting it right for every child programme.</p><p>We launched the guide to implementing GIRFEC at the children's summit last week, which was chaired by Tam Baillie, the children's commissioner. The GIRFEC approach is aimed at meeting the needs of every child, regardless of the needs and circumstances of that child. The needs of children of prisoners are certainly part and parcel of that approach, and we must also ensure that there are stronger links between adult and children's services, so that no child falls between services and the full range of circumstances that affect the child's wellbeing are known of by all relevant service providers.</p><p>The rights of the child are central to the issues that we are discussing today. As many members will be aware, the Government has done much to embed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in our policies, to improve outcomes for all our children and young people.</p><p>The wellbeing of children of prisoners was selected as one of the key priority areas for action in \"Do the Right Thing\", the Scottish Government's response to the concluding observations from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. Our colleagues in the Scottish Prison Service are already delivering or developing a full range of actions to meet the needs of prisoners and children. Children and families groups have been established in almost every Scottish prison, and they are working to good-practice guidelines that were developed by the SPS children and families strategy group.</p><p>New SPS child protection policies and procedures will reflect the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and GIRFEC.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm mentioned the need for assessment of the impact of parental imprisonment on children's rights. SPS has started to use just such an assessment tool. SPS also funds the Families Outside helpline and continues to work alongside local authorities and other partners to ensure that the impact of parental imprisonment is minimised as far as possible. The Scottish Government provides about &#163;133,000 per annum to support Families Outside's running costs.<place-holder colnum=\"28037\"/></p><p>There are certainly shared concerns and a shared wish by all those who are involved in supporting children and families to improve the lives and emotional wellbeing of children who have a parent in prison. The report by the commissioner and Families Outside provides more evidence to show just how much damage can be caused to a child and must give us all further impetus to do more.</p><p>I agree with Aileen Campbell's view, as expressed in her motion, that our work with the SPS and other partners must be done on a cross-party basis, and I hope that what we do in the Parliament will move on into the next session as well. Children's needs must be our collective focal point.

I have undertaken to do that over the summer in the run-up to stage 2. I hope that colleagues on the committee will help in that regard through the scrutiny process, and that we will be able to agree on the way forward.</p><p>The bill has been a long time coming, but I make no apology for that, as it is the first significant reform of the children's hearings system since the Parliament was established. I do not apologise for the number or detail of discussions that I and my officials have undertaken since this time last year, or for changing our minds on some of the issues once we had spoken to and discussed them with stakeholders.</p><p>Although some of that process was challenging, we now have a stronger bill and a clearer recognition of the need for change. The Scottish Government has worked hard with its partners, wider stakeholders and the committee to deliver a better constructed and much needed piece of legislation. I accept that the job is not finished yet, and I expect stage 2 to be intensive.</p><p>Our diverse partner groups have helped to guide and shape the direction of the bill through their expertise and active participation in the consultation. That collective commitment serves to emphasise the broad support for the bill and for <place-holder colnum=\"27357\"/> putting in place robust arrangements to secure the future of the children's hearings system in Scotland.</p><p>Of course, there are still differences that need to be worked through but I am clear that the Government is doing its job in balancing all the conflicting views that we received. I listened to those who wanted to contribute their views and, when appropriate, acted on them. Even in some of the policy areas where the Government's position and that of key partners fundamentally diverged, we identified compromises that achieve the vast majority of what was desired. I suggest that that is the way in which we should proceed.</p><p>I also recognise that the bill is only one thread of the new approach to the children's hearings system. That is why we have started planning for the implementation work that will be required to support the bill and the wider reform programme should Parliament consent to the bill's enactment, as I hope it will. As members will know, an implementation working group has already been created and is looking at a range of priority issues. Again, that work typifies the huge amount of time and energy that lay people and professionals give to the hearings system. I noted that members across the chamber emphasised time and again their experience of the commitment and contribution of local panel members and others in the system. I give Margaret Smith the assurance that she sought that the involvement of partners in the shaping of the legislation will continue.</p><p>I continue to be mightily impressed by the commitment and dedication of partners, for which I am very grateful. Their commitment ensures that the system works well in some parts of the country at present, but I do not believe that it adds up to a coherent and reliable system. The bill proposes the creation of a system of support for panel members that will build on existing strengths and improve flexibility, ease pressure and help to ensure that the hearings system continues to operate smoothly at all times. I am confident that fewer, but larger, area support teams can meet local needs. The bill provides an opportunity to put in place support that not only meets the needs of panel members, but makes best and efficient use of resources while improving the effectiveness of that support and ensuring that it can adapt to meet future demands. We do not expect that the support provided under the new arrangements will vary hugely from best practice, but we want to ensure that best practice covers the country. It is not about adding new or additional tasks; it is about the best support being available consistently to all panel members across Scotland. Christina McKelvie highlighted that point.</p><p>I also know that Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People, children's <place-holder colnum=\"27358\"/> organisations and others are keen on a strengthening of children's rights, including their right to be heard. We need to put that at the heart of the system. We recently supported work by the Children's Parliament that took the views of children on their experience of the hearings system. The bill already provides for the voice of the child to be taken into account, but we want to do more than that. That is why we are discussing the voice of the child in the children's hearings system with stakeholders across the country.</p><p>We want children to be able to participate effectively in hearings, but we do not think that the bill needs a statutory right of advocacy support for children, and the committee supports that view. In supporting children to participate and engage before, during and after a hearing, we must ensure that support is tailored to the needs and preferences of the child. The committee asked us to consider how a report on the child's views could be provided in advance of a hearing. I acknowledge that that raises issues that need to be addressed, and I will ensure that our consideration is taken forward in full discussion with partners.</p><p>There has been much discussion this afternoon about the feedback loop, which will enable the national convener to create a picture of how local authorities are responding to compulsory supervision orders. I say to Claire Baker, Ken Macintosh and others that the local feedback mechanism is inherent in the process, in that the national convener will collect the information from the local authority and it will be disseminated through the area support teams to local panel members. Having that information will allow the panel a better understanding of the types of supervision that have proved effective, which in turn could help to inform future decision making and thus achieve better outcomes for children&#8212;I note that Des McNulty suggested we need to improve outcomes. The feedback loop will also allow the national convener to identify areas of good practice around the country that can be shared more widely. The committee has asked for more detail around the operation of the feedback loop, and I will ensure that work is done on that with the full engagement of partners.</p><p>On safeguarders, I have heard views that their role should be included and that Lord Gill's recommendations should be addressed. However, there is a striking similarity between the intentions behind the bill's regulation-making powers and the improvements that Lord Gill suggested should be made, which is evidence that Lord Gill and the bill&#8212;and, indeed, Ken Macintosh&#8212;have correctly identified the areas of potential improvement. Lord Gill suggested that the various partners should work together to drive forward those improvements. Use of the regulation-making <place-holder colnum=\"27359\"/> powers that the bill provides will allow safeguarders to lead the way on that agenda. In fact, those very points will be discussed with more than 70 safeguarders in Edinburgh next week. I anticipate being able to provide a positive report on progress to the committee in due course.</p><p>The bill's progress offers us all new opportunities and sets us all challenges. We will never take the outstanding contribution that our lay people make to work in this area for granted, but I know that I can rely on the enthusiasm and commitment of our key players throughout the process as we strive to improve the life chances of our most vulnerable children and young people.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20850582", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I acknowledge that there could be a problem with that and that I have further work to do to provide information, further explanation and reassurances.

I have no doubt that the bill is not only necessary, but vital if we are to improve, strengthen and protect our unique children's hearings system&#8212;a system of which we are all rightly proud. I continue to be inspired by the work and commitment of those who work in the hearings system, and particularly those who do so on a voluntary basis.</p><p>In 2008-09, 47,178 children were referred to the children's reporter. In proposing reform, I am committed to ensuring that every child who is referred is served by a system that continues to abide by the Kilbrandon principles. The bill and the wider reforms protect the ethos that children who offend and those who require care and protection equally deserve to be considered as children in need, and that the welfare of the child is of paramount importance. However, there is no getting away from the fact that family life has changed since Kilbrandon reported in 1964. Families now face very different challenges to those that they faced 40 years ago, and the challenges that are faced by the system have changed as well.</p><p>In the early years of the hearings system, a relatively small number of children were referred to it on care and protection grounds. In 1972, 3,062 children were referred on such grounds compared with 21,594 children on offence grounds. The change in recent years is startling. In 2008-09, 39,105 children were referred on care and protection grounds. Our children's hearings system now deals with more than 10 times the number of care and protection cases that it dealt with in 1972. That is why we must have a system that is capable of dealing with the challenges that are presented today and in the future.</p><p>The Government is committed to improving the lives of all children and young people who are at risk, and that commitment is shared by members throughout the chamber. Reform of the children's hearings system is just one aspect of the activity that the Government has under way in that regard. <place-holder colnum=\"27314\"/></p><p>Members will already be familiar with the early years framework and the getting it right for every child agenda, both of which are relevant to this debate.</p><p>The children's hearings system considers the toughest cases for our most vulnerable children, where compulsory measures might be needed. Life-changing decisions that affect fundamental rights are made by panel members every day. With all that is at stake, those decisions have to be right, so they need to be taken by people who feel confident and are fully supported to take them, and the best interests of the child must be paramount in those decisions.</p><p>Everything in the bill and our wider reforms leads back to the child. We must ensure that the child is at the centre of the hearing and is supported and encouraged to participate and engage in the discussions; that panel members are suitably skilled, trained and supported to engage effectively with the child; that the hearing takes place in an open, fair and consistent way and that every decision is made in that context; that the child feels that they are listened to and heard by the hearing and sees that reflected in the decisions that are made; and that the child gets the full range of services that are required to implement decisions. That needs to happen everywhere and in every case, and the bill directly contributes to meeting those principles.</p><p>In my evidence to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, I set out why the system needs to change. We all recognise that change can be uncomfortable and challenging, but when we take a minute to consider what is at stake&#8212;the lives of our most vulnerable children&#8212;we have no other option. We need to continue to work together to deliver change and ensure that it is the right change. I am enormously grateful to all those who continue to give their time to work through that process with us.</p><p>The most striking feature about that engagement is the number of people who arrive thinking that the system works just fine, not only in their area but across the board, until they get round the table with others in the system, start to discuss the differences in practice and hear for themselves the problems encountered by a lot of people in a lot of areas. Feedback from recent events indicated that for some they had been a real eye-opener. We are all united by the desire to make the best possible provision for Scotland's most vulnerable children, which is why I have involved the Parliament throughout the engagement process. I wrote to members between last autumn and spring this year to involve them and their constituents.</p><p>We cannot continue to have a system that has so many variances in practice and to explain them <place-holder colnum=\"27315\"/> away simply as being down to local flexibility. Yes, some areas work very well, but too many do not. I know that children's panel advisory committee volunteers have reacted strongly to that message, but I stress that that is not a criticism of the volunteers, but an identified weakness in the current system. I know from my conversations with CPAC volunteers and panel members that many agree that the standardisation of processes and standards and proper accountability are very much welcomed. Progress has been made, but we are not there yet.</p><p>The bill and wider reforms provide a unique opportunity to ensure that current best practice becomes the benchmark as we go forward; indeed, that is the only way of ensuring that all panel members are fully supported to make the right decisions for our most vulnerable children. The establishment of the national convener and of children's hearings Scotland will provide the structures needed to deliver this change, and I was heartened to see that 86 per cent of panel chairs support the establishment of that body.</p><p>The national convener will ensure that agreed national standards are met and will provide a national voice for panel members. I see no conflict with regard to the carrying out of this role. Let me be clear: the national convener will not be all powerful. He or she will advocate for panel members, not for the whole of the children's hearings system. Committee members will perhaps recall that during her evidence session the principal reporter said that she did not</p><p class=\"indent\">\"have a problem with reconciling that aspect, which is to be critical of one's own organisation's performance in order to improve it.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 21 April 2010; c 3451.]</p><p>I have noted the committee's concern about parliamentary scrutiny of the national convener's future work. In clearly setting out the national convener's responsibilities and functions, the bill allows the flexibility to ensure that support meets any current or future needs that might emerge. Moreover, as with the principal reporter and the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration, the national convener and children's hearings Scotland can be held to account by the Parliament through the annual reporting process.</p><p>I am convinced that the scale of the reforms is wholly proportionate to achieving our objectives. Indeed it is wholly appropriate when one considers that the children's hearings system is the biggest tribunal in Scotland and the only one without a dedicated supporting body. That is incredible, especially when one remembers that it supports Scotland's most vulnerable children and is delivered largely by lay people.</p><p>As a result, I am delighted that the committee has acknowledged those issues in its stage 1 <place-holder colnum=\"27316\"/> report and it gives me great satisfaction that the committee</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recommends to the Parliament that the general principles of the Bill be agreed.\"</p><p>I am particularly pleased that the committee recognises that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the opportunities that\"</p><p>children's hearings Scotland</p><p class=\"indent\">\"will provide for promoting consistency in quality standards across the country can be grasped without undermining the principle of local community involvement.\"</p><p>Indeed, I share that view. The bill puts in place a framework that will maintain the connection that panel members have with children and their local communities and provides an opportunity to improve local connections and local support to panel members across Scotland.</p><p>However, it is important to note that although it agrees to the bill's general principles, the committee has raised concerns in a number of areas. I recognise that we need to do further work and I am committed to making this bill the best that it can be. For example, I gave the committee an undertaking to address concerns about the retention and disclosure of information about children referred to a hearing on offence grounds.</p><p>I also recognise that the committee and others have concerns about new provisions in the bill on the determination of relevant person status. The points that were made on that issue in the committee's report will, like all other points, be given positive consideration, and further information will be provided to the committee as requested.</p><p>There has been wide support for providing the hearing with the means to preserve a child's confidentiality where appropriate. The bill makes new provision that would allow for that in certain circumstances. However, I understand the concerns that have been raised on the difficulties of balancing such a power with the need to respect individual rights. I will consider that issue further with a view to finding a solution that addresses concerns that have been raised.</p><p>In summary, I am happy to work through the issues that have been raised and will provide the information that the committee has requested in order to provide clarity and reassurance to it, the Parliament and our partners. I am clear that the bill will deliver the key elements of the system that our partners have told us that they want. It retains local support for panel members, local authority involvement in that support, the involvement of lay people, and children's hearings in children's local communities.<place-holder colnum=\"27317\"/></p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20850582", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to discuss the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill this afternoon.

I thank the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee for securing the debate and I thank my parliamentary colleagues for their speeches.</p><p>This Government is committed to improving the lives of children who have additional support needs. Providing help when it is needed is both the right thing to do and an investment in our future. That is why we introduced the bill that led to the passing of the 2009 act, which had the aim of creating a stronger and better system for supporting children's learning, and for ensuring that all children and young people receive the additional support that is required to enable them to meet their individual needs and to become successful learners.</p><p>The code of practice explains the duties that have been placed on education authorities and other agencies to support children's learning. We have revised and updated the code of practice in order to reflect the changes that were made by the 2009 act and to respond to requests for further clarification and information. During the parliamentary debates on the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill in 2009, I gave a commitment that the redrafted code would place the legislation in the context of the current policies of getting it right for every child, the early years framework and curriculum for excellence; that it would provide further clarification of the term \"significant\" in the phrase \"significant additional support\", the need for which is one of the criteria for a co-ordinated support plan; and that it would clarify the process of making placing requests. The revised code of practice addresses each of those commitments.</p><p>In its report on the code of practice, the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee raised a number of issues around consultation and co-ordinated support plans. I want to respond briefly to those comments. The <place-holder colnum=\"26549\"/> Government held a public consultation exercise between 5 October 2009 and 8 January 2010, in which we sought comments on the proposed changes to the code of practice; 4,400 letters were issued inviting comments. Because I recognise the importance of engaging with parents on such an important issue, we commissioned Children in Scotland to host five consultation and information events across the country. As well as the formal consultation, we established an additional support for learning implementation group, which comprises key stakeholders, including representatives from parent groups, to support and inform implementation of the 2009 act and finalisation of the code of practice. That group will continue its work, and we will look to enhance its membership with additional parent reps.</p><p>I understand that committee members raised some important questions about co-ordinated support plans. The code of practice includes detailed information on the content and format of a CSP. It clearly sets out what is required and expected of education authorities as regards timescales, engagement and consultation. It also sets out the duties on appropriate agencies, such as national health service boards, and the role of the co-ordinator, who is responsible for monitoring provision to ensure that the agreed services are in place and for taking action to secure those services, if necessary.</p><p>I thank everyone who contributed to the consultation process or who attended and contributed to the consultation events, members of the additional support for learning implementation group, and parliamentary colleagues on the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee. The code aims to help education authorities and other agencies to make effective decisions and to deliver the support that children and young people need to make the most of their education and learning.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20810886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Business Motion: \"Report on supporting children's learning code of practice\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take the opportunity to congratulate Liz Smith on her recent elevation to the front bench.

Members have recognised the financial challenges that exist, which will not be in the gift of any of us to resolve easily, and highlighted the crucial importance of how we work together to manage our way through matters, the critical nature of leadership in looking to the future, and the importance of providing leadership to Scotland's social services from the Parliament. It is recognised that it is essential to Scotland's future economic and social wellbeing&#8212;even in the midst of the current financial difficulties&#8212;that we continue to focus on improving services. It is not good enough to think about only maintaining services, particularly services that we know can be significantly improved.</p><p>I would like to focus on substance misuse, which I did not do so much in my opening remarks. Liz Smith and Murdo Fraser talked about looked-after children and emphasised the number of children who are coming into the system. That has been driven largely by the growth of the problem of drug misuse in our communities in the past couple of decades, which is clearly unacceptable. We will not be able to cope with the numbers that are coming into the looked-after system if we allow the situation to develop without <place-holder colnum=\"25937\"/> checking it. Tackling adult substance misuse specifically, and its effects on children and families, must be a key priority for the Government and the Parliament. We need to ensure that more people recover from drug and alcohol problems so that they can live longer and healthier lives, and so that they can be the parents for their children that they ought to be, to ensure that those children reach their potential through the education system and beyond.</p><p>It is vital, therefore, that we push forward with the national drugs strategy in \"The Road to Recovery: A New Approach to Tackling Scotland's Drug Problem\", which we established within a year of coming into power with the unanimous support of the Parliament. One of the main elements of \"The Road to Recovery\" is in chapter 5, which focuses on children and families.</p><p>It is essential that we bring forward early and effective interventions. Liz Smith mentioned the number of much younger children who are coming into the looked-after children system. We are making progress on that symptom, but it is nonetheless extremely worrying that the numbers are growing so fast. We need to ensure that decisions that are made not only in emergency situations, but for long-term, permanent solutions for those children, are much better than they have been in the past. We all know about the number of placements that children have had and the impact that those placements have had on them and their future prospects. Early and effective decisions on permanent solutions for children who have been taken into care are important. In that regard, I am interested in the experiments by the health board, the local authority and others in Glasgow.</p><p>We know that alcohol consumption is another big problem in Scotland. As recently as the turn of the year, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's ChildLine service in Scotland and Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems produced a report on harmful parental drinking. Alcohol consumption is another major blight on Scottish society that we need to act on. We might disagree about some of the measures in the Alcohol etc (Scotland) Bill, but surely we can agree that we must take much more effective action to reduce alcohol consumption in Scotland.</p><p>I turn to some of the comments that members have made. I will try to answer as many of the points that have been raised as I can.</p><p>Karen Whitefield expressed concerns about maintaining resources for training and professional development as budgets start to be squeezed. Of course, the SSSC has a key role in working with employers, particularly on registration and the promotion of qualifications. Christina McKelvie highlighted the development of the continuous learning framework as an important tool. We will <place-holder colnum=\"25938\"/> continue to fund the SSSC to help the roll-out and embed the use of the continuous learning framework throughout the country.</p><p>The SSSC also helps employers with labour market information for planning purposes. We continue to invest, to the tune of something like &#163;5 million per annum, in the national centres of excellence: the Scottish institute for residential child care; the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability; Scottish training on drugs and alcohol; and the criminal justice social work development centre. We aim to maintain that investment to feed in to workforce development.</p><p>Karen Whitefield mentioned the role of community work. I would be interested to discuss further with her the possibility of a back-to-the-future development on that front.</p><p>Liz Smith and Hugh O'Donnell both referred to the need to reshape care for older people. The way in which we currently deliver services for older people is clearly not sustainable in the longer term and incremental adjustments at the margins are not enough. I said in my opening speech that we need to move towards a more anticipatory and preventive approach, with more rehabilitation, more reablement and a greater emphasis on self-care and supported self-care, with consequential support for unpaid carers and volunteers.</p><p>We now need to move forward, although not necessarily with an independent inquiry&#8212;as Liz Smith knows, we do not agree with the Conservatives' idea of having an independent inquiry. We need to engage with the people of Scotland and ask them to tell us what they think fair care for older people should look like. We are embarking on a public engagement programme along with partners in the national health service and local authorities. We are engaging with front-line staff and members of the public to gather vital information on how we can move forward.</p><p>How do we cope with cuts? Des McNulty indicated that we cannot continue with more of the same. We must look to redesign our services. I have been encouraged by the results that are coming through from the GIRFEC Highland pathfinder evaluation. Significant business benefits are to be gained by stripping out a lot of the bureaucracy and multiple form filling and by getting people to work much closer together, as significant cost savings are involved. It remains to be seen how far that will take us, but I believe that moving in that direction is the way to go.</p><p>Ken Macintosh mentioned the management of workload and the stresses on front-line practitioners, in particular social workers. As part of the changing lives agenda, we are bringing forward a practice governance framework, one of the key elements of which is supervision. Effective <place-holder colnum=\"25939\"/> supervision is the key to ensuring that social workers and social care staff are properly supported, that workloads are managed and that a work-life balance is maintained for staff, which is important. As Karen Whitefield mentioned, it is important that staff are able actively to get engaged in their development. Guidance is being prepared to take forward that agenda.</p><p>Irene Oldfather asked about the dementia strategy, which will be available early in June. I hope that that reassures her.</p><p>Maureen Watt referred to staff numbers. Some of the discussion of that issue is slightly ill informed, as the figures are derived from the latest local government quarterly statistics, which have been affected this year by Glasgow's creation of wholly owned private companies. That has taken about 2,500 social services staff out of the statistics.</p><p>Murdo Fraser mentioned the importance of the voluntary sector. Community Care Providers Scotland has provided a submission for the debate. We recognise the important contribution and innovative approaches that voluntary sector organisations provide in relation to care and support services in our communities. I do not want to see any diminution of that contribution. I have been concerned of late by a tendency at local authority level to look to ditch support for some non-statutory services, which is a big mistake in the long run. We may be able to tackle the issue through the development of our community planning partnership approach and single outcome agreements, but we need to get all the various partners much closer together on that front.</p><p>I am sure that I have missed one or two points, but I should move to a conclusion. The social problems facing the people of Scotland are incredibly complex, but we are reforming our social services. Doing that requires leadership and the active involvement of everyone in the statutory, voluntary and independent sectors, who must bend their practices, resources and creativity to delivering the personalised services that will improve outcomes for individuals, families and communities. We strongly believe that developing the social services workforce is essential. Put simply and plainly, Scotland as a nation needs to do that if we are to achieve our ambition.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Services Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Des McNulty for his extended exposition.

That review identified many examples of services that were transforming and protecting lives and communities, but it also found a social work profession and services that were under great pressure, lacking in confidence and not delivering to their full potential. Both those who worked in services and those who received services felt that there was a growing mismatch between the important values and expectations of social work services and their actual experience. It was also clear that social services alone could not solve society's problems. Change was needed; more of the same was not an option.</p><p>To deliver on the aspirations in \"Changing Lives\", our key focus has been on developing a confident, competent and valued workforce and delivering personalised services that improve outcomes for individuals, families and communities.</p><p>The Social Work Inspection Agency overview report on the findings from its independent inspections of all 32 local authorities in the past five years tells us what has been happening in social services in Scotland. It confirmed:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The messages are clear; the majority of people of all ages who use services and their carers have valued them and think they have made positive differences to their lives. Staff who provide services are committed and look for ways to improve the services they offer to people.\"</p><p>There are excellent examples of support and services that are flexible and responsive to the <place-holder colnum=\"25904\"/> needs of service users and carers, and which meet the demands of change. For example, smart, plug-in technology is being used in West Lothian, where unobtrusive electronic movement sensors, coupled with flexible, responsive and joined-up care-at-home services, are not only supporting people to stay in their own homes but proving to be a catalyst for changing the culture of the workforce, reducing demarcation across staff and agencies, maximising flexibility and encouraging an adaptive approach as people's needs change.</p><p>There are many services that allow people to be active participants in shaping, creating and delivering their care to meet their needs. That personalisation is at the core of services for older people in North Lanarkshire, where systems are in place for agreeing with people what their day care needs are, whether they need a meal, some company or the chance to pursue a hobby, and for measuring whether those outcomes have been achieved.</p><p>There are also many examples of cases in which collaborative work is done with partners to wrap services around people instead of sending them from pillar to post, from agency to agency. Local resource centres in Clackmannanshire, Aberdeenshire, East Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, and Shetland offer a mix of services for older people, such as home care, integrated day care, care housing, respite care and carer support, all of which are delivered from one centre. In South Lanarkshire, social work and education services do effective joint working, which involves young people in residential care sitting down with professionals to consider what they need. The result is that they get a good standard of education, complemented by appropriate support, which helps to improve their future prospects.</p><p>As we go forward, it is crucial that there is a focus on early intervention and prevention, that we avoid the escalation of service needs, that we manage risk and that we provide improved outcomes. We know how important that is in improving children's life chances and choices and what happens in the rest of their lives, but such an approach can also support older people to live in the community, independently and with dignity, for as long as possible.</p><p>Approaches such as the befriending service in East Dunbartonshire, which recruits people with limited mobility to provide telephone support to others, or the good morning West Dunbartonshire service, whereby socially isolated older people are called daily to check on their wellbeing, can increase the resources that are available to help people and can tackle issues before more specialist intervention is required. There are many more examples of people's lives being improved day in and day out by front-line practitioners <place-holder colnum=\"25905\"/> working collaboratively with others to make a difference.</p><p>However, SWIA indicated that provision was variable across the range of services for adults and children that are provided throughout Scotland and that there were wide differences in levels of services and funding but, reassuringly, it reported that its recommendations for improvement were acted on in the vast majority of cases. Evidence of that was provided during follow-up inspections. Improvement is continuous.</p><p>The SWIA report challenges local authorities and their partners to examine where they stand in relation to the key features of high-performing areas and to consider how they can learn and improve. It clearly points out the shortcomings across a range of services, which I expect local authorities to examine in the light of their own services and local needs.</p><p>It might be expected that the level of funding is the key driver of performance and the ability to make a difference, but SWIA's report emphasises that leadership, rather than the level of spending on services or an area's deprivation level, or even its rurality, is critical to the performance of social work services. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Leadership was of critical importance in the performance of social work services.\"</p><p>It impacts</p><p class=\"indent\">\"on outcomes for people who use social work services\"</p><p>and, crucially, on \"staff morale and confidence\". A clear link exists between good performance in the delivery of social work services and the presence of good leadership, not just operational or professional leadership, but corporate leadership, including that from elected members. That is an important finding as we move forward.</p><p>The agenda continues to be challenging and, as the Labour amendment points out, significant demographic changes are coming down the line. There are also wider changes, not least of which is the squeeze on our financial resources in the immediate future.</p><p>In his report on the \"Outlook for Scottish Government Expenditure\", which was published earlier this month, the chief economic adviser to the Scottish Government indicated that Scotland enjoyed</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a period of sustained real increases in the resources available to fund public services\"</p><p>between 2001 and 2009-10.</p><p>Although we do not yet know the exact details of the size and composition of tightening in the United Kingdom to bring down borrowing, it is clear that public spending will be subjected to a period of significant constraint in the years ahead. <place-holder colnum=\"25906\"/></p><p>That could mean five consecutive years of real-terms cuts in the Scottish budget, which could be between &#163;3.5 billion and &#163;4 billion lower in real terms by 2014-15. Such an outlook for future funding requires realism and a genuine willingness to put aside a silo mentality. We need to focus on what can be done collaboratively with the available resources. We need strong, focused and purposeful leadership at national and local level. The Government will continue to work with key partners to achieve our purpose of sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Community planning partnerships can be key vehicles by working strategically to manage combined resources to deliver joined-up health, social care and educational support. A more strategic approach to planning and commissioning within and across agencies, with stronger links between financial plans and service plans, is required. The skills, expertise and creativity of the people who work in services must be fully utilised, whether that is in the statutory, voluntary or private sector. Opportunities to share training, develop common skills and break down culture, language and technology barriers must be identified and grasped.</p><p>We must encourage and support the capacity of people, families and communities to be part of the solution and actively work with services, whether through developments in self-directed support and direct payments, through taking the budget and responsibility for their own care package where appropriate, or through just being good neighbours and looking out for the wellbeing of others. Shifting the focus towards anticipatory and preventive approaches rather than responding when need, cost and impact on the individual have escalated is at the heart of the Government's policies, and it needs to be embedded.</p><p>Underpinning all that is the need to continue to value and develop the workforce, whether in the statutory, voluntary or private sector. I welcome the opportunity to acknowledge the excellent work that is being done. I am clear that we are not starting from a zero base; great strides have been made in Scotland in recent years. However, in taking up the challenges that we face, we will need realism, resilience and a genuine willingness to make the transformational change to continue to improve outcomes for the people of Scotland.</p><p>I look forward to this afternoon's debate.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises the significant contribution made to the lives of the people of Scotland by all those who work in social services, often in difficult and complex circumstances; agrees the need for a confident, competent and valued social services workforce to deliver safe, effective and personalised practice; notes the work that has been done following the review of social work <place-holder colnum=\"25907\"/> services, Changing Lives; notes the finding from the performance inspections of the Social Work Inspection Agency that leadership is of critical importance in the performance of social work services; welcomes the focus on leadership being jointly taken forward by the Scottish Social Services Council and the four social services learning networks, and endorses the need for political, operational and professional leadership and engagement to support and develop the social services workforce.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Services Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to have today's debate and to recognise the important contribution that is made to the lives of the people of Scotland by all those who work in social services, whether in the statutory, voluntary or private sector.

They are part of our society now, and they will mould the way in which Scotland develops and performs in the future. We need to create an environment in which children flourish and can fulfil their potential. By \"we\" I mean all of Scotland. As the 2002 child protection report stated, \"It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright\".</p><p>GIRFEC has a similar high-level objective: improving outcomes for every child and young person. That is a high aspiration, and it will not be achieved overnight, but it is a goal that we must all aim for. The goal was set by the previous Administration and it secured considerable support, but children, families and practitioners all want to know what it means for them. Since we took office, we have been working with partners to turn the aspiration into practical reality, to test it and to show that it can work.</p><p>The evaluation that has been carried out reports on the experience of pathfinder projects, especially in Highland. The evaluation report is lengthy and detailed. The message is that, at this stage in the journey, GIRFEC works. GIRFEC means improved outcomes, better information sharing and reduced bureaucracy. It ensures that children's views are heard and taken into account, and it places the child at the centre. Those are all issues that were raised in the report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education, \"How well do we protect Scotland's children?\", which was published last week. GIRFEC shows how improvements can be made in those areas.</p><p>To ensure that GIRFEC works, we need joint leadership, commitment, planning and training, building on good multi-agency working. Practitioners and management need to reconfigure how they work into a single planning process across all agencies. That means working in a common language, to capture and share concerns, and engaging with families at every stage. That is major, transformational change, and I pay tribute to all the people who are working through that change.</p><p>GIRFEC can make a difference. In Highland, 29 different processes for dealing with children have been distilled into one main planning process. Any <place-holder colnum=\"21891\"/> activity is part of one plan for a child. As a result, fewer meetings are required and support is provided more quickly. Further work is under way on savings in the workload of key staff, the number of meetings that are held and so on. A report will be produced in March. However, the initial signs are that one meeting is needed instead of the three or four that were held previously, non-offence referrals from the police to the reporter are down 70 per cent, and staff in health, schools and social work are noting that time is being freed up from writing reports, so there can be more direct work with children. Therefore, there are considerable benefits to be gained. As the ability to share information electronically throughout Scotland comes on stream in about 2011, there will be enhanced benefits.</p><p>If the approach is to be fully effective, there must be a common language among practitioners. The wellbeing indicators and the GIRFEC model provide that. The evaluation shows that after an initial period of anxiety and concern practitioners across all agencies found that the model works well. The approach requires on-going training and use, but it helps to build trust and produces more targeted and better-quality information. It also provides the basis for measuring improvements in outcomes.</p><p>The motion and the amendment, which I am happy to support, refer to frameworks and how systems operate. That is right; those are the tools that the Parliament can use to create the environment in which change can happen. However, we must always remember that GIRFEC places the individual child at the centre of those frameworks. GIRFEC is the methodology that delivers the frameworks. It provides a personalised approach to service delivery.</p><p>That should mean that the child and their family are involved; that action is discussed and agreed with them; that there are as few meetings as possible; that the help that is provided is co-ordinated and seamless; that they understand why action is being proposed and what it is meant to achieve; and that they understand their roles and responsibilities. The evaluation report notes that that is happening under GIRFEC. Parents feel that there is one team to support them and understand better what is planned. When the wellbeing model is used to explain action, parents appear more willing to engage with and trust services.</p><p>There is much more detail in the full report, which sets out the complex interactions across all the services and the journey that has been taken to implement GIRFEC. Further work is needed, including on greater involvement with the adult sector and on extending the reach into the health service, where midwives and health visitors have been the prime focus to date.<place-holder colnum=\"21892\"/></p><p>The evaluation is of progress to date. Further short thematic reports will be issued during the next four months, drawing on the report that we have published and more up-to-date information, which is being gathered. We need to understand better the impact on longer-term outcomes and how the changes that have been introduced can be maintained.</p><p>In spring we will consult on the review of the 1998 child protection guidance. The review is set in the context of GIRFEC. It will bring powerful changes to child protection in Scotland and will build on the years of good work that started with the reform programme. It will embed a multi-agency, child-centred approach to ensuring that our most vulnerable children are identified, supported and, above all, kept safe.</p><p>We are developing a national toolkit for risk assessment, in response to what child protection practitioners have asked for and in response to the recent HMIE report. It will be founded on the GIRFEC model and the principles that are working well in Highland and elsewhere. With GIRFEC, we will make a step change in the way that all professionals who deal with at-risk children work with one another, among families and for children.</p><p>I commend the GIRFEC approach. Over the coming months, we will encourage community planning partnerships to ask themselves what they are doing to implement it and to secure for their agencies the resource benefits and for their children and young people the improved outcomes that it provides.</p><p>On the back of the positive evaluation report, we will produce an implementation guide that draws on the experiences to date of the pathfinders. The guide will set out the various steps and stages that have been found to work; the time needed for and the phasing of the work; and, most important, the tools that have been demonstrated to make a difference.</p><p>I am encouraged by the support for the GIRFEC approach from various partners. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has welcomed the evaluation report, the findings of which will provide all authorities and their community planning partners with the foundations to debate the relative merits of GIRFEC and its component parts in their local areas. The Association of Directors of Social Work and the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland have both voiced their support for GIRFEC. Time prevents me from quoting others, such the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration, Barnardos and Action for Children.</p><p>Momentum is building in support of change, and we are hugely encouraged by the evaluation, which affirms that the underlying concept of <place-holder colnum=\"21893\"/> GIRFEC is right. It can be done. The development work has been progressed. We now wish to move to full implementation and will engage with community planning partnerships throughout Scotland.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament supports the Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) approach; commends Highland and the other pathfinder programmes for their work in developing the approach; notes progress under the eCare framework to enable secure, targeted information sharing across Scotland; welcomes the report by the University of Edinburgh on progress to date, particularly with regard to the pathfinder programme in Highland; welcomes Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education's summary report on its first round of multi-agency children's services inspections as providing a clear and comprehensive picture of how children's services are operating across Scotland, and encourages work to further develop and implement the GIRFEC approach as a means of public services and the third sector working with parents and communities to improve outcomes for children and deliver the Early Years Framework, Achieving our Potential, and Equally Well.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20432759", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Getting it Right for Every Child"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is no more important task than ensuring that we get it right for Scotland's children.

It is not the first time that she has done so; she has been a doughty fighter on the issue. I also congratulate every other speaker in the debate who has passionately advocated the overturning of a wrong that continues to be perpetrated in our name and in our country. The sooner we can remove the stain on our reputation as a civilised country, the better.</p><p>The Scottish Government remains fundamentally opposed to the detention of children in Dungavel and to dawn raids. We have made it clear that asylum seekers and refugees must be treated fairly and humanely, and must be welcomed and supported while they are in Scotland. The Scottish Government believes in the integration of asylum seekers from day one. We firmly believe that that policy is in the best interests of not only asylum seekers but the settled community.</p><p>We have heard many examples of the contribution that asylum seekers make to their <place-holder colnum=\"21786\"/> communities and the void that is left when they leave. Although we understand that not everyone can stay&#8212;I am sure that members understand that there are people whom we would not want in Scotland&#8212;we firmly believe that the detention of children in Dungavel is totally unacceptable.</p><p>As members know, the Scottish Government is committed to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and to promoting and supporting the rights of all children in Scotland, no matter what their country of origin. That is why we have been working with partners, including Glasgow City Council, the Scottish Refugee Council and the UK Border Agency, to improve the experience of children who are seeking asylum in Scotland, where we have the power to do so. That includes giving young asylum seekers equal access to further and higher education, and we are working with Glasgow City Council to ensure that the children of asylum seekers can access free nursery places.</p><p>We are doing what we can within our powers, but we are unable to decide which families can stay in Scotland and which should leave, nor can we decide what should happen to families with children when they have been told that they cannot stay. At present, families whose asylum claims have been refused and who are not willing to leave voluntarily are forcibly removed and may be detained in Dungavel. Although we understand the principle that a child should not be separated from a parent who has reached that stage in their asylum application, we do not agree that Dungavel is an appropriate place for a child.</p><p>However, we are not just content to criticise. We have been taking a constructive approach to exploring alternatives to detention for families. For example, the family returns pilot project, which has been developed in a partnership involving the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the UK Border Agency and the International Organization for Migration, provides a range of support to up to five families at any time and is aimed at reducing the number of children who are held in Dungavel and at encouraging and assisting the families' voluntary return. The pilot project, which is the first of its kind in Scotland, was launched on 12 May and will run for three years.</p><p>Voluntary return is widely recognised as being by far the best option for asylum seekers who have reached the end of the asylum process and have failed in their application. It is a more humane approach that enables families to prepare themselves more effectively for return. The project offers additional support to assist families in making the transition to ensure that, even if they do not choose to return voluntarily, they will be better prepared for their return.<place-holder colnum=\"21787\"/></p><p>Our opposition to the detention of children at Dungavel has been consistently expressed to the UK Government by the First Minister, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and the Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution. The latter did so as recently as 9 November.</p><p>We in the Scottish Government will continue to do all that we can to ensure that the experience of these children is as positive as it can be. We will also ensure that as they wait for their claim to be considered&#8212;or, if the application fails, as they have to go through the process of leaving the country&#8212;these families are treated with humanity and dignity during their time in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"21788\"/><place-holder time=\"17:47:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:47.</em></p>", "hdate": "2009-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20429558", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dungavel (Detention of Children)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sandra White on bringing the detention of children at Dungavel to the chamber for debate.

In that context, I regret the faintly moralising tone of the Conservative motion and I question the demand for preferential treatment for certain categories of families in the tax and benefits system. We should not forget that the process of phasing out the married couples income tax allowance started under the last Tory Government, so we will take no lectures from members on that side of the chamber.</p><p>All families need support, but some are more vulnerable to poor outcomes. It is vital that our policies recognise that and promote actions that support our people. Last year, we published \"Achieving Our Potential: A Framework to tackle poverty and income inequality in Scotland\", which sets out our ambitious approach to tackling poverty and income inequality. Together with the social policies in the early years framework and \"Equally Well: Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities\", it represents a comprehensive and co-ordinated attack on the poverty and inequality that disfigures Scottish society.</p><p>We are determined to break the cycles of disadvantage that have blighted the lives of too many families for too long. With our partners, we are pursuing a range of actions to make a real difference on those deep-seated and difficult problems. Although the current devolution settlement limits what can be achieved for our people, the Government has a new level of ambition for Scotland and is determined to deliver real lasting change. Together with our partners, we are committed to a programme of work to improve outcomes for all Scotland's children. That is being achieved through the implementation of key change programmes such as getting it right for every child and the early years framework, which <place-holder colnum=\"20865\"/> place children and young people's needs at the centre of what we do.</p><p>We want to help parents to improve outcomes for themselves and their children by providing support at the earliest possible stage to stop problems escalating. We have some great support for families in the early years&#8212;midwives, health visitors and community nursing teams who support parents during pregnancy and early parenthood are known, valued and trusted. We want to build on that by bringing a greater focus on parenting skills and capacity, and by developing care pathways to ensure that parents who have different types and levels of need are given the right support.</p><p>The role of building relationships between parents is crucial, which is why we fund voluntary organisations such as Scottish Marriage Care and Relationships Scotland, as well as family mediation services based in local authorities throughout Scotland. Such services work to reduce conflict and heal relationships where possible, while valuing marriage and the family relationship. However, where parental relationships have broken down irretrievably, those organisations also support parents to create a stable environment for their children.</p><p>Some families face particular challenges, recession or no recession. Tackling parental substance misuse is a priority for the Government. We want to ensure that more people recover from drug and alcohol problems so that they can live longer, healthier lives, realise their potential and make a positive contribution within their families and the wider community. Our early intervention approach will mean that young people do not start down that road in the first place.</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises the important role that is played by grandparents and other kinship carers in providing secure and stable homes for children. Extended families who take on that responsibility provide a valuable service and should be supported in carrying out that role. The Scottish Government is determined to do what it can to help improve their situation. One of the problems that we face in providing financial support for kinship carers is that the United Kingdom benefits system does not interact well with the allowances that local authorities pay to kinship carers. That is particularly true for kinship carers of looked-after children, who are not entitled to child benefit, and where the allowance that is intended for the child can affect other benefits that the carer would otherwise be entitled to.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20354169", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am, of course, happy to contribute to a debate on how we might best support Scotland's families, particularly at a time when many of them face hardship and difficulties through no fault of their own.

Those reports will include updates on the second round of HMIE inspections and will record progress on \"The Road to Recovery\", which embraces the recommendations of \"Hidden Harm\". Together with the alcohol framework, \"The Road to Recovery\" is guiding how we are addressing the risks and poor outcomes that are experienced by children who are affected by parental substance misuse. We are also developing specific tools to meet the needs of children who are affected by parental substance misuse.</p><p>The first round of child protection inspections has given us an unprecedented picture of how services are performing throughout the country, and 77 per cent of local authorities have received a positive report. Nevertheless, we are committed to improving that proportion&#8212;it is, after all, one of our 45 national performance indicators. Areas that <place-holder colnum=\"19950\"/> received \"unsatisfactory\" reports have been actively improving services, which has led to good progress being reported in Aberdeen and Midlothian.

The tragedy of Brandon Muir, like other horrific cases before it, has rightly led to a high level of awareness of child protection issues and to concern that other children might face a similar fate. However, Scotland's children will not be best served by radically changing a child protection system that is basically sound, with detailed guidance already under active review. Earlier, I outlined some of the work that we are doing to improve services for children who are affected by parental substance misuse. That will remain a key priority.</p><p>There have been calls for a shift towards taking more children from parents who misuse drugs or alcohol. In my view, that is an oversimplification of a complex problem. Where necessary, child protection services remove children from families, and the number of children in care is increasing&#8212;it increased by 6 per cent in the past year alone and has increased by 27 per cent since 2004. Scotland has the highest number of looked-after children who are accommodated away from home in the UK. Some 81 out of every 10,000 of our under-18s are looked after away from home, compared to only 54 out of every 10,000 in England.

As I have already done at committee meetings, I make clear the Government's commitment to protecting and promoting the principles and ethos of the children's hearings system. The system is all about the best interests of the child, and the SSI will help to ensure that that remains the case.</p><p>By way of background, the SSI ensures that relevant persons may be provided with free legal representation to assist them in a children's hearing if that is necessary to ensure their effective participation in the decision-making process. A relevant person is usually the child's parent, but it can be other people who have a close involvement in the child's life. The Scottish Government made the concession in the context of a legal challenge in which an individual argued that the absence of provision for state-funded legal representation breached their rights under the European convention on human rights. The Court of Session has not yet issued the judgment in the case, so I am sure that members will understand if I do not go into details about its particular circumstances. However, the Scottish Government has already accepted that the absence of any <place-holder colnum=\"19351\"/> provision whereby a person could apply for state-funded legal representation before a children's hearing if there were unable to participate effectively without such representation was incompatible with articles 6, 8 and 14 of the convention.</p><p>That rationale applied to any relevant person who was unable to participate effectively at a children's hearing without legal representation. Therefore, the Government decided to act quickly&#8212;as soon as it was clear that there was a legal requirement to make available assistance in certain circumstances&#8212;to ensure that any relevant person who was incapable of participating effectively in a hearing because of their physical or mental capacity had the possibility of legal representation if their individual circumstances merited it. That is why the Government took the unusual but legitimate and justifiable step of breaching the 21-day rule by bringing the SSI into force the day after it was laid in Parliament in June.</p><p>The SSI provides an interim route through which such provision can be made proportionately and quickly; the regulations are carefully restricted and we see no less intrusive way of resolving the difficulty. However, I propose to include a permanent scheme in the children's hearings (Scotland) bill that I plan to introduce to Parliament early in the new year. As such, nothing in the statutory instrument ties the Parliament's hands in relation to the children's hearings (Scotland) bill. If evidence suggests that the arrangements introduced by the SSI do not work, we can look to revisit them in the bill.</p><p>I move on now to emphasise what the consequences will be of annulling the SSI. I place on record my deep disappointment that the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee chose to support the motion to annul and potentially jeopardise support to some of Scotland's most vulnerable people. I have spoken to the committee at great length about the fact that the SSI is no longer about securing a right of representation; that point of law has already been conceded and I ask you to bear this in mind today.</p><p>The main issue boils down to the fact that the committee seems determined to remove a measure that simply prevents the most disadvantaged people in Scotland from being further disadvantaged. Relevant persons can already have legal representation at hearings if they can afford to pay for it. I have repeatedly made that hugely important point, which the committee has failed to recognise. So, I ask, are you as a Parliament really going to say to a person who does not have the capacity to participate effectively in proceedings about their child, \"You <place-holder colnum=\"19352\"/> can't pay so you can't have help\"? I urge you to vote against annulment of the SSI.</p><p>I make it clear that voting to annul the SSI will not prevent from coming forward cases in which relevant persons need support.

The motion offers us the chance to commend and publicise in the chamber the work that is done by Mary's Meals. The movement's contribution is considerable. However, the motion also gives us the chance to endorse the immense contribution of those Scottish schools, churches, groups and individuals who, through their efforts and commitment, ensure that Mary's Meals has the resources to feed hungry children throughout the world.</p><p>As my colleagues have said, what we are celebrating is not just that those children receive a meal every day but that that is linked to their receiving an education. As Karen Gillon rightly said, education is a right for every child in the world. It is undeniable, here and in the developing world, that education is the main route out of the poverty, hunger and grinding want that affect so many children throughout the world.</p><p>For more than 400 million children, hunger and malnourishment are a daily reality. Instead of going to school, either they are needed at home or they must go out to work to help their families in their daily fight for survival. Included in that number are the many orphans with no one but themselves to rely on for food and a roof over their heads. That was brought home to me last Saturday at the holy fair in Ayr, when I had a chance meeting with a young man who had come <place-holder colnum=\"18925\"/> over from Malawi and was trying to get some ideas to take back home to help with the huge problem that Malawi faces as a result of the impact of HIV and AIDS, which has left many children without a parent to look after them. Many of those orphan children also act as parents and carers for their younger siblings&#8212;those are the child-headed households that that young man was talking to me about.</p><p>For those children, education is a dream, unattainable because of their unremitting struggle for food. Because they are deprived of the education that should be theirs by right, they will never get the chance to realise their potential or gain the skills that are necessary to help them to escape poverty.</p><p>The Mary's<strong> </strong>Meals<strong> </strong>project offers a simple solution to that vicious cycle&#8212;a daily meal delivered to every child who attends school. Knowing that they will receive a meal every day, the children come back every day. With food in their stomachs, they can concentrate and learn. With an education, they have a route whereby they can work themselves out of poverty. It is a simple but effective idea that has steadily gathered momentum and which now provides daily meals for more than 350,000 of the poorest children in the world.</p><p>I am very pleased that Scotland is committed to playing its part in the global fight against poverty, and the Scottish Government has demonstrated its commitment by continuing financial support from the international development fund to support the Mary's Meals project in Malawi. We are currently providing the project with &#163;400,000 for the three financial years to 2010-11.</p><p>The Government of Malawi has also adopted the policy of universal primary school feeding, and is committed to allowing it to spread across the country. It has also named Mary's Meals as one of the main in-country providers. That is testament to the great work that the project is doing and the high regard in which it is held by the people of Malawi. By the middle of last year, around 300,000 children were included in the Malawi programme. Since the start of the newest phase of the project, funded by the Scottish Government's international development fund in November 2008, Mary's Meals and Scottish International Relief have introduced the feeding programme into nine new schools in Malawi, reaching 11,081 new children.</p><p>In addition to feeding children through Mary's Meals, Scottish International Relief is to be commended for considering more closely the issues that prevent children in developing countries from continuing to attend school. It has shown great imagination in looking at the problems that those children face from the child's point of view.<place-holder colnum=\"18926\"/></p><p>Once a child goes to school, they need pencils and paper and the other equipment that is necessary for them to take full advantage of the school environment. They also need to feel that they do not stand out from other children and that they fit in. That is where the backpack appeal comes to the fore, and where schools and churches such as St Bridget's chapel in Baillieston make a huge contribution. As Margaret Curran has described, the volunteers at St Bridget's encourage their community to donate a school bag filled with such basic items as pens and notebooks. Those bags are then driven by Scottish International Relief to those receiving meals. The bags send a signal to families and communities in developing countries that gaining an education is important, and they also send a signal that families and communities in Scotland, who contributed the backpacks, care about them and support them through their hardship.</p><p>More and more people are taking part in the project. It has sent more than 120,000 backpacks to some of the poorest children in the world in places such as Haiti, Malawi, Uganda, Liberia, Romania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project's success in Scotland has been seen and celebrated throughout the world. Many countries in the European Union and North America have begun to follow Scotland's example, and are collecting and filling backpacks to send to developing countries.</p><p>The debate has focused our minds on the wonderful work that is carried out by Mary's Meals through Scottish International Relief, in strong and close partnership with the people of Scotland. I am pleased to have had an opportunity to congratulate the community of St Bridget's chapel in Baillieston on their sterling work in supporting the backpack appeal.</p><p>I thank members for taking the time to speak in support of the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "19979767", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mary's Meals"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Margaret Curran on securing the debate so that, as Bill Aitken said, we can end the parliamentary session on a high note.

Official statistics released today show that in Scottish local authorities, nearly 57,000 posts are filled with full and part-time staff employed in social work services, which equates to just over 44,200 whole-time equivalent staff. Vacancies among social workers, which reached a high of 13 per cent in 2003, are down to 7 per cent. The number of whole-time equivalent social workers has increased by 31 per cent from 2001, to just under <place-holder colnum=\"18833\"/> 5,100, and the number of social work students is on the increase. The number of undergraduates should rise by around 40 per cent over the next three years, to about 500.</p><p>I am pleased to say that the numbers are healthy, but what about the quality of provision? Clearly, staff who deliver services must have the knowledge, skills and values to allow them to improve the quality of outcomes for service users. Regulation of the workforce through registration places a condition that staff will have the appropriate qualifications for the job that they undertake. However, that is only the beginning. All will be subject to post-registration training and learning requirements, as set by the Scottish Social Services Council, to ensure that they not only maintain but update their skills and knowledge.</p><p>Other measures have been put in place to support and encourage learning in the workplace. In December 2008, I launched the continuous learning framework, which will support all social service workers and employers to improve approaches to learning and development, career pathways and standards of practice. It will help employers to identify which staff need to do their jobs well not only now but in future.</p><p>The recognition of prior informal learning will enable staff to have their experience recognised, which will help them to gain credit towards qualifications. We fund six centres of excellence, which deliver specialist training in areas such as drug and alcohol misuse and residential child care.</p><p>Students of the social work degree now undertake 200 days of practice learning in the course of their degree, which must include actual practice on child protection cases. The sector is recognised for the work that it is doing to upskill its workforce, and we must support and encourage that approach.</p><p>Skills and leadership are needed at all levels. Nigel Don and Trish Godman made good points about that. Staff need to experience strong leadership and support, with a clarity of vision for services and support that can drive and sustain improved performance. High morale and confidence flow from that, and staff at all levels will benefit from effective management from skilled leaders.</p><p>As MSPs, we need to speak up to support front-line workers. I congratulate Christina McKelvie and all the other speakers for the tone of the debate, which has been enhanced by valuable contributions from the former social workers in our midst.</p><p>The wider public do not often see the work that is done on their behalf or appreciate the difficulties that are faced, nor do they hear of the successes <place-holder colnum=\"18834\"/> and happy endings. For every bad news story, there are a thousand good news stories&#8212;of children helped, families supported and lives improved, through the commitment and professionalism of front-line workers throughout Scotland. That is why we welcomed the decision by the Association of Directors of Social Work and the Scottish Social Services Council to develop a public relations strategy to raise a constructive profile of social work services. Like Christina McKelvie, I attended the launch in April.</p><p>While we should be quick to recognise the important contribution that the workforce makes, we should not be afraid to challenge where there are problems. We must face up to it when things go wrong, fix things that have not worked and learn for the future. The unacceptable shortcomings in services to protect children that were highlighted in the HMIE report on Dundee that was published yesterday are a case in point. I have sought and obtained urgent assurances from senior Dundee officials that immediate and significant remedial action is under way. As has been highlighted, multi-agency collaboration and co-operation across the sector is crucial. We will continue to work positively with Dundee City Council, Tayside Police and NHS Tayside so as to be assured that progress is sustained. HMIE has been asked to revisit Dundee within six months to report on progress.</p><p>I remind members that Scotland's child protection inspection system is the most robust in the United Kingdom. Previous critical HMIE reports have led to significant, measurable improvements in services to protect children. Today's publication of the interim follow-through report on Aberdeen is a good example of that, and it shows promising early progress in the six months since the initial inspection. I have challenged poor practice in the past and I will continue to do so. I encourage those who work in services, at whatever level, to do the same.</p><p>Changing lives tools such as the continuous learning framework and the evolving leadership framework will help. The self-evaluation guide from the Social Work Inspection Agency, the recent guidance on the role of the chief social work officer and the developing practice governance framework will also support workforce development and sustainable change and improvement. However, there is more to be done, and we all have a part to play.</p><p>I thank all the members who have participated in this evening's debate.<place-holder time=\"17:46:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:46.</em></p>", "hdate": "2009-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "19977614", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Social Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christina McKelvie for bringing the debate to the chamber, and for her excellent speech.

I continue to be encouraged by the progress that is being made in developing systems in this country for rescuing abducted children and in supporting services for missing children more generally.

I point out to my colleague Gil Paterson and to Parliament that the European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings became binding in the UK on 1 April this year. The Scottish Government, for its part, is running awareness events on child trafficking. In March, we issued guidance on safeguarding children who may have been trafficked and we are working with local child protection committees.</p><p>When we discuss discrete pieces of work such as the child rescue alert system or the 116 000 hotline for missing children, it is important that we offer the context on how those solutions fit with the range of work that the Government is undertaking in child protection. As members would expect, child protection is a top priority for the <place-holder colnum=\"17924\"/> Government. Over the past couple of years, we have worked to shift the emphasis of those services in order to place increased focus on the need to intervene earlier and more effectively. That approach runs through everything we are doing through the policy frameworks with which members are familiar: the early years framework, \"Equally Well\" and \"Achieving Our Potential\". Getting it right for every child provides us with the foundation for delivering all the work that is covered by the frameworks and by all children's services. The approach recognises the crucial role that universal services play in supporting and protecting children, and the need for clear links between them and specialist professionals.</p><p>Members will be aware that in February this year I tasked a national multi-agency working group with considering how best to revise the 1998 guidance document \"Protecting Children&#8212;A Shared Responsibility\". It is important that the guidance that we provide to professionals is an accurate reflection of evolving national policies. We all recognise the importance of driving forward improvements in practice as quickly and consistently as possible.

Many authorities and stakeholders, such as Children in Scotland, share the opinion that the provision will categorise children as having additional support needs when they do not, in fact, require additional support.</p><p>That said, I acknowledge that looked-after children and young people are a unique group&#8212;a group that does not fare as well educationally as others do. However, the bill omits the group of looked-after children who have the lowest educational attainment: those who are looked after at home. Our amendments in the group will rectify the situation.</p><p>The Scottish Government accepts and shares the concern of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee on the position of the groups of children who are identified under section 5C of the bill. I thank Margaret Smith and the Liberal Democrats for their helpful suggestion that we create a working group to consider how the 2004 act is working for those groups of children and young people. I am more than happy to take on board Ms Smith's suggestion and to establish such a group urgently to examine how the act is affecting the groups of children that are specified in section 5C. The working group will report in due course, and we will act on its recommendations. I therefore urge Parliament to support amendment 2, which will delete all the other categories of children that are contained in section 5C, and <place-holder colnum=\"17584\"/> amendment 1, which will extend the provisions of the bill to encompass all looked-after children.</p><p>Amendment 3 makes it clear that, where a child or young person does not require additional support in order to benefit from education, the bill's presumption that they do have additional support needs will be rebutted. I assure Margaret Smith in particular that amendment 3 will not delete the deeming provision. Education authorities will still have to start from the assumption that such children have additional support needs, and they will still have to assess each child individually. The amendment will, however, remove the potential absurdity of authorities being under a duty to deliver additional support to children and young people who do not have additional support needs.</p><p>I understand the rationale behind amendments 3A and 3B and note that they relate only to looked-after children. I trust that that is the case because the Liberal Democrats are supportive of amendments 1 and 2 in my name, which would remove the other specified categories of children who are deemed to have additional support needs. I welcome that support.</p><p>I regret that I am unable to support amendment 17, because it is confusing and legislatively unnecessary. The amendment picks out only one reference to children with additional support needs in the whole 2004 act. Its effect would be that other references to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"children and young people having additional support needs\"</p><p>in the 2004 act would not include those who are deemed to have additional support needs. Without a similar provision for every other such reference in the bill, practitioners would be left to assume that those other references did not include children who are deemed to have additional support needs. Clearly, that is not the intention of the amendment.</p><p>I ask Parliament to support amendments 1, 2 and 3, offer my support to amendments 3A and 3B, in the name of Margaret Smith, and ask Margaret Smith not to move amendment 17.</p><p>I move amendment 1.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15010145", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 5C &#8212; Additional support needs etc: specified children and young people"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The bill, as amended at stage 2, requires authorities to treat all children and young people who fall into a number of specified categories as having additional support needs, regardless of whether they need additional support in order to benefit from school education.

It simply does not make sense for the same definition of additional support to apply to under-threes as that which will generally apply for those children for whom the authority has a responsibility from pre-school onwards.</p><p>That is because education authorities have completely different roles in relation to the different age groups of children. The role that education authorities can play to support disabled children who are under three is described&#8212;correctly&#8212;as that of educational support and is part of the early years framework, which recognises the right of all young children to high-quality relationships, environments and services that offer an holistic approach to meeting their needs.

As I said, our intention has always been to consider the options for review. What we propose is the appropriate option to present to Parliament. We have given significant consideration to the evidence that was presented to the committee and we will lodge amendments at stage 2 that we hope will reflect the weight of that evidence. I am always prepared to listen and to consider other amendments that are lodged. Our response is entirely appropriate and proportionate.</p><p>The bill will give parents and young people access to mediation and dispute resolution from the host authority following a successful out-of-area placing request. Most important, it will strengthen the rights of children with additional support needs and their parents by providing the parents with the same rights as others have to make placing requests to local authorities that are outwith their area. The bill will increase the rights of parents and young people to access tribunals to deal with failures by education authorities.</p><p>As members may know, when giving evidence to the committee, I shared with it three additional amendments that I am minded to explore further. The first would enable all appeals about placing requests for special schools to be heard by the tribunals. The second would ensure that parents have a right to request an assessment of their child's needs at any time. The third would enable tribunals to specify when a placing request should start.</p><p>The code of practice will be amended in due course and will be laid before the Scottish Parliament. The redrafted code will place the 2004 act in the context of our current policies, such as the getting it right for every child programme, the early years framework and the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>I am aware that a number of those who provided evidence to the committee asked for clarification of the term \"significant\", as used in the phrase \"significant additional support\", the need for which is one of the criteria for a co-ordinated support plan. Our intention is to develop further the redrafted code and to clarify the definition of \"significant\". We are working with stakeholders to develop further guidance on the meaning of \"significant\". The code will also clarify the process of making placing requests.</p><p>As members may be aware, we held an extensive consultation on the draft bill. I also met the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and various other stakeholders. Most stakeholders <place-holder colnum=\"15367\"/> were very supportive of the proposed amendments to the 2004 act. I was pleased to note that, in its report, the committee, too, said that it was content with our consultation.</p><p>I warmly welcome the committee's broad support for the amendments to the 2004 act. I am grateful for its support for the general principles of the bill and its recommendation to the Parliament that the general principles be approved. I am pleased to note that the committee recognises that the Government's intention has always been for parents of pupils with additional support needs, regardless of whether those pupils have a co-ordinated support plan, to be in the same position as others in relation to placing requests&#8212;not only requests to the home authority but out-of-area requests.</p><p>I note the committee's recommendation that the Scottish Government is to have regard to stakeholders' views in its revision of the \"Supporting Children's Learning\" code of practice and any secondary legislation that results from the implementation of the bill. I assure the Parliament that an extensive consultation will be conducted in due course.</p><p>However, I recognise that making parents aware of their rights is a key issue, particularly with regard to services for resolving disagreement. To help address that, consideration is being given to amending the Additional Support for Learning (Publication of Information) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 to place local authorities under a duty to publish information on the procedures for dispute resolution.</p><p>Members may also be interested to know that the Scottish Government already provides substantial funding to support Enquire, our national additional support for learning helpline and information service, whose key aims include outreach to support effective implementation of the 2004 act and consideration of new ways to heighten the profile of additional support needs issues among parents, young people and children. At present, we are funding the service to the tune of around &#163;400,000 per annum.</p><p>We are currently working with Enquire to refocus our marketing strategy with the aim of improving parental awareness of their rights under the 2004 act. To assist us with this aim, Sir Jackie Stewart, the motor-racing legend, has very kindly offered his services and involvement in any action that we take forward to make parents aware of their legal rights under the act. His international stature and well-known commitment to improving the lives of children with additional support needs will certainly help to raise the profile of any such promotional work.<place-holder colnum=\"15368\"/></p><p>Similarly, I was delighted to hear that Muriel Gray, the broadcaster and journalist, has become the first patron of Scotland's additional support needs mediation services forum. The forum, which is part of the Scottish Mediation Network, helps to resolve disputes between parents or young people and education staff. I recently attended the communication is the key mediation event that was held in the Parliament. I was encouraged to hear Muriel Gray and a panel of speakers stress that effective communication can be the first step on the route to resolving any disagreement. I assure members that I, too, share that view.</p><p>The committee requested that I clarify my position on Lord Wheatley's ruling, in which he states that additional support should be related only to \"the teaching environment\". Our policy intention is clear: the purpose of additional support is to allow children and young people to benefit from school education. The nature of that support should not be limited to the support that is offered in a school environment; it can involve not only educational but multi-agency services such as health and social work services and those provided by voluntary agencies. However, given that Lord Wheatley's opinion cast doubt on the interpretation of the 2004 act, we are considering lodging an amendment to clarify the definition of additional support.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14768992", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No&#8212;I propose to build on the evidence that has resulted from three years of implementation of the original 2004 act.

I agree with Margaret Smith that this debate has generated more heat than light. I find the Labour Party's fears-and-smears approach to this serious issue profoundly distasteful, not least because of its own track record. The Labour motion creates a narrative to justify its claim that the Government has broken its promise to provide kinship care allowances. That is a deception, and I caution members against taking it at face value. Let me take the motion apart.</p><p>First, the First Minister made no commitment on 27 September 2007. In fact, it was Wendy Alexander who called on the First Minister to make a statement. He expressed sympathy for the proposal, but no more. Secondly, although we support minimum payments of &#163;119 to &#163;198&#8212;the Fostering Network rates&#8212;those are not specified in the Government's strategy documents, as the motion alleges. I refer members to the COSLA briefing for the debate. Furthermore, although last December I expected that kinship care allowances <place-holder colnum=\"13327\"/> would start to be paid from April, I did not stipulate that they would be paid at those rates immediately.</p><p>As the chamber knows, all 32 local authorities are committed, through the concordat, to the introduction of kinship care allowances. Of those, 20 councils have schemes in place and are currently paying allowances. I explained earlier that, given the phasing of the funding, a lot of councils are paying interim rates at the moment, which will climb over the next two years.

Given the financial limitations, I have had to prioritise looked-after children. On 31 March 2008, there were 2,398 such children&#8212;16 per cent of all looked-after children. The number has more than doubled since 2000. That increase shows the vital and important role that kinship carers play in protecting the needs of our most vulnerable children, who would otherwise be placed in foster or residential care. It makes sense to ensure that there is equity between the support that kinship carers receive and that provided to foster carers. We think that an amount equivalent to the weekly allowance that is paid to foster carers, minus benefit entitlements, is fair. Members need not take our word for that. Professor Jane Aldgate, who is chair of Kinsfolk <place-holder colnum=\"13310\"/> Carers Edinburgh and author of the most recent research into kinship carers in Scotland, says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Payment of allowances to approved kinship carers of looked after children is a fantastic step forward by the Scottish Government in strengthening the range of support which kinship carers require\".</p><p>We recognise the challenges that local authorities face. The progress that they have reported is that 20 authorities&#8212;the majority&#8212;are paying allowances. A further six have plans well under way, and the remainder have agreed in the concordat to implement the policy. More progress is required, but local authorities face a significant hurdle. If any sum of money, however small, is paid by an authority to a looked-after child, the carer loses entitlement to benefits, with the exception of child benefit. The reasons for that are complex, but the straightforward explanation is that United Kingdom benefits law does not support the needs of looked-after children living with kinship carers. That is why we have made a start with the kinship carers about whom we know&#8212;carers of looked-after children and those against whom UK benefits rules discriminate.</p><p>I am not at all happy with the situation.

The review will build on the major three-year child protection reform programme that was launched by the previous Administration. It will take into account the aspirations that have been expressed by Scotland's child protection committees for embedding into consistent general use the best practice of Scotland's child protection practitioner community.</p><p>The findings of the recent Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education report on Aberdeen are deeply concerning. We were in touch with the council prior to the publication of the Social Work Inspection Agency's findings of 4 June about social work provision as a whole. When the oral findings from the HMIE inspection became clear in mid-June, Aberdeen&#8212;with our support&#8212;started tackling its problems immediately, rather than waiting for publication of the final report before taking decisive action. I reassure Parliament that I have sought and received assurances from the council and its child protection partners that the report's recommendations are being addressed urgently. Although considerable work remains to be done, a remedial action plan is already well under way, led by a temporary reforming programme director, who was appointed on 7 July. His remit is to improve service delivery by realigning social work and establishing clear financial direction and accountability for the <place-holder colnum=\"13124\"/> service. Longer-term decisions will be for the incoming chief executive.</p><p>HMIE found organisational and operational barriers that obstructed front-line staff in Aberdeen in delivering effective child protection. In order to remove those barriers, the organisation of children's services is being redesigned to ensure that services are needs led, and that they mirror identified needs. Initial reviews of operational procedures have been completed and are being used to redesign services. The emphasis is on finding greater efficiencies and more effective social work interventions, so that the council will increasingly prevent, and divert individuals from, risk.</p><p>HMIE suggested that, at the time of its fieldwork in April and May, some children were being left in unacceptably risky situations. As a result, risk assessment of 900 existing cases is under way and will be completed this month in order to provide confidence that no child is in that situation, and 120 front-line staff have received, or are receiving, additional training. Also, lines of accountability have been shortened and strengthened significantly.</p><p>There have been no budget reductions in child protection services in Aberdeen. Elected members have increased capacity by funding additional social work posts, bringing the complement of children's services social workers to 90 full-time equivalents. Three posts were allocated to the social work team at Aberdeen maternity hospital and six new social worker posts will supplement the current children and families teams.</p><p>Those structural and practice changes are already delivering tangible benefits. The recent inspection by the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care into Aberdeen's fostering and adoption services recorded \"significant progress\", and added that improvements have taken place at every level of the service. The care commission imposed no requirements, which is encouraging, but there is still more to be done. HMIE will require a follow-up report in four months and I, too, will monitor progress.</p><p>Aberdeen's is the 24<sup>th</sup> inspection report to be published. The remaining reports are due by mid-2009. I announced my intention to instigate a review of our child protection guidance, drawing on the findings of those 24 reports and of the reports that are to be published in the coming months.</p><p>Joint inspection of services to protect children, which has been led by HMIE, is multi-agency&#8212;a first for Scotland&#8212;with inspectors seconded to HMIE from the Social Work Inspection Agency, the care commission, Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary for Scotland and NHS Quality <place-holder colnum=\"13125\"/> Improvement Scotland. The inspection team has the expertise to scrutinise all aspects of child protection provision and to understand how the different agencies need to work together.</p><p>The inspection process begins long before an inspector calls. The HMIE guide \"How well are children and young people protected and their needs met?\" helps services to examine themselves against 18 quality indicators, not just as preparation for inspection but as an exercise in self-scrutiny. The Crerar report emphasised the need for robust self-evaluation, which HMIE has championed for years. No organisation can improve without first taking a critical look at itself. That is now happening in Aberdeen.</p><p>Inspection is not just a one-off visit and even the best authorities could do better. Every report includes recommendations for improvement and every area is asked to prepare an action plan following inspection. Every authority can also expect a follow-up inspection within two years of the original visit. We encourage poorer-performing councils to work with other councils on improvements where that is appropriate.</p><p>I turn to the wider perspective. In cases in which children need multi-agency intervention, we need agencies to work effectively together, using the same language, sharing a common approach to assessing risks and needs and sharing information, with each agency playing its part but with clear lines of accountability and responsibility. The getting it right for every child policy is working to achieve that.</p><p>The previous Administration consulted on a draft children's services bill. When we came into Government, we listened to social workers, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and others and we learned that new legislation would be better deferred until practical experience suggests whether legislating will yield real benefits. Parliamentary debate in 2006, during the passage of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill, revealed concerns that a statutory duty to share information might lead to greater bureaucracy and a culture of organisations watching their backs, which might distract from the necessary focus on nurturing confident and competent decision making by skilled professionals on the front line. It is our skilled professionals who provide the key.</p><p>It is easy to seek to blame when something awful happens, such as the cruel life and death of Baby P, but without the compassion, judgment and vigilant care that is exercised every day by Scotland's child protection practitioners, many more children would find themselves trapped in intolerably risky situations. I value profoundly the work that those front-line staff do, and I welcome the opportunity that they have to continue to <place-holder colnum=\"13126\"/> receive the support that they need to do their jobs well, through developments such as the framework for continuous learning in social services, which I launched yesterday.</p><p>In summary, we are working with our partners to address the need for improved information sharing, improved risk assessment and improved multi-agency working on the ground.</p><p>We are beginning to see practical results from the getting it right for every child agenda, such as the national guidance that was launched in September. It is important that we continue to work through the pathfinders and with our partners to learn lessons. I am not ruling out legislation in the future, but our current path is clear.

Providing free, nutritious school meals to pupils in primary 1 to primary 3 will get our children off to a solid start by establishing healthy eating habits at an early age. There is broad consensus that a healthier diet leads to longer-term health benefits. I quote the well-named Professor Mike Lean, the head of human nutrition at the University of Glasgow, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Children who have nutritionally balanced school meals will be in better health, will be able to grow and function and do a lot better.\"</p><p>That was the basis for hungry for success, which has brought significant benefits. However, if we are to achieve maximum impact, many more pupils need to access those benefits.</p><p>We want to offer healthy school lunches to our youngest pupils for free, so that they will benefit from the transformation in food quality that hungry for success has brought about. A universal approach is required, because obesity is a growing problem across the population. The policy needs to be inclusive; we need peer support and peer pressures to apply to bring about the culture change in eating habits that we seek. It is our duty to look after all children, regardless of their background or income. We know that not just children from the poorest families are nutritionally challenged.</p><p>During the past school year, we conducted a trial to see what impact the policy could have. I am <place-holder colnum=\"12927\"/> delighted to report that the trial was a great success. Uptake among P1 to P3 pupils increased dramatically. Teachers, council staff and catering staff were all positive about the trial. Importantly, there is encouraging evidence that pupils were trying and enjoying new foods, asking for healthier options at home and talking to their parents about food more often. The trial was extremely popular with parents, not just because it eased pressures on the family budget but because it made it easier for some parents to serve healthier food at home and gave them new ideas for healthy recipes.</p><p>Some members have queried whether there is enough evidence of the policy's long-term health benefits to justify it. However, if we wait any longer, we run the risk of doing nothing. I believe that the evidence from the trial is compelling. Rolling out the policy will mean that children throughout the country will reap the health benefits in the future. Although we will extend entitlement to free school meals to more families in need next August, the policy will also help to alleviate poverty. Often poverty is hidden from view&#8212;people are not eligible or have not registered for free school meals. The initiative will help to tackle that problem.</p><p>One of the main aims of the trial was to assess the practicalities of a national roll-out. I am pleased that the evaluation found that implementation was relatively straightforward. The trial councils had anticipated possible capacity and accommodation issues, but in reality those did not arise or were relatively easy to overcome. I ask members to trust&#8212;as we do&#8212;that councils will learn lessons from the trial, find solutions to the potential challenges and implement the policy successfully. The local government settlement provides sufficient funding for councils to fulfil this concordat commitment. The all-party Convention of Scottish Local Authorities leadership group has confirmed that the resources are available.</p><p>The trial of free school meals for primary 1 to 3 pupils was a great success. The order that is before Parliament will enable councils to use their power to advance wellbeing to roll out the policy. Conversely, failure to support the order will deny councils that opportunity.

I agree that, throughout the country, more foster carers are required, along with better training and support.</p><p>Members asked what I am doing. I have tasked the fostering and kinship care reference group with making recommendations, and I shall receive the group's report shortly. A national residential care review is on-going, and it will report soon, too. I confirm to Sandra White that I would be happy to meet the foster carer groups that she mentioned to address the many issues that I know are live at the moment.</p><p>I can confirm to Richard Simpson that, in implementing the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007, we are currently consulting on the looked-after children regulations. The consultation ends in January and the regulations will be laid before Parliament shortly thereafter. Discussions with the GMC are on-going&#8212;I take on board the thrust of Dr Simpson's arguments. I think that we need to make more use of the medical expertise of professionals such as Dr Simpson to ensure that all professionals understand the importance of stability, early intervention&#8212;including prenatal care&#8212;and continuity of care. I would be more than happy to sit down and work with Dr Simpson on the issues that he raised. Clearly, Ian McKee has an important contribution to make, too.</p><p>I agree with Hugh Henry that there is no point in mere exhortation to do better. We need to drive improvements. Our single outcome agreements with local authorities provide the vehicle for so doing.

It is good to hear that colleagues from all parties are committed to improving outcomes for looked-after children, young people and care leavers. Sometimes we in Scotland have a tendency to focus on the negatives and, as we have heard, it is all too easy to do that with the care system. However, there are many success stories and there can be many more. The contribution that we all make to the lives of looked-after children and young people can have a <place-holder colnum=\"12607\"/> positive impact on their lives. We can give them a positive future. I believe that Scotland has the potential to be a successful country that values all its citizens and empowers them to be all they can be. The Parliament has a central role in making that happen. Why should our looked-after children, young people and care leavers do less well than their peers? Why should our expectations and aspirations for them not be as high as for young people who are not looked after?</p><p>Across the country and across sectors, we are seeing a growing enthusiasm, understanding and desire for real change. I believe that the materials that we have recently launched in the context of our commitments in \"Early Years and Early Intervention\", \"Getting it right for every child\", \"A Curriculum for Excellence\" and \"More Choices, More Chances\" will support the care system in providing a positive experience so that looked-after young people grow up to be effective, responsible citizens and, above all, happy.</p><p>Let us not forget&#8212;Robert Brown made this very point&#8212;that around half our looked-after children live at home with their birth parents under a supervision order from a children's hearing. Those children currently fare worst of all.

In that context, I am a little disappointed that Labour's amendment is so narrowly focused, but I will respond to it when I sum up.</p><p>As I have said publicly before&#8212;and I make no excuses for repeating my comments&#8212;the way in which we have treated children in public care is a national disgrace. If, as a nation, we are to be judged on our treatment of our most vulnerable citizens, that judgment must be damning. The previous Administration recognised that when it published \"Looked after children and young people: we can and must do better\".</p><p>I am sure that members will share my commitment that there should be no difference between the outcomes for young people who have experienced the care system and those for their peers who have not. That should not be too much to ask, but currently the differences are stark. Children in care are half as likely to leave school with any qualifications, they are more likely to be excluded from school and they are more likely to self-harm. Care leavers are less likely to be in employment and more likely to be in prison or homeless than their peers who have not been in care. I could go on, but I will not.</p><p>So what is different about those children? Their early experience will have been damaging and chaotic, and their experience of parenting will have been poor or non-existent. The protective factors that children gain from conventional families and which help them to grow up happily are likely to have been absent. It is not the children who are different, but their circumstances.<place-holder colnum=\"12560\"/></p><p>I hope that our commitment to getting it right in the early years, early intervention and prevention will, in the fullness of time, ensure that fewer children come into care. Families who need support will be identified early and supported to care for their children. However, we must ensure that those who do come into care get a better experience.</p><p>The term \"corporate parent\" can be controversial. I understand why people say that we need less of the corporate and more of the parenting, but we need to get both bits right. Agencies that care for looked-after children and care leavers must work together effectively and must have robust planning, monitoring and scrutiny mechanisms that drive up standards. They must recruit and develop the best staff and must be committed to improving services to children and their families. To achieve that, they must act corporately and have a corporate responsibility for those children and young people.</p><p>Good parenting is at the heart of a good childhood. Professionals and carers who take on that role for children in care face many challenges. I do not pretend that it is easy, but everyone involved must be able to answer positively the question, \"Is this good enough for my child?\" That is the message set out in \"These Are Our Bairns: A guide for community planning partnerships on being a good corporate parent\", which covers all services&#8212;the corporate extended family, so to speak. It is unique in the United Kingdom in its multi-agency approach to looked-after children and young people and care leavers. That approach, which is underpinned by the getting it right for every child framework, is reflected in all the other associated materials that we have recently published.</p><p>To bring the document to life and illustrate what we can all do to make a difference, the guidance includes stories from people who are part of the corporate family and quotes from young people. I heard recently about some young people from Dumfries and Galloway, one of whom has left care to go to drama school in London and another who has set up her own business as a professional photographer. That would not have been possible without a supportive corporate family.</p><p>A range of people work with looked-after children and care leavers. They have a wealth of experience, which, together, we can bring to bear on improving outcomes. Social work and education are crucial, but they cannot do this alone. Others have a valuable contribution to make: housing; health; the voluntary sector; and the police, to name but a few.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246612", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss with colleagues in the Parliament the important issues that Scotland faces in addressing our commitment to improve outcomes for looked-after children and young people and care leavers.

It is clear that different local authorities have different local circumstances and can pick and choose from the options available, but there are a range of successful interventions that people can take up and, I hope, implement in their area.</p><p>Those who run services&#8212;elected members and board members&#8212;must promote a culture of high expectation and ensure that systems do not present barriers to good childhood experiences.</p><p>Young people want to lead a normal, stable, secure life with people who care about them, and they want access to the same opportunities as their friends. Does the corporate family ensure that its children can play with friends and do sports? Does it ensure that young people are immunised, go to the dentist or optician and eat healthily? Do the young people grow up feeling supported, with the boundaries that they need to be responsible citizens?</p><p>When young people leave care, many of the differences come into sharp focus. Some members will have had the opportunity to see the National Theatre of Scotland's \"365\" production at this year's Edinburgh festival. It was a challenging production, which dramatised the turmoil that faces young people who are trying to set up home for the first time without the support that other young people access through their family. The good work that might have been done while they were in care can very quickly be undone because their vulnerability leaves them open to exploitation and failure through a lack of preparation for independence and the lack of having someone at the end of the phone with the time and resources to help them.</p><p>Members may recall that, in June, the Parliament debated the issues raised by Kathleen Marshall, Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People, in her report \"Sweet 16? The Age of Leaving Care in Scotland\". I was grateful to Karen Whitefield for raising the issue and for the positive words from colleagues throughout the chamber.</p><p>Many areas are developing innovative ways of tackling corporate parenting. Inverclyde's children's champion scheme has now been operating for a year. Each member of the council's corporate management team is champion for two <place-holder colnum=\"12562\"/> looked-after children and must address barriers that become apparent in their areas of responsibility. The chief executive and directors have risen to the challenge and the council is now being approached by partner organisations, such as the local health board, who have asked whether they can participate. One of the children championed by the education director was excluded from school and, as a direct consequence, he rewrote the council's policy on exclusions. That is one example of the scheme in action.</p><p>A cross-community planning partnership approach is already being tried in Perth and Kinross, where the Tayside child health commissioner is a children's champion and the police actively support the scheme. The child health commissioner has told me that her involvement has opened her eyes to the barriers that systems, which make sense to organisations, can present to young people.</p><p>Other areas such as Fife and Renfrewshire have appointed lead councillors to champion the needs of all looked-after children. The councillors are already challenging their services to improve the experience of children in care. One issue that young people raise with them repeatedly is access to MSN and satellite television. Such issues may seem trivial to us adults, but for teenagers they are part of being normal.</p><p>I firmly believe that we can learn a lot from listening to young people. I am sure that all members share that belief and have heard from young constituents with strong views. How do we hear the voices of young people who are not so confident and need support to express themselves? Learning to express oneself confidently should be a normal part of growing up&#8212;effective advocacy can help vulnerable young people to do that. Who Cares? Scotland provides advocacy across Scotland. This year it is celebrating its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary by undertaking a major piece of work to challenge stigma.</p><p>We in the Parliament also have the job of challenging stigma and ending discrimination. What can we do? We have a unique role in formulating policy and legislation. We are also community leaders and can challenge public perceptions of young people in the care system and challenge our local services to do better. We can contribute by promoting a culture that is aspirational for young people, their families and carers, communities and Scotland.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that it is unacceptable that outcomes for looked-after children and young people and care leavers across a range of indicators fall so far behind those of their peers and agrees to do everything possible to end discrimination and stigmatisation of those who have <place-holder colnum=\"12563\"/> experienced the care system and to challenge all services to offer the best possible childhoods to the children and young people in their care to ensure that looked-after children and young people and care leavers are able to grow up into successful, responsible and happy adults.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246612", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Rhona Brankin for that helpful intervention.

The state must intervene to care for those children&#8212;that is our first duty. I agree with the member that there are other vulnerable people whom we ought to be able to help and I am engaged with local authorities on how best to do so. I am slightly frustrated at the pace of that work and I hope that we can get people moving so that a report on progress can be made at the end of this financial year.</p><p>We must also continue our work to tackle discrimination and prejudice. Karen Whitefield mentioned Travellers and the Roma, and I met representatives from north-east Scotland, who told me about problems that they were having. Restrictions had been placed on them by the settled community, and their children were having difficulty accessing education. Processes that had been put in place, such as the use of the red book, which enables teachers to understand where a child is at in their education, were not being properly adhered to. I am concerned about that and I intend to consider carefully how we can take the agenda forward.</p><p>Play, which Karen Whitefield and Ken Macintosh mentioned, will be a key element of the early years framework. The framework, which we will publish later this year, will encompass play facilities and wider issues to do with risk and parental attitudes. We highlighted play in the report, \"Equally Well: report of the ministerial task force on health inequalities\", in which we talked about the importance of the physical environments that promote healthy lifestyles for children, which should be a priority for local authorities and other public services. We are working with Inspiring Scotland, a venture philanthropy organisation, to conduct baseline research on play, with a view to setting up a fund to support play in Scotland.</p><p>Poverty destroys rights. As Rob Gibson and other members said, the scale of child poverty in Scotland is scandalous. Children in Scotland deserve the best possible start in life and no child should be born into or condemned to a life of poverty&#8212;it is morally unacceptable that more than 20 per cent of our children live in poverty. The most direct levers for tackling poverty are benefits and tax credits, which are the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. However, under the current devolution settlement there are three broad ways in which the Scottish Government can take action: preventing poverty by tackling root causes; helping to lift people out of poverty; and alleviating the impact of poverty on people's lives. This month, we will publish our anti-poverty framework, in which we will bring together key areas for action and say how we will address the issue using the powers that are available to us.<place-holder colnum=\"12201\"/></p><p>I agreed with much of what Nicol Stephen said, in particular on the abuse of children around the world. Scotland is not immune from child abuse, as is evidenced by the growing number of youngsters who have to be taken into care. We will tackle the issue through our early years framework. We want to move towards a system of prevention and early intervention and away from the crisis interventions that mark the current system.</p><p>We can and must do better on outcomes for looked-after children and care leavers; I acknowledge what Mary Mulligan said in that regard. She was right to highlight the important role of children's advocacy, and I was pleased to be able to secure additional resources for Independent Special Education Advice (Scotland) and others.</p><p>The Scottish Government is heavily engaged in the agenda for care leavers and looked-after children, with particular emphasis on improving corporate parenting. Members will be aware that recently we launched \"These Are Our Bairns: A guide for community planning partnerships on being a good corporate parent\", which spells out the responsibilities of every member of the corporate family team and what we expect from them.</p><p>Murdo Fraser and Marlyn Glen disagreed on the issue of physical punishment of children. I support Marlyn Glen's contention that a change in attitude seems to be developing in Scotland. In a survey of parenting that was published this month, around 91 per cent of parents said that they would discuss an issue calmly with their child and explain why something was wrong. Only around 5 per cent said that they had smacked their child in the past year, and 60 per cent said that they had never done so. I do not know whether Murdo Fraser believes the survey.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14210336", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We certainly have issues to do with kinship care for looked-after and other   children, and I am not ashamed to say that my main focus is kinship care for looked-after children, for whom we have direct responsibility.

Rhona Brankin's point about pre-service education was valid. It is obvious that multi-agency training is key. Work is going on to identify the core competences for pre-service training and we are discussing with the universities and colleges how to incorporate the issue into workforce development.</p><p>I thank Elizabeth Smith for her supportive comments and I agree with her that parenting skills&#8212;and the lack thereof&#8212;are a central issue. Indeed, the issue is central to the development of our early years framework, in which we will tackle, for example, pre-school provision and early years provision for vulnerable one and two-year-olds. That work is being actively developed with COSLA and other partners and we will be in a position to bring our proposals to the Parliament later this year. I hope that we will all have a chance fully to debate issues to do with parenting, family support and so on.</p><p>I reassure Hugh O'Donnell that the approach in Scotland is not to create a central database. Information will be held and controlled by agencies and data will be brought together only when required. We are not going down the road that has been taken in England. There will have to be justification for access to information, and databases will not be open to being searched without there being a clear reason for doing so.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary answered the points that were made about legislation. It would be a big mistake to legislate too early&#8212;we have made some mistakes in the Parliament in previous legislation.

However, we are not in a position to introduce a bill and we have not identified areas in which legislation would be appropriate at this stage.</p><p>I agree entirely with Duncan McNeil's analysis and with what he said about what requires to be done.

We need to negotiate constructively with Westminster. I think that Bob Doris answered the relevant questions about kinship care. If Rhona Brankin had listened to Duncan McNeil's speech, she would have found that it was much more constructive than her own speech was.</p><p>I say to Marlyn Glen that we need to address broader issues to do with male violence against women, to improve outcomes for children who are affected by domestic abuse. The national domestic abuse delivery plan for children and young people is just one of the measures that we are taking forward. We have allocated more than &#163;40 million to take the wider agenda forward during the next three years. Of course, we are learning from the pathfinders in that context.</p><p>The getting it right for every child programme is the foundation for work with all children and families. It builds from universal health and education services, to change the way in which adults think and act to help all children and young people to grow, develop and reach their full potential. It is the means by which we can shift the emphasis in the provision of children's services from crisis intervention to prevention and early intervention&#8212;a number of members pushed for such an approach in their speeches.</p><p>In simple terms, the getting it right for every child approach is how practitioners and professionals across all children's and adult services will work together to meet children's needs. It overcomes interdisciplinary barriers and eliminates wasteful duplication and bureaucracy, thereby releasing resources, to ensure the outcomes that we want for all our children. It is building a common approach throughout Scotland, although local needs and circumstances will shape approaches locally. The getting it right for every child approach is the methodology that delivers&#8212;and the thread that stitches together&#8212;all our various substantive policies: the early years framework, the curriculum for excellence, the youth framework, health for all, and the better health, better care action plan.</p><p>However, as members are aware, there is no simple, quick fix. Transformational change does not come easily but requires a raising of awareness, a redesign of how practitioners go about their business, multi-agency training that is based on common language and processes, and the fostering of trust and understanding across services and with children and families.</p><p>The pathfinder experience has involved lengthy discussions, testing, refining and the reappraisal of <place-holder colnum=\"10496\"/> how wholesale change can be managed. That has always been challenging and at times it has been frustrating, as progress has been slow and planned activity has had to be rescheduled or scrapped. However, as time has gone on, results have become increasingly encouraging and positive. It is exciting when children and families report that they understand better what is happening and why. It is exciting when individual agencies experience the benefits of different ways of working, which mean that help gets to a child earlier. It is exciting when a health visitor can identify a need for social work support and can commission the resource directly, without being required to refer to line managers or another department. It is encouraging when a police officer at a domestic abuse incident can capture information that better informs the school, social work services, or whoever is best placed to give support, so that the children are helped more quickly and effectively. It is exciting when agencies can work together to decide how they can best help a child and then go ahead and take action, minimising bureaucracy and&#8212;more to the point&#8212;getting the child the right help much earlier, within a day or so of the decision.</p><p>Much remains to be done. The formal evaluation of the pathfinder process and the impact on individual children's outcomes will not be available until next year. However, the early signs are promising. What we have achieved so far is the development and testing of a practice model that can be applied by any practitioner, whatever the child's circumstances. We have developed a common approach to recording information and assessing risks and needs.</p><p>We have begun, with the University of Edinburgh, to map out how we can systematically measure improved outcomes for individual children, not just in relation to their needs but in relation to how services are working together and what the experiences of the child and family have been. Much more needs to be worked through and developed into an evaluation model that can inform performance, but we are on the way.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948624", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was not having a pop at Westminster; I was trying to suggest that we need to work out how the benefits system dovetails with our plans.

I also know of young people who will say that their experiences were positive and that the things that made the difference for them were continuity of care and positive, consistent support, which helped them to achieve their potential.</p><p>It is of course deplorable that not every child or young person will have a positive experience. That is one of the biggest challenges that we face together. I also find unacceptable the statistics that show that a large number of young people leave care at 16 years. I know that the reasons are varied, but members may rest assured that I will give the matter my full attention, particularly when I meet local authority representatives.</p><p>It is perhaps worth reminding members that local authorities have a duty to consider the best interests of the child or young person in <place-holder colnum=\"10179\"/> considering discharge from the looked-after system. The need for continuing support should and must be taken into account in the decision-making process. We will explore whether more needs to be done in that area in the light of the commissioner's findings.</p><p>The report also highlights some of the health issues that care leavers face. I assure members that our health policies, be they on drugs, alcohol or sexual health, will be fully inclusive of looked-after children and young people and care leavers. Many members will be aware of the phrase \"corporate parent\", which encompasses the ambitions and responsibilities that we must all have if we are to improve the life outcomes for all our looked-after children and young people and care leavers.</p><p>I do not say \"our\" lightly. Local authorities and community planning partnerships have direct responsibility for the children in their care. I agree whole-heartedly with what Cathy Jamieson said about that. In response to Karen Whitefield's point about key workers acting as champions for young people, I point out that that has been piloted in Inverclyde. One or two other local authorities are also interested in taking that forward, and I am trying to push them in that direction, but it is not just local authorities and community planning partnerships that have responsibility; all members of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government have a role and a responsibility to support local partnerships to help transform outcomes for looked-after children. Members can challenge local authorities and, of course, the Parliament frequently debates the importance of improving outcomes for looked-after children.</p><p>We also have a responsibility to learn from and act on important reports such as \"Sweet 16?\" It is simply not acceptable that young people are leaving the looked-after system and facing living in a B and B or being unemployed. We need to support and encourage the wider corporate family and ensure that it draws on all its services and resources to make the necessary changes to improve things.</p><p>As is set out in \"Supporting Young People Leaving Care in Scotland: Regulations and Guidance on Services for Young People Ceasing to be Looked After by Local Authorities\" of 2004, local authorities have a duty to assess the needs of young people who have been looked after and who leave care after school age. The assessment and subsequent plan, which is entitled \"Pathways\", is designed to work with young people to meet their needs on leaving care and to identify areas and issues that need to be addressed before the transition to independent living is made. That includes contingency plans. If the plans do not work out, the youngster should be able to go back, <place-holder colnum=\"10180\"/> for a short period or a longer period, to their foster carer or into a residential home. They should be able to retain the links that they have built up with workers.</p><p>The concordat between the Scottish Government and local government gives us a real opportunity to focus on improving outcomes for the most vulnerable members of our communities. I encourage members to read the single outcome agreements for the local authorities in their area and consider to what extent outcomes for looked-after children feature in those documents.</p><p>What specific actions are we taking forward? On a national level, all the work that is being done under \"Looked After Children and Young People: We Can and Must Do Better\", which began during Robert Brown's time as a minister, is raising the profile of looked-after children and young people and care leavers in general. However, it is also supporting a culture change through a range of actions, many of which will come to fruition in the next few months. In August, we will publish corporate parent guidance for community planning partnerships and a report that gives examples of positive practice by local authorities in respect of the support that is provided in further education, training and employment. After that, we will issue the updated \"Learning With Care\" training materials, a transitions toolkit and a resource pack for care leavers.</p><p>All those things have a clear common purpose: to improve outcomes for looked-after children and young people and care leavers. They support the culture change that is needed and will consider areas such as improvements in skills for independent living, support in on-going education, training and employment, and specialist aftercare support. We work closely with all the inspection agencies, and I know that they are also concerned about the messages in the \"Sweet 16?\" report.</p><p>The \"Sweet 16?\" report presents us all with questions that need to be answered and challenges that need our attention. It reminds us all that looked-after children and young people and care leavers are a vulnerable group and that they deserve our full attention if we are to support them to become all that they can be. I have taken on that challenge as Minister for Children and Early Years, and I am determined that the Scottish Government will work closely with all our partners to ensure that we do better across the board. We must all ask ourselves, \"Is this good enough for my child?\"<place-holder time=\"18:11:00\"/> <em>Meeting closed at 18:11.</em></p>", "hdate": "2008-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13776935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Age of Leaving Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo Robert Brown's remarks about the excellence of the debate and thank Karen Whitefield for securing it.

It is essential that all young people meet their full potential and that schools play their role in that by providing all pupils with accessible curriculum materials. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 specifically places a responsibility on local authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all young people who may require assistance, including those with visual impairments. Duties are laid on authorities to provide additional support for children under three who are referred to them by a health board. If parents are concerned about the provision that their child is receiving, there are provisions under the 2004 act to enable them to have those concerns addressed.</p><p>We are already supporting local authorities to meet their duty to deliver curriculum and school information in alternative forms, where necessary, to enable pupils to achieve their full potential. That is in line with the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils' Educational Records) (Scotland) Act 2002, which requires that all disabled pupils are able to access the curriculum. That includes ensuring that they have access to accessible curriculum materials.</p><p>Although I appreciate that the RNIB is calling for a national transcription service for visually impaired and blind pupils, as Robert Brown said, we must not forget that other formats may be more suitable for other groups of children with additional support needs. The scoping exercise, books for all, which was conducted by CALL&#8212;the national centre for communication aids for language and learning&#8212;reported that pupils with visual impairment were well catered for and that a number of other pupils with a print disability would benefit from adapted materials. That work was taken forward by a group of stakeholders that convened on three occasions after the publication of the \"Books for All\" report to consider its recommendations and the way forward. I am delighted to report to Parliament that the group, which included representation from local authorities, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, Dyslexia Scotland and the RNIB, has made considerable progress on achievements.</p><p>One of the biggest stumbling blocks in our schools is related to copyright legislation. Until April 2008, the schools copyright licence allowed materials to be adapted only for those with visual or physical impairment. From April, the Copyright Licensing Agency agreed to extend the licence to cover those who are visually impaired or otherwise disabled, which is a much wider definition. That notable achievement for the group will benefit a large number of pupils with a range of needs, including those with dyslexia. In addition, we have <place-holder colnum=\"8529\"/> funded the CALL centre to take forward a project that will enable pupils to listen to digital curriculum materials spoken in a Scottish voice. That material, in a voice provided by Heather the Weather, can be downloaded by all schools free of charge from the CALL centre website.</p><p>Finally, the greatest achievement of the group has been the creation of a database of adapted resource for all pupils with additional support needs. The database will be available to all schools through Scran, which is one of the largest educational online services to provide access to educational material. The database will contain a list of adapted materials and a note of where they are held. I refer to Robert Brown's remarks about a centralised system not requiring a centralised place. It is possible to access materials from throughout the country. They can be requested and made available to any pupil in Scotland. Subject to copyright agreement, the database will also hold adapted materials that can be instantly accessed and used.</p><p>The database, Scottish books for all, is being piloted with local authorities that are glow users and by those who were represented on the stakeholder group. Learning and Teaching Scotland commenced the pilot in April and will feed back its findings in June. It is hoped that Scottish books for all will be rolled out at the beginning of the new school year in August.<place-holder colnum=\"8530\"/></p><p>By accessing those resources and planning appropriately, teachers will be able to ensure that all pupils with additional support needs receive curriculum materials at the same time as their classmates in a format that meets their needs. I am sure that the Parliament and RNIB will agree that that not only meets the concerns that have been raised but goes further.</p><p>I acknowledge that RNIB's right to read campaign has been running for a number of years. However, I feel that the measures that I have outlined will have a tremendous impact on pupils' access to education and that the work has been done in a methodical and timely manner. I am grateful to RNIB for raising with us the issue of accessible curriculum materials and I trust that all are reassured that, given the steps that we have taken, there is no need for the type of national transcription service that RNIB proposes. We are totally committed to ensuring that all our pupils can access the curriculum. The \"Books for All\" report has enabled us to identify gaps in provision and take positive steps to ensure that we can achieve that aim.<place-holder time=\"17:42:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:42.</em></p>", "hdate": "2008-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13649096", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Right to Read Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will spare members details of my sleeping habits.

We all acknowledge that there are no easy fixes and that achieving fundamental change will take years. However, in many areas, there is tangible progress.</p><p>That said, we cannot forget the physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children that took place in Scotland's residential establishments. The issue has been a running sore in Scotland's history of taking care of children who could not live at home. The pain and trauma of those experiences were eloquently and bravely set out by survivors in their petitions to the Scottish Parliament. The cross-party group for survivors of childhood sexual abuse plays a crucial role by reminding us of survivors' concerns.</p><p>My statement today sets out the progress that we are making to improve the support that is available for survivors of in-care and institutional abuse. I make it clear that this statement is made on behalf of the whole Scottish Government. My ministerial colleagues and I cover the range of survivors' interests and, collectively, we are determined to work closely with our partners to achieve real change.</p><p>Survivors' commitment and action led, in 2004, to the then First Minister's apology for the abuse committed. He put in place a raft of work to get to the heart of how that abuse happened and to help us understand how we could prevent abuse on such a scale from recurring. One important area of work is the review that was led by independent expert Tom Shaw and which published, in November 2007, the document, \"Historical Abuse Systemic Review: Residential Schools and Children's Homes in Scotland 1950 to 1995\".<place-holder colnum=\"5926\"/></p><p>The Scottish Government is pleased to accept the recommendations of the Shaw review in full. There are a few differences in the detail of some of our proposals for taking forward the recommendations, but there is nothing that will affect their substance or intent.</p><p>In relation to Shaw's recommendation on the introduction of support services for in-care abuse survivors, I am pleased to inform Parliament of recent developments. Within the context of survivorScotland, the national strategy for adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse, which is being led by the Minister for Public Health, we intend to improve the well-being of, and services for, all survivors and to raise public awareness of the existence and impact of all forms of abuse.</p><p>The reference group that is taking forward survivorScotland has recognised the specific needs of in-care abuse survivors by establishing a sub-group, which is chaired by Gary Westwater and is made up of survivors and other stakeholders. That group concluded its work this week with proposals for a national service framework. It wants a national hub that provides advice and information and is able to link up with the local services that in-care survivors need, which should include advocacy, mediation and counselling services.</p><p>I am persuaded in principle that that is the way forward. I have made available central funding for the next three years and, subject to the comments of the survivorScotland reference group, I expect to be able to move ahead quickly with the procurement of this national service.</p><p>More widely, the Scottish Government has listened to survivors and their explanations of the importance of society acknowledging the suffering that they have experienced. At the moment, the courts are the only avenue by which survivors can receive such public acknowledgement. Of course, it is essential that abusers are brought to justice, but often that route alone will not meet survivors' needs.</p><p>I am pleased to inform Parliament that we have been actively scoping the adaptation of the principles of a truth and reconciliation model. We are committed to that. We are considering good practice examples for establishing a forum to give survivors the chance to speak about their experiences and to help them come to terms with the past. That will provide an invaluable opportunity to establish the facts, learn from the suffering and use the experience to help us protect and provide for children in the future.</p><p>I assure Parliament that, as the process develops, there will be further consultation with survivors of abuse, organisations that provide them with support and information and other <place-holder colnum=\"5927\"/> providers of care that share with Government responsibility for acknowledging and supporting survivors.</p><p>In that context, I turn now to the Scottish Law Commission report, \"Personal Injury Actions: Limitation and Prescribed Claims\", which was published on 5 December. The time bar is an issue in cases involving survivors of in-care and institutional abuse. That has recently been brought directly to members' attention through a letter from a survivor. My ministerial colleagues and I have every sympathy for survivors of abuse. However, the Scottish Government accepts the Law Commission's recommendations that prescribed claims should not be revived. The events in question took place before September 1964, and any attempt to legislate to revive those very old cases would run into very serious difficulties in relation to retrospection and European convention on human rights considerations.</p><p>The Law Commission's report does not make specific recommendations for survivors of abuse in relation to the limitation period for raising a claim, which is currently three years. It recommends the continuation of non-time-limited judicial discretion for cases outwith that period.</p><p>We genuinely do not believe that a change in the law to give abuse survivors a right to take any case to court would actually right the wrong in question and provide positive outcomes for survivors. Changing the law is not the way to tackle this issue. The Government's focus is the development of the forum that I have just described.</p><p>Another aspect of support for survivors that was identified by the Shaw review was the importance of ensuring that survivors and past residents could access their records. It is a tragedy that so little value was placed on keeping children's records. The stories of adults discovering from their records that they had siblings or finding out details of their families' circumstances that they never knew before are deeply moving. Even more heart-breaking are the stories of survivors who can find no record of themselves or their family.</p><p>We have learned the importance of looked-after children having a diary and memory book and records maintained for them from birth. However, we still have a responsibility to support adults to access their records and to make sure records for children in care now are properly stored.</p><p>The Shaw report rightly makes important recommendations about records and record keeping. The first is the need for a review of public records legislation. There are clear advantages in such a review, as the existing law is more than 60 years old. We have therefore asked the keeper of the records of Scotland, in consultation, to review <place-holder colnum=\"5928\"/> the legislation on public records in the light of the shortcomings that were exposed by Shaw.</p><p>Shaw also stresses the importance of using the existing law to improve the management of and access to children's records. Shaw recommends that children's organisations use the section 61 code of practice on records management from the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. We agree, so we will seek to include that code as a model for best practice within the looked-after children regulations, which are currently out to public consultation.</p><p>Shaw highlights the overriding concern of the survivors to whom he spoke that all those responsible for children in residential care now and in the future must learn the lessons of the past. He outlined the need to develop a culture in residential child care that is founded on children's rights and the need to raise respect for those children. I whole-heartedly agree with him. I want to work with partners to make residential care the first and best placement of choice for those children whose needs it serves. The starting point must be improving the status, morale and skills of residential care staff, who have among the toughest of jobs in caring for our most vulnerable children. We depend on their dedication and commitment, and they deserve improvements.</p><p>I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Government intends to take the necessary steps to require residential child care workers to register with the Scottish Social Services Council. Of course, many such staff have already registered with the council, but progress is not good enough. We must ensure that all staff register with it in order to secure a well-qualified and highly professional workforce. We will engage with a range of key stakeholders, including employers and the council, to ensure that all parties are well placed to take forward such a vital agenda.</p><p>More widely, the Scottish Government is committed to the long-term, sustainable development of the social services workforce in Scotland. We have been working with the social services sector to build capacity and skills through developing a continuous learning framework, which will help everyone in the sector to manage their career development and learning more effectively, and through a programme of action to improve leadership capacity.</p><p>Further improvements in residential care are also required. I will invite a range of partners to work with us to help achieve residential care of the best possible quality. I will look for recommendations on how we can achieve a supply of residential child care that matches the full range of needs of children and young people. We must also strengthen care planning for children in and out of placements by using the <place-holder colnum=\"5929\"/> getting it right for every child framework. Furthermore, we must develop a more consistent approach to commissioning that is based on the desired outcomes for all children, with agreed roles and responsibilities for commissioning authorities and providers. We need to achieve agreement among providers, local authorities as corporate parents, the inspectorates and others on respective responsibilities for ensuring safety and good-quality care for children. I expect to receive early proposals on how those challenges can be addressed by June this year.</p><p>I want partners to ensure that we demonstrate that we have learned the lessons that are set out in the Shaw review and other inquiries, but of course we need to be continually alert to the potential for the abuse of children and ensure that our systems for listening to children are continually refreshed.</p><p>In October, I announced that the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council had jointly commissioned an independent inquiry into abuse at Kerelaw and that further details would follow. Today, I have placed on the Scottish Government's website the jointly agreed terms of reference for that inquiry. The inquiry team will engage thoroughly with survivors and ensure that their voice is central to the inquiry. Ex-members of staff will also be invited to provide insights into how abuse occurred over a long period of time without its being prevented. The inquiry team will produce further details on its engagement with all relevant parties as its work continues. When the inquiry concludes, we will have a comprehensive picture of the strengths of the systems that we have in place to protect children and keep them safe, the shortcomings of those systems and further improvements to them that may be necessary.</p><p>Knowing what we know now, the Scottish Government considers that no further inquiries into historical abuse are necessary. Rather, our efforts will focus on the prevention of abuse in residential care and on the provision of support for survivors now. I am sure that all members will agree that the programme that I have set out will, over time, transform support for survivors.</p><p>The time for saying that we need to learn the lessons of historical abuse is over. Survivors deserve visible signs of progress. Their campaigning and willingness to share the horror of what they suffered will result in important changes that will help to protect children in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397987", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Survivors of Institutional Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The determination of the Scottish Government to improve the life chances of children who are looked after is well documented.

Financial compensation or redress is not part of the picture there. The key issue for survivors of abuse is to be able to relay their experiences, get them out into the public domain and have them recognised, and to get perpetrators or organisations that were responsible to admit what had happened. That is the key element that allows individuals to move forward with their lives and lead fulfilling lives, and not to continue to be scarred by what happened in the past.

The centenary has offered a unique opportunity for scouts to showcase their achievements and demonstrate the positive impact that they have had on local communities and at national level. The array of achievements is so great that it is difficult to single out specific ones, but I want to mention a few individually.<place-holder colnum=\"4281\"/></p><p>The first is Carrie Gibson's phenomenal achievement as only the fifth Scottish woman to reach the summit of Everest and the first person in the world to do so through scouting as part of the Scottish scouts seven summits expeditions team. I can only imagine how proud the scouting movement in Scotland is of her achievement. I congratulate her.</p><p>The second achievement is the scouts' involvement, for the first time, in the Edinburgh military tattoo's nightly finale. I understand that 50 scouts took part each night. They highlighted the contribution that scouts make and their role, and they showed to our many foreign visitors that they are highly valued and respected in Scotland.</p><p>The third achievement was the series of sunrise ceremonies on the morning of 1 August in which scouts celebrated the dawn of a new century of scouting. In particular, I want to mention the ceremony in Glasgow, which was hosted jointly with the 2014 Commonwealth games bid team.</p><p>It is fitting that the new century of scouting in Scotland will begin with the seven year lead-up to one of the most exciting events that we will ever have seen for our young people in Scotland. We are keen to get across the message that the Commonwealth games are not just for elite young athletes, important as those athletes are, but that they also present an amazing chance for young people throughout the country to get involved in shaping them and reaping the benefits that they offer. I am not surprised that the scouts have been involved from the beginning. I hope that they will continue to participate in promoting the games and the potential of the games for young people and communities alike.</p><p>The Government places great importance on the role and value of children and young people. We are committed to offering all our young people more choices and more chances to develop their potential and make a success of their lives. School and formal education are important for most young people to achieve their ambitions, but we also recognise the opportunities that informal learning and youth work offer. The best youth work opportunities let young people expand their horizons, develop their confidence and practise leadership and team-working skills. They involve young people in designing programmes and are clear about the outcomes that they want to achieve. The scouts have promoted and demonstrated in their work the qualities that I have mentioned for many years, and it is encouraging to see how the scouts organisation has modernised and adapted to reflect social change. The Scottish council of the Scout Association has increasingly been active and constructive in shaping and delivering national policy, most recently on youth work and the protection of vulnerable groups.<place-holder colnum=\"4282\"/></p><p>In particular, I have been impressed by how the scout movement has embraced the possibilities of the youth work strategy year of action and has contributed to its overall success. It has worked with YouthLink Scotland and other partners from the voluntary and local authority sectors to develop a peer assessment and grant distribution model for the youth opportunity fund and the youth facilities fund. I thank Jim Duffy in particular for his contribution to the development of the youth work volunteering action plan, which I launched at Youth Scotland's conference on 24 November. The Government progressed that work with active input from the voluntary sector. Jim and his colleagues from a range of national voluntary organisations have impressed me greatly with their ideas, expertise and desire to share their experiences and resources. The action plan supports the voluntary sector in developing the practical resources and support that it knows will work to enhance the experience of volunteers who work with young people. With the continuing input and support of the scouts and others, it can have a positive impact for many years to come.</p><p>Robert Brown asked about Project Scotland, which has been successful in raising the profile of volunteering among young people. We are keen to broaden it out to a wider range of people&#8212;to slightly older people who have more life experience and who can make a significant contribution to youth organisations. All the commitments that have been made to Project Scotland up to 2008-09 will be fulfilled.</p><p>Another avenue of support this year has been the voluntary organisations support fund. The fund, which is delivered through YouthLink Scotland, was intended to help national voluntary organisations to provide better training and to build their capacity, as Robert Brown mentioned. I know that they have found it valuable and that it has enabled them to progress work that enhances the quality and extends the scope of what they can provide to our young people. I am therefore pleased to announce today that the Scottish Government intends to continue the fund at the level of &#163;0.5 million a year for the next three years, to 2011. As a national fund, it will continue to be delivered through YouthLink, which is the national youth work agency. The fund will continue to support training and capacity building, but we will also explore with YouthLink and voluntary youth organisations the possibility of expanding its criteria. There may be scope to include initiatives by national voluntary organisations that are designed to support local groups' and volunteers' work with local authorities to deliver their agreed outcomes for young people.</p><p>I realise that I am out of time, so I conclude by re-emphasising that the Government is committed to offering more choices and more chances to <place-holder colnum=\"4283\"/> young people across Scotland. This year we celebrate 100 years of the scouts achieving just that. I welcome this opportunity to join parliamentary colleagues in congratulating them on 100 successful years. I trust that they will achieve continuing success and impact for many years to come.<place-holder colnum=\"4284\"/><place-holder time=\"17:37:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:37.</em></p>", "hdate": "2007-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scouting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Robert Brown for initiating the debate and for his continuing support and enthusiasm for the scout movement's work in Scotland.

There is nothing inevitable about looked-after children doing less well than their peers. \"We can and must do better\" is not just the name of a strategy but a stark challenge to us all to transform life chances for those children. There is no magic bullet; there is no one easy and straightforward approach.

Fourthly, that all placements should be designed to achieve stability; and fifthly, that appropriate support should be provided.</p><p>How will we achieve those principles? As I stated in our debate on early years and early intervention, we must focus on prevention and on helping to build resilience in children and families in the early years, identifying at an early stage those families who need more support. Then, we can mobilise agencies, under the getting it right for every child framework, to address problems before they become crises.</p><p>There will always be some cases where the interests of the child are best served by their being away from home. Removing a child of any age from their parents, whether for just a brief period or whether there is a possibility of permanence, is a huge step that places a great responsibility on both the local authority, as the corporate parent, and on the carer of the child. When that occurs, we want to support the wider family circle in looking after the child, where that is in his or her best interests.</p><p>The majority of kinship carers do not want or need any interference by the state, but they might welcome the occasional helping hand to ensure that both they and the children in their care get the support that they need. That is why I am delighted that Citizens Advice Scotland will establish a national framework of information services that are tailored to the needs of children in kinship care arrangements.

I am not sure when we will be in a position to launch the regulations thereafter. I will write to the member about the details of that.</p><p>It follows that children in kinship care should be afforded the same level of protection and quality assurance as children in foster care. A light-touch approval process for kinship carers will ensure that the kinship carer can meet the child's needs and it will clarify how the kinship carer will be supported to do so. That will include payment of a financial allowance by the local authority at the same rate as that paid by the authority to a foster carer, minus child benefit, to which a kinship carer is entitled but a foster carer is not.</p><p>Our fourth principle is about achieving stability. We must be in no doubt that reducing the drift and uncertainty that too many looked-after children face will require a transformational effort across all the care settings&#8212;our early intervention work, foster care, kinship care, residential care and adoption. What kind of life experience are we offering our most vulnerable children when, of the 4,313 children who were looked after away from home for more than two years, 40 per cent&#8212;or 1,800&#8212;had experienced three to five placements and 521 had experienced six or more placements?</p><p>From early 2009, there will be a new legislative tool. The permanence order, which was introduced <place-holder colnum=\"4088\"/> by the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007, will give children for whom adoption or return to family is not possible the assurance of a permanent home with an approved carer or in an appropriate residential setting. Preparations for that change are well under way.</p><p>The final strand of our strategy is to identify a proper and appropriate level of support for kinship and foster carers. The Scottish Government and COSLA have established a multidisciplinary reference group, co-ordinated by the British Association for Adoption and Fostering and the Fostering Network, to develop proposals on the recruitment and support of carers that are informed by best practice. It will report in the second half of 2008 and its recommendations will cover recruiting the right range and number of carers to meet the needs of children; providing a consistent assessment and approval process for foster and kinship carers; providing improved training arrangements to meet the requirements of today's and future carers; and identifying whether existing organisational arrangements for placing children in foster and kinship care are fit for the challenges that I have outlined.</p><p>The strategy sets out the vision and signals a joint commitment to deliver. However, we recognise that it is only the first step towards a genuinely child-centred system. Our next step is to embed into the legislation the getting it right principles. As I said, this evening, I will officially launch a consultation on regulations for looked-after children. We are consulting on a number of issues: the approval of foster carers and kinship carers; how we can address any shortcomings that are identified in the recent report from the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care on the quality of fostering services; improving the planning process for the child; creating and retaining records; and removing existing barriers to recruitment by lifting the prohibition on fostering by same-sex couples.</p><p>Taking forward the strategy will be the joint responsibility of the Scottish Government and local authorities. However, the people who do the really hard work are those who pick the child up from school, read them their goodnight story, take them to the nurse or dentist and give them a hug when they pass a test in class. All children need and deserve a carer who cherishes them and stands by them through thick and thin. I intend to ensure that this strategy will help more vulnerable children to get that type of care. We owe them nothing less.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that the needs of a child are paramount and that families should be supported to stay together; agrees that, where the child needs to live away from his or her birth parents, care within the family <place-holder colnum=\"4089\"/> circle by a kinship carer should be the first option unless it is not in the best interests of the child; believes that all placements for a child who must live away from his or her birth parents must provide a safe and nurturing home, whether for a planned short-term period or on a permanent basis, and affirms its commitment to the provision of equitable and appropriate support for all carers of looked-after children, with systems in place to ensure that carers can provide the best possible opportunities and chances to all looked-after children.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393641", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fostering and Kinship Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The draft regulations were published yesterday.

Through those initiatives, adults who previously were not offered any support have managed to access training and employment, build relationships and improve their mental well-being.</p><p>The national reference group has also worked to improve the consistency of diagnosis across Scotland by training professionals in the use of agreed diagnostic tools, which has had the added benefit of reducing some waiting times. The Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network has now published extensive guidelines&#8212;in fact, Scotland is unique in Europe in doing so&#8212;on assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions for children and young people with autism spectrum disorders, which will provide the evidence base to help doctors better diagnose and manage the condition.</p><p>Early diagnosis is critical, as James Kelly said. As I said in last week's debate on early years and early intervention, our focus must shift to preventing the emotional and behavioural problems of young people who have the disorder and helping to build resilience during the early years. We need policies and services across the board to deliver early intervention, thereby reducing the demand for crisis intervention, which currently dominates our systems. People with autism spectrum disorders, like everyone in Scotland, need health services to be there at the time when they need them.</p><p>Our communities also have a significant role to play in supporting positive childhoods and the quality of experience for children.

Guidance will shortly be issued <place-holder colnum=\"3303\"/> to promote greater use of local area co-ordinators by demonstrating how that role can be pivotal in delivering personalised services and self-directed support. That is still in its infancy, but, hopefully, we will see progress in that area. As Kenny Gibson said, guidance for the commissioners of health and social care services in relation to people on the autism spectrum is also near completion. The guidance will include good examples of successful practice.</p><p>I turn now to education. I would readily commit to support for special schools. There are a number of fine establishments up and down the country; Kenny Gibson mentioned Daldorch House in Ayrshire, which I visited recently. Robin Harper mentioned mainstreaming. The time is coming for a review that considers the place of special schools. I will certainly be looking at reinforcing support for the vital provision that such schools offer.</p><p>We must also recognise the role of education services in supporting young people on the autism spectrum. I am particularly concerned with ensuring that those young people receive the education that they deserve to ensure that they achieve their fullest potential.</p><p>Considering the needs of the individual is the key message of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, which came into force on 14 November 2005 with the aim of creating a stronger, better system for supporting children's learning. We know that schools alone cannot deliver all that children and young people need to make the most of their education. The act recognises that other agencies, particularly in social services and health, have a critical contribution to make. Those agencies need to be involved, especially at the time of transition to post-school provision.</p><p>The act also introduced new rights for parents. If parents feel that their child is not getting the education that he or she deserves, they have the right to give their view about the support that their child is getting. They also have the right to call for assessments. Like other members, I want the act to make a real difference to the lives of children and young people with ASD, but I accept that there is still considerable room for improvement.</p><p>Last year, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education published its report on educational provision for children with autism. Inspectors found much good practice in the work of education authorities, but made a number of recommendations to address the considerable challenges that still exist. To assist in taking forward those recommendations, and those made as part of the National Autistic Society's make school make sense campaign, the Scottish Government has created an autism spectrum <place-holder colnum=\"3304\"/> disorder education working group&#8212;which is quite a mouthful. Alison McInnes mentioned the role of Robert Brown in setting up the group. The intended outcome of the group is a resource pack for education authorities that will include guidance on strategic planning for future service provision.</p><p>I recognise the need for qualified teachers to increase their knowledge and awareness of additional support needs. Following recent talks, the General Teaching Council for Scotland has added five new areas to the professional recognition framework, one of which is autism. That will allow registered teachers to gain recognition for enhancing their knowledge and experience in this area.</p><p>Nanette Milne mentioned appropriate teacher training. She may be aware that the Scottish Government is funding the University of Aberdeen in a project to embed within initial teacher education inclusive approaches to teaching pupils with additional support needs. That work will include autism. I hope that the project will be a good model that can be spread out to other providers.</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises that much can be learned from sharing experiences. Last night, I was delighted to attend the Scottish launch of the Celtic nations autism partnership to support its work. Nanette Milne also mentioned the partnership. It provides Governments and support organisations with the opportunity to share ideas on developing the best possible outcomes for children and adults with autism.</p><p>I am well aware that the majority of support for children and adults with ASD comes from family carers. So, in concluding, I would like to extend a special thanks to all support providers&#8212;in particular, the national societies&#8212;for supporting families through the stress and uncertainty that comes with a diagnosis of ASD.</p><p>It is for us all, whatever our role, to ensure that policies are translated into practice. General and specialist services across health, social care and education all need to recognise and meet the needs of people with ASD and their families by working effectively and in a spirit of collaboration.<place-holder time=\"17:40:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:40.</em></p>", "hdate": "2007-11-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391703", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism Parliamentary Network"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I stand corrected.

A few last-minute changes required me to hold things back a little bit.</p><p>Yesterday, the Scottish Government set out its vision for how an effective early years strategy can contribute to a positive future for Scotland. Today, I want to turn attention to the most vulnerable children in society: those who are in need of our care and protection.</p><p>Child protection is one of the most difficult but important issues with which the Parliament deals. I doubt that there is anyone in the chamber who is not deeply moved by accounts of child abuse and neglect. We respond to the inherent issues as politicians; but we respond first and foremost as human beings. I hope that all will share my ambition and work with me to do everything possible to eradicate such suffering, as experienced by children and young people in Scotland. There is no room for party politics in child protection, and I acknowledge the considerable progress that the previous Administration made in driving child protection reform.</p><p>Throughout Scotland, multi-agency child protection committees now provide a strategic overview, and support change and improvements in child protection practice and multi-agency working. The strategic understanding of the Scottish Government and child protection committees throughout the country is being broadened and deepened by the learning secured through the tough child protection inspections that Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education leads. We expect child protection committees to work vigorously in addressing areas of weakness that are identified in inspections and in further developing areas of strength in the delivery of services.</p><p>Our vision is for services that always proactively seek to identify and assist children at risk, so committees are expected to use the self-evaluation tool, \"How well are children and young people protected and their needs met?\" That tool <place-holder colnum=\"3003\"/> is designed to build capacity within organisations for continuous self-inspection and improvement, regardless of the inspection cycle.</p><p>More generally, the challenge for everyone dealing with child protection is to create an environment in which we do not wait for crises to happen to children at risk before we intervene to help. We need to think and work proactively rather than reactively. Child protection services in Scotland need to be timely, flexible, responsive to the needs of the individual child, efficient, consistent with the principles of \"Getting it right for every child\" and delivered by skilful staff at every level of every organisation and every discipline that is involved in the care of vulnerable children. In addition, we need a coherent and joined-up means of delivering that vision in a multi-agency and multidisciplinary environment.</p><p>A consistent theme running through child protection is that of better and earlier information sharing. That is at the heart of good delivery of services to children who may be at risk; but, of course, we want to ensure that information is shared only when necessary and that everyone has the same understanding of the rules for doing so. That is why we are giving a high priority to devising and implementing appropriately a draft code of practice for sharing information when there are concerns about a child.</p><p>Since taking office, I have been considering a range of initiatives that relate to specific aspects of the child protection agenda and I have been considering how we ensure that our efforts in that area are coherent, strategic and proactive. Throughout my deliberations, I have reflected on the importance of childhood and the importance of striking the right balance between providing a safe and caring environment for Scotland's children and giving children space in which to grow up to be confident individuals. I am sure that that dilemma will strike a chord with many members who are parents as well as politicians.</p><p>To get the balance right&#8212;collectively, from national Government right down to individual parents&#8212;we have work to do, to assess risks to children better and to act upon risk assessments with improved skill, speed and precision. I attach high priority to making progress in that difficult area and to developing flexible and robust policy principles, to support parents and professionals who work with children.</p><p>A particular issue that accentuates the dilemma on risk is that of vetting and barring. The issue was debated during the passage of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced in the previous session of the Parliament. I understand the discomfort that some people have about disclosure checks, but none of us would want to drop our children off at school <place-holder colnum=\"3004\"/> without the assurance that the staff with whom they come into contact do not have a history that raises concern about children's safety. Our objectives must be to undertake disclosure checking in the most streamlined, efficient and unobtrusive way and to act swiftly on information that suggests that people who are working with children and protected adults might pose a risk to them.</p><p>The Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 delivered the framework for a robust vetting and barring scheme. I am pleased to announce the publication of the consultation on the secondary legislation required to implement the provisions of the 2007 act. I look forward to engaging further with parliamentary colleagues and stakeholders as we develop the secondary legislation and move closer towards implementing Scotland's strengthened vetting and barring scheme, which we hope will go live in the summer of 2009.</p><p>During the passage of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill, Robert Brown placed particular emphasis on the importance of wide-ranging and meaningful engagement with the sectors affected by the legislation. I too believe that we cannot deliver an effective vetting and barring scheme without such engagement. The operational details must be right, and the accompanying guidance and training need to be trenchant. The publication of the consultation marks the start of that engagement.</p><p>Although I want to frame consideration of child protection issues proactively and proportionately, it will always be necessary for the Scottish Government to respond to emerging issues of national significance. Many members will be aware of the revelations of abuse at Kerelaw school. Glasgow City Council's investigation of the school identified an unacceptable and long-standing history of abuse of children. The council acted quickly to close the school in 2005, to take disciplinary action and to provide support to the children who were in Kerelaw. Those actions are to be commended, but we would do a great disservice to all those involved if we did not consider what we can learn from the Kerelaw situation. I want to be assured that abuse and allegations of abuse on such a scale and over such a long duration cannot ever happen again in a residential setting in Scotland&#8212;we owe it to the children who were abused, to the staff who were not involved in the abuse but who were caught up in the events by association and to all children in residential settings, whom we have a responsibility to safeguard.</p><p>Since the publication of Glasgow City Council's report in June, I have been in discussion with the council about how we can ensure that we take <place-holder colnum=\"3005\"/> forward the lessons that can be learned from Kerelaw constructively and in a way that is sensitive to the subject matter and does not put disclosures about events at Kerelaw under a glaring public spotlight. I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council will jointly commission an independent inquiry into Kerelaw. I want the inquiry to secure comprehensive insight into the circumstances that led to the abuse at Kerelaw, to examine Glasgow City Council's stewardship of the school, to consider the steps taken by Glasgow City Council subsequent to the closure of Kerelaw, to identify recommendations relevant to ensuring that the contributory factors that led to abuse at Kerelaw never arise again, and to identify any other issues that the Kerelaw inquiry considers relevant to the safe care of young people in residential settings. I have asked Mr Eddie Frizzell to chair the inquiry. He is visiting professor of public service management at Queen Margaret University and a former senior civil servant. He brings a breadth and depth of experience and, most significantly, a fresh and objective perspective.</p><p>I want to ensure that the inquiry does not impede any criminal proceedings relating to Kerelaw and that it proceeds in a way that actively involves former pupils, staff and other stakeholders who want to participate. With input from the Lord Advocate and Glasgow City Council, I will in the coming weeks discuss a detailed remit with Eddie Frizzell, with a view to a further announcement in the new year. On this occasion, it is better to maximise the insight that we can gain from Kerelaw than to rush headlong into matters. It is better for Scotland's most vulnerable children that we get the matter right rather than carry out the inquiry swiftly.</p><p>Glasgow's willingness to open up the issues to independent scrutiny and to facilitate the learning from the Kerelaw situation sets an important example of leadership and accountability. Councillor Steven Purcell will shortly advise a full meeting of the council of the steps that the council has taken in relation to Kerelaw and of what we both want to achieve from the inquiry. I am pleased that Margaret Doran, Glasgow's executive director of education and social work, is in the public gallery today, which reflects the joint approach that we are pursuing.</p><p>I have received reports on Kerelaw from Glasgow City Council, HMIE, the Social Work Inspection Agency and the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care. In the interests of openness, I will place those reports on the Scottish Government website in the coming days. It is important that we all work together to learn all the lessons that we can from Kerelaw. I have also carefully considered how the independent inquiry sits alongside the forthcoming publication of the <place-holder colnum=\"3006\"/> independent systemic review of historical abuse in residential care between 1950 and 1995, by the expert Mr Tom Shaw. That review is of great importance&#8212;its purpose is to identify the various legal and regulatory systems and processes that were in place to protect children during the period. The review will help answer the fundamental question: how could abuse on such a scale have continued for so long without being prevented?</p><p>Mr Shaw will submit his review to the Government in mid-November and it will be published shortly thereafter. The findings will be analysed and considered fully as we make progress on proposals for strengthening the contribution of residential care. I also intend to introduce proposals on support for survivors of historical abuse, once I have considered Mr Shaw's findings. The Shaw report on historical abuse and the independent inquiry on Kerelaw are complementary and I am confident that, together, their findings will provide a rich insight that will contribute positively to the significant improvements that I want the Government and the Parliament to achieve for our most vulnerable children.</p><p>Residential care is the best possible environment for some children and young people, providing a range of opportunities for children to thrive and flourish in an environment that is safe and tailored to their individual needs. More than 220 establishments in Scotland provide some form of residential care to children. Those establishments should provide a safe and nurturing home for our most vulnerable children, and their staff should be dedicated and committed to providing the very best of care to those children. I want positively to support the sector so that all establishments and all those who are tasked with looking after children can make a positive contribution to the lives of and outcomes for vulnerable children.</p><p>We have a collective responsibility to all Scotland's children and young people to ensure that they get the best start in life and, if they are vulnerable, to ensure that they get all the care and help that they need. I urge members to join me in ensuring that the Parliament takes all reasonable steps to do the very best for the children in Scotland who need our help most.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390875", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child Protection"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I apologise to my counterparts for the late arrival of the promised advance copy of my statement&#8212;you know what they say about good intentions.

I believe that that ambition is shared across the chamber and by our partners in local government, health boards and beyond. However, with the evidence that stark health and education inequalities emerge within the first few years of a child's life, the scale of the challenge that faces us is clear. By the time that some children are three, their development is already up to a year behind that of their peers. The root causes are poverty and deprivation, and it is to our shame as a nation that one in four of our children are so disadvantaged. Modern medical research shows that children who are born into and grow up in such adverse circumstances suffer long-term impairment to their cognitive development and their physical and mental health.</p><p>It is time for Scotland to put a stop to that tragic waste of human potential and to break the pernicious intergenerational cycle of poverty, poor health and low educational attainment that blights our society. To achieve that, we need to gear up our public services across perinatal, pre-school, school, primary health care and social care to ensure that vulnerable families receive intense support when they need it, to build the resilience that can overcome disadvantage.</p><p>The early years strategy will be long term, will cover the period from pre-birth to eight years old&#8212;including pre-conception issues such as parenting education&#8212;and will cover the range of services that support young children and their families. Our focus must shift to prevention and helping to build resilience during the early years. We need to reconfigure policies and services across the board to deliver early intervention, thereby reducing the demand for crisis intervention, which currently dominates our systems.</p><p>Four themes are emerging as being central to the approach. First, we must build parenting and family capacity, particularly in the pre-birth and very early stages of a child's life. Most of a child's basic needs in the early years are met by parents, carers, families and their wider social networks. Children who live in families where parental <place-holder colnum=\"2851\"/> capacity is high lead, more often than not, happy and productive lives. However, there is a group of parents who are not so well equipped to meet the needs of their children, either because their own parenting skills are poorly developed or because of wider factors such as poverty, domestic violence, mental health problems, substance misuse and so on.</p><p>I do not believe that there is sufficient appreciation in our society of the fact that parenting children is perhaps the hardest, and certainly the most important, task that any adult will undertake in their life. Although children's services will have a role to play in providing the support that children in vulnerable families need, some of the biggest and longest-term gains are likely to flow from supporting parents to develop their own skills, use the strengths within the family, build social networks and address the stresses that have a negative impact.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390473", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Early Years and Early Intervention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Early years policy holds the key to building the sort of Scotland that we want for the future, in which all our children are successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors.

That will be the subject of the forthcoming fostering and kinship care strategy, which I hope to announce later on this year.</p><p>I return to the theme of providing a supportive environment for children and families. Less tangible aspects of the issue include the existence or absence of positive aspirations for children and the degree to which the community sees the welfare and well-being of children as a collective responsibility. We do not deal with that terribly well in Scotland. Many aspects of policy will need to come together with grass-roots social change to make an impact. I do not underestimate the challenges.</p><p>The third theme that we want to pursue through the strategy is delivering services that meet the needs of children and families in a holistic way. The early years service landscape remains quite fragmented, with a plethora of health, social work, education and child care services. The fact that several of those services encompass public, private and voluntary sector provision makes the landscape even more complex.</p><p>In many areas, local authorities and their community planning partners are doing positive work to join up approaches at local level, but fragmentation can have many consequences, from children being shuffled between several different forms of child care to multiple assessments and the risks that arise from the complexity of sharing information.

When children need to be cared for away from their birth family, we are determined to support the delivery of consistent, secure, high-quality and nurturing care, whether that is provided by the wider family, by foster carers or in residential care.

In July, I announced an initial &#163;4 million package for training, advice and information for foster and kinship carers. The funding provided agencies with a training grant of &#163;1,000 for each full-time foster carer and each kinship carer of a looked-after child. Members might view the equality of treatment of foster carers and kinship carers as something of a signal of future intentions. The grant has proved to be a tremendous success&#8212;so much so that we have made available additional resources to extend the grant to foster carers who provide short-term breaks and respite care to <place-holder colnum=\"2655\"/> children in need, and who play a crucial role in helping families to stay together. We have also extended the grant to include kinship carers of children who do not fall into the looked-after child category but who are known by their local authority to be vulnerable and in need. That means that my Government has now spent a total of &#163;6.1 million on supporting training for foster and kinship carers.</p><p>I am also grateful to the Fostering Network Scotland for supporting the Government's investment in training. The network hosted a meeting earlier this month that allowed local authorities and independent providers to come together and share ideas for commissioning and delivering training throughout the coming year. I am confident that that investment will lay the foundation for improving the quality of care that is provided to children. It also reinforces this Government's commitment to supporting those carers.</p><p>In addition, I have made available &#163;126,000 to the Fostering Network Scotland so that it can expand support services to foster carers who are the subject of allegations. Our consultation told us that this can be an extremely stressful situation for carers that can mean that they need independent specialist support. I have also asked FNS to expand and further develop its mediation and advice helplines. I am delighted that it will be able to extend its services across Scotland and provide the in-depth support that has proved to be invaluable to many carers.</p><p>I have noted Christine Grahame's estimate of the shortage of foster carers and have a number of points to make about that. Leaving aside the arguments about precise figures, I agree that some children are having to wait for placements that will provide stability and security.

I hope to touch on that issue later in my speech.</p><p>The Government's agenda is for the long term, which is why we are placing so much emphasis on early years. The first few years of a child's life shape and can determine their future growth and development. Those are the years in which enthusiasm for learning ignites and carries <place-holder colnum=\"926\"/> children through school, college and university and into later life.</p><p>In the previous session, the Education Committee's early years inquiry found that after a good start, with the introduction of free nursery places for all three and four-year-olds, momentum in developing early years services gradually eroded over the past five years. I am determined that, through the development of a comprehensive early years strategy over the next 12 to 18 months, we should reinvigorate early years policy and set a course that will lead us towards our long-term vision of integrated education and care services.</p><p>During the development of the strategy, I will work hard to build consensus with colleagues from all parties and will welcome good ideas from all quarters. I heard what Labour members said today. I know that there is agreement across the chamber that we should strengthen support for young children and their families and that our announcement of the first step in expanding pre-school provision for three and four-year-olds will be widely welcomed.</p><p>Many members are keen to strengthen services for the under-threes. The failure to address that issue was a deficiency in this debate. The first report of the growing up in Scotland study demonstrated the extent of the disadvantage that some children experience from birth and how that impacts adversely on their life chances. The recently published millennium cohort study confirmed that, by the time they reach their third birthday, children from deprived backgrounds can be as much as a year behind their peers in cognitive and social development. To our shame as a nation, the vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation remains to be broken. Early intervention is the key to achieving that. Over the coming months, we will develop our policy on supporting our youngest children.</p><p>We need to look beyond the existing narrow focus of early years policy to create a new vision of an early years sector that encompasses family support, pre-school education, child care and early primary education as a coherent whole&#8212;improving the transition to early primary education is vital. We also need to ensure that children in primary school receive extra support as soon as a need is identified. Nurture groups, for example, have been particularly successful in supporting young pupils, and we should build on that approach.</p><p>I stress the importance of different sectors working together to support children and their families. We know that an integrated approach to delivering services for children has particular benefits for disadvantaged families.

As <em>The Sunday Times</em> illustrated the other week, using HMIE statistics, tens of thousands of our youngsters are failing to master the basics of literacy and numeracy by the age of 14. Why is this happening? It is happening because Labour has failed to keep its promises on cutting class sizes. We need to give our teachers time and space to teach the basics and not overload them with endless Government initiatives, over-assessment and bureaucracy. We also need to break the vicious cycle of poverty, deprivation, low educational attainment and poor employment prospects, which prevents many of our children from fulfilling their potential. That situation has been brought into stark prominence by the publication the other week of the United Nations Children's Fund report, which concluded that Britain is a \"picture of neglect\" when it comes to the well-being of children.</p><p>Unlike the Executive, the SNP is determined to break the vicious cycle. We will give all our children a head start by investing heavily in health and child care in the early years of a child's life, intervening where necessary and supporting responsible parenthood.

However, it is important to recognise its limitations. We cannot afford to be lulled into a false sense of security by a tightening of the law. There are people who do not have a recorded history of harming vulnerable people but who are potential offenders and must be detected and prevented from causing harm. That is why we need to extend the debate about the protection of vulnerable groups beyond legislation and into policy and practice.</p><p>We must recognise that the risk of harm cannot be eliminated, but the risks should be minimised and dealt with proportionately. I do not think that that is what is happening, and that the result is a distortion of the relationship between adults&#8212;particularly men&#8212;and children. We have almost reached the stage at which the motivation of any man who wishes to work with children is automatically questioned. It is little wonder that many men now choose not to put themselves in such a position.</p><p>I accept that the minister has made significant concessions that should help to reassure the voluntary sector that it will not be unduly burdened by matters such as retrospective checking and fees for disclosure checks. However, as he said, that has been the easy part of the legislative process.

The biggest potential downside to the bill is that it might reduce the voluntary sector's capacity to deliver services to children and vulnerable adults by diverting resources to administering the protection system or by deterring volunteers.

HMIE undoubtedly has a key role in improving Scottish education. Its senior chief inspector, Graham Donaldson, mapped out the route we should be following in that regard in his report on the subject last year. He spelled out the key challenge that is faced by us all&#8212;politicians, professionals and parents&#8212;in the following terms:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"While many of our young people perform well in school and beyond, too many do not develop sufficiently the competences, capabilities and values which are vital for the <place-holder colnum=\"32158\"/> future success and well-being both of themselves and of Scotland as a whole. For many, that future success will depend on participation in learning once they leave school ... However, over 20% of adults report difficulties with literacy and numeracy and too many young people aged 16 to 19 are not in education, employment or training.\"</p><p>In other words, the performance of the lowest-attaining 20 per cent of our school pupils has been flatlining for some considerable time. We must break that inertia if we are to progress as a nation. The chief inspector emphasised the need for high-quality leadership, for creating space for imaginative teaching and for more rigour in the development and certification of core skills. He argued that HMIE must make the maximum impact with the minimum intrusion in the system.</p><p>I turn to the issues that were raised in the debate. Brian Monteith is entirely mistaken in saying that the senior chief inspector is not accountable to Parliament for his organisation. He has responded every time to the Education Committee's many requests to him over the past four years. The minister explained the changes to the inspection regime, which have been approved by the committee. Fiona Hyslop addressed the issue of culture change, and the very great need to reduce assessment overload and move towards self-evaluation in quality assurance. It was a pleasure to see Peter Peacock in the chamber, this time extolling the virtues of the Scottish inspection system, which is world class.</p><p>All that said, neither the inspectorate nor the school system can operate in isolation from its environment. The United Nations Children's Fund report that was published the other day starkly revealed the alienating nature of British society. The United Kingdom is failing its children. Scotland can do better than that. It is time for us to come together to achieve the goal of giving every one of our children an equal chance to succeed in life.

Presumably, it was transferred to Dunfermline, where the group is based. The ruthlessness of the action is beyond belief and must be condemned by the whole chamber, especially because 420 workers have been dumped on the scrapheap without so much as a penny from Mr Russell in the form of redundancy payment.

My friend Jim Mather likes to identify the core problem. In our education system, the core problem that we face is the persistent underperformance of one in five school pupils. We have had 10 years of Labour rule but <place-holder colnum=\"31939\"/> no improvement in attainment levels among the lowest-performing 20 per cent of the school population.</p><p>How can it be acceptable that so many of our youngsters go through the school system without acquiring the basic literacy and numeracy skills that are needed to fit them for their working lives? It is a national scandal that we continue to have one of the highest rates in the western world of 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training. Those stark facts are an undeniable measure of Labour's failure to deliver on its education, education, education pledge. Let us not forget that the Liberal Democrats in Scotland are fully complicit in that failure.</p><p>We all know that poverty and deprivation are the root cause of educational underperformance. The Labour Government has failed to break the vicious cycle of poverty, lack of qualifications, low pay and unemployment, yet it is clear that early intervention, through the provision of high-quality child care and early years education, is the key to turning that situation round. For children from deprived backgrounds&#8212;Alex Johnstone mentioned this point&#8212;such an approach provides the early cognitive and behavioural gains that, if they are properly supported through the school journey, can help to equalise life chances and educational opportunities.</p><p>I do not understand why the Executive has allowed the early momentum that was gained with the introduction of free nursery places for three and four-year-olds to run out of steam. The constant interference in policy development by a First Minister who fancies himself as an education guru may have something to do with it. Whatever the reason, progress in Scotland has been limited in comparison with what is happening elsewhere in Europe, including south of the border, where there is a 10-year child care strategy. Here, the Executive inexplicably regards a three-year planning horizon as sufficient for the delivery of high-quality services, and the provision of family centres in deprived areas as a matter for local consideration. No leadership; no ambition; no idea&#8212;it is time to sweep this tired regime and its failed policies out of the way of real progress.</p><p>As Fiona Hyslop set out, the SNP will inject much-needed dynamism into early years policy. The SNP would introduce a 50 per cent increase in hours of free nursery education, and access to a nursery teacher for all our pre-school children&#8212;that is an improvement in quality as well as in quantity. Class sizes would be cut to no more than 18 for primary 1, primary 2 and primary 3, and there would be pilot provision of free school meals for that same group of children. Our aim is to give our children the best possible start to their education by allowing their teachers to spend the <place-holder colnum=\"31940\"/> time they need to work individually with their pupils.

Similarly, there is no significant opposition to the notion that a registration scheme of the type that is recommended by the Bichard report should be established. However, the debate today and the Education Committee's consideration of the bill have raised serious concerns about the nature and shape of the bill that was introduced by the Executive. Specifically, doubts have been raised about whether the bill is a proportionate response to the problem that it seeks to address and whether its implementation might have adverse&#8212;albeit unintended&#8212;consequences. The biggest potential downside to the bill is that it might reduce the capacity of the voluntary sector to deliver services to children and vulnerable adults by diverting resources to administering the protection system or by deterring volunteers.</p><p>To his credit, the minister has allayed some of the fears by responding with proposals for a longer timescale to phase in retrospective checking for the existing workforce. That should ease some of the burden. Incidentally, I hope that Euan Robson's interesting suggestions on how to take retrospection forward are taken on board.</p><p>Similarly, on information sharing, we believe that the minister has made the correct decision to drop part 3. Ensuring that relevant information is shared among agencies is vital if we are to avoid a repetition of some of the tragic cases that we have witnessed in recent years, when failure to share information resulted in horrific abuse and the deaths of youngsters who could and should have been afforded the protection of the relevant authorities. However, it is clear that consultation on that part of the bill has not been sufficient and that, if it were enacted in its current form, it might have a damaging effect on the welfare needs and human rights of those whom it was designed to protect. Iain Smith and Elaine Murray explained that particularly well.<place-holder colnum=\"31124\"/></p><p>Dropping part 3 and addressing the timetable for retrospective checks for the existing workforce are significant concessions. However, a question remains about whether the benefits that the proposed vetting and barring scheme that is outlined in parts 1 and 2 will bring will significantly outweigh adverse impacts. Certainly, the proposed improvements&#8212;the continuous updating of disclosure checks and an end to multiple applications&#8212;are desirable and worth having. On that basis, the SNP supports the general principles of the bill. However, we share the Education Committee's reservations, particularly its concern that so much of the guts of the bill will be left for ministers to determine in secondary legislation and codes of guidance. We agree with the committee that the bill should not proceed to stage 2 until draft regulations, guidance and codes of practice have been produced for scrutiny. I am interested to hear what the minister says on that when he sums up.</p><p>We should not rush through any legislation without adequate scrutiny just because we are coming to the end of a parliamentary session, least of all legislation on a sensitive matter. Although legislation might be important for child protection, it is not the be-all and end-all. David McLetchie spoke well about the something-must-be-done tendency that dominates the agenda. New laws will certainly do something, but will they be effective? That is the real question. To paraphrase Fiona Hyslop, bureaucratic systems do not necessarily protect children and vulnerable adults; it is people who protect other people.</p><p>Even if the bill is passed, we cannot afford to be lulled into a false sense of security. After all, even if the vetting and barring scheme works perfectly to exclude those with a history of harming vulnerable people, there will still be potential offenders who need to be detected and prevented from causing harm. I hope that the Executive and its successor will recognise that reality and ensure that policy development is not confined to legislation such as the bill but is extended to the inculcation of best practice in recruitment and workforce training to enhance the protection of vulnerable groups.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No one takes issue with the bill's overall objective, which is to better protect children and vulnerable adults from abuse by people who are working with them on either a paid or a voluntary basis.

The sense of betrayal felt by the Ayrshire public served by Ayr's A and E unit is now palpable and I will be very surprised if the Labour vote at the forthcoming elections does not suffer accordingly.</p><p>What is clear now is that the only hope of saving Ayr's A and E unit comes in the form of an incoming SNP Administration on 3 May. Of course, Labour candidates will try to sweeten the bitter pill by insisting that no changes will be made to Ayr A and E unit until all the community-based facilities and services that have been promised are in place. Both the minister and the health board have made that pledge but, frankly, it is not worth the paper that it is written on. It will carry no weight with a public sickened by a sham consultation process, in which overwhelming public opposition&#8212;55,000 signatures on a petition, protest marches and the like&#8212;made no impact.

It will take several years for new staff to be recruited and trained to provide the promised new services. There is no way in which those services can be put in place without deploying existing hospital staff, including A and E staff. I did not come to my own conclusions on that. That informed view was provided to me by no less an authority than Professor David Kerr, when, along with MSP colleagues, I met him to discuss the health board's proposals last year.</p><p>When he is making that pledge, the minister also knows that existing A and E staff will be looking around for jobs with better prospects as of now. Once they move, it will be extremely difficult to recruit for an A and E department in its last days. There will be no stability at Ayr A and E over the next few years.

The practical importance of academic subjects needs to be made clearer and careers guidance needs significant reform.

The committee has fulfilled its duties and obligations many times over in reaching out across Scotland to meet disabled people and service providers to seek their views, to inform its deliberations. As a consequence, the recommendations in the report have gained added weight and relevance.</p><p>I suggest that the Parliament has a duty to ensure that this is one committee inquiry report that is not allowed to lie on an Executive shelf gathering dust. A concern is that the Executive has been slow to follow up the establishment of the independent living review project team in England, which the Prime Minister's strategy unit initiated. In its briefing for the debate, the Disability Rights Commission makes it clear that it regards <place-holder colnum=\"30577\"/> the committee's recommendation that the Scottish Executive establish an independent living task force as the key proposal that underpins every other aspect of the report. The task force's objective would be to ensure co-ordinated policies and the delivery of services that will allow all disabled people to have the same choice, control and freedom as any other citizen at home, at work and as members of the community.</p><p>A lack of interdepartmental co-ordination has been a weakness of the Executive, and Parliament will require to see the flesh on the bones of any commitment to the independent living agenda before it will be convinced by any Executive pronouncement, especially at the present stage of the parliamentary session. The minister acknowledged that the disability working group's recommendations do not go as far as the committee's recommendations on independent living. When the Executive's response is issued in January, it will be scrutinised keenly on that matter.</p><p>As befits the inquiry's scope, the debate has been wide ranging. Many members have made pertinent speeches. Sandra White, John Swinburne, Shiona Baird and Jackie Baillie highlighted the importance of transport as a cross-cutting issue. Without accessible public transport and secure door-to-door services, disabled people can be excluded from access to leisure and other services. Disability equality training for public sector staff is clearly important. As the minister says, the advent of the disability equality duty must become much more evident in planning services.</p><p>Nora Radcliffe, Jamie McGrigor and Carolyn Leckie emphasised the barriers that people who seek work or who are being supported in work face. We all know that paid work is the main route out of poverty, which afflicts a much higher proportion of disabled people than of the general population. Inadequate information for potential employees and employers, the need for more support at work through better funding for aids and adaptations and a lack of flexibility in working hours and in the benefits system add up to fragmented and patchy support services to help people to access and retain employment. We can and must do better. The solutions are known, but they are not being implemented.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest challenge that we face is the need to change attitudes to disability and to disabled people. It must be recognised that people should not be defined or categorised by the impairment or long-term illness that they have and that such people have an equal right to participate in society without having to overcome barriers such as discrimination or false assumptions about <place-holder colnum=\"30578\"/> what they can and cannot do and about what they can expect from services.</p><p>It is clear that the impact of disability is affected greatly by environmental, attitudinal and cultural barriers to full participation.

No doubt they will be glad to put that burden down at the end of today. I also thank Robert Brown. He has shown exemplary willingness at all times to take on board with courtesy and consideration the many representations that were made to him.</p><p>That said, I echo the point of order that Lord James Douglas-Hamilton made this morning at the start of our stage 3 consideration. The bill's complexity and the many changes that it has undergone from its introduction to the end of stage 2 should have resulted in an extended period of reflection and discussion prior to stage 3, but that period has been much more truncated than normal. I do not think that even the minister can say, hand on heart, that this piece of legislation has emerged from the process in its best form.</p><p>As I indicated earlier, we in the Scottish National Party are particularly concerned about whether the provisions on the interface between the children's hearings system and the adoption courts are fit for <place-holder colnum=\"30232\"/> purpose. If that interface turns out to be flawed in practice, the Parliament will need to rectify the situation through new primary legislation in the next session.</p><p>The SNP supports the bill and welcomes the broad thrust of its provisions. We see it as an important part of the bigger policy framework that must be put in place if we are to address the overwhelming disadvantages that are faced by children who are taken into care. I also welcome the publication of the Executive's national fostering and kinship care strategy, which is out for consultation from today&#8212;better late than never.</p><p>It must also be recognised that policy implementation is as important as policy development. A key test for the bill will be the construction of regulations that ensure the development of adoption support services that meet adoptive families' needs. We await with interest the introduction of subordinate legislation on this matter and on adoption allowances.</p><p>I have two more specific points, one positive, one negative. I still believe that the bill's biggest sin of omission is its failure to give a voice to children under 12 who are involved in the adoption process. I regret that amendments that sought to provide access to independent advocacy were voted down at stage 2. After all, the child is at the centre of the adoption process and has a right to be heard.</p><p>Finally, I am glad that Parliament used reason and common sense in dealing with the controversial issue of extending the pool of adopters. We must recognise that the bill's approach ensures that the child's interests are paramount. All prospective adoptive parents must undergo a very rigorous assessment process to determine their suitability to adopt a child. A great deal of care is taken to ensure that individual children will be matched with suitable adoptive parents.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the bill extends the pool of adopters beyond married couples, given that nowadays many other family arrangements can provide security and stability in children's best interests. As a married person with four children, I believe that marriage is the best family arrangement in which to bring up a child, but I am not prepared to rule out, because of marital status or gender, opportunities for vulnerable children, many of whom have been subjected to abuse or neglect by their natural parents, to find loving homes with parents who are suitable in every way.</p><p>The SNP will vote for this bill at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2006-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13374043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take this opportunity to thank all those people without whose assistance proper scrutiny of the bill would have been an almost impossible task.

The adoption policy review group was exercised by the issues with which the group deals. The key problem stems from an overlap between the children's hearings system and the courts that deal with adoption. The adoption process can be derailed if the two bodies cannot be aligned and end up making contradictory or differing decisions.</p><p>To solve that problem, the adoption policy review group made two recommendations. The first of those would govern what happens when a permanence order application is made for a child who is subject to a supervision requirement. The recommendation was that, during the period when the permanence order is being determined, any existing supervision requirement should continue in force but any changes should be made by the court rather than by the children's hearing that made the supervision requirement. In addition, any interim orders that are made by the court should supersede inconsistent conditions of the supervision requirement.</p><p>The point at issue is that the Executive's attempts to implement that recommendation in sections 91A and 91B appear not to be fit for purpose, even with the adjustment that is proposed in amendment 153. BAAF Scotland has <place-holder colnum=\"30204\"/> provided a detailed technical analysis, which is informed by not just legal expertise but practical professional experience, as to the reasons why that is so. I hope that the minister and other members have received a copy of that analysis.</p><p>The upshot is that there is a fear in professional circles that, because the interface between the court and the children's hearing is not set out in line with the APRG recommendation, local authorities will not use permanence orders. If that is so, the bill's key reform mechanism will be dead in the water. That is a situation that none of us would wish to see. Amendment 51 is offered as a solution to the problem of implementing the APRG recommendation.</p><p>We are in a very unhappy predicament here. Serious questions are being asked about, essentially, the competence of the bill's draftsmanship. Last minute manuscript amendments were made to critical provisions in the bill. I do not see how the minister can convincingly rebut the detailed criticisms that are made in the BAAF briefing. Members present should be aware that the briefing and amendment 51 were prepared by the independent legal adviser to Sheriff Principal Graham Cox's adoption policy review group and that BAAF has the support of the Association of Directors of Social Work in its concerns. I urge the minister to accept amendment 51 and thereby dispel the fears of a fundamental flaw in the bill.</p><p>Amendment 54 would reinstate the APRG's second recommendation, which the Executive has decided not to implement, on the interface between the court and the children's hearing. The provisions in amendment 54 would govern what happens after a permanence order has been granted and the hearings system is still involved, or wants to become involved, with the child. The amendment would again give the court primacy for any variation of the conditions of the permanence order. The fact that such children would be treated differently in the hearings system would be offset by the consideration that there must be some limit to what a hearing may do about the residence, contact and basic welfare aspects of the life of a child who is already subject to a court order. If a permanence order is to work, it must provide a significant level of security for the child.</p><p>I intend to move amendments 51 and 54.</p>", "hdate": "2006-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13373958", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: After section 91"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Robert Brown rightly said, the amendments in group 15 address a complex area of the law and practice.

The fact is that Scotland spends less than 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product on all early years education and care services. The minimum recommended by the European Commission's child care network is 1 per cent. Social democratic countries such as Sweden and Denmark spend more than 2 per cent.</p><p>We should be mindful that this Parliament does not have all the policy tools to hand with which to effect change. The tax and benefits systems could and should be used as key drivers for change. Although we welcome the provisions of Westminster's Work and Families Act 2006 to extend maternity leave and pay, Gordon Brown seems determined to stick to tax credits rather than move to provider subsidies. As well as easing the burden on parents, supply side subsidies would help to stabilise funding for services and make it easier to deliver improved staff pay, training and conditions.</p><p>With regard to funding, the committee found inconsistency, complexity and incoherence in funding streams and reporting requirements, and called for rationalisation and streamlining. The City of Edinburgh Council's suggestion that the Executive should create a single early years budget to cover sure start, the child care strategy, pre-school education, the working for families programme and aspects of the change fund has considerable merit and would raise the profile of and give impetus to early years work in local authorities. Such reform would provide a mechanism to encourage the reallocation of resources into early years provision and would attract additional funding for early intervention. It would also dovetail with moves to integrate children's services, which we are all keen to promote.</p><p>The family centre model that has been mentioned could deliver a range of services including care for under-threes and nursery <place-holder colnum=\"28373\"/> education for three and four-year-olds, in addition to family support. It has a great deal to offer, not least in facilitating multidisciplinary team working. Family centres would be particularly valuable in addressing the problems that are associated with poverty and disadvantage. Given that they are the centrepiece of England's 10-year strategy for child care, it is disappointing that the Executive regards the question whether more family centres are needed as a matter for local consideration and considers a three-year planning horizon to be sufficient for the delivery of high-quality services. The Scottish National Party begs to differ.</p><p>Finally, I turn to workforce issues. The committee's report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The single most important factor in improving quality in the early years sector is raising skill levels across the workforce.\"</p><p>We are disappointed with the Executive's response to the national review of the early years and child care workforce and we share Unison's concern that the Executive has spurned the opportunity to develop a national framework of grades to create a career ladder for nursery nurses and has not sought to pursue national pay bargaining. Our nursery nurses surely deserve better.</p><p>We are deeply concerned that the Executive has explicitly rejected the committee's view on the role of teachers, which is that the use of qualified teaching staff ought to be a requirement in the delivery of pre-five education in disadvantaged areas because such staff have the necessary expertise to identify additional support needs and thereby facilitate early intervention.</p><p>Fiona Hyslop will set out the very different approach that we intend to pursue in government.

The lifelong pain and heartache that the individuals concerned suffered was pitiable and we can be thankful that the rigid social norms that led to some 2,500 adoption applications in 1949 are well behind us.</p><p>However, in the here and now we are afflicted by social fragmentation as never before.

Many of those children are taken into care to be looked after by local authorities and it is those children who are the most likely to be subject to the adoption process.</p><p>It is worth emphasising that the route into a caring family environment that we are discussing is limited to just a few hundred of the several thousand children who are looked after at any one time. The bill is a fairly small part of the bigger policy framework that must be put in place to address the overwhelming disadvantages that looked-after children face.

Perhaps we can engage in a debate on that a little later. My colleague Maureen Watt will cover the fostering concerns, so the minister may want to respond to her comments.</p><p>I welcome the Executive's response to the recommendations in the Education Committee's stage 1 report, despite the fact that it appeared just in time&#8212;a new concept. Lest I appear too churlish, I congratulate ministers on taking on board most of the committee's recommendations for amendments. Our concerns about resources for adoption support services appear to have been addressed positively, though we await with interest the outcome of the further consultations that the Executive will undertake on the demand for and costs of enhanced support services. The Finance Committee was rightly sceptical of the financial memorandum's claim that the bill will be cost neutral. That committee also highlighted the current underfunding of such services.</p><p>Adoption UK in Scotland, which has experience of supporting adoptive families, points out that adoption support services come at a heavy price, but that, without them, the cost to children in the care system, to the adoptive families who parent them and to society is far greater. Funds must be available for families who parent children who have been traumatised by abuse and neglect&#8212;that should be a routine part of adopting today. It is a sad fact that one in five adoptive placements breaks down. Providing resources for early intervention such as adoptive parenting training, therapeutic services and financial support can contribute significantly to reducing that figure.</p><p>I turn to the important issue of human rights for parents, families and children. We welcome the bill's compliance with the European convention on human rights, particularly with regard to dispensing with parental consent to adoption orders. We also welcome the introduction of permanence orders, which will help with the early resolution of contact issues. The orders will provide greater certainty, security and stability for children by being more flexible and capable of being tailored to individuals' needs than the current court orders are.</p><p>I am sure that the committee will return to the need for the wider family to be involved in arriving at the best care options, an issue to which John Swinburne alluded in his intervention. Placing children with strangers must always be the last <place-holder colnum=\"27411\"/> resort. Children 1<sup>st</sup> pointed to the use of family group conferencing as an effective, tried and tested model that often results in kinship care solutions, which minimise the trauma that children experience. Children in Scotland emphasised that unmarried or non-resident fathers should be considered as potential solutions much more than they currently are. Those issues are very relevant to the wider debate on looked-after children, and we shall return to them.</p><p>The biggest sin of omission in the bill, however, is the failure to give a voice to the children who are involved in the adoption process. An impressive array of children's agencies, led by Children in Scotland, has called for the child's right to be heard, as articulated in article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to be stated on the face of the bill. As the bill stands, only children aged 12 and over will have the right to express their views and be asked for consent to any proposed adoption. Clearly, access to independent advocacy would be the appropriate mechanism to address that deficiency in the bill. I ask the minister to respond to those calls in his summing up.</p><p>So far I have concentrated on what I consider to be the most important issues arising from the committee's stage 1 consideration of the bill, but it would be remiss of me not to comment on an issue that, while less significant, has filled more column inches in our newspapers than any other. I refer to the proposed extension of the pool of adopters to include unmarried couples, including same-sex partners who are living together in an enduring family relationship. I do not agree with people who claim that there is a great point of principle at stake, that the teachings of the Christian or other faiths will be undermined, or that faith-based adoption agencies would not be able to operate as they have done until now. All that is nonsense, as anyone who has taken the trouble to read the committee's report, rather than the newspaper cuttings, will know. However, there are two principles at stake, the first of which is that the Parliament has a duty to legislate for the world as it is, rather than for how one perspective thinks it should be, no matter how influential that perspective might be.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for his intervention.

The greatest benefit, of course, will be derived by the members of the public who will take up the option of travelling to the airport by train, although non-airport rail passengers will benefit significantly from the increased reliability and frequency of train services that will follow from increasing the line capacity between Glasgow Central and Paisley.</p><p>Travelling by rail between Ayr and Glasgow is often a frustrating experience, in which overcrowded trains and a limited timetable put off many people who would prefer to travel to work by train. I have no doubt that improvement of the rail infrastructure will encourage the modal shift from road to rail that is often aspired to but is little realised, although it is ironic that the main shift in this case is likely to occur among non-airport passengers. That emphasises the point that the investment that is proposed for increasing line capacity is badly needed, whether or not the case for the airport link stacks up.</p><p>Improvement of rail services to Ayrshire will also contribute to social inclusion and regeneration objectives by improving access to jobs, education and training opportunities in areas of Ayrshire&#8212;notably the Irvine bay area&#8212;that are struggling with higher than average levels of long-term unemployment and low skill levels. The proposed new pathfinder urban regeneration company for the area will be facilitated by the investment that we are discussing today.</p><p>I was interested in the evidence that was provided by the manager of the Ayrshire joint structure plan, who pointed out that an ever-increasing number of Ayrshire residents are travelling to work in Glasgow, pushed by the lack of local jobs but also pulled by job opportunities in the city, to which Charlie Gordon and other members have alluded. All the evidence suggests that those labour market trends will continue.</p><p>In addition, the prospect of the further growth of Prestwick airport and of the rail-passenger traffic that that generates&#8212;about 20 per cent of total airport customers&#8212;also points to the need to improve the capacity of the Ayr to Glasgow line. I conclude, therefore, that the case for investment in that line is substantially proved from an Ayrshire perspective. That investment would be welcomed, but only as a first step&#8212;there will still be capacity issues to resolve south of Paisley and at Glasgow Central.</p><p>Whether the case for the rail link to Glasgow airport stands up is an altogether different question. In that regard, the evidence from the operators of Prestwick airport was particularly <place-holder colnum=\"26778\"/> interesting. Their view is that airport users' attraction to such a rail link is limited. People like point-to-point connectivity, but rail generally does not offer that, particularly in the Glasgow context, with the missing links between Glasgow Central and Queen Street stations. Bus services are much more flexible: they wait for delayed flights, whereas trains do not. They also operate early in the morning and late at night, when trains do not: Glasgow Central station closes at 12 o'clock at night.</p><p>If Sandra White will forgive me, I will remain unconvinced about the rail link to Glasgow Abottsinch and will support it only as a mechanism to get more investment into the Glasgow to Ayr rail line.

SCOD has a long history of raising awareness of issues affecting deaf and deafblind people. Right at the top of its campaign priorities is the need to establish specialist mental health services for a disadvantaged group of our citizens who are being denied access to the help and treatment that they require and which other national health service patients who are not sensorily impaired receive as a matter of course.</p><p>The Executive, which supposedly is committed to social inclusion and has designated mental health as one of its national clinical priorities, has signally failed to deliver for deaf and deafblind people. The minister will no doubt argue that the Executive is aware of the problem and that last June it issued guidance in the shape of Health Department letter 27 to all Scotland's health boards on making access to services easier for <place-holder colnum=\"26448\"/> deaf and deafblind people. However, the obligatory rider to such guidance is that it is for each NHS board to meet the health care needs of its resident population from within the funding that is available, taking account of national and local priorities. There is the rub: no new money is available to fund service development, and neither deafblindness nor mental health&#8212;which is often called the Cinderella service of the NHS&#8212;features prominently on the list of health board priorities. That is a recipe for continued inaction or, at best, ad hoc and piecemeal service development, which leads to postcode lotteries for access to and delivery of services. The situation is crying out for national leadership and initiative. I do not understand the Health Department's reluctance over many years to step in and solve the problem. It surely cannot be because of a lack of finance, given the vast increase in funding that the NHS in Scotland has enjoyed since devolution.</p><p>I will return to what precisely ministers should do, but first I will define the nature and scale of the problem. The fundamental problem that deaf and deafblind patients face at every level in the NHS is a communication barrier. Effective diagnosis and treatment are predicated on a clear understanding of the patient's symptoms and state of mind. Deaf patients continually report that there is a lack of understanding on the part of doctors, that, because of restricted access to counselling, medication is the only treatment option that is offered and that they are underreferred to specialist services.</p><p>The system failure is compounded by the fact that the NHS in Scotland provides no specialist mental health services for deaf and deafblind people. The only specialist service available is an outreach service that is delivered by the John Denmark unit from Manchester under Professor Paul Anderson, a consultant psychiatrist who is skilled in sign language. The unit also provides a hospital-based service, which can be accessed by Scottish patients if their health boards sanction the cost of treatment. In England, there are now four hospital-based services that offer a range of in-patient and out-patient services specifically for deaf people. There is a medium-secure unit at Bury and even a unit for deaf people at Rampton hospital. In those units, all staff are required to learn to communicate in sign language and to be deaf aware. Indeed, there is a drive to recruit and train deaf people to staff the units. In so doing, England is following best practice that has been adopted elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>The contrast with Scotland is stark. We have no specialist mental health officers and only two counsellors who are deaf and experienced in working with deaf and deafblind people. We also have only one registered mental health nurse who is deaf, but that nurse does not work specifically <place-holder colnum=\"26449\"/> with deaf and deafblind patients. There is one consultant psychiatrist and one community psychiatric nurse who have worked with deaf patients before, but they do not officially provide a specialist service. They are currently seeking funding for an out-patient service in Glasgow.</p><p>To be frank, the lack of provision and the absence of planning for the future are scandalous and will be thrown into sharper relief if the John Denmark unit is forced to withdraw its outreach services to Scotland under pressure from its local mental health trust, which is a real and current threat. I urge the minister to cut through the bureaucratic inertia that seems to be afflicting his department on the matter. He has a golden opportunity to make a significant difference to the lives of many in our deaf and deafblind communities, who are much more prone to mental health problems than are people in the wider community because of their sensory impairment and the isolation that it brings.</p><p>We require the creation of a small centre of excellence in Scotland to not only provide specialist services but take the lead in breaking down the barriers to access for deaf and deafblind people across the whole NHS system. The costs would not be great. The cost of the John Denmark unit's services in 2004-05 was only &#163;326,000. That is a mere drop in the ocean of funds that are going into the NHS. What is more, there is already a blueprint for implementation to hand, in the form of a paper that Dr John Loudon, the former principal medical officer for mental health in the Health Department, commissioned from Dr Ken Black, of the national services division of the NHS in Scotland, on a strategy for developing mental health services in Scotland for people who are deaf. The Scottish Executive Health Department promised to distribute that paper for consultation, but it has failed to do so, despite repeated requests. I ask the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care why that report is sitting on a shelf somewhere in his department, gathering dust. Is he going to allow the deplorable lack of service provision for our deaf and deafblind citizens to continue indefinitely?

Early intervention through the provision of high-quality child care in early years education is the key to breaking that cycle. It provides children from deprived backgrounds with the early cognitive and behavioural gains that can help to equalise their life chances and educational opportunities if they are properly supported throughout their school journeys. That will, of course, require significant investment, not least in a highly qualified workforce. It is disappointing to witness the Executive's tacit support for the cutting back of nursery teachers from family centres in Glasgow as well as the interminable delay that has been built into the national early years workforce review.</p><p>Another big challenge is the need to renew the teaching profession. As 40 per cent of the current profession are due to retire in the next 10 years, that is no small task. Despite its rhetoric, the Executive is clearly struggling to hit its targets for increasing teacher numbers. For evidence of that, we can point to the rising vacancy rates&#8212;for maths and science teachers in particular&#8212;and the minister's climb-down on class size targets.</p><p>There is no doubt that the McCrone deal has helped to create a better climate for recruitment&#8212;we will leave aside the impact on pupil attainment&#8212;but we need a culture change and an enhancement of the profession's status. As the Education Committee's inquiry into pupil motivation found last year, the teacher makes the difference in motivating pupils and engaging them in the learning process. Teachers will raise the <place-holder colnum=\"26281\"/> standards but, as Matthew MacIver of the General Teaching Council for Scotland pointed out to us, politicians have all too often undermined the profession through endless initiatives, constant analysis of every action in the classroom and overloading teachers with unnecessary administrative burdens. That disempowerment of teachers, coupled with the lack of appropriate support systems to cope with pupil indiscipline, acts as a constant drag on their recruitment and retention.</p><p>How do we tackle that? We must give teachers more freedom to teach. The problem with the mainstreaming policy, for example, is not its principle but the fact that its implementation has been underresourced, as Rosemary Byrne eloquently expressed during her speech. Graham Donaldson's report \"Improving Scottish Education\" got to the heart of the matter with its call for space for imaginative teaching that can capitalise on approaches that make learning relevant, lively and motivating and for the system to be much more rigorous and explicit about the development and certification of essential skills such as literacy and numeracy for all pupils.</p><p>Getting rid of the current assessment overload is an absolute priority. In the current system, teachers are training pupils to pass exams rather than teaching thinking skills and opening minds. The result is the creation of a growing proportion of false positives from the system. People can be qualified, but illiterate, much to the consternation of universities and employers.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13363432", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is clear from the debate and from other education debates in the past that the Scottish Conservatives will not reconcile themselves to the comprehensive system of schooling that we have in this country.

The Kerr report highlights the need to meet patient expectations and build public trust, but the public is losing confidence in the NHS because of creeping centralisation and specialisation.

NHS Ayrshire and Arran's approach offered a model of how not to conduct a consultation exercise, although the board claimed to have followed to the letter the Executive's guidelines on public consultation. If that was so, the guidelines are deeply defective and utterly fail to ensure public engagement with the change process. Even if one accepts the need to centralise specialised A and E services, what justification can there be for not presenting an option for centralisation of such services at Ayr hospital, which was deemed feasible in the options appraisal exercise? Given Ayrshire's geography, that option would minimise inconvenience to the public. I urge the minister to consider the mess that NHS Ayrshire and Arran has made of the public consultation. The matter must be revisited if we are to restore a semblance of public confidence that the future of the NHS is in safe hands.</p><p>The minister should focus on how to deliver community-based services before he approves radical surgery to specialised A and E units.

His description of the situation in north-east Scotland applies equally well to the south-west, which I represent.</p><p>It is interesting that the Department for Work and Pensions feels the need to take a second bite at the cherry that is the post office network's share of the benefits-transaction business. It appears that Post Office card accounts are taking a much bigger share of the business than was anticipated by the DWP when it conceded card accounts to sweeten the pill of automated credit transfer of benefit payments to bank accounts some three or four years ago. I understand that the DWP had anticipated 1 million card accounts, but there are now 4.5 million such accounts. The DWP underestimated the determination of sub-postmasters to stay in business and to serve their communities.</p><p>Those figures are also a measure of the Government's failure to engage the major banks, which in Scotland means the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland, as Christine Grahame said, in the setting up of basic bank accounts for people on low and fixed incomes, who work with a cash budget from week to week, as Stewart Stevenson described. The great attraction of the card account for pensioners is that it incurs no charges. Therefore the risk of going overdrawn and receiving a letter from the bank that tells them that they have incurred a &#163;25 penalty can be avoided. Until such matters are resolved and the post office network can be guaranteed an income from the provision of services to bank customers, the income from benefits transactions via card accounts will remain vital to the viability of that network, especially in rural areas.</p><p>The importance of the network to rural life cannot be overemphasised, as many members have said. Not only is the post office often the only provider of financial services in a rural area, but it is often the only shop for miles. For many pensioners in particular, such post offices offer a lifeline&#8212;in a very real sense&#8212;to other services and to the outside world.</p><p>I am sure that ministers are well aware of the vulnerability of the rural post office network in Scotland and I hope that they will actively represent to their counterparts in London the concerns that have been expressed during the debate. There is a feeling that the DWP has been duplicitous in withdrawing a hard-won concession on Post Office card accounts and, as Christine Grahame said, there is trepidation about the future of the subsidy to the rural network, which is due to end in 2008.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13359469", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post Office Card Accounts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to Richard Lochhead on securing the debate.

What matters is how that insight will be translated into classroom practice to support successful learning, and to promote confidence, participation and responsibility. Margo MacDonald<strong> </strong>made some good points about teacher training, but why do we have to wait another 15 months&#8212;at the earliest&#8212;for the publication of detailed guidance?</p><p>That said, we broadly support the aims of the curriculum for excellence and we welcome proposals to unify the curriculum and to introduce a simplified progression framework that will free teachers to teach creatively to a depth and breadth that will engage all their pupils. The reduction of assessment overload is surely an absolute priority.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell and other members highlighted the adverse effect on primary school children of teaching to the test, but that approach is even more prevalent in secondary schools, particularly when attainment of qualifications becomes all-important. That is so true that most teachers now take the view that their main purpose is to train pupils in how to pass their exams rather than to educate children or to teach thinking skills and open their minds, thereby preparing them for the world of work and for lifelong learning.</p><p>The minister will be familiar with a report from teachers in the north-east of Scotland called \"Listen to the Teachers\", which was sent to him and to members of the Education Committee this month. It makes the point that we have, in effect, a mandatory national curriculum that is dictated by the SQA. The SQA sets the exams and thereby determines what is taught in our schools, which effectively stifles creativity. The pernicious nature of that state of affairs is highlighted by a history teacher who describes his experience of higher history courses. He said that ten years ago most teachers would have taught the whole course of ten topics, but that now most only teach four topics and those are gone over, and gone over again, giving pupils practise in every combination of essay that might come up in the exam. The result is that the experience of history is arid and technocratic.</p><p>Incidentally, another by-product of the situation is that teachers have abandoned the Scottish history element of the course&#8212;only 4 per cent do the Scottish question on the higher exam&#8212;because it is time-consuming and unnecessary. Given that reality, it is not nearly good enough for the minister to dismiss curriculum proposals by Professor Tom Devine and others by claiming that such ideas are not compatible with maintaining a non-statutory national curriculum in Scotland.</p><p>The progress report talks a good game. Its expressed goal is to give teachers more freedom to teach in innovative and creative ways. That <place-holder colnum=\"24650\"/> chimes well with Graham Donaldson's calls for space for imaginative teaching that can capitalise on approaches that make learning relevant, lively and motivating, and for the system to be much more rigorous and explicit about the development and certification of essential skills such as literacy and numeracy for all pupils.</p><p>None of that is new thinking; the Howie committee made the same points back in 1992. Why has the review group borrowed our own watch to tell us the time&#8212;and taken 15 months to do so? Why will it take at least another 15 months for any detailed guidance that initiates reform to emerge?

In so doing, it fulfils article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p><p>It is to our shame that we are far from meeting that obligation. One of the main reasons for that has been our failure to listen to what our children have been telling us. Kathleen Marshall, Scotland's commissioner for children and young people, last month sent us all the results of a consultation that she had conducted with 16,000 young people. Top of their list of priorities for action was a plea for more things to do and for activities that are affordable and accessible to all, including those with disabilities, and which are designed by young people themselves in co-operation with trusted adults. Young people said that they wanted to be recognised as an integral part of their communities and to have access to community facilities. Surely that is not too much to ask. Save the Children, in one of the many excellent briefings that we received for this debate, points to successful projects of that kind, which have met expressed needs.</p><p>Other issues need to be addressed as well. Ken Macintosh said that opportunities for unstructured play had been reducing because of a combination of factors. Parental fears about child safety have been growing and the availability of local open space has been shrinking.</p><p>When no less an authority than Walter Smith, our national football team's manager, visited the Parliament last year, he bemoaned the loss of traditional means of developing football skills and talent, such as kickabouts in the streets and parks.</p><p>Children living in poverty are particularly disadvantaged by the shrinking of free, locally <place-holder colnum=\"24017\"/> available play spaces. The negative impact on children's development cannot be overstated.

However, the bill contains precious little on the first two of those aspects. It seems to be all about the replacement of school boards and no more than that. By participation, we mean building a partnership between parents and teachers and ensuring that the support for learning that is provided for our children is the best that it can be to let them reach their full potential.</p><p>As the Headteachers Association of Scotland pointed out in its evidence to the Education Committee, the changes that are proposed in the bill will in themselves do little or nothing to bring about the desired participation of the section of the parent body who have been disengaged or disaffected or have felt disfranchised under the current scheme.</p><p>Children in Scotland suggests in its excellent briefing for the debate that the form of parental involvement that we seek requires a culture change and that parents are more likely to remain involved in a child's school life if they are encouraged to do so at an early stage in their child's education.</p><p>On an Education Committee visit to Sweden last October, my colleague Frank McAveety and I were extremely impressed by how close the relationship was between parents and early years staff, both in monitoring the child's progress and meeting their development needs. Often it is easier for parents to become involved in their child's education during the early years, so it is mystifying that early years provision&#8212;along with a number of other matters&#8212;does not get so much as a mention in the bill. If Jamie Stone were still here, I would say to him that education authorities, too, get very little mention.</p><p>I have spoken about the bill to several head teachers, none of whom suggested that it would make any difference to the management of their school. In so far as the head teacher and staff of a school already have a responsibility to ascertain parental views and perceptions on a range of matters as part of their professional obligation to engage in self-evaluation and the preparation of <place-holder colnum=\"23393\"/> improvement plans, it might be argued that the bill includes unnecessary duplication of effort and bureaucracy.

We would be hard pushed today to so describe our society, in which the incidences of poverty, dysfunctional relationships and chaotic lifestyles have seemingly grown out of control.</p><p>The fact that the Executive has chosen its flagship policy to be control of antisocial behaviour is surely symptomatic of the type of society in which we now live, although&#8212;if I may say so&#8212;it also smacks of treating the symptoms rather than the fundamental causes of the problems. In any case, it is profoundly misguided to blame social work professionals for failing to cope with those trends.</p><p>Last night, many of us met the chairpeople of our local children's panels, who are lobbying us in advance of the forthcoming report on the children's hearings system. Their frustration is palpable and is due to both the lack of public awareness of the good work that they do and the inadequacy of the resources that are deployed to meet the needs of the children who are referred to them. It is staggering that, last year, more than 50,000 of our children were referred to a children's reporter. Compared with the previous year, there was a 12 per cent increase in the number of referrals on care and protection grounds alone. Those are truly shocking figures. We must respond much more effectively to the needs of those children and, as the minister said, our response must be integrated throughout all public services, including health services, social work, education and the police. Much lip service is paid to joint working, but progress is painfully slow.</p><p>The \"Changing Lives\" report talks about the transformation of social work from crisis management to prevention and early intervention. <place-holder colnum=\"23283\"/></p><p>That is a laudable aim, but the report comes up short on answering the question of how it can be achieved. No doubt we will have to wait for the promised implementation plan before we can make hard and fast judgments. That said, the SNP takes the view that the development of universal early years services is vital. The Executive made a reasonable start with free nursery places for three and four-year-olds, but we are disappointed that the momentum subsequently stalled.</p><p>In the remainder of my speech, I will focus on some of the more detailed issues that are highlighted in the report. Chief among them is resources. Professor Arthur Midwinter has identified serious underfunding of local authority social work services; he estimates that there is a shortfall of &#163;135 million for children and families services alone. It is little wonder that such chronic underfunding has resulted in chronic staff shortages. So many vacancies remain unfilled that some departments are operating with 40 per cent of their posts vacant, which compromises their ability to provide basic services. There are also insufficient numbers of foster carers, residential care beds and day care facilities.</p><p>The Executive is keen to take up the report's recommendation that a new performance improvement framework should be introduced. That has echoes of the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000, which introduced to school education the notion of continuous improvement. As yet, however, there is no hint of an accompanying McCrone-type deal for social work professionals that would cover pay, conditions and continuous professional development. Such a deal would help to underpin the change agenda.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish National Party welcomes the debate, which comes hard on the heels of the report, \"Changing Lives: Report of the 21 st Century Social Work Review\".

Given Scotland's geographical location on Europe's periphery, it is absolutely necessary that we have first-class two-way transport and communication links overseas if we are to survive and prosper in an increasingly globalised world economy. For far too long, our businesspeople, tourism industry and travellers have been handicapped by the all-flights-lead-to-London syndrome. Stopping the growth of direct air routes from Scotland would have the effect of increasing flights to the London hub. Given the economic and environmental impacts of doing so, that would be akin to cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.</p><p>That said, the Executive is in danger of exaggerating the benefits of the air route development fund, given the lack of evidence, for example, of the fund's additionality. Should we perhaps praise rather the airlines and airport companies that have invested in direct routes from Scotland for taking the risk and making their venture successful? I would like to know just how critical the ARDF subsidy was for each of those decisions and the extent to which taxpayers are receiving value for money. The SNP supports the broad thrust of the policy, but we suggest that the fund could be more effective with better targeting.</p><p>To consider how the fund might be developed, let us take as an example Prestwick airport, which has been the major success story in Scottish aviation over the past five to 10 years. Last week, Prestwick airport announced that yet another low-cost airline carrier&#8212;Wizz Air, which is based in Budapest&#8212;would launch its first ever Scottish routes to Warsaw and Gda&#324;sk. Those routes will be in addition to eight other routes that Ryanair operates between Prestwick and locations across <place-holder colnum=\"22522\"/> western Europe, from Stockholm to Rome. All those routes are supported by the ARDF and all are successful, whereas the success rate for all other ARDF-supported routes from other Scottish airports is, by contrast, apparently only 50 per cent.</p><p>What attracted Ryanair to Prestwick and what sets Prestwick apart from other airports? The answer is surely that Prestwick offers a combination of tight, efficient management, low landing charges and high-quality airport infrastructure. It is notable that Prestwick is Scotland's only rail-connected airport, with some 30 per cent of passengers arriving at the airport by air train. Passengers who travel on the new Wizz Air routes in the first six months of their operation will be entitled to free rail travel to and from anywhere in Scotland; thereafter, they will be entitled to half-price rail travel. Surely the message for the Executive is that, if we want to underpin future growth, we need significant investment in rail links to our airports.</p><p>Although the airport's management might not thank me for saying so, Prestwick could probably attract airlines and open new routes successfully regardless of any subsidy, but the same could not be said for its air freight business. That is despite the fact that Prestwick carries more freight than all the other Scottish airports put together. That part of the business has grown by 400 per cent over the past 10 years but, as the minister will know, growth has slowed in the past couple of years due to the downturn in electronics.</p><p>An enormous amount of freight that could be flown direct from Scotland is instead trucked down south to fly out from London and the east midlands. We could and should provide more help for Scottish exporters by extending the ARDF to freight. That would help airlines to offset risk and high start-up costs. Tipping the balance in favour of Scottish routes must surely be a strategic objective. For example, Scotland currently has no dedicated air freight routes to the middle east and China. That is a big gap that must be addressed.</p><p>The SNP amendment addresses those issues, so I hope that it will attract support from members in all sections of the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13353937", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Air Route Development Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I can sympathise with the Greens' contention that, in the UK or European context, unrestricted expansion of commercial aviation involves significant environmental costs, I cannot agree with their opposition to further development of direct air routes from Scotland to the rest of the world.

As other members have said, access and confidentiality issues are not limited to an individual child's case file, which is sampled for <place-holder colnum=\"21479\"/> inspection purposes. What about information from the health records of relevant third parties such as parents or other adult relatives? What about police involvement in inspection teams and the extent to which confidential information might be passed to them about activities that are not relevant to the child inspection process? As Fiona Hyslop, Iain Smith and others have said, access and confidentiality issues are of concern, so I welcome the minister's assurance that he will give them further thought. I have already mentioned the primary concern that the BMA in particular expressed, which is that the confidential relationship between doctor and patient might be undermined if access is allowed without consent. To address such points, the minister has undertaken today to consider lodging an amendment to the bill that would place a duty of confidentiality on inspectors. I welcome that.</p><p>The Education Committee has also asked the minister to consider applying a code of confidentiality similar to that which was negotiated with general practitioners for the purposes of auditing. Patients are made aware that health records can be used for inspection purposes and, unless they specifically say otherwise, their consent is implied. I assume that the draft protocol on which the minister intends to consult will introduce the idea of consent. However, I cannot see how that could be applied retrospectively, because inspectors will be calling as soon as the bill is enacted. Perhaps the minister will reflect on whether transitional arrangements are needed.</p><p>I reiterate our desire that the joint inspection process should make quick progress, not just for inspections of specific child protection services, but for wider inspections of children's services.

Until now, however, our schools, far from addressing that problem, have been reinforcing it with their cursory treatment of the experience of being Scottish. Let us take the teaching of history, for example. The national story should be the academic spine that supports the consideration of European and world developments, yet many pupils can go through their school lives without being exposed to that story at all. I suggest that most of us here have learned more about Scottish history from books that we have read since school than we ever did at school. Even now, the guidelines for five to 14-year-olds stipulate that the teaching of one topic per year with a specific Scottish focus will satisfy the need to examine the Scottish context.</p><p>That disregard for the Scottish experience in history teaching is bad enough. Thanks to the St Andrew's day petition from our writers and poets, we are reminded that such disregard goes right across the curriculum. It is particularly pronounced in English language teaching. Why is it that no Scottish book is compulsory at any level until advanced higher? What kind of message does that send to our children? Does it tell them that Scottish achievements in literature are so inconsequential that they are not fit to be taught in our schools?</p><p>We believe that Scottish history and culture should be mandatory elements in the school curriculum up to the age of 16. No other European country would allow its children to be left in ignorance of their country as we do, and have done for many generations, much to our disadvantage. We are dismayed that the minister appears to have set his face against directing the curriculum review that way, and that he has instead been seduced by arguments for more pupil choice in schools. He seems to have missed the point about the damage done to subjects such as history because of that approach, and he has failed to recognise that the sort of direction that we are suggesting would offer a means to improve access to the curriculum for all and to equalise opportunities.</p><p>The minister might be content with the progress that he is making in modernising Scotland's schools, but we in the SNP beg to differ. The current curriculum review will be the key driver for change, but it is not radical enough, and it will not tackle the scandal that Scottish history, heritage and culture remain closed books in our schools.

I do not agree with all her conclusions, but she made a reasonable point when she suggested that most children with special educational needs require skilled specialist teachers. Dyslexic children, for example, can make remarkable progress with a few hours of specialist teaching. Depending on classroom assistants alone to keep children up to pace with the work of a mainstream class is not good enough.</p><p>In an amendment that was not selected for debate, Rosemary Byrne highlighted the need to cut class sizes and to employ additional trained and qualified staff to meet additional support needs.

Modernising the children's hearings system and adoption law and improving school-college links are all welcome&#8212;and, some might say, long overdue&#8212;initiatives. Even the bill on parental involvement, about which we have had some concerns, appears to be shaping up better than <place-holder colnum=\"18896\"/> we might have expected as a consequence of the consultation process. That said, we will wait with interest to see the detail before we give a considered response.</p><p>One concern that we would like to be addressed is that parental involvement is best expressed through providing home support for learning. In its pupil motivation inquiry, the Education Committee found that, all too often, parents whose own experience of schooling has not been positive do not provide the kind of support that is required to ensure that their children realise their potential at school.</p><p>My question for the Executive is not whether its legislative proposals are necessary but whether they are sufficient to tackle the underlying problems of poverty and social deprivation that are blighting the life chances of many of our youngsters. There is a particularly strong moral obligation on ministers and all of us in the Parliament to do better by the most vulnerable group of children&#8212;those who are looked after by local authorities. Robin Harper highlighted that group. We are talking about nearly 12,000 children nationwide who are being supervised because of their offending behaviour or their need for care and protection.</p><p>The children's hearings system does well to deal with child offenders and child victims of abuse in the same system&#8212;not least because they are often the same children. However, there is no doubt that children's reporters need more powers to ensure that the intensive services that are needed to help those children to stop offending behaviour are delivered.</p><p>Reforming the children's hearings system alone will not do; the whole children and families support system needs an overhaul. Too many children come to children's hearings not because their problems are serious&#8212;although of course they are&#8212;but because the right support has not been offered at the right time.</p><p>It is therefore disappointing to say the least that the programme for government makes no mention of developing the provision for early years education and child care, especially as the review of the early years workforce continues and is due to report well within the next 18 months. In our vision for a prosperous, socially just and independent Scotland, the development of a universal affordable system for child care and education is an absolute priority. We would seek to move along that road as far as we could, even with only the Parliament's limited powers.</p><p>It should be seen as a mark of shame on the Government&#8212;and perhaps even the Parliament&#8212;that children who are taken into the care of the state are so poorly equipped for the world in which <place-holder colnum=\"18897\"/> we live. Of those who leave care, 60 per cent have no educational qualifications and 60 per cent are not in education, employment or training. One in six such young people experiences a period of homelessness in the year after leaving care. Such figures make a mockery of the First Minister's boast that we are the best wee country in the world.</p><p>In a speech to Barnardo's earlier this year, Mr McConnell said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am determined to press council leaders and others to make sure the education of looked after children is taken as seriously as most parents take the education of their own children.\"</p><p>I say to the First Minister and the ministers who are present: let us see that rhetoric converted into action in the programme for government.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13344754", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As my colleague Fiona Hyslop intimated in her opening speech for the SNP, we take issue with little in the Executive programme that concerns children, young people and education.

Although the past 100 years have brought hugely welcome changes in attitudes to child poverty and homelessness, those social evils are still with us, if not in the extreme form of Victorian times. Thankfully, the orphanages that were synonymous with the Barnardo's name, which were life-saving but hardly life-enhancing institutions, are also consigned to the past.</p><p>Given the social and economic advances of the past 100 years, one might have hoped that the services of charities such as Barnardo's would no longer be necessary. Sadly, that is not the case. Barnardo's still plays a highly relevant and responsible role in our communities, dealing with deprivation and homelessness through the medium of family support services. I pay tribute to the work of Barnardo's in that regard, especially in the South Ayrshire Council area. There, Barnardo's works in close partnership with the education, health and housing services, among others. For the past 12 years or more, it has played a key role in co-ordinating services for homeless families with children or families that are becoming homeless. In 2003-04, Barnardo's helped 117 families with 212 children to resettle and reconnect with the community when all the normal linkages that we take for granted had been badly disrupted. For example, if someone is living in temporary accommodation in January, where do they go to register a child for school in August?</p><p>The Barnardo's service has also been instrumental in reducing placements into unsuitable accommodation that is unsustainable in terms of affordability or size. Recent improvements include a dramatic increase in the number of families that maintain their tenancies after resettlement. In South Ayrshire, 90 per cent of tenancies are now maintained after a year, compared with a rate just a few years ago of a little over half. Given the shortage of affordable and appropriate local accommodation and recent changes to the housing benefit rules, which have hindered the smooth transition from temporary to permanent accommodation, those are remarkable figures and a testament to the effectiveness of the interagency working that is being achieved in that area.</p><p>I am aware of a Barnardo's children's rights and advocacy service in the north Ayr social inclusion partnership area that aims to raise awareness and develop confidence among children in what services are and should be available locally, and to recruit young advocates, who play an important role in dealing with mental health issues among <place-holder colnum=\"17990\"/> young people and with the forthcoming implementation of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.</p><p>In short, Barnardo's provides an invaluable service to the people of South Ayrshire and I thank it for that.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13342574", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Barnardo's"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Robert Brown on securing this evening's debate, which marks 100 years since the death of Dr Thomas Barnardo.

One is from the Laighdykes residents group in Ardrossan and Saltcoats and the other is from the save the old racecourse group in Ayr. I can update Mike Watson's information on the latter case. Although outline planning permission was refused by South Ayrshire Council's planning committee, the administration is to come forward with a detailed planning application.</p><p>In both the Ayrshire cases, the councils seem determined to ride roughshod over their own development plans and national planning policy guidelines by building new schools on well-used and established playing fields using PPP funding. It is clear that the strictures of national planning policy guideline 11 and planning advice note 65 are not having the desired effect. Paragraph 29 of NPPG 11 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Robust planning policies are required to safeguard established open spaces, playing fields and access routes where they contribute to local community needs and enjoyment.\"</p><p>Crucially, it also states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Councils should lead by example and generally resist development of open space and playing fields in their ownership.\"</p><p>In the Ayrshire cases, there is also a clear conflict of interests, with the councils' being landowners, the education authorities or de facto planning applicants, and the planning authorities. Such cases pose an obvious danger to the integrity of the local planning system. Unfortunately, since the advent of PPP, they are becoming much more commonplace, as many members have said.</p><p>In that context, I refer members to a letter from sportscotland's acting chief executive. In response to the Public Petitions Committee's request for information on the Ayr old racecourse petition, he said:<place-holder colnum=\"17458\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"sportscotland is concerned about the amount of development pressure that current PPP proposals are placing on school playing fields.\"</p><p>He highlights the affordability gap in PPP projects, the lack of finance to acquire new sites for schools and the fact that few development plans have allocated new sites for schools.</p><p>Sportscotland observes that local authorities look to their own estates for suitable sites and that playing fields are often the preferred option because of their size and physical suitability for development. Sportscotland's statutory consultee status allows it to scrutinise all such proposals, but</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the dual influence of ... this 'affordability gap' and the determination of local authorities to take the opportunity that PPP presents means that they are in most cases determined to press ahead with their proposals.\"</p><p>In those circumstances, sportscotland feels constrained not to object but instead to seek concessions and reach compromises. The result is more lost playing fields. Given those unintended consequences of PPP funding, it is incumbent on the Executive to ensure that the development pressure on playing fields is relieved.

I agree with Elaine Murray that much more needs to be done <place-holder colnum=\"17192\"/> to publicise the congress and the events that will happen this year. Jamie Stone mentioned an event in Sutherland. I am sure that events will take place in Ayrshire, but I have not heard about them yet, so I hope that the Executive will spread the knowledge among us.</p><p>The headline goal of the congress is to show Governments what progress young people throughout the world have made to meet the millennium development goals. Those goals are probably unique, in that all 191 United Nations member states have pledged to meet them. The goals include eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and achieving universal primary education. Many other members have mentioned goals such as tackling HIV and promoting gender equality. Those are the key issues that face us.</p><p>The young people also want to illustrate their plans to secure substantial support for their activities. Scotland is willing to listen to young people. The event's timing and location are ideal, because many of the UN goals are echoed in the G8 agenda. I guess that young people will be slightly more radical than some of the G8 leaders. If the world youth congress receives the coverage that it deserves, it will help to sustain our attention on those crucial matters.</p><p>The event acknowledges that Scotland values young people's opinions. By brainstorming, networking and volunteering, the delegates will go some way towards creating solutions to the problems that will affect their generations probably even more acutely than they have affected ours. Its global reach will enable the congress to take a global perspective on sustainable development. What members such as Robin Harper have said is relevant.</p><p>The congress will focus on making it easier for young people to become involved in volunteering, by showing them practical ways to establish new local projects. Therefore, it is fitting that the congress will take place while we celebrate 2005 as the year of volunteering.

Education is probably the most important tool for combating the problems that plague the underdeveloped areas of the world.

I am also happy to acknowledge other parties' commitment in this area.</p><p>We therefore welcome the publication of the Executive's strategy and plans. The minister will no doubt be gratified with the largely supportive consensus that has emerged this morning, but it is a pity that members have been allowed little time to digest the details of the Executive's proposals. As a result, the debate has been rather more broad brush than it could and should have been. Fortunately, as Robert Brown has indicated, the Education Committee's current inquiry into pupil motivation covers school-college partnerships and we will seek to drill down into the detail before we come back to the chamber with our report.</p><p>Given the evidence that we have already taken, I am sure that our report will feature a rejection of the notion that offering vocational training or more specialist provision to 14 to 16-year-old pupils will act as a panacea and sort out the problem of young people who are disaffected by or disengaged from school education. I am glad that the minister has confirmed that that will not be the case.</p><p>Pupils with deep-seated problems that are reflected in poor attendance or behaviour records at school are unlikely to alter their attitude just because they are given access to a college course. A different learning environment will not change their personal circumstances. Surely we require early intervention to nip those problems in the bud, but policy development in that area is still rather too thin. In that regard, ministers could even consider the approach that Brian Monteith outlined&#8212;he is a bit like a volcano: he spouts rubbish most of the time, but occasionally he comes up with a good nugget.</p><p>On the other hand, academically bright pupils who want to exercise a positive choice to access a college course should not be systematically <place-holder colnum=\"16806\"/> denied that opportunity or dissuaded from taking that route because such a choice does not fit with teachers' expectations for that pupil. That happens too often. As Donald Gorrie pointed out, if we want to facilitate enterprise and to help our young people to realise their potential, we must move away from a slavish attachment to the old stereotypes. If this initiative is to be successful, it is critical that we identify the pupils who would benefit most from such opportunities and ensure that they are given access to them.

However, such situations happen, and we need to get rid of them.</p><p>Another critical issue is the accreditation of course outcomes and the question whether such qualifications will be well respected in the labour market. Existing schemes, such as those that the Education Committee visited in Glasgow yesterday, appear to be aimed at training that is suitable for people seeking future employment in local authorities, in construction or caring jobs, for example. How does the Executive envisage the development of links with employers in the private sector? Should not the proposed standing stakeholder forum&#8212;or whatever it is called&#8212;include business organisations from the outset?

There is a need for pupil accreditation that has full currency in the marketplace, and I would like to hear the minister's thoughts on that. There is also a need to ensure that college lecturers have teaching qualifications that are appropriate to the tasks required of them, preferably with GTC registration.

Research conducted by the Hannah is deemed not suitable for SEERAD's remit, although it was SEERAD that pushed the Hannah in the direction of biomedical research, as Phil Gallie explained.

Why has SEERAD passed the buck to the institute on employment matters, despite the fact that public sector research funders have a responsibility for maintaining the infrastructure and sustainability of institutes when they are the main funders? SEERAD provides more than 70 per cent of the Hannah's funding. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that SEERAD has been determined to get rid of the Hannah for a considerable time and has been conducting a campaign of attrition to that end.

Futureskills Scotland has published an interesting comparison between Scottish and English employers in the light of their respective 2004 skills surveys, which shows that although both countries have skills shortages and gaps the situation is marginally worse in Scotland. There is little evidence that Scottish solutions have been found for Scottish problems, and yet more evidence of a lack of competitive edge to the Scottish economy when compared with our nearest neighbours.</p><p>As Murdo Fraser pointed out, 25 per cent of all vacancies in Scotland are hard to fill because of skills shortages. In addition, almost 10 per cent of all employees are judged by their employers to lack proficiency in their work, with more than one in five workplaces being affected by such skills gaps. I take issue with Des McNulty's claim that those weaknesses are not significant.</p><p>It has been mentioned that the most common skills that are lacking are soft skills such as oral communication, customer handling and problem solving, and skills gaps are most common in jobs that require lower levels of skills and qualifications. That places a question mark over basic education levels and standards.</p><p>I am concerned most of all by the fact that all the figures that I have quoted indicate a worsening rather than improving trend. The same goes for the number of employers who are not offering some kind of training to employees. In 2004, 36 per cent of employers did not offer any training, compared with 32 per cent in 2003. Last May, the then Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning acknowledged that, according to a <place-holder colnum=\"16090\"/> Confederation of British Industry survey, Scottish businesses invested less in training than did those in any other part of the UK. The minister promised progress, but we are getting the opposite; I invite him either to admit to Parliament the failure of the Executive's skills improvement policies and the need for a new approach or to explain how more of the same will produce the goods in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Any approach to improving our skills base clearly needs to engage with business to bring about a culture change among what appears to be a growing proportion of the business community that regards deskilling with equanimity. The effort that is required to raise skill levels could be seriously devalued if, at the end of the day, jobs are not available that are relevant to those skills.</p><p>I see little or nothing coming from the unionist parties to address such issues. Of course, they are content to operate with one hand tied behind their backs in managing the Scottish economy, much to its continuing detriment. That said, the Executive could and should do much more to stimulate upskilling in the public services and a consequent uprating of pay, thereby setting an appropriate example.</p><p>The caring services in particular have been mentioned. They deserve much more investment in human capital across the board, from home care and residential care of the elderly to foster care and nursing care of children. Such an effort would also represent a direct method of attacking low pay, particularly for women.</p><p>As a former member of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee in the previous session, I express my disappointment at the Executive's failure to pick up and run with the main recommendation of the committee's inquiry into lifelong learning, which was to create a unified system that would empower the individual, from whatever background, to access training and educational opportunities in pursuit of personal development. Why can those learners who enter higher education count on support for their learning as an entitlement while other post-school learners cannot? The committee recommended that everyone should be entitled to the equivalent of six years of study, which could be used at any level and at any time in their life. That would be a simple mechanism to make lifelong learning an accessible and practical choice for people. Why have ministers rejected that Scottish solution to a Scottish problem?

However, they are being let down by the Executive, as was evident in the EIS perspective that Sylvia Jackson gave. Having visited a number of primary and secondary schools in the past few <place-holder colnum=\"15489\"/> months, I urge action in three key areas: early intervention, class sizes and in-school back-up for teachers.</p><p>Although the SNP supports the principles of mainstreaming, there is no doubt that the demands on teachers from pupils who have social, emotional and behavioural difficulties are extremely stressful. Most of those problems are evident pre-school and could and should be addressed at that stage. We need a comprehensive early years, child care and education system. The nurture group initiative in Glasgow has proved that children's behaviour can be turned round permanently. Many primary teachers have also told me that they are able to cope with the demands of children who have additional support needs only because class sizes are falling as our population declines. Others, particularly secondary teachers, claim that they lack back-up from senior staff, and there is a great need for behavioural support units to which disruptive pupils can be sent. It is time the rhetoric on zero tolerance was replaced with systematic action.</p><p>There are a number of other points that I would like to make, but I shall finish on parental involvement. We are certainly sympathetic to the Executive's proposed reforms. Anything that can be done to encourage parents to support their children's learning at school should be considered, and we look forward to the debate on the proposed bill. Unlike the Tories, we do not regard school boards as having added significant value to our schools; we believe that there are more gains to be made from involving more parents informally within schools.</p><p>As I said at the outset, we reject the Tory desire to impose a market model on Scottish education.

We are looking for incremental change now, but we need to support initiatives such as nurture groups that seek to help children who have missed out on the early experiences and relationships that provide healthy development. A growing number of very young children are being brought up in socially and emotionally deprived households by drug-misusing parents, for example. Those children have not learned to make trusting relationships with adults or to relate appropriately to other children and they cannot settle in school. The nurture-group approach has been successful where it has been adopted, most notably in Glasgow. It addresses the needs of children who have social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, it stimulates cognitive gains and it returns them to their base classes ready, willing and able to participate fully, like their peers. The nurture-group approach shows the clear benefits that are to be gained from high-quality provision, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>As the director of the Social Market Foundation pointed out in his January newsletter, the single biggest determinant of quality provision is a highly qualified workforce. That cannot be bought on the cheap and certainly not by people who are in receipt of child care tax credits. To bring quality provision to areas where the cognitive gains to children will be greatest will require significant reductions in parental contributions to costs and increased provider subsidies. If we are to bring children under three into the system, provision will be even more expensive, given the need for much lower staff-to-child ratios.</p><p>We recognise that maximising access to high-quality subsidised early education and child care is an expensive policy to pursue. Spending will have to rise from the &#163;320 million that we currently spend to about &#163;1 billion a year. However, the educational, social and economic benefits that would accrue from such a policy would far outweigh the financial costs. The policies would include: attacking child poverty and educational inequalities at their roots; lifting the financial burden of child care from parents; allowing women in particular to increase families' income by participating more fully in the labour force; and not least, reducing the burdens that are imposed by dysfunctional behaviour on our education, health and criminal justice systems.</p><p>That is a truly ambitious policy.

The time is right to revisit the matter, given the publication of the University of Dundee research that compares the impact of targeted versus universal provision of free school meals; the filtering through of some of the results from the Executive's hungry for success programme; and Jamie Oliver's fascinating television series on his quest to banish junk food from school dinners.</p><p>I will start with an appraisal of hungry for success. Margaret Jamieson, rightly, focused on successes in her constituency, as did Maureen Macmillan and Eleanor Scott in relation to the Highlands.</p><p>East Ayrshire Council is to be congratulated on the commitment and enthusiasm that it has shown in getting rid of processed foods in its primary schools and in replacing commercial vending of fizzy drinks with healthy vending in secondary schools. The organic and local sourcing pilot in Hurlford looks really exciting. However, East Ayrshire Council is the only Scottish council to have achieved commended status for all primary and secondary schools in the Scottish healthy choices award scheme. How much more could be achieved if the East Ayrshire example were to be backed up by statute or by regulation and if coverage were extended to all children who might depend on their school dinner to provide their one nutritious meal of the day?</p><p>In East Ayrshire, hungry for success has proved&#8212;in primary schools at least&#8212;that the take-up of school meals can be improved by increasing nutritional standards. Catch kids early enough and they can be weaned off junk food. As we know, all the research evidence shows that a balanced diet is essential if kids are to be fit for schools in respect of their ability to concentrate, to behave appropriately&#8212;as Chris Ballance said&#8212;and, above all, to learn. However, making school dinners nutritious is not enough: we must extend the entitlement to free school meals. As the Child Poverty Action Group points out, 100,000 children who live in poverty are not getting the benefit of a free school meal. Twenty seven per cent of <place-holder colnum=\"14964\"/> children live in poverty, but only 19 per cent are entitled to free school meals.</p><p>Not only does the current system of means testing fail to deliver to the poorest, but it creates a poverty trap. Of course, those arguments have been well rehearsed in the chamber and have always foundered on the issue of cost. The SNP offers a third way in the form of a pilot initiative for free school meals in the early primary years&#8212;an early intervention. For the Executive parties, which boast of the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and the abolition of up-front tuition fees as their main achievements, surely a free school meals initiative is not a step too far.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334910", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: School Meals"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The SNP broadly agrees with the motion.

The bill is one of those pieces of legislation in relation to which all of us who participated in the evidence sessions felt the hand of history on our shoulders and a sense that time was running out to turn round a process that has the Gaelic language teetering on the edge of extinction.</p><p>History tells us, as other speakers have pointed out, that the origins of Scotland as a nation were Celtic in nature and culture. Gaelic was the language of court and country. The evidence of that time is still with us today in the names of places, mountains and rivers wherever we go in Scotland, as Elaine Murray pointed out. However, we know that Gaelic gradually drew back from lowland Scotland during the middle ages, creating the distinction between Highlands and lowlands, and from then till now has faced varying degrees of hostility from the powers that be. In the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, from a lowland perspective, Gaelic was reckoned to be one of the roots of what were regarded as Highland superstition and barbarity, from which political disloyalty was generated, and it had to be crushed.</p><p>Of course, in more modern times, other economic and social forces have come into play, driving down the number of Gaelic speakers to devastating effect, with fewer than 2 per cent of Scots having some knowledge of the language. The total dominance of English in popular culture is clearly threatening to overwhelm Gaelic. On the Education Committee's visit to Skye last year, I was struck by the scale of the task in hand when we were informed by the youngsters in the Gaelic-medium schools that we visited that English, not Gaelic, was the language of the playground.</p><p>The question is whether the bill will help to give the Gaelic language a fighting chance to turn round its fortunes. From the evidence provided to the committee, three main issues emerged: first, equal status for the language; secondly, rights to Gaelic-medium education; and thirdly, the treatment of Gaelic by UK public bodies. The bill clearly does not directly address the status of the Gaelic language in Scotland. However, I hope that the minister is still considering&#8212;he indicated today that he is&#8212;strengthening the wording in the bill to boost the aspiration that Gaelic speakers will be able to use Gaelic in just the same way and for just the same range of activities as one uses English, and certainly in accessing public services. I recognise that equality of treatment depends on the level of demand for services and the supply of staff with the requisite language skills, and that, even in Gaelic heartland areas, such service <place-holder colnum=\"14111\"/> provision will be difficult to deliver. Nevertheless, I am sure that the minister recognises the symbolic importance of equality of status, not least in sending a signal that the cause of Gaelic will not be hobbled by hiding behind practical difficulties and that Gaelic can count on generous support from this Parliament and Executive from now on.</p><p>The spread of Gaelic-medium education is clearly the key to the survival of the language. Others have spoken about the demand for a right to Gaelic-medium education, subject, perhaps, to reasonable demand. Such a right would act as a spur to public bodies, and parents would be empowered, but again we run into practical problems of teacher shortage. We need to create an infrastructure to deliver such a right. I welcome the minister's announcement about the task force.</p><p>The language-planning approach of the bill allows for a strategic and co-ordinated approach while ensuring that decisions with regard to Gaelic-medium education are no longer solely subject to local conditions. The bill's provisions in that respect are a significant step forward. I trust that the confidence of the minister and B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig in that approach will bear fruit.</p><p>Finally, I hear what the minister said about seeking the co-operation of UK public bodies that carry out reserved functions in Scotland. I hope that any agreements will have the effect of changing the practices of organisations such as the Royal Mail and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which have in the past rejected the use of Gaelic because they were not legally obliged to use it. As Alex Neil said, that situation contrasts markedly with the situation in relation to Welsh.</p><p>I welcome the bill; it is not perfect, but it is a good start and I look forward to the next stages of its progress through Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13332744", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Education Committee, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to today's debate.

I am also grateful to the many members of the public in the public gallery who have travelled to Edinburgh from Ayrshire to listen to what I hope will be a constructive session.</p><p>Over the next week or two, many of us will meet again at the perhaps more convivial gatherings at which we will celebrate the life and works of our national bard and toast his immortal memory. This evening, we have the more sobering task of finding a way in which to ensure the long-term survival of his physical legacy in the form of buildings, manuscripts and artefacts. Our task is to preserve a unique treasure as a source of inspiration for future generations. If we forget Burns, or are careless with his legacy, we will diminish both as a nation and in what we can contribute to the world.</p><p>Given the iconic status of Robert Burns, it is almost unbelievable that 46 per cent&#8212;almost half&#8212;of the most important Burns material in collections throughout the country is kept in uncontrolled environments, which allow its condition to deteriorate. By far the most important single collection is held by the Burns cottage <place-holder colnum=\"13822\"/> museum in Alloway, where more than 35 per cent of all the surviving material that was used or created by Robert Burns is kept in truly primitive conditions. The problems include rainwater penetration through the roof and dilapidation. The situation is shameful. If anyone doubts the truth of that, I refer them to the report that was published last April by the distributed national Burns collections project.</p><p>Crucially, the report identifies that most of the collections are managed and funded independently; little or no support is received from the Executive or other national bodies. Surely the lesson to be learned from the failure of the Burns national heritage park is that local partnerships alone do not have the wherewithal in terms of expertise or finance to maintain and develop nationally important Burns heritage sites or collections.</p><p>I am not absolving local authorities of all responsibility&#8212;far from it. For example, South Ayrshire Council has allowed a &#163;200,000 backlog of repairs to the auld kirk Alloway to build up. However, the Executive must have realised some years ago that the park was not sustainable under the joint board of local partners. Similarly, the never-ending saga of applications to the Heritage Lottery Fund should have awakened ministers and officials to the reality that a new museum was not in the offing in the foreseeable future. We are talking about the same Executive that declared three years ago that Burns heritage would be at the heart of its tourism development strategy and which is pinning such hopes on the 2009 year of homecoming&#8212;the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of Burns.</p><p>That said, I do not want to descend into the blame game. There is still time to turn things around, although there is no time to lose, and I challenge the Executive to deliver on its rhetoric. The way forward has been mapped out by key players in the tourism and heritage fields. Professor John Lennon at Glasgow Caledonian University's Moffat centre, whom the Executive commissioned to come up with an action plan for 2009, has already identified a lack of central focus that could and should be addressed. That can be done if the conservation and management issues at the national heritage park are tackled immediately.</p><p>In its final road-map report, the national Burns collections project recommends that the Executive and other national bodies should provide the long-term funding to sustain the Burns collections and should support the development of capital bids.</p><p>Most important, the National Trust for Scotland has expressed an interest not only in taking over the park, but in turning it into a national hub for Burns heritage that would co-ordinate the <place-holder colnum=\"13823\"/> fragmented national collections. Its vision is that Alloway would form the gateway to a tourism trail that would cover Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway, which would give people the opportunity to experience a coherent single-ticket pilgrimage. At long last, we have an exciting and realistic proposition that would allow the massive potential of Burns heritage and tourism to be fully realised.</p><p>I hope and trust that the Executive will rise to the challenge. Ministers will need to take a hands-on approach to facilitating the handover of control of the heritage park from the local partners to the National Trust for Scotland. They will also need to make a significant long-term financial commitment, so that our priceless Burns heritage can be cherished and promoted in a way that will be a constant source of pride for Scotland.

Sadly, that system has failed too many children in the past, with tragic consequences, and Elaine Murray quite properly highlighted the faults in the system that led to Kennedy McFarlane's death.</p><p>Members throughout the chamber have expressed the concern, which we all share, that many of our children are exposed to abuse and neglect or have their lives and welfare blighted by adverse social conditions and poverty. We should never forget that improving children's services is fundamental to tackling the child protection issue.</p><p>This week's leak from the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration that the inexorable rise in the number of children being referred for care and protection appears to be continuing unabated serves to underline the seriousness of and the dangers inherent in the current situation. It also serves to highlight the fact that we have a long way to go to fulfil the aspirations of \"It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright\".</p><p>As the convener of the Education Committee said, the main concern that the committee had at the end of the inquiry was about maintaining the momentum for reform and translating policy objectives into on-the-ground reality. We identified key constraints as being the difficulties in establishing a child-centred approach through a genuine multi-agency approach and information sharing, and the chronic shortages of social workers&#8212;as mentioned by Mary Scanlon and Christine Grahame&#8212;and particularly of front-line staff to work with children and families. It is not just a question of the shortage of social workers in general; there is a problem relating to the fact that many of the most experienced staff are under the greatest pressure and are more susceptible to the possibility of going for a promoted post elsewhere. That problem needs to be addressed. Of course, the need for early intervention is important. We have to ensure that the support that is needed in <place-holder colnum=\"13394\"/> order to deliver early intervention is not being siphoned off to further other agendas such as the youth justice agenda that Fiona Hyslop mentioned.</p><p>As others have mentioned, previously the main concern with Disclosure Scotland was the turnaround time for checks rather than the unintended consequences that the voluntary sector has brought to our attention in recent weeks. Not surprisingly, the debate has focused on that latter issue. Robert Brown, Rosemary Byrne, Ken Macintosh, Donald Gorrie and others have gone through the relevant issues including multiple disclosures, the provision of training and clearer guidance.</p><p>Although it is important that those concerns are addressed, the excellent briefing for the debate by Children 1<sup>st</sup> points out that there is a danger in focusing too much on disclosure checks as being the main way in which to protect children from dangerous adults. There is a concern that such a focus could give people false reassurance that it is someone else's job to ensure that children are all right. I would like to endorse the call by Children 1<sup>st</sup> for a public information programme to engage with adults and make individuals and communities much more aware of what they can and should do to protect our children and ensure their safety. I welcome the minister's announcement today of the pilot scheme and hope that it is rolled out across the country as soon as possible.</p><p>I welcome the support that Children 1<sup>st</sup> has given to the committee's recommendation that a single national child protection helpline should be established to ensure that concerns raised will be properly directed. There appears to be some confusion about whether we have such a helpline in place and I would be grateful if the minister could spend a little time telling us about the arrangements in that regard.</p><p>The work that Children 1<sup>st</sup> has done with sporting organisations shows the way in which the delivery of child protection training and the development of good practice can encourage volunteering by addressing the worries that people have about whether they are doing the right thing with children. I would be grateful to hear from the minister how the Executive intends to respond to the demand that all those working with children or providing direct services to children should receive mandatory child protection training.

It is long on rhetoric and exhortation, but short on policy substance, especially regarding the development of quality tourism products. We can have the best marketing operation in the world, but if the product fails to appeal or disappoints the consumer, we shall get nowhere near to realising the potential of Scottish tourism. It is time for the Scottish Executive to assist the tourism sector, not just by restructuring VisitScotland or giving it additional funding, but by taking significant responsibility for product development.</p><p>Let us take the heritage tourism product as an example of what is lacking and what is needed.

I can cite many examples of this failure, not just the current crisis that is enveloping the Burns national heritage park in Alloway, to which I will return in a moment. Despite the rich legacy, there have been few or no serious attempts to develop a Burns trail or visitor attractions across the county. Local authorities, no matter whether they are councils or tourist boards, have demonstrated that they are not up to the task. Indeed, they cannot even be trusted to look after the physical heritage that they have inherited, including the Burns monument in Kilmarnock, which was recently all but destroyed by fire-raisers after lying for years unused, locked up and fenced off.</p><p>The common themes of neglect, procrastination, the shuffling-off of responsibility and the failure to realise opportunities are nowhere more evident than in the deplorable state of the Burns cottage and museum in Alloway, which should be the flagship asset of the Burns heritage industry in Scotland. Although in its day the museum might have been suitable for housing a nationally important collection of Burns manuscripts and artefacts, that day has long gone. It is no longer possible to keep, preserve, present and interpret <place-holder colnum=\"13099\"/> that collection in a worn-out building that is more akin to an early 20<sup>th</sup> century cricket pavilion&#8212;with a leaky roof, to boot&#8212;than a modern purpose-built museum. Given the building's state, it is not surprising that some of the most important manuscripts such as \"Auld Lang Syne\" and \"Scots Wha Hae\" in the poet's own hand have been removed in recent weeks for safekeeping in Edinburgh.

That said, as the minister appreciates, the devil is often in the detail of a proposal and good intentions do not guarantee the outcomes that all might desire. Scottish National Party members would therefore like to study any proposals in some depth before we reach a final, considered judgment.</p><p>There is no doubt, however, that significant investment in the fostering service is long overdue. I refer members to the concerns expressed by the child care charity, the Fostering Network, which claims that Scotland is short of some 700 foster carers. That is a crippling shortage, when one considers that more than 3,000 children are living with just over 2,000 foster families. Too many children's lives are being badly disrupted by having to make frequent moves and by having to <place-holder colnum=\"11751\"/> go to foster homes a long way from family, friends and school.</p><p>The statistics show that in Scotland one in four children who live away from home in public care were placed in three or more homes in the last year, whereas the equivalent figure for England is one in seven children. What is more, the problem of recruitment and retention is not a new phenomenon. Back in 1999, the then Minister for Children and Education, Sam Galbraith, announced a review of the payment structures in fostering. He did so in recognition that the under-resourcing of foster carers was a major disincentive. Although it has taken a long time for the Executive to fulfil that pledge, let us hope that this is a case of better late than never.</p><p>There is no doubt that the allowances that are paid to foster carers do not meet the true costs of looking after a child. Indeed, research that was commissioned by the Scottish Executive said so, as did the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities report on foster care, both of which were published in the year 2000.</p><p>The Fostering Network's broad estimate is that each child in Scotland is being under-resourced by approximately &#163;50 per week. That figure is based on university research on the true costs of caring. Either children's needs are not being fully met, or carers are subsidising the needs out of their own pocket. Whatever the reason, the net effect is indisputable: more carers are quitting. The figures show that 5 to 10 per cent are doing so every year. Fewer carers are being recruited, which also limits placement choice. That result increases the likelihood of a mismatch between the child and his or her foster family, which leads to disruption and further moves. These children are amongst the most vulnerable and damaged in our society and they deserve better from our public services. Foster care is not just about offering a place of safety; it should offer the opportunity for the child to experience stability and an environment that gives them the chance to recover and develop.</p><p>The Association of Directors of Social Work are wholly supportive of the Fostering Network's call for better support for foster carers. The association acknowledges that there is inconsistency in the basic allowances and fees across the country. In some areas, independent fostering agencies that offer better remuneration to foster carers are springing up. Given the dearth of foster carers, the local authorities are being forced into using those agencies, which adds significant pressure to already stretched budgets.</p><p>ADSW argues that local government cannot handle the situation without a substantial hike in the funding of children's services from the Executive. The &#163;12 million that the minister announced this morning, while welcome, will not <place-holder colnum=\"11752\"/> make inroads into the estimated &#163;150 million shortfall in funding for children's services as reported by ADSW, which has led to a situation where local authorities need to spend a third more on those services than they get from the Executive. The minister will be well aware of the representations that local government has made in that regard. The reaction of local government to the detail of the proposals will be indicative of how well the Executive has measured up to the challenge.</p><p>The Executive needs to demonstrate that it appreciates that we need to make a step change in the provision of foster care services. As institutional care is phased out, the demand for foster care can only grow, and the service will continue to be the major provider of care for the most damaged, vulnerable and demanding of Scotland's children.</p><p>We need to reflect on the words of the COSLA report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Foster care is a difficult and demanding task. It is also a very isolated one in comparison with other child care placements. This needs to be taken into consideration in the support of carers to ensure that children are given the quality and type of care that they need and deserve and carers are given the information and help to develop the skills that they need to care for foster children without prejudicing their own family relationship.\"</p><p>Yet we know that less than 1 per cent of carers had any form of specific accredited child care training. We are in danger of creating a two-tier system, where children and young people in foster care will be cared for by people, but where there is no agreed national minimum in terms of training, background or experience. The very opposite applies to children in residential care.</p><p>Does the Executive intend to establish a national vehicle to deliver skills training to the foster care service? Alternatively, how are fostering support services at local level going to be developed to equip carers with the necessary preparation and continued training and support on a regular and consistent basis? The minister has yet to develop those proposals.</p><p>The time has come to stop thinking of foster carers as unsung heroes, as the Executive is fond of labelling them, and instead think of them as professional carers who need to be suitably trained, fairly remunerated and given the back-up that they need for the challenges that they will undoubtedly face. That is the view of the social work directors who are calling for a clear national strategy from the Executive, backed by the requisite resources. Such a need is ever more pressing, given the imperative to establish national standards and an inspection regime, as found in all other child care services.<place-holder colnum=\"11753\"/></p><p>Finally, reference has been made to kinship carers&#8212;the grandparents or other relatives who look after children who would otherwise be the responsibility of the foster care service. Often, those carers get little support from local authorities, yet they provide an invaluable service to the children in their care and to their local communities. Any national strategy for the foster care service must recognise and assist that underappreciated group of people.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13326832", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fostering"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish National Party side of the chamber welcomes the commitment that is expressed in the Executive motion to boost the fostering service in this country.

Those events also serve as a reminder that ministers and, indeed, ministerial assurances can be here today and gone tomorrow.</p><p>I have no doubt that the minister is sincere in his arguments and in his intention to use but rarely, if at all, the powers that the bill, once enacted, will confer on him. However, he has failed to convince many beyond the ranks of his own department and the members around him that there is any need for the proposed new intervention powers contained in part 1 of the bill. Most, if not all, of the education authorities that responded to the consultation exercise on the bill suggested that there was <place-holder colnum=\"10953\"/> already a range of checks and balances in place and that there was little or no evidence to suggest that local authorities or schools do not respond to issues raised in HMIE reports.</p><p>The notion that new powers of intervention were needed to close the loop with the inspection and monitoring mechanisms established under the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000, which allows ministers to fulfil a duty to secure improvement in the quality of school education, is at best arguable and at worst disingenuous. Many in the education world believe that the existing powers of ministerial intervention in education authorities that fail to meet statutory duties under section 70 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 would be sufficient to do the job when combined with section 2 of the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000, which places a duty on education authorities to secure improvement in the quality of education provided in schools managed by them.</p><p>It is notable that opposition to the bill has, if anything, grown over the course of its passage through the Parliament. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland have expressed alarm at what they see as the destruction of the partnership of trust between HMIE and local authorities. The recommendations in HMIE reports will, in effect, become instructions backed by the threat of ministerial intervention, which will remove management control from our democratically accountable local authorities.</p><p>The scope for intervention ranges far beyond the promotion of the quality of school education to any matter relating to the school, as I pointed out during the debate on Lord James's group of amendments earlier.

In particular, my colleagues and I welcome the proposed new child protection measures. Much work has been undertaken in the past few years to tackle child abuse, but the new bills will take that work into new areas by dealing with developing threats such as internet grooming as well as ancient barbarities such as female genital mutilation. That said, it would be remiss of me not to enter the caveat that there is many a slip between the introduction of well-intentioned legislation and its effective implementation. Those of us who served on the Education Committee when it conducted its child <place-holder colnum=\"9939\"/> protection inquiry were made aware of just how slow progress has been, for example in implementing the recommendations of the report \"It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright\".</p><p>One of the key problems has been the difficulty in recruiting and retaining social workers in the children and families field, where high levels of stress and low levels of public esteem have worked against the creation of a comprehensive child protection system. Delivering in that area remains a key challenge for the Executive in its attempt to combat child abuse, and care must be taken to ensure that the Executive's concentration on criminal justice and young people does not suck away even more social work resources from child protection.</p><p>In his speech this morning, the First Minister made some bold claims with regard to the Executive's tackling of child poverty. The evidence, however, suggests that child poverty remains at disturbingly high levels, with around one third of Scotland's children living in low-income households. It appears that the main beneficiaries of UK Government welfare to work policies have been children in households that are just below the poverty threshold. There is now more support for people in employment or moving into work but much less is being done for those not in employment. In fact, it can be argued that inequality is deepening for the non-working poor. The reality is that eradicating poverty requires us to tackle inequality effectively. A redistributive tax and benefit system is a prerequisite for such an effort. Of course, however, this Parliament is denied those powers. When members on the Labour benches tell me that constitutional issues are irrelevant, I like to point out the impact that our having the powers to implement a redistributive tax and benefits system would have on people in Scotland. The issue is far from being an irrelevance.</p><p>The Executive has also made much of its investment in early years education and there is no doubt that such investment is important in enhancing the life chances of all our children, regardless of their background. It is a great pity, therefore, that many who work in that sector, such as nursery nurses, have been treated shabbily for a long time in relation to pay and recognition of their invaluable contribution. I sincerely hope that the current review will provide a just settlement to their long-running grievances. We await the detail with interest.</p><p>We want justice for nursery nurses but the SNP also believes that much more must be done to develop a national system of supported childcare that is both affordable and accessible, along the Scandinavian model. In this country, childcare costs act as a powerful disincentive to participation <place-holder colnum=\"9940\"/> in the labour force and to the decision to have large families. The economic benefits of such a policy would far outweigh its costs. Unfortunately, I see no hint of such policy development from this Executive.

The integrated curriculum services staff to whom I spoke, who are led by Ruth Hendery, were very much in the business of delivering on another of the Executive's strategic goals: to create a Scotland where people have the confidence and skills they need to participate in society despite all the difficulties they might have to overcome. I want to highlight some of the issues that emerge from delivering learning opportunities to people who have mental health problems and to point out some of the shortcomings that constrain college provision. I hope that ministers will address those shortcomings.</p><p>It should not take much imagination to realise that mental ill health raises significant barriers to learning. For example, people who suffer from such ill health might have low self-esteem, might lack confidence and might have a fear of being stigmatised in a college environment if symptoms recur or if their medical history is revealed. They might have dislocated lifestyles and have very real financial difficulties, or they might be struggling with the side effects of medication, with a lack of concentration and with a reduced capacity for retaining information.</p><p>In such circumstances, access to education services more often than not requires the active intervention of referral agencies, no matter whether they be national health service <place-holder colnum=\"8615\"/> rehabilitation teams or local and national voluntary organisations. Referrals must be appropriate; they must take place at the right level, at the right time and in the right place, which inevitably requires that a range of services be available.</p><p>Additional support to overcome barriers to learning must be both comprehensive and holistic, which means that there must be close working relationships between the referral agencies and education providers. That poses a real challenge to the effectiveness of joint working. Although such issues are undoubtedly difficult, I sense that there is great willingness on all sides to tackle them and to assist people who are either recovering from or managing mental ill health in getting back into productive lives.</p><p>However, a big problem remains, which requires ministerial intervention and policy change. The current funding mechanisms need to be modified to allow students who have additional support needs to be accommodated without displacing mainstream students from college courses.</p><p>Currently, colleges have little room to expand dedicated provision for people who have additional support needs, or to provide education as part of rehabilitation. The on-going capping of growth throughout the college sector has led to an excess of demand for places. Priorities determine that those who are furthest from entering the labour market will be less likely to receive a service, as colleges are steered towards their core business of delivering vocational training. People who are recovering from mental ill health invariably need more pre-vocational training in preparation for job-related courses. Moreover, time means money, so colleges are under pressure to make courses shorter and to leave more material for students to cover through independent study. Again, that tends to disadvantage the client group about whom I am talking, who tend to need more personal tutorial support.</p><p>Although additional funding for students with additional support needs covers the extra costs of small classes, the overall budget remains limited and growth of such provision could take a disproportionate share of the budget. Colleges could be in the invidious position of having to choose between funding one student on a discrete course and funding two students on a mainstream course. Needless to say, colleges invariably address the needs of the many rather than the needs of the few.</p><p>There is a clear case for reform. Colleges that have the skills to work with partners in their own communities should be funded to provide discrete provision for people who have mental health problems, who perhaps need more time and support if they are to achieve their learning goals and become ready to undertake programmes of <place-holder colnum=\"8616\"/> vocational training.

The economic activities that are associated with the leisure and recreational infrastructure built up at the seaside still provide vital sustenance to coastal communities.</p><p>In recent times, the major concern that we have had regarding our beaches has been over bathing water quality, as the minister mentioned. Thankfully, the disgusting practice of discharging raw or untreated sewage into the Clyde has ceased with Scottish Water's belated but welcome investment in its sewerage and waste water systems. I trust that Scottish Water and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency will continue to work together to eradicate continuing problems such as wrong connections or foul drainage into surface water systems in the coastal urban areas. Similarly, the work that SEPA is doing with the agriculture community to stop diffuse pollution from run-off from fields into the rivers needs to be followed through. Although the quality of bathing water has undoubtedly improved, it is still not up to the most stringent European Union standards, and we cannot afford to take a foot off the pedal on the issue.</p><p>The Executive would do well to take note that the Ayrshire public put the state of the beaches and bathing water quality right at the top of their agenda for environmental action. No fewer than 54 per cent of respondents to South Ayrshire Council's recent environmental issues survey demanded cleaner beaches, rivers and coastlines. What is more, communities such as Troon are being stung into action by what they see as neglect by local councils. As you will no doubt remember, Presiding Officer, Troon south beach held a national clean beach award for six years until 1999, when South Ayrshire withdrew financial support for beach wardens. However, the beach has subsequently deteriorated. The council pleads poverty and says that the Executive does not allocate it enough funds to spend on beaches. It claims that it can afford beach maintenance work only during the summer season.</p><p>By contrast, the local community has taken responsibility into its own hands. The Troon sand dunes restoration group, which was set up as a charity, gained landfill tax grants and enlisted council help to use discarded Christmas trees to stabilise the sand dunes, which were eroding. That erosion was threatening the old course at Troon, where the open golf championship will be held this summer. Local volunteers regularly stage clean-up campaigns to keep the beach free of litter, and many of our much-maligned young people are active in that work. Following on from that success, a separate group of volunteers is taking on the refurbishment of the north shore to develop it into a multipurpose recreational area.<place-holder colnum=\"8242\"/></p><p>Does the minister recognise the value of the work that is undertaken by such groups and will he consider direct Executive support for their work? If he has not already done so, I suggest that the minister should make a short journey doon the watter from his constituency to meet the good folk of Troon, who, rather than sitting around moaning about their problems, are getting up and doing something about them.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318074", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Beaches: A National Resource"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I cannot promise that there will be any songs in my speech.

The debate is timely in that it is being held during national depression week. In addition, the debate will help to raise awareness of depression and to fight the stigma that surrounds it.</p><p>It bears repeating that one in five people will be affected by depression at some stage in their lives. Treating depression accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of the work burden of NHS primary care services. The World Health Organisation predicts that depression will be second only to heart disease as the biggest global health burden by 2020. However, three in four cases of depression are neither recognised nor treated because the stigma that is associated with mental health problems continues to prevent people from seeking and finding help.</p><p>Therefore, while any and all initiatives that the Executive takes to raise awareness and tackle stigma are to be welcomed, there are legitimate questions to be asked about whether enough is being done to promote mental well-being and to combat mental ill health, given the scale of the problems and the history of underinvestment in mental health services over many decades.</p><p>Ministers are aware of the patchy nature of service provision across the country. Dr Sandra Grant's report identifies many gaps in services and it makes for grim reading. The notion that mental health is the Cinderella service of the NHS persists&#8212;under-resourced, under-staffed and under intense pressure is the reality for professionals who work in the field. Despite the central directives and the establishment of mental health as a national clinical priority, local NHS boards still appear to be reluctant to reallocate resources in favour of mental health. The minister's earlier announcement of extra resources is welcome, but ensuring that those resources reach their intended destination and have the required impact will need careful monitoring.</p><p>In the time that I have left, I want to focus on one or two areas for priority action. The first is child and adolescent mental health, which was until recently something of an invisible issue in the policy domain. As Mike Rumbles highlighted, recent studies have indicated that 10 per cent of the five-to-15 age group&#8212;125,000 of Scotland's children&#8212;suffer from mental health problems of such severity and persistence as to have a significant impact on those children's functioning and relationships. The rate is higher among <place-holder colnum=\"7634\"/> children in lone-parent households and in low-income families. However, according to the Scottish needs assessment programme report that was published last spring, such problems often go unidentified and it is difficult to access the right support even when they are recognised.</p><p>Clearly, it would make sense to ensure that such problems are tackled when they arise, instead of allowing them to develop to the point at which they endanger a child's healthy development. Early intervention and prevention of mental ill health among children should surely be at the top of the priority list for Government action. Other studies show that it is possible to instil resilience&#8212;the capacity to cope with stress&#8212;through school-based programmes. Carefully designed and implemented preventive programmes can reduce the rate of subsequent mental health problems in high-risk populations.</p><p>I am aware that the child health support group is working on a guidance template to develop the SNAP report's recommendations, but I would appreciate an indication from the ministers today of their commitment to ensuring that implementation will be supported by sufficient resources. Dr Graham Bryce, who chairs the support group's work in that area, indicated yesterday to the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on mental health that a doubling of the budget on child and adolescent mental health services would be required to turn round the dire situation that specialist services will face within the next five to 10 years.</p><p>That may be necessary as far as treatment is concerned, but clinical services alone will not tackle the underlying problems. The range of children's services must be brought into play in the form of an intelligent network. Schools have a particularly important role to play not only in terms of referrals to specialist services, but in providing direct assistance to children. The importance of a major staff-training effort cannot be overemphasised.</p><p>We must move away from current practices in which children who are identified as having mental health or behaviour problems are all too often diagnosed by general practitioners who have little time or expertise to carry out thorough assessments. I am particularly alarmed at the growth in the use of drug therapies to modify children's behaviour or to deal with their mental health problems. That cannot be the way forward. I have run out of time, but that is an area to which I will need to return in future.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13316348", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I preface my remarks by thanking the Executive for bringing the debate to the chamber today.

I hope that the minister will respond to what I say when he sums up.</p><p>It is quite right that sewage sludge can no longer be dumped at sea, so we must find alternative and environmentally friendly methods of disposal. Landfill is not an option. As a result, mixing sludge with industrial slag on derelict brownfield sites to create a growing medium that will allow that land to be restored could be regarded as a viable option, provided that the justifiable concerns of communities about the safety of the process and the control of pollution&#8212;including smells&#8212;are properly addressed.</p><p>If sewage sludge is to be used in such a way, it must first be properly treated to ensure that biological hazards are not introduced into the environment. There is a strong case for the establishment of an inspection regime that checks outgoing loads from water companies to ensure that safety standards are guaranteed. I suggest to the minister that SEPA's role in that regard needs to be strengthened.</p><p>Secondly, the proximity principle should apply. As there is a panoply of area waste plans and a national waste plan, a duty should be introduced on sludge producers to the effect that they must dispose of waste within its area of origin; perhaps a code of practice could be drawn up. There should be no scope whatever for the dumping of English waste in Scotland, or of Scottish waste in England for that matter.</p><p>Thirdly, local authorities and&#8212;more to the point&#8212;communities must be fully involved and empowered in respect of local environmental control. I know about the circumstances in South Lanarkshire, but the fact that Scottish Coal did not require planning consent before going ahead with its trial at Dalquhandy exposes gaps in current planning laws and guidance that badly need to be filled. Those gaps have visited environmental injustice on communities such as those in Clydesdale, Cumnock and Doon Valley, with which I, as an MSP for the South of Scotland, am particularly concerned.

The House of Lords is an anachronism and it should not have a role in the governance of a modern Scotland. What is more, the House of Lords has proved to be fallible in the few decisions that it has had to make on Scots law, most notably in the recent case of Sharp v Thomson, in which English law concepts were applied to overturn the decision of a Scottish court, creating so much consternation in legal circles that the Scottish Law Commission has recommended that the decision be overturned by statute. If Annabel Goldie were here, I would suggest to her that the ginger beer has gone very flat indeed. I would also suggest that, apart from by those Scots lawyers who enjoy their days out at Westminster, appeals to the House of Lords will not be missed.</p><p>Last week, I, too, attended the Lord Advocate's lecture in the Signet library. I found his defence of the Government's proposals for a UK supreme court to be unconvincing and his attack on proposals to repatriate the right of appeal in civil cases from the House of Lords to the inner house of the Court of Session to be patronising. Nicola Sturgeon has already quoted from the Lord <place-holder colnum=\"5330\"/> Advocate's contribution to the Scottish cringe, but I think that it is worth repeating. The Lord Advocate said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"As a legal system in a small country on the edge of Europe, we must be conscious of the risk of becoming self-centred and inward-looking.\"</p><p>I seem to recall those same sentiments being expressed many times by those who battled hard over the years to prevent the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>The Lord Advocate also claimed:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the presence of Scottish judges in the supreme court, whether it is the current House of Lords or the proposed new institution, opens a two-way window for us into the worldwide family of common law systems.\"</p><p>Excuse me&#8212;I am not a lawyer&#8212;but has not the Scottish legal tradition, unlike its English counterpart, been part of the European main stream from time immemorial? Surely, given our membership of the European Union, all the various European legal institutions are much more relevant as vehicles for our interaction with the wider world. Disparaging attitudes to Scotland and its institutions seem to be entrenched in UK Government circles. Why does the consultation paper on the proposals for the supreme court make no mention of the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament in devolved judicial matters? The paper makes it clear that the powers of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords will transfer to the supreme court, but that proposal is apparently not for debate and is not subject to consultation.</p><p>Given that arrogant disregard for the Scottish experience, it is little wonder that senior figures in the Scottish legal establishment have been sounding the alarm bells. Lord Hope of Craighead summed up the situation accurately. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are two quite distinct things at stake. The first is the integrity of the Scottish legal system, which was protected by the Act of Union and has always been respected up until now ... The second is the devolution system\".</p><p>The question is what the Parliament will do to counter those threats. To my mind, we should first oppose the whole kit and caboodle of what is being proposed. Taking the judiciary out of the legislature and placing it under the control of an arm of the Executive in the form of the Department for Constitutional Affairs is no constitutional advance. Secondly, and perhaps more pertinently, given that this is a devolved question, we should abolish the practice of sending appeals to the House of Lords and repatriate them, as the SNP amendment suggests.

That intention fits well with the fundamental commitment of the Scottish Parliament to build an inclusive and just Scotland where everyone matters. The question that we face is whether or not the legislation that we are considering today fits the bill.</p><p>There is no doubt that the current record of needs system is ripe for reform. It is overly bureaucratic and too often brings families and education authorities to loggerheads over service provision and resources. It is an adversarial system in which the onus is on the parents to enforce the law. To some extent, those features were inevitable consequences of setting up a separate special system to try to ensure that a vulnerable minority of children got what they needed. Unfortunately, from our perspective, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill comes from the same stable.</p><p>Our basic view is that strengthening the universal system is the more powerful safeguard for children with additional support needs. In the real world, systems for everyone tend to have higher standards than systems for particular sub-groups of the population, not to mention the fact that a universal system limits the scope for stigmatisation. That means that, firstly, there must be a clear recognition that education, as a public service, has a duty&#8212;as does, for example, the national health service&#8212;to adapt its service to meet the needs of all children and to act in their best interests. Secondly, it means that there must be generic systems for appeal and dispute resolution when children and families are not getting the service that they feel they need.</p><p>Although the bill attempts to address the inequities of the current system, we are in danger of creating or continuing a three-tier system, as Fiona Hyslop and Rosemary Byrne have eloquently pointed out. The Scottish Executive has clearly set out on a road to improve the current system, but there is no statement of intent or aim to aspire to. I would be grateful if the deputy minister could provide such a statement in summing up. Is the key purpose of the bill to reduce inequalities in educational outcomes by providing more flexible and individualised teaching and support to all children, or is it simply to try to replace one system for classifying and assessing special children and for rationing resources with another, more efficient, system, while leaving the basic way in which children are helped to learn the same?</p><p>On the specific provisions of the bill, the minister will be aware that the Education Committee has been wrestling with a number of thorny issues, which are laid out in what I believe is a thorough <place-holder colnum=\"5255\"/> and commendable report. Those issues have been well reflected in this afternoon's debate. The committee was particularly concerned about the rights of the children and parents who currently qualify for a record of needs but who will not be eligible for a co-ordinated support plan. Lord James rightly focused much of his contribution on the not insubstantial number of people who might feel that they will lose out in the transition from the old system to the new one. I echo his call for the protection of those legal rights, while acknowledging that the minister has set out his stall to ensure continuity of service provision.</p><p>It is also widely recognised that the proposed code of practice, in defining the duties of education authorities and others, is absolutely central to the success of the legislation. The minister himself has acknowledged the lack of trust that many parents feel under the current system, and it is essential that appropriate provision is made for all children, irrespective of whether or not they are eligible for a co-ordinated support plan. The fear that education authorities and other agencies may invoke what can be interpreted as get-out clauses in section 19 of the bill or that they may use another get-out clause on the ground of reasonable cost deserves further attention. The whole area of assessment and diagnosis or identification is particularly sensitive. Mary Scanlon and Rosemary Byrne spoke well on those matters.</p><p>I would be grateful if the deputy minister would respond to the committee's concerns in paragraphs 110 to 114 of its report and in particular to the call for provision of advocacy services for parents, although I recognise the welcome announcement that he has made today.</p><p>In addition, the importance of independent mediation, clear dispute resolution procedures and equity in legal assistance before and during tribunals has been reflected well in the debate. I trust that ministers will be able to lodge suitable stage 2 amendments to address the concerns of witnesses and the committee. I have already touched on&#8212;as did Robert Brown, Christine Grahame and others&#8212;the desirability of extending access to tribunals beyond those with CSPs.</p><p>I am aware that there are many other issues that I have not mentioned, but it would be remiss of me to finish without highlighting what we see as weaknesses in the financial memorandum, particularly the fact that it does not quantify the provision of services for children with additional support needs. Given Audit Scotland's recent criticism of the Parliament for passing the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Bill without having full and robust financial information, we believe that every effort should be made to illustrate the wider impact of the bill when it is <place-holder colnum=\"5256\"/> enacted rather than focus narrowly on the changes to administration costs.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13309793", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate has demonstrated that there is a desire among all parties in the Parliament to ensure that, in the terms expressed by the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000, \"the right of every child of school age to be provided with school education\",  in accordance with his or her needs, is fulfilled in such a way as to develop each child to his or her full potential.

Of course, we do not approve of the financially wasteful PPP method of funding the school building programme. The problems that have been encountered in East Lothian are symptomatic of the weaknesses of that form of financing and we remain convinced and concerned that PPP will not <place-holder colnum=\"5170\"/> deliver the physical infrastructure that our pupils and teachers deserve. The major investment that the Executive is rightly making in early-years education is being undermined by its failure to act to bring nursery nurses in from the cold.</p><p>The debate has been wide-ranging, with some interesting contributions. However, I should point out to Rhona Brankin&#8212;before she harangues other members&#8212;that it was the minister himself who first called for a philosophical debate. The only person who really hit the nail on the head this afternoon was Rosemary Byrne. Let us be blunt: reducing class sizes is the single most effective measure that could be taken to improve school education. I quote the president of the Educational Institute of Scotland at last year's Trades Union Congress:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"smaller classes, for teachers, means lessons and activities better targeted towards the needs of each pupil; smaller classes, for parents, means that they can be confident that their child's teacher knows and understands their child's needs. And smaller classes for pupils means that they can receive more of their teachers' time to help them meet their needs. Modern teaching methods, new technology, new courses all point towards one thing: a crying need to reduce class sizes\".</p><p>All the educational research that has been conducted, both here and throughout the world, backs up those commonsense views. We should be particularly concerned that the evidence shows that class sizes of 25 or more hinder the educational development of children&#8212;we know that class sizes of over 30 are the norm in the early years of secondary school.</p><p>The first signs of the implementation of the Executive's programme are not particularly encouraging. The financial support packages that have been put together to implement cuts in class sizes for P1, S1 and S2 suggest a programme that has been cobbled together at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour, rather than a carefully thought out, systematic approach to raising the quality of pupils' learning experiences.</p><p>It would appear that the Executive cannot provide the 3,000 additional teachers who are required by 2007 to reduce class sizes without bringing primary school teachers into secondary schools to teach classes there. Not enough teacher training places are available. We need to double the capacity for initial teacher training to achieve anything like the number of secondary school teachers that the Executive has announced is required.</p><p>Peter Peacock stated that his aim was to move from a producer view of how we organise services and a system that is built around providers to a user-led view of how services ought to be provided. The proposal to use primary teachers in a stop-gap way to teach maths and English in S1 <place-holder colnum=\"5171\"/> and S2 flies in the face of that aim. The minister should be well aware that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Parents would be outraged to discover that people were teaching subjects in which they had no proper expertise\".</p><p>That is the view of the General Teaching Council for Scotland.</p><p>Given the background of falling school rolls for several years to come, we have a golden opportunity to effect a step change in reducing class sizes. I believe strongly that the whole Executive, not just the Minister for Education and Young People, should be judged on how well it meets that challenge. There is no more important issue facing this country and its Parliament than how to raise Scotland's educational standards.</p><p>As was pointed out in this morning's debate on higher education funding, Scotland's wealth was built on the competitive advantage that we gained from being first in the field with a universal education system. Our future prosperity is totally dependent on our aiming for and achieving educational excellence to equip us to deal successfully with the opportunities and threats posed by a globalised world economy.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13309650", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would suggest to Brian Monteith that that was not so much good cop, bad cop; it was more like Laurel and Hardy.

I make no apology for returning to that source, as I believe that it is the authentic voice of the chalkface. Its article on indiscipline states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We consider chronic indiscipline to be the most serious problem facing Scottish teachers.\"</p><p>It goes on to complain bitterly that teachers' local authority employers have failed to protect both their rights to work in a safe environment and the rights of the majority of children, who behave appropriately.</p><p>Will today's debate as it is reported in tomorrow's newspapers send a signal to school staffrooms across the country that the Executive and the Parliament are serious about ensuring order in Scotland's schools, that we acknowledge that the 2001 discipline review has only partially addressed the problem and that much more effective action to tackle it will be forthcoming? We need an answer to that question today.</p><p>The open part of the debate was particularly good and I have no doubt that the preponderance of former teachers among members contributed to that. Robert Brown made good points, although I believe that he is not a former teacher. He argued that discipline is not about control and sanctions but about the need to establish support systems, especially for those children with social, emotional and behavioural problems.</p><p>Rosemary Byrne, who has considerable professional experience, developed that theme and called for the proper resourcing of joint action teams. Like her, I am concerned about the incidence of mental health problems, such as depression, and the growing trend for the use of behaviour-controlling medication among our schoolchildren. She made an excellent suggestion about developing mentoring schemes, which should be taken up.</p><p>Scott Barrie also drew on his experience from a previous life. He made pertinent points on parent involvement and the exclusion merry-go-round. Given the increased devolution of powers to head teachers, it is clear that HMIE has an increasingly important role to play.</p><p>I will now address the ministers. Although we welcome the measures that have been announced, especially those that are designed to provide teachers with training and support in dealing with disruptive behaviour, we question whether they go far enough fast enough. As Sylvia Jackson, Rob Gibson and others highlighted, training is important. It is apparent that, in teacher training courses in the past, dealing with disruptive behaviour has not been given anything like the prominence that it should have been given. My wife, who is a secondary school teacher, can recall only one class that covered the subject during a full year at teacher training college. Nor <place-holder colnum=\"2002\"/> has dealing with indiscipline been a huge feature of in-service training.</p><p>That said, training should not be regarded as a panacea for all ills. I do not want there to be any reversion to blaming the teacher for not being up to the job of class control. Too many head teachers and education authorities have hidden behind such excuses for inaction and lack of support systems in the past.</p><p>We are glad about the U-turn on school exclusion policy that the minister announced. The target was both bureaucratic and counterproductive and it prevented head teachers from taking appropriate action, at the expense of pupil and teacher safety. We want the Executive to go further and devolve discipline policy from local authorities to head teachers. That is not to say that education authorities should not provide support in the form of guidance. I commend Glasgow City Council's education department for its recently published guidelines on dealing with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p><p>The SNP will push four main policy issues. First, we must establish a rights and responsibilities code to instil a sense of personal responsibility and self-worth among pupils. Secondly, there is a need to establish a zero-tolerance culture in the classroom, coupled with a strategy to change behaviour by expanding alternative curricula or, as Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and Alex Neil advocate, increasing access to further education. For more seriously disruptive students, there should be temporary exclusion centres where behaviour change is made part of the learning process.</p><p>Thirdly, we should acknowledge that early intervention is critical to nip problems in the bud. Smaller class sizes have a role to play in facilitating that process. Finally, schools should be properly resourced so that they can deal with indiscipline.</p><p>I will close on that and commend the SNP amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13301744", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Better Behaviour, Better Learning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "During her opening speech for the SNP, my colleague Fiona Hyslop drew on ordinary teachers' experience of unruly pupil behaviour, which is highlighted in the latest edition of the General Teaching Council for Scotland's monthly   magazine.

Those feelings are shared across the spectrum of the SAC's stakeholders in Scotland and among staff, students and rural communities throughout the country who have bought into the SAC's mission to enhance the sustainability of our land-based industries, and into its vision to be a focus in Scotland for innovation and the transfer of knowledge to those industries. They are angry at the performance of an inept board&#8212;largely self-appointed and unaccountable as it is&#8212;and a succession of senior managers who have failed to rise to the challenge of change, to the point at which the financial viability of the whole operation is seriously under threat.</p><p>Those people are also dismayed that despite the intervention of the Parliament and the Minister for Rural Development last year to stop ill thought-out plans to close the Auchincruive campus, the board has come back this year with proposals to close not only Auchincruive, but to close Craibstone in Aberdeen, with a view to centralising its operations in Edinburgh. What more intuitively absurd proposition could there be, that in order to promote the rural economy, we must close rural campuses in favour of city locations?</p><p>The proposals have an all too familiar ring to them. When the centre is in trouble, the solution is <place-holder colnum=\"295\"/> to asset strip and sell off the outlying parts of the organisation&#8212;even though they might be perfectly functional or profitable on their own&#8212;and to consolidate on the site with which senior managers are more familiar and comfortable.</p><p>I have little doubt that the process has been in train for several years; Auchincruive in particular has suffered from the erosion and transfer of research capability. Perhaps the most blatant example is the transfer of grassland research away from Scotland's principal dairy farming area. Not only have staff and facilities moved away, there has been a deliberate policy of disinvestment. The maintenance backlog at Auchincruive is estimated to be &#163;2 million and at Craibstone it is &#163;700,000, but the figure is only &#163;350,000 in Edinburgh. What clearer indication do we need of the board's long-term intentions? Perhaps a ban on initiatives to realise development opportunities that arise from underutilised physical assets would be a clearer indication. Such a ban has been in place at Auchincruive for some years.</p><p>Given the background, I am disgusted with the board's attitude that, if politicians do not like the proposals, they must cough up more of the taxpayers' money to bail out the board. That said, we are where we are, and there are hard choices to be made if we are to secure financial viability for any organisation that seeks to deliver education, applied research and advisory services to our land-based industries. Given the Minister for Environment and Rural Development's responsibility to achieve best value from public money, he would no doubt agree. The question is whether the board's proposals are based soundly on an objective appraisal of all the available options. I will be interested to hear from the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development whether he agrees with me&#8212;and many colleagues&#8212;that the proposals are not based on such an appraisal.</p><p>After his meeting with the Rural Development Committee just prior to the break-up of last Parliament for the elections, Ross Finnie said that he and his officials were asking questions about the underlying assumptions that are built into the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. I hope that Ross Finnie's deputy will share with us any answers that have been received. I also urge him to acknowledge that the proposals should be the subject of an urgent inquiry by the new rural development committee.</p><p>Many stakeholders are deeply sceptical about the options appraisal and the heavy influence of the SAC's executive management team in directing and informing the consultants. For example, the projected figures for future student numbers seem to be particularly dubious. Where <place-holder colnum=\"296\"/> will the increase of 400 full-time equivalent students over the existing number of 1,100 come from? All the evidence suggests that removing Auchincruive, which accounts for 60 per cent of the student body, will significantly reduce demand for the SAC's educational services. The notion that higher national diploma or higher national certificate students from local further education colleges will transfer readily to an Edinburgh campus for degree courses flies in the face of experience.</p><p>The financial performance of a centralised SAC would be critically dependent on student numbers. Failure to reach the target of 1,500 students&#8212;we should remember that the campus at Edinburgh King's Buildings has at present only 115 students&#8212;could lead to losses that would make the existing deficit and debt look like a drop in the ocean.</p><p>In scrutinising the plans, the Parliament has a duty to take into account considerations that are wider than those that exercise the SAC's board and management. The impact on the wider community of changes to the structure of the SAC must be assessed. A recently released report from Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire revealed that Auchincruive puts &#163;10 million into the local economy each year, supports 410 full-time equivalent jobs and is supplied by 198 local companies. Craibstone will, no doubt, have similar figures to report.</p><p>I appeal to Ross Finnie, the Minister for Environment and Rural Development, to resist the temptation to put his accountant's hat on, and to remember that growing the economy is supposed to be the Executive's number 1 priority. In that context, can the deputy minister flesh out the proposal that is outlined in the partnership agreement for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the establishment of a Rural Development Institute\"?</p><p>What relationship does he foresee between such a body and the SAC's rural campuses?

In the globalised economy of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we must run hard to stand still, but standing still is not good enough, given our dismal underperformance in economic growth. We need a step change in competitiveness to boost our long-term growth <place-holder colnum=\"19894\"/> rate to the UK level, never mind the level of other small European countries, which have averaged an annual growth rate of 3.1 per cent in the past 25 years whereas our rate has been 1.7 per cent. If we had grown at a rate of 3.1 per cent, our GDP per head would be a staggering &#163;5,000 higher than it is today.</p><p>What is more, the situation has worsened under Labour. Contrary to Labour's propaganda, Gordon Brown has not turned round the Scottish economy. It is not strong or stable, compared with our competitors' economies. In addition to lower growth rates, we have constantly had a higher unemployment rate than the British average and a population growth rate that is much lower than that in England and which is turning into absolute decline.</p><p>John Scott highlighted the situation in the Ayrshire economy, which has suffered about 3,500 redundancies in the past year.

User groups are deeply sceptical about the notion that community-based compulsory treatment orders will always be the least restrictive alternative. Because of the many gaps that exist in community-based services, there is suspicion that the new orders will amount to little more than compulsory medication in people's homes, as Mary Scanlon outlined, and will involve no reciprocity.</p><p>The bill does not specify the types of patients for whom a community-based compulsory treatment order would be more appropriate than a hospital-based compulsory treatment order.

The fear is that, unless conditions for their use are tightly drawn, community-based compulsory treatment orders may increase compulsion significantly. Furthermore, it is feared that the orders may be used as a resource management tool to relieve pressure on an understaffed national health service that has a decreasing bed capacity.</p><p>If the Executive were to accept amendments 74 and 75, people's fears could be effectively allayed and the bill's credibility with service users would be enhanced considerably.

I acknowledge the need to further develop and strengthen the tourism industry. Naturally, the committee tended to focus on tourism matters that are within the remit of the Scottish Parliament, but it would be idle to pretend that reserved issues are not of vital interest to the future of the Scottish tourism industry. Westminster controls the exchange rate policy and a whole swathe of fiscal policy from fuel tax to air passenger duty to VAT. At their current levels, those all have a major impact in putting up the price of the Scottish tourism product and in reducing the competitiveness of our industry in the international marketplace.</p><p>Action to cut VAT on hotel accommodation is long overdue. All the research shows that, in a highly prized, sensitive industry such as tourism, there is a clear negative correlation between high VAT and consumer demand. With VAT on hotel accommodation more than double the European Union average of 8 per cent, the UK is the odd man out in Europe. If the Scottish Parliament had the powers, it could follow the Irish example. Cuts in VAT that were introduced in the late 1980s, together with other initiatives, quadrupled tourism revenues in Ireland.</p><p>Perhaps the most impressive part of the report is the internal research that was conducted by Stevens and Associates, which identifies lessons to be learned from comparable competitor countries that are performing much better than Scotland. The clear message from that research is that strategic intervention and leadership on the part of the Government combined with a fully engaged private sector are critical for success.

Like many others with an interest in this area, I believe that, in being required to provide proper scrutiny of such an important bill within such a tight time scale, the committee has been given a particularly burdensome task. It is a great concern that the introduction of the bill has been so delayed and that the parliamentary time available for consideration of it has been so compressed that we may end up with flawed legislation. That would be a great pity and would reflect badly on the Executive, given the comprehensive preparation and detailed work that was done by the Millan committee, which spent more than two years taking evidence and consulting widely before reporting with a coherent set of reform proposals.</p><p>I want to focus on the provisions that relate to compulsory treatment&#8212;in particular, the extension of long-term compulsory powers to treat people who are living in their own homes.</p><p>When proposing the introduction of community-based CTOs, the Millan committee was specific about the criteria that should apply when determining whether compulsory treatment should be hospital or community based. A community-based order might apply to people who had relapsed while off medication in the community in the past, presenting a risk to themselves and others. The clear intention was for community-based orders to be used as preventive measures to stop people becoming so ill that they needed to be hospitalised.</p><p>The Millan committee did not envisage that such orders would be freely interchangeable with orders that involve hospitalisation. That raises the legitimate fear that community-based orders will be used as a resource management tool to relieve pressure on an NHS that is understaffed and whose bed capacity is reducing. User groups are deeply sceptical about the notion that, in those circumstances, community-based orders will always be the least restrictive alternative form of treatment that Millan envisaged.</p><p>It is likely that, in return for the restriction of normal freedoms in one's home, all that will be offered will be compulsory medication. Given that the new orders can be renewed continually, in practice some people may remain under compulsion for many years. Until we have developed a wide range of community-based <place-holder colnum=\"16229\"/> services, such as day care, psychological therapy and rehabilitation schemes, which at the moment are palpably missing, community-based orders should be the exception rather than the rule.</p><p>Those provisions&#8212;indeed, any legislation in that area&#8212;should be seen as a last resort to cover situations in which all else has failed and the only option is to compel treatment. It is a disturbing fact that the incidence of compulsion has been rising rapidly over the past decade or so&#8212;by some 300 per cent. The resource implications of the bill are much greater now than they would have been even in the recent past. I note the Finance Committee's criticism of the financial memorandum's inadequacy.</p><p>My point is that, at the same time as striving to make the bill as effective and as progressive as it can be, we must address the state of our mental well-being as a nation.

That lack of effective diagnosis and treatment presents a huge danger to the potential mental health of women suffering from post-natal depression. If not tackled professionally and quickly, it can turn into a chronic and long-term illness. There is also strong evidence of a link between untreated post-natal depression and poor health outcomes of the children concerned.</p><p>The SIGN 60 guidelines state that there is a need to ensure routine screening for any signs of depression. For that to happen, those who come into contact with new mums must be properly trained to spot the signs of PND. The mental health charity Mind believes that many women go untreated because of a lack of training and because health professionals do not have sufficient time to spend with patients. Health <place-holder colnum=\"16043\"/> professionals need to be vigilant for signs of PND, as it is very difficult for many mothers to admit to post-natal depression. As Trish Godman said, everyone, including the professionals, expect them to be on cloud nine with a new baby, so many women hide their true feelings. For that reason, I believe that it would be worth while and cost effective for the Executive to focus its attack on that stigma through its \"See Me\" campaign.</p><p>The SIGN guidelines also recommend that psychosocial interventions should be considered when deciding on treatment options for post-natal depression. Services such as infant massage, cognitive behavioural techniques, couple interventions, social support and counselling should be available. They have been shown to help women suffering from post-natal depression. Given that many women are rightly wary of drug therapies at that time, there is an urgent need for alternatives to be made available. Unfortunately, I believe that, like other SIGN guidelines for mental illnesses, few health boards will implement them, citing a lack of resources. The Executive needs to take responsibility for the implementation of SIGN guidelines, rather than allow them to gather dust on a shelf as happens now.

The committee and its staff have done the Scottish Parliament a service, picking their way through a vital but complex area of our national life and fulfilling an ambitious remit to produce a coherent set of recommendations. As the committee's convener said, the report has been the first real attempt to examine all the sectors of lifelong learning as elements in what should be a unified system that will underpin economic success, social justice and full democratic participation for all our citizens.</p><p>The report advocates a significant cultural change through the empowerment of the individual to access training and educational opportunities in pursuit of personal development. Crucially, that should mean that no group in society is left out in the cold. Learning will be relevant to everyone, which is far from the case just now. Although we might congratulate ourselves on the fact that 50 per cent of school leavers now enter higher education, we should remember that university entrants still come from predominantly middle-class backgrounds. Children of the wealthiest seventh of the population are five times more likely to go to university than children of the poorest seventh.</p><p>The other side of the coin is that 800,000 Scots of working age have low numeracy and literacy skills and 24 per cent of Scots in employment have no qualifications. In addition, financial disincentives and other barriers to entry are placed in the way of thousands of our fellow citizens who might wish to return to full-time or part-time post-school learning.</p><p>To address those problems, the committee report advocates unequivocally widening access by targeting disadvantage and redistributing <place-holder colnum=\"15734\"/> resources to break down or overcome barriers. The SNP supports whole-heartedly such an approach. We believe that providers should be given extra funding to attract and support learners from non-traditional backgrounds and that the wider access premium for higher education institutions should be increased to 25 per cent. Equally important is the need to ensure that local authorities provide adequate funding to sustain the informal learning that is provided by community and voluntary groups.</p><p>Consistent and well-funded support across the lifelong learning spectrum must also be made available to learners, particularly those with disabilities and dependants. Typically, learners in higher education are entitled to support, whereas other learners might be eligible for support. That lack of entitlement is probably the biggest barrier to lifelong learning. The report's advocacy of an extension of entitlement is therefore the key to breaking down the barriers and empowering the individual to seek learning opportunities and qualifications without financial penalty.</p><p>That would help to establish equality of treatment for all learners. Part-time learners would be entitled to the same fee arrangements pro rata as full-time students, as entitlement would be equalised among all learners whether in further or higher education. Mature students entering further education would have a clear idea of the support that they would receive rather than taking the risk of subjecting themselves to discretionary funding from individual colleges. Similarly, the rules and criteria for funding unemployed learners or those on other benefits would be standardised to secure equality of eligibility.</p><p>Those are the kind of system changes that are required to raise demand for learning and skills acquisition among disadvantaged groups. The beauty is that that is achievable by using the groundbreaking Scottish credit and qualifications framework. We do not suggest a big-bang approach, but a few pilot studies would be useful.</p><p>In the SCQF, outputs are measured by a points system in which most forms of learning can be accounted for. The committee recommends that everyone should be entitled to the equivalent of six years of study&#8212;two years of post-compulsory school education and a four-year degree. However, that entitlement could be used at any level and at any time in one's life. The framework is a simple mechanism to make lifelong learning an accessible and practical individual choice. Therefore, it is disappointing that, in its response to the report, the Executive cannot bring itself to support the principle of entitlement. There are many warm words about widening access but, on entitlement, the Executive says that it</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recognises the difficulties inherent in this concept, and that <place-holder colnum=\"15735\"/> the extent to which entitlement can be fully realised depends to a considerable degree on how it can be resourced.\"</p><p>Sir Humphrey would be proud of that one.

I am suggesting that the Executive has not accepted the principle of entitlement. Indeed, it calls the concept of entitlement difficult, which it is not. That suggests to me that the civil service might be dousing our enthusiasm for entitlement.</p><p>Entitlement will mean redistribution of resources within the system. Let us take the example of vocational training and workplace learning, for which a major reorientation is required. As Alex Neil pointed out, the demographic fact is that our pool of talented young people is shrinking fast. It is shrinking so fast that 80 per cent of the work force of 2020 is already in work. That means that, if Scotland is to have a well-trained and competitive work force in the future, we must shift the focus of training on to those who are already in work.</p><p>To close the skills gap and develop workplace skills requires a complete overhaul of the current system. Too many employers have eschewed upskilling as too difficult and have developed production strategies that require low levels of skill. If we want to move to a high-productivity, high-wage economy, we need to build capacity for workplace learning, with the training of trainers as a key element.</p><p>I will give an illustration of what is required. I want to talk about Ayrshire&#8212;I see Mr Gallie in the chamber. The expansion of the aerospace industry will be a key driver of economic growth in Ayrshire. However, that growth will be choked if a skilled work force cannot be developed. The basic infrastructure exists. Several companies, such as BAE Systems at Prestwick, operate successful training departments or schools, but those are underutilised by as much as 60 per cent, because companies are training only for their own <place-holder colnum=\"15736\"/> requirements.</p><p>On top of that, disincentives are built into the current funding regime. On average, to complete an engineering apprenticeship in the United Kingdom costs approximately &#163;40,000. The subsidy that is available to Scottish employers is only &#163;7,000, compared to &#163;14,000 in England. UK companies such as BAE Systems are therefore discouraged from training more apprentices in Scotland. At the same time, engineering courses are high cost, but FE colleges receive only half the subsidy that their counterparts in higher education get to run engineering courses. Not surprisingly, FE colleges tend to choose to run other, low-cost courses. Those funding anomalies need to be eradicated to allow for the building of training capacity and the development of the skilled work force that is required not only for an expanding aerospace industry in Ayrshire, but across the industrial spectrum.</p><p>The committee's report has comprehensively addressed those failures in the system. In that area, as in others, its recommendations are sound and sensible. Taken as a whole, the report sets out the basis of a lifelong learning strategy that is vital to achieving economic competitiveness and social justice. The question is whether the Executive is up to the challenge.</p><p>However, as Alex Neil said, the report does not address some key issues, including student finance and the funding of higher education. It would be remiss of us not to broach those subjects in the debate. The questions about the sub-Cubie arrangements that the Executive adopted in its graduate endowment scheme will not go away. To enter higher education still requires a leap of faith by the poorest of students and particularly adults who are entering the system for the first time as mature students. Fear of debt is a clear disincentive.</p><p>The Executive must revisit the &#163;10,000 threshold for the graduate endowment scheme.

He informed me that that is outwith his control, as it is perfectly acceptable for waste from other areas of the UK to be transported and dumped in Scottish landfills. I believe, as do many others, that that makes a mockery of the national waste strategy for Scotland, which, along with the waste management strategy in Ireland, is based on the proximity and self-sufficiency principles.</p><p>What is the point of Scottish councils and consumers cutting down on the waste that they dispose of by landfill and engaging in more recycling when we can be used as a dumping ground by other areas of the UK, especially when those areas have their own capacity to deal with waste and should be doing so? I urge the minister to look into the situation at Lendalfoot and particularly to consider whether the company is complying with the conditions of its licence.</p><p>The so-called Alba Resource Recovery proposals also cause me deep alarm. Interestingly, Alba Resource Recovery is a subsidiary of the well known opencast coal mining operator, Scottish Coal. I presume that the link between coal mining and waste disposal is a large hole in the ground. The prospect of massive waste management centres being established in East Ayrshire and in Fife horrifies me. Huge quantities of municipal waste from several councils would be transported to one local site for waste treatment and disposal. I suppose that it has the attraction of improving recycling rates at one fell swoop. However, that type of initiative will do nothing to change behaviour in the way that is needed to minimise waste at its origin. It will also visit more environmental injustice on areas such as Cumnock and Doon Valley, whose development opportunities have been and continue to be blighted by environmentally damaging economic activity.

I do so from the perspective of having a particular interest in mental health.</p><p>There is a need for a significant hike in investment in mental health services, which the recent Clinical Standards Board for Scotland report on schizophrenia accurately described as still the Cinderella of the national health service in Scotland. In September, when the Minister for Health and Community Care announces the detailed allocation of the extra resources that were made available by the recent budget, I want to see planned expenditure for mental health services on a scale that reflects the status of a national clinical priority. That means pushing the rate of increase in mental health spending to higher than the average for total health spending. We must also ensure that we invest those extra resources in quality. We must invest in front-line services, not feed a massively inefficient and unaccountable <place-holder colnum=\"11962\"/> bureaucracy.</p><p>We must recognise the need to focus on a range of outcomes, not all of which can be as easily measured as waiting times, to evaluate spending decisions. Mental health services do not lend themselves to simple outcome measurement. In many cases, treatment is about better management of a recurring condition and securing improvements in a patient's quality of life in the community.</p><p>On key priorities for investment in reform, we now need more acute beds, not fewer. The minister will be aware that more and more forensic patients are being treated by general psychiatric services, rather than being dumped into prisons as they have been in the past, much to our shame. Most such patients do not need to go to medium-secure units for their safety or for that of others. Rising demand is putting staff resources under too much pressure. Equally problematical has been a tendency to reduce staffing and resourcing for acute in-patient services in line with a reduction in the number of beds and a move to the provision of care within the community. That ignores the fact that the in-patients who now need acute beds are the more complex cases, who require more intensive care and treatment. Therefore, staffing per bed needs to rise to ensure that standards of care and treatment are maintained, let alone improved.</p><p>As has been emphasised many times in the chamber in recent weeks, we must do much more on pay, conditions and career development opportunities to retain experienced staff and attract new blood into the caring professions. Further investment is also badly needed to improve the physical environment in hospitals, for patients and staff alike. We need smaller units in the acute setting. For example, in Ayrshire and Arran there is no separate provision for adolescents. Teenagers are being put into adult wards with some very disturbed people. That is extremely distressing for the young people concerned and their parents. Most hospitals also lack step-down facilities to prepare people for discharge. I am reliably informed that the most dangerous time for patients emerging into the world after an acute episode is the seven days after discharge. I will use a military analogy. Their wounds may have been patched up in hospital, but they are not fit to go back into the front line and they quickly become casualties again.</p><p>We need more rehabilitation units in the community to manage the transition from continuing care to living in the community. The reform agenda must recognise that hospital management teams and those involved in putting together care packages are best placed to identify needs, or gaps in provision. They need flexibility to <place-holder colnum=\"11963\"/> do a good job. Devolving managerial responsibility and budgets must be the way of the future.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13274158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health and Community Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.

It is significant that the primary care modernisation group's first report has highlighted the need for better provision for sufferers of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Thirty per cent of all GP consultations arise from people seeking help with mental health problems. What is more, recently published survey results show rising trends in the incidence of depression among all age groups. Even children under the age of four are being treated for depression. However, the most heavily affected group is women in the 25 to 44 age range, with a staggering annual figure of nearly 100,000 of the 700,000 Scottish women in that age group seeking treatment for depression from GPs.</p><p>We clearly need to improve our understanding of why so many people are suffering from poor mental health, so that the root causes of that modern disease can be tackled. We need to review a wide range of policies, not just in health care, to relieve the stresses with which so many of our fellow citizens struggle to cope. Lifting more families out of poverty and providing much better child care facilities for working mothers are two areas for action.</p><p>However, that is not the whole story. On a recent visit to a suicide prevention centre in Glasgow, I was told that the dangerous increase in the incidence of suicide and self-harm among young people is born out of a perceived failure to live up to their own expectations of what they can achieve in life and to what they feel are their families' expectations. That applies to upwardly mobile social groups in particular. We need culture change.</p><p>On the deficiencies in treatment of mental distress of that nature in the NHS, drug therapy is too often the first and last resort of GPs. There has been a huge rise in the prescribing of antidepressants over the past few years, with reports suggesting that the prescription rate for antidepressants is much higher in Scotland than in England. Mental health problems that are not severe and enduring can be dealt with in a variety of ways: medication, specialist treatment, counselling and other forms of psycho-social intervention. However, widespread uncertainty exists among GPs over what kind of interventions are appropriate and effective.<place-holder colnum=\"11265\"/></p><p>We need better models of care. We need better training for GPs and nurses in the area of mental health. We also need much improved availability of specialist services. For example, waiting times of more than a year are the norm for people who are referred to clinical psychologists. Above all, what people really need to overcome mental health problems is someone to listen to them and to give them time, which is precisely what hard-pressed GPs are finding increasingly difficult. Practical help and information to alleviate the conditions that contribute to health problems are also badly needed.</p><p>In that regard, the way forward has already been signposted by the Health Education Board for Scotland's 1998 study \"Mental health and primary care: a needs assessment\". It highlighted the need to recruit other members of the primary care team to deal with patients with such problems. Health visitors and practice nurses, for example, can be as effective therapists as the doctor&#8212;if not more so for patients with poor mental health who do not want to bother the doctor. Training is therefore a major priority.</p><p>The main message is that attitudinal change is needed. We must view the patient as a whole person who needs a combination of help, not all of it of a medical nature. We need much better partnership working between primary care professionals, the voluntary sector and other agencies, such as social work and the police, as Mary Scanlon said.</p><p>Urgent ministerial action is now required to give substance to the lip service that has all too often been paid to mental health as a national clinical priority.

In the context of a national strategy for economic development, it makes no sense to dismantle a centre of excellence, and a growth point in an area that suffers from chronic economic underperformance, and to relocate that centre's functions to areas of Scotland that are overheating.</p><p>The SAC is clearly in financial difficulty, having <place-holder colnum=\"10603\"/> lost &#163;2.5 million last year. Its financial position has certainly not been helped by funding pressures, not least from the Executive, nor by a contraction in the number of students, which is a result of increased competition from other colleges. I do not accept the spin from the SAC's board and senior management that the college's poor performance is an inevitable consequence of the problems faced by the agricultural industry.</p><p>Over recent years, the board has made a series of plans, offering a series of short-term solutions and consuming badly needed cash, but providing few positive outcomes. There has to be a question mark over the business capabilities of senior managers who owe their positions to being successful scientists. By their nature, such people will tend to have a focused&#8212;some may say blinkered&#8212;approach, and will tend to favour their particular area of interest or even geographical site.</p><p>At least an element of that tendency would seem to have been at play in recent years, with the erosion and transfer of research capability from Auchincruive to Aberdeen and Edinburgh. For example, where was the logic in the transfer of grassland research away from the principal dairy farming area of Scotland, where poor weather and difficult soils perforce make grass the main economic crop?</p><p>In recent months, that trend has been accelerated, with no fewer than 18 staff, with combined teaching experience of 385 years, leaving Auchincruive.

He castigates me for dealing in soundbites and for seeking to preserve the status quo. It is quite the contrary.

To downgrade or close Auchincruive in order to reduce overhead costs is akin to throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p><p>The capacity of the Auchincruive estate should be regarded as a development opportunity. I note that the SAC is in discussions with South Ayrshire Council and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire on options for a change of use. I would have thought that the prospects for establishing a bioscience or business park, or for leisure or recreational development, would be much greater with a fully functioning agricultural college of international repute on the site.</p><p>The SAC is in real danger of losing its client <place-holder colnum=\"10604\"/> base if, on the one hand, it preaches diversification and rural integration to farmers and land managers while, on the other hand, demonstrating a complete lack of gumption in maintaining and developing the Auchincruive estate. Then again, SAC clients appear to be the last group to be consulted on the proposals for change.</p><p>What takes the biscuit for me is the SAC's assertion that the most important driver of the proposals for change is the need to secure delivery of substantive, competent research programmes, and to do so by creating focused research groups with critical mass and aligning those with potential partners. That is precisely what the SAC has been busy dismantling at Auchincruive over the past few years.</p><p>A single body at Auchincruive has provided education, research and advisory activities. The transfer of ideas and interaction between staff who are involved in various activities occur systematically. That results, first, in education being relevant to what is happening in the industry; secondly, in a research programme that responds to the needs of the industry; and thirdly, in advisory services that rapidly become aware of new research developments.</p><p>At Auchincruive, there has been the added extra of continuing involvement with the food processing sector. The college is one of the few establishments in the world where expertise on the complete food chain, from farm to fork, can be found on a single site. That is a priceless asset, given the need to develop small, rural-based food processing enterprises&#8212;and it is being partly realised by the association with the Hannah Research Institute in the CHARIS project. In addition, Auchincruive retains strong links with the University of Glasgow and its basic and applied research output is renowned worldwide. It would be a real tragedy if the SAC board were allowed to get away with destroying Auchincruive's research capability instead of building on its immense reputation. I trust that the Parliament and the minister will stand in the way of those designs.</p><p>I am conscious that I have not focused my remarks on the importance of Auchincruive as an educational centre of excellence. I trust that colleagues with first-hand experience of the college will be able to expand on its virtues. I will confine myself to pointing out that the SAC's prospectus for 2002 outlines details of 40 courses and that Auchincruive delivers no fewer than 25 of them. It provides rural Scotland with a first-class learning environment that is fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>I trust that the minister will be able to indicate this evening, first, that he will be sending Messrs Mackie and McKelvey homeward to think again about their disastrous proposals, and secondly, <place-holder colnum=\"10605\"/> that on no account will his approval, let alone his funding, for the changes be forthcoming.</p>", "hdate": "2002-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13270637", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Agricultural College, Auchincruive"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the future of the Scottish Agricultural College at Auchincruive and to represent the views of the many people in Ayrshire and beyond who are campaigning to retain the college as a vibrant engine of change and growth in the rural economy.

Next year, with the advent of the automated credit transfer system, across-the-counter benefit transactions, which are the mainstay of sub-post offices' income, will be phased out. At a stroke, an average of 40 per cent of the revenue of such businesses will be lost&#8212;in many cases, the figure will be much higher. In some sub-post offices in south Ayrshire, 70 per cent of income is derived from benefit transactions.</p><p>For any business, a loss of income on that scale would be a massive financial black hole and would threaten its survival. That gap must be filled or hundreds of sub-post offices will go bust, which will leave communities bereft of services that contribute to the social fabric, about which a number of members have spoken. Given that the UK Government decided to introduce ACT, it has a major responsibility to bridge the gap.</p><p>In agreeing to act on the proposals that the Cabinet Office performance and innovation unit made in June 2000, the UK Government appears to be meeting that responsibility. However, almost two years after the proposals, post offices still do not know whether developments such as \"Your Guide\" will be introduced, let alone provide the new income streams that are required to fill the gap. Nor do sub-post offices know what transaction payment they will receive for operating the proposed universal bank. How can people plan their business for the future on that basis? Given the current state of uncertainty, it is unsurprising that the market value of post office businesses has plummeted. It would take a great leap of faith to buy or invest in a sub-post office at this time.</p><p>In Scotland, that uncertainty has been compounded by the equivocation of the Scottish Executive, which is demonstrated every time the Executive is asked to give a commitment to the post office network. The concerns deepened with the Executive's admission that the funding consequential that is received from HM Treasury for the development of \"Your Guide\" was not used for that purpose and that other options to deliver online public services were investigated. The minister would relieve some uncertainty if he gave a commitment to support the roll-out of \"Your Guide\" in Scotland, if the outcome of the English pilot is a decision to roll out the system in England and Wales.</p><p>Given the time that it takes to run an evaluative pilot scheme, we do not have the time to carry out our own one.

It remains to be seen whether public accountability will be more than a nominal feature of Scottish Water or whether the commercial imperative will win out when the ethos of the body corporate is established. Given the Administration's ideological distaste for public enterprise, I fear that the accountants will dominate. Perhaps we have got off to a bad start with the Minister for Environment and Rural Development.</p><p>I want to focus on how operational efficiency savings will be sought; their likely impact on the quality of service that is provided to customers by the work force; and the work force's terms and conditions of employment. Let us look at the scale of the job losses that the amalgamation of the three authorities will visit on the industry. In his evidence to the Transport and the Environment Committee, the Minister for Environment and Rural Development suggested that around 1,000 jobs&#8212;one in six of the current work force&#8212;will go. That figure, which is bad enough in terms of the loss of skills and expertise, is likely to be a significant underestimate. Unison suggests that 2,000 is likely to be nearer the mark. For confirmation, we need look no further than the experience in England and Wales, where the work <place-holder colnum=\"4571\"/> force has fallen by a third since privatisation.</p><p>The consequences of such work force losses on other public utilities have had a severe impact on work force capability and on the quality of service that is provided to customers. Railtrack is but one example. The problem is not only that deskilling takes place&#8212;bad as that is&#8212;but that there is an inevitable erosion of health and safety performance that affects both the work force and the public. Clearly, the major public health concern is what would happen if an accident or other incident were to cause contamination in the water supply. When that happens, the whole system must be shut off and cleaned up. Taking out a third of the work force means that such incidents will be dealt with less effectively and will result in serious disruption. The evidence to the committee made it clear that local knowledge and experience are vital to sorting out problems. We have a hotch-potch of sewers and pipes. In a water quality crisis, local operational staff who know the systems and know what they are doing are vital.</p><p>The drive towards multifunctional roles, which goes hand in hand with staff reduction, will also have an adverse impact on public health. Someone who is in a sewer in the morning should not use the same clothing and kit in the water system in the afternoon. At the moment, there tends to be a demarcation between water and sewerage to prevent the incidence of cross-contamination. A logical consequence of a significant reduction in staff and the adoption of multifunctional jobs is an increased risk to public safety and a rise in the number of boil water notices. I hope that the minister will address that in his summing-up.</p><p>Furthermore, I hope that the minister will acknowledge that such problems will be compounded many times over if, as is likely, outsourcing becomes a significant feature of the industry when the commercial imperative takes over. It is a matter of concern that, in the past year, the four fatalities in the industry in Scotland have all involved staff of private contractors.</p><p>Not only workers' health and safety but their employment rights will be put at risk because of privatisation and increased outsourcing. Although I welcome the minister's commitment to protect pension rights, I hope that he will confirm that workers who are transferred from the three water authorities will have their terms and conditions guaranteed, even if they are transferred on again to private contractors. Will he also acknowledge the need for the regulator to take into account the effect that any decision will have on the work force? That would be a welcome departure from regulatory regimes elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, I hope that the minister will take on board Unison's proposal for a comprehensive staff <place-holder colnum=\"4572\"/> order in addition to section 23.</p>", "hdate": "2001-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13261960", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Industry (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Implicit in the creation of a single water authority is the desire that the new authority will be lean and mean enough to see off competition from the privatised English water companies.

East Ayrshire is the part of Scotland that has been more affected than any other by opencast mines, often to the detriment of local communities. I return to the point that was made earlier, that landfill follows opencast mines as night follows day. I do not know where John Farquhar Munro gets his information, but he should check his sources.</p><p>I was, in East Ayrshire, especially concerned that the coal subject plan should be shaped so as to reduce the impact of opencast mining on the environment and to protect the amenity of local residents and communities from the adverse effects of opencast operations&#8212;we heard earlier about the adverse effects. In arguing that, I thought that I was arguing with the grain of the Executive's national planning policy guidelines, in particular with NPPG 16&#8212;after all, there are few more environmentally destructive activities than opencast mining. I prefer to use the term strip mining, because it describes more accurately what happens to the land during the extraction process.</p><p>To be frank, opencast mining is not an industry that I care to promote. If alternative economic opportunities are available to local communities, I favour a general presumption against opencast operations.<place-holder colnum=\"4049\"/></p><p>Local authorities in East Lothian have established clearly that opencast coal mining is appropriate in only a few areas. They have rightly resisted designating wider areas for opencast mining, because that could inhibit new investment or the expansion of industries that range from high-tech to low-tech industries, including tourism.</p><p>In that context, the decision by Scottish ministers to modify the Lothian structure plan can be regarded only as perverse and I cannot envisage that national interests will be served by that exercise of ministerial powers. Scotland demands less coal than is being extracted. I reckon that we need about 3 million tonnes per annum, which is mainly for the Longannet and Cockenzie power stations. More than half of Longannet's needs are met from the last deep mine in Scotland, which is at Longannet. However, according to recent figures, Scottish opencast coal production exceeded 7 million tonnes in 2000. That is almost 50 per cent of total UK production.

There might now be a clear strategic identity for the elderly mentally ill, but little progress has been made in changing attitudes&#8212;both within and outwith the national health service&#8212;to dementia and other mental disorders among the elderly. That is despite the fact that a demographic time bomb is ticking away quietly, with the year-on-year increase in the proportion of over-65s and over-75s in the population.</p><p>The health service in the 21<sup>st</sup> century must persuade older people and the professionals who deal with them that mental disability is not an inevitable consequence of aging. Older people seldom query changes in their mental health. They must learn the importance of recognising symptoms of mental health problems such as memory loss, a decline in their abilities in daily living or loss of pleasure in daily activities. Although dementia is irreversible, a great deal can be done for people who suffer from dementia and for their carers. I echo the points that Donald Gorrie made about care in the community and the distance that we must still travel in that direction.</p><p>At the moment, unless people who suffer from dementia are diagnosed, they are unlikely to receive support and services until they reach the later stages of the illness, when there is a crisis. However, primary care screening is too much of a hit-and-miss affair and is very dependent on the approach that is taken by individual GPs. The <place-holder colnum=\"3534\"/> treatment of Alzheimer's is a case in point. Four years after the launch of the first drug treatment for the disease, we are experiencing a postcode lottery. As I understand the situation, the disparity in uptake is not due solely to budget limitations in health boards. Differences in local practice play a major part in causing problems. In many areas, GPs are not referring patients to hospital specialists or to memory clinics, where they exist. It is significant that the area of highest uptake is Ayrshire and Arran, where memory clinics are very much in existence.</p><p>I have no doubt that one of the main barriers to progress is the prevalence of agism in the national health service and in wider society. The attitude still prevails when priorities are being set that our elderly are worth less than other age groups.

The error has been to confuse financing with funding, which obscures the fundamental truth that the taxpayer must, sooner or later, pay for public infrastructure, to the extent that it is not commercially viable. Most would acknowledge that few of our rail services fall into the category of commercial viability.</p><p>I know of no member of the Parliament who would not want our rail network to be extensively developed. There are sound and convincing grounds for that, such as to further environmental, economic development and social inclusion objectives in urban and rural Scotland. Who could deny the strength of the case for the Borders rail link, as presented by Christine Grahame, or <place-holder colnum=\"3320\"/> Sandra White's arguments for a Glasgow crossrail scheme and airport link?</p><p>We propose a Scottish variation on the theme that Stephen Byers has advocated of reformulating Railtrack as a not-for-profit trust or a company limited by guarantee with a board of directors who are drawn from rail industry stakeholders. That body's priority would be the interests of the travelling public, not the need to increase shareholder value. It would invest any operating surpluses directly into the network.</p><p>As Andrew Wilson has cogently argued, we want Scottish ministers to take a further step forward by negotiating for the establishment of an independent Scottish trust to raise investment funds in capital markets, for the devolution of railway policy to the Scottish Executive and Parliament and for a fair share of planned UK public spending on the policy, perhaps through the Barnett formula. That would allow us to create a publicly accountable railway system that is fully integrated with other transport modes.</p><p>What are the alternatives? A UK-only trust will mean continued strategic control of our railways by Whitehall and its agency, the Strategic Rail Authority. Scotland is bound to lose out without decentralisation, as it is sure that the Treasury will insist on maintaining pressure to focus on investment schemes with the best short-term return on capital. That means directing investment to the areas where high passenger flows already exist&#8212;principally London and south-east England.</p><p>What about vertical integration and the ScotRail franchise taking over responsibility for track and stations? I suspect that companies such as National Express would run a mile from that prospect, given market conditions.

Unfortunately, the unsatisfactory situation that he described in respect of Lockerbie is all too familiar throughout the rail network in Scotland. I have received representations from many constituents who have had difficulty in using stations, particularly on the Glasgow to Stranraer line along the Ayrshire coast. Many are unable to use the old bridges that cross the lines to other platforms. More often than not, those bridges involve <place-holder colnum=\"3290\"/> climbing steep stairs up and down. That is completely impossible for wheelchair users or young mums with baby carriages.</p><p>Many people do not use trains as a consequence of such barriers to access. As at Lockerbie, others must resort to taking a train in the opposite direction to which they want to go until they reach a station where they can alight and cross to the other side. On the Ayrshire coast line, Ayr serves that purpose. The time, trouble and expense involved in that effort are disproportionate to what should be a simple journey. The fact that so many people put up with that says a lot about the stoicism of our fellow citizens who are subjected to that rigmarole, but it is a damning indictment of the underinvestment in our railways over many years.</p><p>I made representations to Railtrack on behalf of those constituents and was told, \"Yes, we have a programme to improve accessibility and to replace old bridges, but given that each replacement will cost &#163;0.25 million\"&#8212;which was the figure that I was quoted, so David Mundell was obviously given an inflated amount for Lockerbie&#8212;\"we cannot afford to complete such a programme in less than 20 years.\" Where does that leave the 2004 deadline? I am sure that members will agree that the situation is totally unacceptable and flies in the face of the fine intentions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and effectively thwarts its objectives.</p><p>Now that the infrastructure of the rail network is back under public control, I hope that the Executive will ensure that disabled people's needs will move up the priority list, as outlined in the document, \"Strategic Priorities for Scotland's Passenger Railway: A consultation paper: November 2000\". I hope that the Executive will also establish a national advisory committee on transport needs for the disabled and encourage direct consultation with disabled passengers and their carers at the point of use. As well as providing a more accessible physical environment, the rail industry must assess openly and transparently how its staff at stations and on trains can provide a more responsive service to those with disabilities.</p><p>As convener of the cross-party group on mental health, I want to highlight the need for further research on the services that are required to make it easier for those suffering from mental health problems and learning difficulties to use public transport. It must be remembered that the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 covers people with physical and mental impairments. Those impairments have a substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person's ability to carry out day-to-day activities. Staff training is vital to improve customer services and to ensure that <place-holder colnum=\"3291\"/> customers with disabilities are able to access services as easily as possible. All service providers should look at that, to ensure that staff know how to make it easier for those with disabilities to use their services. That change should be brought about quickly and easily.</p><p>Other simple changes that would help disabled customers could be introduced easily by service providers. Those changes include improving announcement systems or introducing induction loop systems to ensure that those with reduced hearing can access services; making timetables more readable and understandable; providing literature in large print, in Braille or on tape for those with visual impairments; and upgrading signs to ensure that they can be understood easily by those with learning difficulties.</p><p>None of those modifications would be horrendously expensive or overly ambitious, but they would be appreciated by large sections of the travelling public and would allow many of the non-physical barriers to access, which limit the use of railways by our fellow citizens, to be overcome.</p>", "hdate": "2001-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13259043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Railway Station Platforms (Disabled Access)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Mundell on securing the debate and on the cogency of his argument.

That process would have exposed as palpable nonsense the Executive's justification in the policy memorandum to the bill for the renewal of tolls and particularly its assertion that not to renew tolls would have</p><p class=\"indent\">\"undesirable economic, environmental and social consequences through potentially increased traffic levels on a heavily used facililty\".</p><p>A basic understanding of elementary economics informs us that raising the price of or introducing a charge on a service will reduce the quantity demanded of that service. We agree that removal of tolls will increase bridge use. However, it is perverse to suggest that the enhanced movement of goods and people that will result will have anything other than a positive impact on economic activity in the areas that the bridge serves. The local councils welcome the removal of charges, as that provides a direct economic boost to the area.</p><p>The councils also anticipate a reduction in detrimental effects on the environment and in congestion, as alternative routes to the bridge are through highly urbanised areas. In that context, it is interesting to note that the Executive accepted the sense of that argument in 1999, when tolls were temporarily suspended to redirect traffic further up the river from the Kingston bridge when that bridge was closed for repair. It follows that the removal of tolls from the Erskine bridge could relieve the whole Glasgow conurbation of some of its congestion at existing pinch points, such as the Kingston bridge and the Clyde tunnel. Air pollution would also be reduced as traffic could move more freely and quickly throughout the area. In addition, at a time when we are trying to rebuild the tourist industry in Scotland, removing restrictions caused by tolls on the Erskine bridge would encourage wider access to Argyll and the west Highlands.</p><p>There are powerful arguments about the economic efficiency and environmental benefits to be gained by the removal of tolls. Those arguments must be balanced against the financial impact of the removal of tolls on the Executive's budget. It is clear that the Executive is operating a surplus of some &#163;3.2 million on the bridge's operational account. Apparently, that surplus is to supplement the amount allocated to transport in the assigned budget. That is what is happening, but the question is, should it be happening? Is it fair that bridge users are not only paying for the maintenance and upkeep of the bridge, but making a further contribution to the transport system of Scotland, over and above that of other taxpayers?

Transparency needs to be significantly improved. The committee's report and several members who have spoken have highlighted a variety of deficiencies in the annual expenditure report. They include the failure to pick up proofreading errors; the absence of explanations for changes to expenditure and policy compared with the previous year's plan; the lack of quality information, which prevented subject committees correlating departmental aims with expenditure; and the lack of disaggregated spending details for policies that are delivered through local authorities, health boards and quangos&#8212;which constitute the bulk of the <place-holder colnum=\"2087\"/> Executive's budget. Little progress has been made on the reporting of cross-cutting expenditure, which is disappointing, and no progress has been made on gender impact analysis.</p><p>I welcome the ministerial commitment, which I believe to be sincere, to fill those gaps. The minister has said that he will act to bring the budget process into line with the Finance Committee's recommendations. I was also impressed by the willingness of the Deputy Minister for Finance and Local Government to move towards a performance assessment framework for departments and towards a system of priority-based budgeting. The focus on the outcomes of spend rather than on the amount of inputs that are purchased is welcome.</p><p>I am sure that the deputy minister expressed a consensus view when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"All politicians have a habit of simplifying policies for election periods, saying that they will employ X more teachers, doctors and nurses, for example. There is very little focus on the end product.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Finance Committee</em>, 8 June 2001; c 1318.]</p><p>The question is whether we in the Parliament can raise our game to conduct a more relevant debate to re-engage the growing number of people who have lost faith in the democratic process as an instrument of social and economic progress.</p><p>In my swan-song as a finance spokesperson, I wish to advance the argument that no matter how well the Executive manages its financial resources, the constraints that are imposed by block and formula funding from Westminster under the current devolution settlement will, sooner or later, limit the Executive's room for manoeuvre. That will be to the detriment of the aspirations of the Scottish people. Already, the Executive is struggling to find the resources to pay for its commitment to fund the teachers' pay settlement, free personal care for the elderly, the abolition of up-front student tuition fees and the cost overruns on the new Scottish Parliament building. Given all that, how will it deliver on its election promises to improve the health and education services?</p><p>Problems are arising despite the influx of new money coming into the budget at the rate of &#163;1 billion a year in each of the years that were covered by the most recent comprehensive spending review. That flow of funds will almost certainly slow down in the next CSR period; the Barnett squeeze will bite deeper; and the credit available from the ministers' flexible friend&#8212;otherwise known as end-year flexibility&#8212;is bound to dry up. When that happens, the Executive will be reduced to having to fund any new initiatives from the 1 or 2 per cent of departmental budgets that it will be feasible to change or redistribute between expenditure programmes. That is not my analysis but that of Professor Arthur Midwinter in <place-holder colnum=\"2088\"/> the research that was commissioned by the Finance Committee.</p><p>How, then, will the Executive&#8212;although it might find itself in opposition by that time&#8212;respond to the Scottish public's overwhelming support here and now for increased powers for the Parliament? Will we still need to hang onto nurse for fear of something worse? Will the line be held by assuring us that, to secure our wealth, a political and economic union that has brought Scotland the lowest economic growth rate in Europe&#8212;a structural deficit of &#163;5 billion per annum, according to the minister&#8212;must be retained, despite the cost?

The minister stated that she would not be reviewing the current criteria for conditions that they<place-holder colnum=\"1301\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"should be easily recognisable, lifelong and life-threatening\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-05-15.S1W-15512.r0\">[<em>Official Report, Written Answers,</em> 15 May 2001; p 184.]</citation></p><p>I would argue that many people with a mental illness could be covered by those criteria and that exemption from prescription charges should be conferred on them. The Government surely must review the current list of medical conditions that are eligible for exemption. To my knowledge, the list has not changed since it was drawn up in 1968. Since then, much has changed in society, in the medical profession and in pharmaceuticals. In particular, much has changed in diagnoses and the number of new conditions has increased.</p><p>Costs of medication for people who have enduring mental illness can range from just &#163;2 per week to &#163;28 per week. I will cite the cases of two of my constituents. One suffers from clinical depression and has to pay &#163;31.90 every four months. Another suffers from manic depression and has to pay &#163;30.15 every two months. Both are in full-time employment and therefore do not qualify for free prescriptions. Those people already have the anxiety of their illness; they do not need the added pressure of financing their medication. Those examples clearly show a disincentive to take up work opportunities, which runs counter to the Executive's social inclusion agenda.</p><p>The Executive has assured the people of Scotland that mental health is one of the three key health priority areas. That has to be reflected in the levying of prescription charges. The Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 has been reviewed, and the subject of charging patients on long-term medication was highlighted as an area that should be reassessed. The minister has the opportunity to make changes and the power to extend exemptions on prescription charges. I urge him to take that opportunity and the necessary steps to extend exemptions.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13253642", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prescription Charges (Exemptions)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to endorse much of what Mr Davidson has said, and I would like to thank my colleague Brian Adam for securing this debate.

That critique is all the more powerful because of its underlying support for the broad thrust of policy, which has seen a significant shift in recent years towards the concept of inclusive education. There is broad <place-holder colnum=\"806\"/> support across the party political spectrum for the policy objective of maximising participation of all children in mainstream schools. As John McAllion and others expressed eloquently, the problems lie in implementation.</p><p>From my experience of trying to represent the views and concerns of parents, I confirm the fundamental truth of the committee's observations in paragraph 19 of the report, which says that the evidence suggests that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"success has been achieved through a combination of a strong commitment by individuals, flexibility and resources. The main barriers to inclusion are a lack of resources in mainstream schools, inadequate training of staff and negative attitudes.\"</p><p>I have seen for myself the strenuous efforts that have been made by the likes of South Ayrshire Council to achieve inclusiveness, especially for children with learning difficulties, who were previously stigmatised because of their attendance at special schools.</p><p>The learning bases that are provided in schools such as Dalmilling Primary School and Mainholm Academy in north Ayr are models of their kind. Notwithstanding some parents' sensitivities, nobody could fail to be impressed by the commitment of the teachers and staff in those schools and by how well all the pupils have adjusted and responded to the mainstreaming initiative. However, the system fails other children who have special educational needs, especially those who have social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. Much more attention must be given to meeting the needs of children who have chronic mental health problems.</p><p>In recent months I have been trying to assist parents of children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I must tell members that almost all those parents have a horror story to tell about the treatment of their child in school, from the child being forced to assume a dunce's position in class, to tales of bullying and scapegoating. There is a crying need for education and training for teachers and special needs assistants on how to cope and how to get the best out of pupils who have mental health problems and disorders. That training and education must be for all the teaching staff in a school. We must have much more in-service provision for teachers&#8212;it is not good enough merely to have one specialist person in the school who understands about ADHD, autism or other problems. I whole-heartedly endorse that recommendation in the committee report.</p><p>There can be no denying that reducing class sizes must also be on the agenda if we are talking about mainstreaming special needs kids. I also support strongly the report's recommendation of the need for health, education and social work <place-holder colnum=\"807\"/> professionals to work together to develop support packages for children and families. An holistic approach to treatment, education and family support is conspicuous by its absence in the cases that I have been dealing with.</p><p>For example, the administration of medication to children in schools leaves a lot to be desired. As John McAllion pointed out, and as members will be aware, many children who are diagnosed with ADHD are prescribed a class-A drug, Ritalin, to control their behaviour in school. However, many parents have found that there are no qualified personnel in schools to supervise the taking of the drug and, on occasion, children have been allowed to self-medicate. John McAllion found out how many children in Dundee are taking the drug, but Ayrshire and Arran Health Board does not keep a database of children who are currently being prescribed Ritalin. The system is wide open to accident and abuse.</p><p>I endorse the committee's recommendation that informal parent support networks ought to be facilitated and supported. Authorities like to deal with individuals, rather than with collective approaches by parents. At the moment, the system provides very little for parents. I spent last Friday evening with parents of children who suffer from ADHD, encouraging them to work collectively to establish a support network in Ayrshire. Thanks to the offer of help from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, that effort was successful. However, my point is that such a support network should have been up and running for years, long before now, acting as a spur to improve service provision and providing relief from the purgatory that David Mundell and other members have said that parents go through in dealing with the authorities.</p><p>I hope that the Enquire service and the pilot projects that are developing local mediation services to help parents and local authorities work together to resolve disputes will be successful.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#8212;or ADHD&#8212;is the most commonly known and was first identified nearly 100 years ago. Its symptoms appear as exaggerations of normal child development behaviour and cannot easily be controlled. Children with ADHD are chronically inattentive, impulsive, volatile, poorly co-ordinated and restless. The impact of such behaviour can be devastating and can disrupt the educational environment and the family home.</p><p>I am greatly concerned about the alarming rise in the number of children who are diagnosed with <place-holder colnum=\"429\"/> ADHD and about the widespread use of the drug Ritalin to control the behaviour of such children. Many parents and professionals have severe doubts about the suitability of the treatment. The short-term benefit in behaviour control is being bought at the expense of the health and well-being of the children in the longer term.</p><p>Members may have read a recent feature article in <em>The Herald </em>that highlighted the work of the late Professor Steven Baldwin. Professor Baldwin was deeply sceptical of the research that the pharmaceutical companies that produce Ritalin conducted, which proclaimed the drug safe and free from long-term, damaging side effects. His research, by contrast, led him to believe that the long-term effects of Ritalin use could include damage to the cardiovascular system, stunted growth, psychosis and violent or suicidal behaviour.</p><p>Studies into the causes of ADHD have indicated a genetic susceptibility that can be triggered by environmental factors. The most alarming evidence points to the use of anti-depressants and to alcohol abuse during pregnancy. Babies are born with an addiction and damage to the brain that results in ADHD. The latest survey shows that more than 90 per cent of benzodiazepine babies develop ADHD and that 70 per cent go on to suffer from other problems associated with chemical dependency. That raises questions about the appropriateness of treating a condition that arises from the use of prescribed chemical substances with another chemical substance whose long-term effects have not been sufficiently researched. In that context, the huge increase in the prescription of Ritalin&#8212;which, as I indicated, has undergone a tenfold rise in one health board area from 40 instances in 1995 to just under 400 in 2000&#8212;is deeply worrying.</p><p>I add my voice to the calls of the people whom I know have been making representations to ministers, such as the Scottish Association for Mental Health, for an urgent review of the practice of prescribing Ritalin. The application of the drug does not provide a cure. It suppresses and slows down a child's mental processes and it is a substitute for forms of treatment that will improve children's social and communication skills to help them integrate with their peers and, in due course, into adult society.</p><p>Best practice for the treatment of hyperactive disorders must be established as soon as possible to ensure that GPs, health authorities and education and social work departments work together in a systematic and coherent way to assist affected children, parents and teachers to cope with and combat the problems. Sadly, that is not happening in Scotland.</p><p>I am aware that the Scottish intercollegiate <place-holder colnum=\"430\"/> guidelines network will shortly issue guidelines for the treatment of hyperactive disorders; I hope that that will herald a more enlightened approach.</p><p>I would be grateful if the minister could give a commitment that Government funding of research into the use of Ritalin is one of its priorities.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13251302", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I shall focus on the rapidly growing problem of hyperkinetic disorders among children and the lack of a holistic approach to tackling the problem by health, education and family support services.

Community initiatives form a relatively small proportion of structural funds, but LEADER + is worth &#163;17 million to &#163;18 million over the next six years. My understanding is that Scotland is well behind the rest of the UK and that local action groups that are responsible for the design and implementation of development strategies for their areas have not yet been formed. The Scottish programme should have been with the European Commission in November 2000 and project proposals for the local action groups should have been lodged last month. Parliament is entitled to <place-holder colnum=\"1298\"/> an explanation today from the minister for the unconscionable delays in applying for LEADER + funding.</p><p>Rural communities such as Dumfries and Galloway have benefited greatly from predecessor programmes. I should not need to remind the minister of how valuable LEADER + projects would be in dealing with the economic crisis in rural Scotland, and in Dumfries and Galloway in particular. The previous LEADER programme in Dumfries and Galloway led to new investment of &#163;11.6 million in the local economy. Several hundred new jobs in tourism were created and farm diversification projects featured heavily.</p><p>I ask the deputy minister to give prominence to the issue in his closing remarks.

If the Scottish Executive intends that there should be a broad interpretation of section 6, it is conceivable that a Department of Social Security tribunal, for example, could merit advice by way of representation or civil legal aid. Because social security is a reserved matter, a discrepancy would be created within the UK, in that legal aid would be available in Scotland but not in England.

Legal aid used to be paid for on a time-and-line basis, but spiralling costs led to fixed payments. It has been argued that fixed payments do not necessarily ensure that the accused receives a fair trial and that they could therefore be challenged under article 6 of the ECHR. Proposed new subsection (3C) to section 33 of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 would allow the Scottish ministers to define the criteria on which a case could be judged to have exceptional circumstances and would therefore allow legal aid to be paid for on a time-and-line basis.</p><p>Whether a case is judged to be exceptional is left entirely to the discretion of the Scottish ministers.

If approved, it will result in the Leasehold Casualties (Scotland) Bill being passed. It is almost five years since the attention of the House of Commons was drawn to what was an obscure corner of Scots property law, in an adjournment debate that was responded to by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the former Minister of State, Scottish Office and the only member of that UK Government to have found a new lease of life in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>At that time, there was concern over the predicament of tenants in Boghead, in Lanarkshire. Out of the blue, they found themselves on the receiving end of demands for the payment of large sums&#8212;so-called casualties. They either had been badly advised by solicitors or had not been advised at all. Their situation seemed to be one of hardship and oppression, which needed to be addressed quickly through legislative change. Sadly, although the Scottish Law Commission was able to respond quickly to a reference by the Government of the time, the Westminster Parliament was not.</p><p>The journey that began with that 1996 debate has, however, reached an end today with what I hope will be the passing without demur of the bill. I hope that, although many tenants have had to find their own solutions to the problems that emerged in 1996, the bill will be of help to some and that the door has been firmly closed on any future oppressive use of leasehold casualties.</p><p>The retrospective effect of the bill is unusual, in that its key provisions have been backdated to 10 May last year&#8212;its date of introduction. That was intended to stop any last-minute attempt by landlords to claim casualties while the bill was being scrutinised by the Parliament. That has been effective, as we are not aware of any outstanding actions of that nature against individual tenants.</p><p>It has been a pleasure and a privilege to be the sponsor of the Leasehold Casualties (Scotland) Bill, and it is a tribute to the workings of the <place-holder colnum=\"408\"/> Parliament that it has, so far, had a smooth passage. I pay tribute to the efficient and careful way in which the former Justice and Home Affairs Committee went about its task. The committee took a balanced approach to the calling of evidence on the bill, and its stage 1 report supported its principles.</p><p>I also commend the Scottish Law Commission on its 1998 report, on which the bill was based. The commission looked into the issues carefully and produced sound recommendations. At stage 1, I explained the respects in which I departed on advice from the commission's recommendations. However, the commission did not lose interest in the bill but continued to give the Executive the benefit of its advice as to how the bill could be improved. As a result, at stage 2 on 14 February, seven Executive amendments were agreed by the Justice 1 Committee and incorporated in the bill. On that occasion, Iain Gray explained fully the purpose of the amendments. Some of them had been suggested by the Scottish Law Commission on the basis of research that it had carried out in preparation for the review of residential long leases. The amendments will ensure that the bill covers every tenant who should be covered. They also clarify that irritancy under common law, and thereby threat of eviction, will be abolished with retrospective effect, so back-door actions by landlords trying to get round the legislation will not succeed.</p><p>No more amendments have been lodged and the bill is ready to be approved by the Scottish Parliament and to pass into law. This is a significant achievement for the Scottish Parliament. Although it is not the first member's bill to pass into law, it is a further affirmation of the strength of our standing orders and parliamentary procedures that a bill such as this can be set in motion by a member on his or her own initiative.</p><p>I have, of course, benefited from the support of the Executive throughout the process. I am grateful to the minister and his officials for the way in which they made available their advice and their time. I am also grateful to members generally for their support and co-operation during what has been something of an adventure for me and for the Justice 1 Committee, which has not previously taken a member's bill through to a conclusion.

It is clear that, in a situation where practitioners are stressed, the propensity to misdiagnose or to be less sympathetic to patients who are suffering from mental health problems is likely to increase.</p><p>The Millan report, which was commissioned to review mental health legislation in Scotland, received evidence from professionals and from NHS users and their families that mental health services are often overstretched and inadequate. The report also states that the proper operation of mental health legislation is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"clearly predicated on the provision of effective and responsive mental health services.\"</p><p>There is plenty of evidence that there are problems with access to urgent help through primary care services for mentally ill people. Carers in particular may not have the credibility with GPs to get over how urgent that need is. In a recent survey by the National Schizophrenia <place-holder colnum=\"107\"/> Fellowship, one carer related:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I phoned the GP to say that my son was suicidal and was told that this was only attention-seeking behaviour. He tried to commit suicide that same evening.\"</p><p>Another stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The GP refused to come. We had no car. Over the phone, the doctor told my husband that my son did not need to take medication.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, <i>The Herald</i> reported a case in Glasgow in which a GP was found by the General Medical Council to be guilty of serious professional misconduct by refusing to see a psychotic woman in her home. Unfortunately, such experiences are far from uncommon for families, particularly those who have to deal with disturbed adult patients who do not believe that there is anything wrong with them.</p><p>The answer to such problems must lie with the development of primary care teams so that, as has been suggested this morning, they include many more skilled nurses. Community psychiatric nurses are worth their weight in gold.</p><p>That brings me to the subject of resources. An article in this week's <i>The Health Service Journal</i> points out:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"90% of patients' problems are dealt with entirely within primary care and this is increasing, yet it receives less than 10% of the NHS budget. We are at a political crossroads. There is a pressing need for real change and improvement in the Scottish Executive's support for primary care.\"</p><p>I emphasise that that is particularly true for mental health services. Although mental health is one of the three clinical priorities, mental health services funding has traditionally suffered leakage to other less stigmatised health areas. There is a fear that, with frameworks for cancer and cardiac care coming on stream, history will repeat itself. I appeal to the minister not to allow that to happen.</p><p>Those who provide mental health services within the NHS are committed to change.

Not only that, but the last of the work force are not even to be given the redundancy packages that they are due.</p><p>I will make three points. First, the fact that closure had been in the pipeline since March last year demonstrates that Cathelco had always intended to shut the yard. Secondly, at the time of the original takeover, the yard was in a financially viable position and still had a potentially lucrative future in Ayrshire. Thirdly, Cathelco was well aware of the financial implications of any redundancy measures.</p><p>As I said, Cathelco never had any intention of saving the shipyard. Apparently there was a buyer at the table in August 2000, but Cathelco actively discouraged him from pushing for a sale. A month before the closure, the website was replaced with one advertising and serving Cathelco's property division. Why? Because Cathelco wanted the land for other purposes. Cathelco made a submission to South Ayrshire Council for the land covered by Ailsa-Troon to be rezoned for housing and leisure. The document was compiled, I believe, in March 2000. Some in the council were aware of what was happening long before Cathelco announced publicly its plan to close the yard.</p><p>In its submission, Cathelco states that one of the reasons for the shipyard's closure was that the yard was unprofitable. John Scott has shown how the view of the company changed over a short space of time from the 1990 election campaign, when the company said&#8212;I was there&#8212;that everything was absolutely wonderful. In reality, Cathelco was planning hotels, leisure facilities, restaurants, pubs, houses and marina facilities months before the workers were aware that they were soon to be jobless.</p><p>What about the workers? All but 16 of them were given a redundancy settlement, which cost Cathelco &#163;520,000. The final 16 were owed &#163;300,000, which Cathelco said that it could not afford to pay and was not an issue because</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a significant number of the final 16 employees have been successful in getting new jobs.\"</p><p>Apart from the fact that that is not the issue, I wonder what a significant number is to these people.</p><p>The final 16 workers were the most loyal&#8212;they <place-holder colnum=\"1190\"/> had been there the longest and were the most expensive to make redundant. When they were asked to stay on, Cathelco knew that it would not have enough money to pay them the redundancy money that it owed&#8212;it knew that almost 10 months earlier. This is a disgrace.

It is even more disappointing that the concept of an endowment foundation, as laid out by Cubie, has been hijacked and transmogrified into a graduate tax scheme, crudely camouflaged by the endowment label.</p><p>Cubie envisaged a charitable foundation that would allow civic Scotland to contribute to the future support of those who enter higher education. Only graduates whose income rose to more than &#163;25,000 would be required to contribute to the fund, with a total contribution of around &#163;3,000. What the Executive has come up with is a completely different animal. It is, in effect, a scheme to collect tuition fees retrospectively. As the NUS has pointed out, that departs from any notion of financial benefit from higher education and the money will be payable on graduation by those who are liable.</p><p>I question the efficiency of the graduate tax. It is clear that straight abolition of tuition fees would have an annual cost of only some &#163;25 million, taking into account savings that were accrued from reducing parental and spouse contributions to fees and living costs, and the consequent reduction in loans. The amount that must be raised from graduates is estimated at &#163;30 million per annum&#8212;proof positive that tuition fees live on as graduate taxes. However, the cost to the Executive of making loans to cover graduate taxes is likely to be in the region of &#163;15 million. In other words, the cost to the Executive of collecting &#163;2,000 in graduate tax will be a massive &#163;1,000, not including administrative costs. I put it to the chamber that that is an absurd arrangement and that the Liberal Democrats have been sold a pup by their coalition partners. Then again, the Liberal Democrats are more adept at achieving face-saving compromises than they are at sticking to the principle of free access to education for all.</p><p>I make a plea with regard to support for mature students. When it comes to laying out consequent regulations, we must ensure that national guidelines are married to local flexibility to meet the needs of mature students.

Both the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Office before it demonstrated a lack of vision and understanding by failing to recognise the economic potential of the Loch Ryan corridor and the link with Ireland.</p><p>To be frank, there can be no excuse for the failure to invest sufficiently in the A75, which links the ferry ports with the UK motorway network. In 1993, the A75 was designated as part of the trans-European network, linking Northern Ireland with the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich. In 1995, it was included as part of the Ireland-UK-Benelux road link, which is one of the Essen 14 European Council priority projects.</p><p>By contrast, the route action plan proposals are severely limited: the plan is an unambitious, piecemeal development that is far from being the step change that is required to free up the flow of traffic and reduce journey times.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the A75 has attracted Government investment of only &#163;110 million, compared with the &#163;730 million that has been spent on upgrading to dual carriageway status the A55 from Holyhead, with its ferry link to Dublin, in north Wales. I suspect that the average journey time between Stranraer and Gretna has barely improved in that time, while average journey times on the Bangor to Chester section of the A55 have reduced from five hours in 1965 to less than 90 minutes today. The private sector has shown far <place-holder colnum=\"375\"/> more faith in the Stranraer ferry ports and their economic potential than have successive UK Governments. In the past four years alone, Stena Link has invested &#163;90 million in its Stranraer to Belfast route and it employs 600 people in Dumfries and Galloway.</p><p>Historically, the north channel route between Northern Ireland and Scotland had a competitive advantage over the Dublin to Holyhead route as the sea journey time is shorter, but that advantage is rapidly eroding because of the lack of investment in road links to Stranraer. In that context, it is worth mentioning that the A77, which is the main link to central Scotland from Stranraer, also requires significant upgrading, particularly the single carriageway section that lies south of Ayr. That road has become notorious for its slow journey times, high accident rate and lack of bypasses for communities such as Maybole and Girvan.</p><p>From the Irish perspective, fast transport communications with Europe are vital for the maintenance of the Republic's economic success story.

The SLC also said that even if no hardship or distress had been caused to existing tenants, there was still a strong case for abolishing leasehold casualties as soon as possible. The bill does that job.</p><p>I will address some of the points raised in the debate. In responding to Phil Gallie on section 4, I indicated that if the tenant did not pay within five years of a notice, the obligation to pay would fly off. That is the case only when the landlord takes no enforcement action to enforce the debt within the five-year period, as both Alasdair Morgan and Christine Grahame pointed out.</p><p>Euan Robson praised the SPICe paper, which was produced for the benefit of members and others who were trying to understand the issues. I heartily concur with his estimate of it. I do not know whether I am allowed to mention Fiona Killen as the author of that excellent paper.</p><p>Pauline McNeill, my sponsor, mentioned the ruthlessness of landlords in pursuing people for these purposes. She commented on the fact that Mr Hamilton had&#8212;as it were&#8212;got lucky in finding the clauses that he could exploit. Although Mr Hamilton's behaviour was entirely legal, it was wholly unjust and immoral. Christine Grahame's use of the sobriquet \"raiders of the lost titles\" is inappropriately romantic, which is why I have not employed it. I can assure members that residents of Boghead in Lanarkshire who have suffered at his hands have a few more couthie and accurate epithets for Mr Hamilton.</p><p>Scott Barrie and Alasdair Morgan said that the legislation would cover up for sloppy solicitors. Indeed, Mr Hamilton himself justified his actions by indicating that tenants could and should sue their solicitors to recover their expenses after having been misdirected. However, Gordon Jackson's eloquent speech totally demolished that argument.</p><p>As most of the other arguments have been well rehearsed, and given the fact that my opening speech lasted 20 minutes, I will now wind up. Although leasehold casualties affect a relatively small number of people in Scotland, they have undoubtedly been used to oppressive effect.

Members will be aware that the feudal system will be abolished in due course, following the passing of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000. However, there are pockets of non-feudal tenure in various parts of the country. Leasehold tenure&#8212;although rare in Scotland in comparison with the situation south of the border&#8212;is quite common in parts of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Clackmannan. Instead of feuing building plots, landowners in those areas would let vacant land under very long leases, sometimes for as long as 999 years. That might have been done because there were prohibitions on feuing or for other reasons. Such long leases of residential property are now prohibited, following the passing of the Land Tenure Reform (Scotland) Act 1974. However, to all intents and purposes, <place-holder colnum=\"17\"/> those leases were the equivalent of a feudal grant and legal practitioners in the relevant areas have been, for practical conveyancing purposes, treating those long leases as feudal property.</p><p>At this point, I should make it clear that the bill would affect only one aspect of leasehold tenure: leasehold casualties. The Scottish Law Commission will review the law relating to residential long leases more generally as part of its sixth programme and will publish a discussion paper in due course. I know that my colleague Fergus Ewing is interested in such matters. I hope that the commission's final report will lead to a more wide-ranging bill on residential long leases, which will reform the law on that form of tenure. It is possible, however, to deal with leasehold casualties ahead of more general reform because the commission has already reviewed that subject, and provided in its 1998 report a bill which I have been able to adapt.</p><p>A leasehold casualty is a payment, additional to rent, that a tenant must pay to a landlord if a lease so stipulates. Casualties can be, for example, payments based on one year's net rental value of a property, which fall to be paid upon the entry of a new tenant. They can also be duplicands, which are extra ground rent payments payable typically every 19 years. While some casualties are low, say less than &#163;2 a year, and for that reason may not be worth collecting by the landlord, leasehold casualties based on the annual rental value of a property may be substantial, and it is that sort of casualty that has been responsible for the distress caused to tenants in certain areas.</p><p>It is worth noting that it also used to be possible for feudal superiors to impose equivalent feudal casualties on feudal properties. Feudal casualties were abolished by the Feudal Casualties (Scotland) Act 1914, which contained provisions to allow the Court of Session, if it wished, to apply the effect of the legislation to leasehold casualties by passing an act of sederunt. Some years ago, the Law Society of Scotland and the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland made a joint approach to the Lord President of the Court of Session to ask him to make such an act. However, the Lord President of the day took the view that the matter was too controversial to be dealt with by an act of sederunt, and should be dealt with by primary legislation. That moment has finally arrived.</p><p>I mentioned already that, until recently, leasehold casualties have largely remained dormant and the payments uncollected. Last century, the landlord with the largest leasehold interest was the former National Coal Board, which acquired the landlord interest upon nationalisation. The cost of collecting lots of fairly nominal casualties would have far exceeded the income, so no casualties were collected. That, and <place-holder colnum=\"18\"/> the fact that leasehold titles, and therefore leasehold casualties, are uncommon except in areas such as Lanarkshire, and are couched in unfamiliar terms, led to leasehold casualties being overlooked by some solicitors when they were advising clients who were in the process of purchasing properties held under very long leases.</p><p>However, over time, and particularly when the nationalised industries came to sell off non-core activities, estates including landlord interests in leasehold properties were acquired by land speculators. Although they may have been unaware of the existence of leasehold casualties at the outset, close examination of the titles alerted some new landlords, or their legal advisers, to the potential for financial gain offered by the long-neglected clauses. That applied in particular to casualties based on annual rental value.</p><p>In the mid-1990s, some incoming buyers&#8212;who, remember, become tenants under a long lease&#8212;particularly in Lanarkshire, were asked to pay an unexpected sum, which in some cases amounted to several thousand pounds. In one case, an individual payment in excess of &#163;20,000 was demanded. In addition, landlords may succeed in attempts to show that incoming tenants are liable for past unclaimed casualties against previous tenants.</p><p>In pursuing claims for outstanding leasehold casualties, some landlords have taken legal proceedings against tenants for present or accumulated casualties. If the tenant had not been advised about the casualties at the time of purchase, he might have a negligence claim against the solicitor who advised him when he acquired the property. Of course, such insurance claims are not settled quickly. The solicitor would enter into negotiations with his insurers, and the tenant against whom the claim of casualties had been made would inevitably suffer stress and worry until the matter was settled.</p><p>Although the issue has died down at present, it could resurface at any time, since the sale of any house held under a long lease and which is subject to a casualty clause might provoke a claim from a landlord against the incoming tenant, in other words, the new owner. We simply do not know whether the potential for commercial gain from leasehold casualties has been exhausted. Unless the bill is passed, it is possible that further hardship will occur.</p><p>The matter was raised in the Westminster Parliament as long ago as November 1996 in an adjournment debate that was instigated by Jimmy Hood, the member of Parliament for Clydesdale. The Scottish Law Commission was not due to consider the problems associated with residential long leases until it had completed its work on the <place-holder colnum=\"19\"/> abolition of the feudal system. In view of the hardship that was being caused to tenants, the Secretary of State for Scotland in February 1997 asked the commission to accept a reference</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to consider the law on leasehold casualties and advise on possible reforms\".</p><p>The commission published its report in April 1998. I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the commission not only for the care and diligence that it took in formulating its recommendations, but for the speed with which it did that. In little more than a year, the commission issued a discussion paper and analysed the responses from a wide cross-section of interested parties, including landlords, before producing a carefully considered final report. Given the speed with which the commission dealt with the matter, it is greatly to be regretted that the report has not been implemented by legislation before now. That is another example of how difficult it was to have purely Scottish legislation dealt with in the Westminster Parliament.</p><p>The commission recommended that leasehold casualties should be abolished and provided a draft bill to give effect to that basic recommendation. The bill that is before Parliament differs from the original bill on three main aspects.</p><p>First, the commission proposed that rental value casualties, which yield the largest sums to landlords and have therefore caused tenants the greatest distress, should be abolished without compensation to landlords. Tenants will have to pay compensation to landlords for the abolition of all casualties other than rental value casualties, but only if landlords request it by a written notice that is given no later than one year after the abolition date. The compensation sums are likely to be small and not worth seeking in most cases.</p><p>The commission believed that rental value casualties should be treated differently because they are in the nature of a tax or charge by the landlord on the value of buildings that the tenants had built, paid for, maintained and improved themselves, rather than on the rental value of the ground alone. Such casualties allow the landlord to benefit from a value that derives from the tenants' expenditure over the years, when the landlord has provided only the ground. I have been advised that the bill would be less open to challenge if it included some provision for compensation for the loss of rental value casualties. The relevant case law makes it clear that compensation need not be proportionate, so my bill provides compensation only on the basis of the ground rent.</p><p>The second change to the commission's bill will reduce the window of opportunity for further exploitation of the existing law. The commission <place-holder colnum=\"20\"/> proposed that irritancy provisions in pre-1914 leases, which allow the landlord to repossess a property for unpaid casualties and which cause the main difficulty, should be void. It also proposed that current tenants should cease to be liable for casualties that were due in the past from previous tenants. It was proposed that those provisions should come into effect on royal assent and apply to any court action that had been commenced but not concluded by that date. That would have meant that landlords could still pursue irritancy actions effectively, provided that they obtained final decrees before the bill received royal assent, and that they could seek to evict tenants who were unable or unwilling to pay casualty payments. However, the bill that I have introduced has been drafted so that those provisions will come into effect from its date of introduction, which was 10 May 2000. Irritancy clauses will be void from that date and landlords will be unable to claim casualties from current tenants that were due from previous tenants.</p><p>The third change to the commission's draft bill concerns claims for indemnity against the Keeper of the Registers. It would be wrong if someone who was entitled to indemnification by the keeper for mistakes in the Land Register of Scotland lost that entitlement as a result of the bill or any other legislation. Regrettably, it has happened that clauses in leases containing obligations to pay leasehold casualty payments have been erroneously omitted when some properties have been registered in the Land Register. That may have been because they were mistaken for feudal casualties, which, as I mentioned, were abolished in 1914.</p><p>It is not possible, under the relevant legislation, to rectify the register to the prejudice of the proprietor in possession&#8212;in other words, the tenant&#8212;so the keeper becomes liable to a claim from the landlord, since such an obligation is only enforceable if it is on the face of the register. If it is omitted, the landlord is no longer able to enforce the casualty. The saving in the bill will apply to claims for indemnity in respect of omitted leasehold casualties commenced but not finally disposed of before the date of abolition.</p><p>It might be helpful if I briefly run through the provisions in the bill.</p><p>Section 1 of the bill will abolish leasehold casualties automatically from the date of introduction of the bill, 10 May last year. That will not affect arrears of casualties that have fallen due before the introduction of the bill. Relevant leases are defined as those granted before 1 September 1974, for a period of not less than 300 years. That avoids inadvertent application to modern commercial leases.</p><p>Under section 2, compensation will be payable <place-holder colnum=\"21\"/> in respect of all casualties abolished by the bill, but will only be due if requested by the landlord by a written notice not later than one year after the date on which the bill receives royal assent. The compensation will be payable by the person who is the tenant at the date on which the bill is introduced. The notice must stipulate the amount of compensation as calculated by the landlord.</p><p>Section 3 sets out the rules for calculating the compensation payable by tenants. The guiding principle is that, except in the case of rental value casualties, the landlord should be awarded a sum of money that, if invested, would have yielded the same amount at the due date. An appropriate rate of interest has been assumed. It is therefore the intention to award full compensation to landlords. However, in reality most casualties yield little return, so in most cases the compensation will be very low and in many cases it will not be worth claiming. The level will depend on the amount of the casualty and the length of time the landlord would have to wait to receive it.</p><p>Schedules 1 and 2 to the bill contain, respectively, a table of multipliers and a method for calculating the multiplier in cases involving casualties of fixed amount payable at fixed and regular intervals. Other rules are stipulated for other kinds of casualties. In relation to rental value casualties, section 3 makes it clear that the landlord will be compensated for the casualties based on the ground rent, without taking account of buildings or improvements that the tenant or his predecessors may have carried out on the ground.</p><p>Under section 4 of the bill, the obligation to pay compensation will prescribe after five years, beginning with the date of the notice served by the landlord.</p><p>Section 5 abolishes the power of a landlord to terminate a lease by virtue of an irritancy clause triggered by the tenant failing to comply with any provision of the lease.</p>", "hdate": "2001-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13242079", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Leasehold Casualties (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to move the motion to approve the general principles of the Leasehold Casualties (Scotland) Bill.

I also mention Pat Whyte of Majella, who could not make it this evening.</p><p>Not long after I was elected last year, I met Margaret Paton and became interested in her work for carers. Trust: A Carers Connection has been working with mental health carers in Ayrshire for many years and is one of the few organisations for carers of people with a mental illness. Predictably, given the lack of public support for carers of the mentally ill, it is a voluntary self-help group that depends entirely on the commitment and determination of Margaret and others to keep going.</p><p>I lodged this motion in October because I believe that the rights and needs of mental health carers are not adequately addressed. I hope that the debate will highlight both the significant differences between carers of the mentally ill and other carers, and the fact that those differences are not catered for.</p><p>Carers and caring issues have a high profile in the Scottish Parliament. We have held debates on carers and a cross-party group has been set up as a forum for debate on caring. However, everything has been directed at caring in general, and general strategies that are aimed at all carers tend inadvertently to discriminate against and neglect mental health carers. Why should that be the case?</p><p>First, the stigma attached to mental illness is an <place-holder colnum=\"466\"/> enormous barrier to overcome. It prevents some carers from seeking help, while many others remain hidden, trying to cope in isolation. Other carers do not usually share that experience. A member of Trust: A Carers Connection said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"People who have experienced mental health problems know what it is like to suffer pain, but their families suffer the hidden pain&#8212;not being able to speak about it to anyone, no-one to listen to their problems. The Carers' group has helped me to cope with these problems, giving me support and hope for the future.\"</p><p>Most disabilities carry some form of stigma. However, the stigma that is attached to mental illness makes it one of the great taboos of modern life. Carers need to know where they can go for support from those who have had personal experience of caring in a mental illness situation. Otherwise, there is every possibility that they will keep their situation a secret, with isolation the result.</p><p>Secondly, carers of people with serious mental health problems often do not identify themselves as carers. A project explicitly for mental health carers would help to identify hidden carers, would assist in the identification of young carers and/or family members, and would promote the recognition of the needs of carers in mental health services.</p><p>Thirdly, carers are often the first to notice a change in the behaviour of the person for whom they care. Indeed, they may be the only person to recognise the development of a mental health problem in the first place. Those carers are not trained; they are thrown in at the deep end with little or no assistance to care for someone who has a condition about which they may know little.</p><p>Mental illness is not a consistent condition like that suffered by someone with a physical disability. Mental illness can fluctuate, with people becoming ill quickly and unpredictably. It can manifest itself in different ways, with the person becoming aggressive or withdrawn. It is intensely emotionally demanding of the carer, who may not know the best way to react to and deal with changing behaviour. At such times, it is important to know how best to respond&#8212;to be caring, calm and non-emotional&#8212;and to be supported in doing so. It is important for carers to be able to access expertise and understanding. Often, such support can be given effectively by other mental health carers as well as by professionals.</p><p>Many welcome developments have taken place in caring and mental health, but not in mental health caring. The national carers strategy is not relevant to mental health carers. The Millan committee, which is reviewing the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, is mainly patient centred. I am concerned that the development of a system of nominated people, as recommended in the second <place-holder colnum=\"467\"/> draft of the Millan committee's report, may lead to difficulties for the carer if the nominated person is different from the carer, who is often the nearest relative.</p><p>It is vital to ensure that carers' rights are balanced against those of the nominated person. For example, the professional care team should inform and consult the carer as well as the nominated person&#8212;if they are different&#8212;during a compulsory assessment and before discharge from hospital or variations to a community care plan. If those rights were provided for in new legislation, that would be an important step forward in ensuring better support for the carer and a more accurate view of the patient's situation and likely support needs. In some cases, it could also make things safer for the carers.</p><p>The nub of the problem faced by carers of people with mental health problems is lack of information. In carers' experience, patient confidentiality is often used as an excuse not to share information with or explain consent to those who care for people with mental health problems. That unacceptable practice can leave the carer under-informed, marginalised and even at risk. The challenge for this Parliament is to ensure that the needs of mental health carers are properly addressed and, in particular, that carers' rights to information and to be involved in decisions that affect them and those they care for are properly recognised in law.</p><p>One in four adults will suffer from mental ill health during their lives. They will for the most part be cared for by friends and family, saving the taxpayer some &#163;280 million a year. Service users and carers deserve our attention and a much better deal.

I understand that some members of the Local Government Committee favoured the option of a national standards commission&#8212;as established under the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000&#8212;as the investigatory authority for complaints against MSPs. Questions arose about why councillors and MSPs should not face the same regulatory regime and why MSPs should be allowed self-regulation through the Standards Committee of the Parliament, while councillors are not allowed such self-regulation. Clearly, in asking that last question, the key point&#8212;that the Scotland Act 1998 set the standards regime for the Parliament&#8212;was missed.</p><p>In the Standards Committee's view, the proposal that Parliament should appoint an independent standards commissioner&#8212;who would be invested with statutory powers to conduct his or her duties thoroughly and without fear or favour&#8212;is a far superior solution to that which would be provided <place-holder colnum=\"312\"/> by a national standards commission that was appointed by the Executive. Above all else, such an appointment should inspire public confidence in the conduct of our affairs and should enhance the reputation of the Parliament.</p><p>On investigation and reporting, members will note that the Standards Committee recommends a more open procedure than that which has been adopted by the Westminster Parliament, where all meetings and hearings of the Standards and Privileges Committee are held in private. Members should consider the damage that would have been done to the Scottish Parliament's reputation if the Standards Committee had conducted its lobbygate inquiry in such a fashion. Although it is appropriate that the standards commissioner should conduct investigations in private&#8212;not least to protect the reputations of members who are subjected to malicious or unwarranted complaints&#8212;it is surely right that, once it has been established that there is a case to answer, an open and public procedure should be adopted as the norm by the Standards Committee. It is also right that members who are found by the committee to be in breach of the MSPs' code of conduct to the extent that sanctions must be applied, should have a right of appeal.</p><p>Parliament is the most appropriate locus for consideration of the committee's report on a breach of the code of conduct.

The SNP believes that the measures that have been announced should signify not the end but a new beginning to the process of financial reform of local government.</p><p>The soundness of that view was confirmed as recently as Monday of this week when my colleagues and I on the Finance Committee took evidence from Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council. Both councils confirmed that the severity of the squeeze on their spending was a direct consequence of the tight constraints put on their funding by central Government. The assumption that efficiencies would pay for increased salary costs, and the growing use of hypothecation, the ring fencing of funds and special grants for special purposes have resulted in real and significant cuts in services. Revenue spending plans by Aberdeen City Council have been reduced by &#163;75 million over the past five years; in Aberdeenshire Council, the figure is &#163;57 million. That scenario has been replicated in many local authorities across Scotland. Invariably, repairs and maintenance programmes have borne the brunt of the cuts, resulting in an all-too-evident deterioration in our schools and roads.</p><p>Efficiency savings have proved to be a euphemism for redundancies&#8212;more than 13,000 jobs have been lost over the past few years. Local <place-holder colnum=\"260\"/> government has had its hands tied because of the restrictive regime that has been imposed by central Government. Until the mid-1980s, a reduction in central Government support could realistically be compensated for by shifting the burden on to local taxpayers. When 50 per cent of local government funding came from the local tax base, a 1 per cent cut in central Government support could be repaired by a 2 per cent rise in rates. Today, when less than 20 per cent of local government funding is raised locally, excessive hikes in council tax are required to compensate for reductions in central Government support. Council taxes have shot up by no less than 25 per cent across Scotland since Labour came to power three years ago. The so-called gearing effect has profoundly debilitated councils' ability to respond to local needs, which, together with expenditure guidelines and capping limits, means that local administrations are effectively hamstrung.</p><p>Notwithstanding the relaxation of the regime that the minister has announced, the case for an independent and comprehensive review of local government finance is overwhelming. In the absence of such a review, the Local Government Committee is to be congratulated on taking on its own inquiry.</p><p>I do not doubt Angus MacKay's sincerity in his desire to stabilise and improve the financial settlement for local government. However, he is in grave danger of damaging his credibility if he does not deliver on statements such as the one that he made to the Local Government Committee.

However, much of that will be eaten up by wage and salary rises unless the minister intends to find more money to fund the McCrone proposals.</p><p>What about new burdens? How much is the national concessionary fares scheme going to cost? I know that the minister does not know the answer, because the Executive has commissioned consultants to find it out. Let us say that a reasonable guess would be that it would cost the same again as local authorities have spent on their concessionary fares schemes over the past three years&#8212;&#163;126 million. That is the cost of only one burden, but it would eat up more than 10 per cent of the new money.</p><p>I urge the minister to recognise that the current system for financing local government is unsustainable in the long term.

The surreptitious transfer of the &#163;44 million that was accumulated by NHS trusts under the internal market system out of the NHS to facilitate a wholesale housing stock transfer in Glasgow is a case in point. Throwing up the smokescreen of Treasury rules to try to obscure a political fix merely served to compound a blatant error of judgment.</p><p>I am sure that the minister will acknowledge the fact that the NHS needs every penny it can get. If that &#163;44 million was available only for debt repayment, the sensible course of action would have been to deal with the current debt problems of the NHS trusts. The situation in Tayside, for example, has been highlighted in this Parliament.</p><p>Decisions such as the transfer have a knock-on effect, frustrating policy aims and objectives and throwing the whole process of accountability into disarray. The Executive has made much of its initiative to tackle inequality in the provision of <place-holder colnum=\"1524\"/> health care through its implementation of the Arbuthnott report recommendations. Reallocating NHS resources among health boards to ensure that the impact of social exclusion and the needs of deprived and rural areas are fully addressed throughout the country is a laudable aim.</p><p>Margaret Jamieson illustrated, however, how Ayrshire and Arran Health Board has thwarted the Executive's intentions. The unpalatable truth is that the health board will get away with its decision&#8212;as it has with others, such as its suspension of the further development of mental health services despite that being one of the three NHS clinical priority areas&#8212;because of the absence of appropriate local accountability mechanisms and a lack of political will, on the part of the Executive, to direct health boards. I am not convinced by anything the minister has said this morning that such fundamental flaws in the system are going to be tackled effectively.</p><p>There appears to be a complete lack of appreciation on the part of the coalition parties and others in this Parliament of the big picture of health spending. The tightening grip of the Barnett squeeze on the NHS in Scotland is a major threat that is looming on the horizon. At the moment, the health service in Scotland receives funding that is roughly 20 per cent higher per head than that which is received by its English counterpart, but the Barnett formula is designed to eliminate that differential.</p><p>The latest academic research suggests that a convergence with the spending per head in England will proceed rapidly and that, in the next few years, the per capita spending differential will dip below 15 per cent. The differential was established in the 1970s as what was required to meet the greater level of need in Scotland due to the higher incidence of social deprivation and the sparsity of the population. When convergence happens, the chickens will come home to roost with a vengeance in this Parliament, exposing the inadequacy of the devolution settlement. The problems that are associated with NHS governance and accountability will be compounded manyfold.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13237966", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I shall focus on financial accountability and the transparency of information on health expenditure nationally and locally.

In that context, I am deeply disturbed that the document makes no mention of the groundbreaking project to establish a purpose-built school of music and recording technology&#8212;or SMART&#8212;in Ayr.</p><p>SMART will be a world-class centre of excellence for popular music. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, it will provide a creative environment unique in Scotland and Europe offering the highest-quality professional training to talented people and combining music performance, recording technology and music business management in a co-ordinated structure.</p><p>The school will provide a curriculum of vocational courses at further and higher education levels relevant to the needs of the popular music industry. Furthermore, it will place Scotland and Scottish students at the forefront of a rapidly expanding industry which in UK terms is worth &#163;3.6 billion a year, accounts for 7.2 per cent of the world market and employs more than 100,000 people. It will do so because it will meet the critical needs of the industry as identified by the creative industry task force set up by Chris Smith.</p><p>Those needs are, first, to provide business support and guidance for the many small independent companies on which the industry relies; and, secondly, to ensure that musicians and others in the industry receive the training that they require. The new technologies coming rapidly to the fore mean that such needs are expanding just as rapidly.</p><p>The potential for Scotland of the SMART project has been widely recognised. In June, Bob Crawford, the chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, wrote to assure me that SMART was<place-holder colnum=\"1374\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"already positioned as a key infrastructure project for Ayrshire and Scotland in our creative industries cluster action plan\".</p><p>Scottish Enterprise is a key investor in the project, along with South Ayrshire Council, the University of Paisley and Ayr College. Why has there been no commitment from the Scottish Executive? Could it be that the Executive is embarrassed by its failure to assist with the capital funding of the project, and that SMART is an illustration of how the current devolution settlement cannot ensure an effective national support framework for culture? I refer again to Bob Crawford's letter, in which he states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I share your concerns at the delay in securing capital funding for this exciting project . . . despite the SMART building design and educational model being commended as innovative developments . . . the resulting deferral by the Scottish Arts Council of the partnerships capital funding application meant we also lost the opportunity to secure capital funding last year from Strathclyde European partnership.\"</p><p>The cold fact is that lottery funds that are available to the Scottish Arts Council for distribution to arts capital projects have been cut back so drastically that the SAC is no longer in a position to core-fund major capital projects. That is in sharp contrast to the position in England, where massive amounts of lottery funding continue to be poured in. They include &#163;25 million for the South Bank centre in London and &#163;11 million for a national museum of music in Sheffield. The Arts Council has set aside a staggering &#163;43 million for a regional arts centre in Gateshead. By comparison, Scotland is on starvation rations, with only &#163;9.8 million in lottery funds available to the Scottish Arts Council for distribution to capital projects this year.</p><p>The minister must address that inequality of funding as a matter of priority. In particular, he must challenge the totally unfair and deeply biased practice of top-slicing funds available to the arts for so-called national projects, invariably to the benefit of England, and London in particular. As long as the purse strings of this Parliament are held in London, ambitions will be curbed and opportunities denied to our people. That is nowhere more evident than in the creative arts and industry.</p><p>I hope that the minister and the Executive have the courage to confront their Westminster counterparts on this issue.

It must examine performance in relation to the targets that have been set by the Executive and it should explain where Scotland gets its funding from.</p><p> I now come to criticisms from individual committees, specifically from the Local Government Committee, which is undertaking a review of council finance. Councils speak with one voice on self-financing pay awards. Moreover, both the Local Government Committee and the Finance Committee agree that we cannot continue <place-holder colnum=\"810\"/> to take money from councils just because the Government refuses to accept that public sector pay rises must take account of inflation. The Minister for Finance has claimed that freezing the money that is available for pay will lead to efficiency savings. If we accept that premise, does the minister expect us to accept that higher inflation rates will lead to a quicker drive to efficiency? To paraphrase Rosemary McKenna, the former president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, that is the politics of the madhouse.</p><p>The Executive must make Scotland's accounts transparent&#8212;they are far from transparent now&#8212;and the Minister for Finance must assure us that the farce of self-financing pay awards and the consequent job cuts at the local level will be ended.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13232014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Time for Reflection: Budget Process 2000- 02: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The level I figures are not in the document. \"Serving Scotland's Needs\" includes a comprehensive table of level I figures from the outset, in cash and real terms.

The document sets out the ethos of care in the community&#8212;that people should be cared for in their own homes wherever possible. I am sure that all members in the chamber agree with that sentiment. The problem is that the resources necessary to provide community care have never been made available since the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 came into force.

I welcome the bill and I congratulate the Local Government Committee on its thorough scrutiny of it at stage 1. The committee's report raises a number of interesting questions, one or two of which I will address today.</p><p>The bill provides for the establishment of a <place-holder colnum=\"114\"/> national code of conduct by the Executive in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I appreciate the input of local government into the bill and I cannot overstate the importance of ensuring that elected members in local government are primarily responsible for drafting the code. The ownership of a code of conduct by councillors is crucial to its success, inspiring adherence to its letter and spirit.</p><p>The bill should be viewed in the context of a partnership between the Parliament and local authorities, with this chamber having due respect for the work of democratically elected councillors throughout the country. The bill encourages councils to assist their members in achieving high standards in public life, and it is my firm belief that the work that some councils have already undertaken in establishing their own standards committees could be beneficially applied across the country and should be promoted.</p><p>Partnership should not be merely a one-way street. I am aware that arguments have been presented that members of the Parliament should be brought under the scrutiny of the proposed national standards commission. Those arguments tend to be furthered by questions such as the following. Should not parliamentarians be required to meet the same standards that we expect of our councillors and of those who serve on other public bodies? Why reject self-regulation for councillors in favour of an independent commission, when a committee of MSPs is charged with the responsibility of investigating complaints against fellow members?</p><p>With no disrespect to colleagues, I believe that such questions betray a misunderstanding of the standards framework within which MSPs operate. That framework is built on the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#8212;formerly chaired by Lord Nolan and chaired since 1997 by Lord Neill&#8212;which defined the seven principles of public life. Those principles have become the template for public standards regulation and are common across all tiers of government.</p><p>It must be emphasised that MSPs are not self-regulating. The Scotland Act 1998 sets the standards regime for this Parliament. Incorporated in our code of conduct are no fewer than 124 paragraphs based on statute regulating our standards. The Standards Committee's role is to ensure that members' behaviour in relation to that code of conduct is monitored.</p><p>Why is that a better solution than an independent commission? The fact of the matter is that, as the bill clearly stipulates, such a commission will be appointed by the Scottish Executive. Members should ask themselves whether such a commission could really be described as independent of this Parliament when <place-holder colnum=\"115\"/> commissioners and the chief investigating officer are appointed by ministers.</p><p>Would the Lobbygate inquiry launched by the Standards Committee last year ever have got off the ground if such a commission had been in place? Remember that the Executive's first inclination was to resist a public inquiry. Surely it is better that we as MSPs should have a politically balanced parliamentary committee that can undertake investigations into the conduct of members, however exalted, and that can be seen to do so without fear or favour.</p><p>I commend the bill to Parliament and I acknowledge the work and consultation that has gone into bringing it before members today. However, as for the struggle to drive standards in Scottish public life ever higher, we must be aware that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>", "hdate": "2000-04-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13226289", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Mike Rumbles, I am a member of the Standards Committee.

It has some of the best agricultural land in Europe and, without doubt, some of the best and most efficient farmers in Europe. With those assets, one would expect that Scotland should, at the very least, be able to supply milk for its own needs, and should certainly be aiming for quality Scottish dairy products to lead in the European marketplace.</p><p>However, all is far from well in Scottish agriculture, notably in the once-prosperous dairy sector. Dairy farmers now face a situation in which the average cost of production of a litre of milk is more than the price that can be achieved in the marketplace. Clearly, the survival of many dairy farm businesses is now seriously under threat, especially when we consider that cull cows now fetch less than 50 per cent of the price that they did before BSE, and that male dairy calves are virtually unmarketable.</p><p>For the average dairy farmer in Scotland, net dairy farm income has collapsed to a mere &#163;4,400 per annum. The average farm-gate price for milk has fallen to its lowest real-terms level since records began in 1970. In the past three years alone, it has plummeted by a third to just 16p per litre&#8212;the lowest price in Europe.</p><p>What has brought about what can be described only as a serious crisis in the Scottish dairy sector? What could have happened to Scotland's agricultural advantage to have given rise to those shocking statistics? The National Farmers Union is in no doubt. The farmers in Ayrshire, Lanarkshire and Dumfriesshire, whom I am privileged to represent, are in no doubt. The combined actions and the stewardship of the agriculture industry of successive Westminster Governments have taken their toll on Scottish farmers, and I want to examine the main areas of concern.</p><p>The biggest factor by far is the strength of sterling. Gordon Brown's exchange rate policy has damaged the competitiveness of other parts of the economy where international trade is important, such as manufacturing industry. That policy makes imports cheaper and exports dearer, to our detriment. By way of illustration, I noticed at the weekend that the dairy counter of my local supermarket is selling no fewer than 13 different brands of butter, only two of which are UK-<place-holder colnum=\"1416\"/> produced.</p><p>In the dairy industry, those pressures are compounded by the intervention price system. To be technical, as the pound rises against the euro, the sterling value of the intervention milk price equivalent, which is set in euros, is pulled down. As the IMPE acts as a marker price for milk products, the farm-gate price for milk paid to the farmer also falls. In the four years since 1996, farm-gate prices have fallen more than 7p per litre, of which more than 4p is attributable to currency movements of that kind.</p><p>It is in that context that the minister's recent announcement on agrimonetary compensation should be viewed. Although I congratulate the minister on his successful efforts to secure compensation for dairy farmers for the damage caused by the increasing strength of sterling against the euro, the compensation is worth just 0.15p per litre. Only last weekend, the farm-gate price for milk fell again. One frustrated Ayrshire farmer was quoted in <i>The Herald</i> as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We may be getting &#163;2m in compensation, but the cut in the milk price from April 1<sup>st</sup> will take away &#163;12m\".</p><p>I am sure that the minister will agree with the NFU that, although such payments are welcome, they are no panacea for the Scottish farming industry. I urge him to continue to make representations to HM Treasury ministers in London seeking an end to what is an extremely damaging exchange rate policy.</p><p>I will refer now to the structural problems that the industry faces, which can be dealt with directly by the Scottish Executive. The problems are not manufactured by the farmers but, as I have said before, are consequences of Government action, in particular the abolition of the milk marketing boards and the discouragement of vertically integrated co-operatives in a misplaced drive for competitiveness through deregulation. The abolition of the Scottish Milk Marketing Board in 1994 could have brought new challenges, advantages and prosperity. However, the decision to prohibit its successors&#8212;Scottish Milk, and Milk Marque in England and Wales&#8212;from processing and to restrict their activities to trading robbed many farmers of the opportunity to share in the profits that have been made as the farm-gate price for milk has been driven down by dairy companies, which have quickly learned to work the system to their advantage.</p><p>Of the 7p fall in farm-gate prices, 2p can be attributed to the effects of deregulation and intervention by the likes of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The farm-gate price for milk might have fallen by 30 per cent, but the supermarket price has fallen by only around 6 per cent. Someone somewhere is making a profit, but <place-holder colnum=\"1417\"/> it is not the farmers. Until farmers have ownership of the supply chain&#8212;the processing, where the profit is made&#8212;they will continue to lose out to those who can buy milk directly at the farm gate, add value by processing, and then supply it directly to supermarkets. I am pleased that some progress has been made and that, ahead of developments south of the border, Scottish Milk is now able to process more than 10 per cent of its throughput.</p><p>Greater vertical integration, which allows farmers more ownership of the processing and marketing operation, is vital. Measures to encourage purchasing co-operatives to develop milk processing operations can pass some of the profits on to farmers, rather than the current situation in which the money is made and kept in the hands of the biggest operators that buy, process and sell milk. Companies such as Wiseman and Express Dairies are currently enjoying monopoly profits.</p><p>It is the responsibility of this Parliament to act now to limit the damage that previous Governments have left in their wake. We must be imaginative. We must recognise the long-term benefits of restructuring to secure the future of the industry. Capital investment is needed to allow farmers to gain a share of the profits that are currently being secured through milk processing. But how can such capital be generated when the milk price is so low? In the view of the Scottish National party, the Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise networks should be tasked to encourage producer co-operatives and to provide funding for them to establish joint ventures with dairy companies and others in the private sector. The minister need look no further than the Galloway Creamery in Stranraer for a successful joint venture of that kind, which pre-dates the current crisis.</p>", "hdate": "2000-04-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13225728", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dairy Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scotland is a nation of 5 million people, and covers nearly half the UK landmass.

He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I want to give local authorities a stable financial regime . . . We will build on our constructive dialogue with local government to respond to the issues which affect vital local services.\"</p><p>Perhaps Mr McConnell would like to explain why it is that all over Scotland, councils are crying out in pain, warning that massive cuts in services and in jobs will have to be imposed so that they can balance their books next year.</p><p>In Ayrshire, for example, East Ayrshire Council has announced a shortfall of &#163;7 million, to keep services at the same level as last year. In South Ayrshire, the shortfall is &#163;4 million to &#163;5 million. In North Ayrshire, Labour councillors are to meet officials from their district party to alert them to a financial disaster in the council to the tune of &#163;7 million. That will mean the closure of two old people's homes and two children's homes, the possibility of an entire tier of middle management having to be paid off, education and social work departments being merged, opening hours for main libraries being cut and so on.</p><p>Is the minister aware that Labour insiders in North Ayrshire have said in the local press:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The voters aren't going to forgive us for what we're going to have to do. And that is before we even consider the council tax?</p><p>Will the minister take any responsibility for the crises that are being visited upon our local authorities by his management of Scotland's financial affairs, or are those Labour-run councils being visited with a less than divine retribution for years of mismanagement at local level?</p><p>The minister often accuses the Scottish National <place-holder colnum=\"1027\"/> party of financial irresponsibility. I put it to you, Presiding Officer, that it is this Administration that demonstrates financial irresponsibility daily, by stripping resources from our local authorities and preventing them from delivering essential services to our old, our young and the most vulnerable in our society.</p><p>Why, then, is all not as rosy in the local government garden as the minister's stunning increase of 3.7 per cent would have us believe? The minister might have increased local authorities' budgets, but he has also increased their work load. The 3.7 per cent increase diminishes quickly when we consider the amount of new work that local government has to undertake. According to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, costed new burdens alone come to some &#163;120 million. Taking account of those costed new burdens, the increase in grant-aided expenditure falls to 1.1 per cent.</p><p>The Executive does not appear to believe that local authority workers deserve any sort of wage rise and, as a consequence, like the Tories before it, it has included no provision for pay awards. A further &#163;100 million must be deducted from local authority spending power, to cover that burden. It is little wonder that, under scrutiny, the minister's budget increase of almost 4 per cent falls rapidly, to the point at which current service levels can no longer be met.</p><p>Despite the prevalence of ex-council members in the Parliament, the Executive seems to have forgotten the importance of allowing local communities to spend their money as they see fit. Consequently, councils find that specific grants are set to increase by more than 7 per cent, further restricting their ability to determine spending. How does that square with the minister's statement on 15 December?</p><p>I am sick and tired of listening to announcements from the Administration of trendy new initiatives with ring-fencing attached, the impact of which, if any, will be marginal.

It is more akin, and more directly comparable, to the annual budgets produced by our local councils. Just like them, we have to accept what funds we are given by a central authority&#8212;in our case a block grant from Westminster that, over time, will bear little relation to what we actually need to spend on our nation's public services to maintain, never mind improve, their quality.</p><p>Even more significant, the block grant that we are given to allocate and distribute bears little or no relation to the revenues that Westminster ingathers from Scotland.

I will use my time to draw attention to the needs of the valuable people who care for those with mental illness.</p><p>I would like to make three points. First, I wish to flag up the difficulties that exist in identifying carers of the mentally ill. Secondly, I wish to highlight the different needs of carers of people with mental illness from other carers. Thirdly, I wish to draw attention to the fact that the special needs for this group of carers are not met and not properly addressed in the strategy document.</p><p>One in four people in Scotland will suffer from mental illness at some point in their lives and 14 per cent of the adult population have significant mental health problems, yet many people who suffer from mental health problems never have contact with the health service and many are cared for in their own homes by carers, family members or friends. The extent to which that happens is difficult to estimate. Mental illness is a taboo subject; many will admit neither to being cared for, nor to being the carer.</p><p>Many carers suffer alone or in silence. Margaret Paton, of Trust: a Carers Connection, which operates in Ayrshire, has experience of just that situation. Her adult daughter was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at the age of 21. That is when Margaret's nightmare began. She went to hell and back in an attempt to get her daughter the help she needed, in a community where her daughter's condition was misunderstood and stigmatised. So horrific was her experience that she has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that no one else has to go through it. Single-handedly, she set up a support group at Ailsa <place-holder colnum=\"1027\"/> hospital in Ayrshire, which meets once a month. That has now extended to six support groups throughout Ayrshire. An office in Ailsa hospital has been set aside for Margaret, in which she deals with carers' problems. She does all that entirely voluntarily, providing a support service and advocacy for people who receive no support from elsewhere, least of all from the public agencies.</p><p>Carers of mentally ill patients save the Government &#163;280 million every year through the services they provide, yet local authorities provide only &#163;54 million for people who are recovering from mental illness; that is less than 20 per cent of the estimated need. Unofficial carers provide the rest of the care.</p><p>Nowhere in the national carers strategy are carers of the mentally ill, and their special needs, referred to specifically. Carers of mentally ill people have different needs and different priorities. Those to whom I have spoken are not looking for benefits or respite care. They want information and support, recognition of their loved ones' illnesses and medical care to address them. They want their loved ones to see the same psychiatrist and to have continuity of care; they want the chance for relations to build up between patient and psychiatrist. They want information to flow freely between patient, carer, psychiatrist and GP. In short, they want rights and they want their opinions to be considered.</p><p>The national carers strategy, like many of the Executive's announcements, is a step in the right direction, but there is not enough money to fund it and there are important omissions from it.</p><p>Mental illness can affect one in four of us. Many of those who are affected are cared for at home. Carers of the mentally ill have different needs from other carers, and people such as Margaret Paton deserve our recognition and support.</p>", "hdate": "1999-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13215931", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to debate this extremely important issue in Parliament.

I welcome the Executive's recognition that full employment in Scotland is an achievable objective. For the past 20 years, we have been lectured by unionist politicians of all shades that a reserve army of the unemployed was an inevitable consequence of post-industrial society. More recently, we have been told that it is a price worth paying for low inflation south of the border.</p><p>The turnround is welcome, but I fear that the commitment carries less weight than the overblown presentation packs published by the minister. With the change in objectives, I assumed that there would be a change in the prevailing <place-holder colnum=\"845\"/> approach of the past 20 years, during which time it was assumed that people were unemployed not because there were no jobs but because they did not have the skills to do those jobs. Billions have been spent on training schemes, on the expansion of further and higher education, on adult learning and on retraining to free up the supply side of the labour market. On the demand side, however, laissez faire has been the order of the day.</p><p>Following the hype of the press announcements, I read the document. I was disappointed but not surprised to find no indication of a change of approach by the Executive. It seems that we can look forward to more of the same old policies, supported by the right-wing gurus of supply-side economics who blame the unemployed for being unemployed.</p><p>I agree with what Wendy Alexander says in the document:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Achieving our targets will also be about more than what we spend. It will be about how we spend, whom we work with and how we organise for change.\"</p><p>The hundreds of millions of pounds that are being spent on schemes designed to cut unemployment statistics rather than to get people into real jobs should be pumped into public works and major infrastructure projects and should be used to support small businesses that will create jobs and the conditions for economic expansion.</p><p>On Monday, while the Executive was polishing its press skills, I visited a jobcentre in Cumnock. If the minister had been with me, she would have found that the number of job vacancies did not tally with the number of people who were out of work. The International Labour Organisation figure for the unemployment rate in the area is 14.6 per cent.</p><p>The jobs that are available in the area tend to be part-time, temporary or not highly skilled. The brightest prospect for employment in the area is the opening of a Tesco supermarket. The jobcentre has already been inundated with applications and inquiries for jobs that have not even been advertised. At the same time, full-time, skilled jobs, especially in the agricultural and textile industries, are leaking away. That is what is happening in the real world. There is nothing in the documents that will effectively address unemployment in Cumnock.</p><p>Let us consider the Executive's milestones, to illustrate the point. Milestone 1 is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Reducing the percentage of our children living in workless households.\"</p><p>That is obviously dependent on the achievement of milestone 13:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Reducing the proportion of unemployed working age <place-holder colnum=\"846\"/> people.\"</p><p>That is to be measured by the ILO rate of unemployment derived from the labour force survey.</p><p>The Executive has made its aim clear. It wants to reduce a proportion&#8212;a statistic calculated by dividing the number of people who are employed by the number of people of working age who are economically inactive. It does not have to create a single job to achieve that objective. By its own definition, it requires only a shift in the number of people to the economically active category from the economically inactive category.</p><p>The mechanisms for doing that have been pioneered by UK Governments over the past 20 years. Between 1981 and 1995, the number of people in Britain claiming sickness benefits over six months rose by 1.23 million. Those people consequently vanished from the unemployment statistics.</p><p>The latest labour force survey shows that 216,000 of the 698,000 people of working age classified by the Government as economically inactive wanted a job.</p>", "hdate": "1999-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13215379", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to focus on the Executive's commitment to full employment in Scotland by 2020.

There is little doubt that overseas multinationals have played a considerable role in modernising our industrial structure, most notably establishing and sustaining the major electronics sector. Together, overseas-owned manufacturing companies directly employ some 80,000 people in Scotland.</p><p>Scotland owes its success not only to the fact that it was the first part of the UK to plan to attract inward investment in a systematic way, but to the excellent performance of Locate in Scotland over the past two decades.

Scotland needs to work hard to stand still.</p><p>Scotland's relative success with inward investment has been a constant source of irritation in Whitehall. There have been repeated attempts to clip Scottish wings and to submerge Locate in Scotland in the Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau. Back in 1996, it was Michael Heseltine who had to be beaten off, but not before he had intervened to redirect a &#163;450 million project by Samsung from Scotland to the north of England.</p><p>The advent of new Labour reinvigorated the bureaucratic, centralist tendency&#8212;or was it mere empire building? Margaret Beckett launched a fierce bid to bring Locate in Scotland under control. Not only did Mrs Beckett want to establish a concordat to that effect, she even demanded a veto on regional selective assistance packages and the reduction of Scotland's grant allocation to a per capita basis.

It stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Devolved matters over which the Scottish Parliament will have legislative power include . . . inward investment including the functions of Locate in Scotland\".</p><p>No wonder Jim Wallace, in <i>The</i> <i>Scotsman</i> on 5 November 1997, was moved to attack the DTI's threats in the following terms:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"At a time when every move should be directed towards the decentralisation of decision making, we seem to have a clear case of the centre wanting greater control.

In terms of legislating for transparency in a devolved context, the bill is adequate. In the wider context of Scotland's finances, however, much is missing.</p><p>I want to examine the most basic and fundamental flaw in the Parliament's financial system. The Scottish Parliament is expected to take responsibility for the expenditure aspect of the budget, but London holds the control of the revenue that the Parliament receives. In other words, the Parliament is responsible for money out but not for money in. That is a chronic defect. The SNP has always argued that money that is raised <place-holder colnum=\"992\"/> in Scotland should be spent in Scotland and that the Scottish Parliament should have responsibility for the debit and the credit side of the accounts.</p><p>Let us look at the relevant parallels with local government. It is beyond dispute that local authority budgets have plunged near crisis over the past few years. From those involved in managing that crisis, it is clear that the problem is caused not only by central Government cuts, but by the fact that local authorities have control over a diminishing amount of their income and are reliant on central Government for around 85 per cent of the money that they spend.</p><p>Councils are meant to be financially responsible, but cannot truly be so because they are not responsible for raising their own revenue. That pocket-money principle has been acknowledged as flawed. It does not put elected representatives in councils in control of budgets. It simply thwarts their attempts to provide services and leaves councils carrying the can for being unable to deliver the expectations of the electorate. In the same way that Scotland's councils were given their cash handout from London via the benevolent&#8212;or not so benevolent&#8212;Secretary of State for Scotland, the Parliament is dependent on a cash handout from London, although not before it is top-sliced on its way here by the Secretary of State for Scotland.</p><p>In the same way, the pocket-money principle cannot be applied successfully in the Parliament. How can we undertake to meet the expectations of our nation if it is London that dictates the finance that is available to meet those expectations? I can think of no better way to illustrate that point than to examine Scotland's ability to argue for European funds. We are dependent on the Secretary of State for Scotland going forward, cap in hand, pleading for the UK Government to take Scotland's case to Europe. Already the Government public relations machine has kicked into action, ready to talk up the crumbs swept from the table in Scotland's direction and preparing us for the worst, should John Reid fail on Scotland's behalf.</p><p>The Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Bill is&#8212;commendably&#8212;designed to ensure transparency and accountability in decisions made on the use of public money. That is welcome. It will not be possible for the Executive to take financial decisions behind closed doors, away from the scrutiny of members and the public.</p><p>I am pleased that the bill makes financial practice in the Parliament accountable.

The reality is that the failure of successive Tory and Labour Governments to invest in infrastructure projects and public transport is leading to a disintegration of our transport links and services. Over the past 10 years the volume of traffic on the roads in Scotland has increased by 25 per cent and it is set to increase by a further 25 per cent in the next 10 years. Despite that, Labour will not prioritise investment in roads programmes. Roads expenditure has been cut savagely since Labour came to power. Current spending plans for motorways and trunk roads are a mere &#163;50 million over the first three years of this Parliament.</p><p>We await the long-delayed strategic roads review. I hope that its outcome will be a substantial increase in the budget so that urgently needed projects such as the upgrading of the A77 between Glasgow and Kilmarnock are given the go-ahead. I have little confidence that that will be <place-holder colnum=\"514\"/> the outcome, however, given that a series of pronouncements by Labour politicians suggest that road spending will continue to be low. The prevalent attitude is typified by George Foulkes, the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley MP, who dismissed roads as an issue during the election campaign and suggested that Labour was happy to leave it to the SNP.</p><p>Labour is making two fundamental mistakes in disregarding the fact that, after years of Tory neglect of public transport, increasing numbers of people depend on cars, and the fact that the cuts to road improvement programmes are having a severe impact on road safety and economic development. The situation in Ayrshire illustrates that. The A77 is the main road artery connecting Ayrshire to Glasgow; Mrs McIntosh has already said how dangerous that road is. It is used every day by 37,000 vehicles&#8212;that is 7,000 over its capacity. By 2005 an increase of a further 8,000 vehicles a day is expected. The proposed PFI to build a Glasgow south orbital route with a link to the A77 would add another 9,000 vehicles. If the Executive fails to bring forward a plan to upgrade that road immediately, it will be guilty of deliberately neglecting public safety.</p><p>In more general terms, the drive to regenerate the Ayrshire economy has been severely hampered by the lack of trunk road development. To the north we need an upgrade of the A737 to connect it to the M8. In the south and west the narrow and aging road network does not help the tourism industry that towns such as Maybole and Girvan need to develop. Girvan has the highest level of unemployment in Scotland, and the lack of a bypass is causing severe structural damage to the town centre of Maybole.

It was the greatest leap forward for social inclusion that this country has ever seen. Everyone in our society was given entitlement to quality medical provision free and at the point of need regardless of his or her means. It was Aneurin Bevan, the great socialist architect of the NHS, who proclaimed the dawn of a new age in this country-an age in which no one would be denied the support that was necessary to climb out of the miseries induced by illness, ignorance, poverty and unemployment. That support would be there from cradle to grave. At last that supreme article of socialist faith- </p><p>\"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\"-  was given hugely practical and popular expression. For the past 50 years, public investment and reinvestment has been efficiently financed by low-interest, long-term loans from the Public Works Loans Board. That has allowed succeeding generations to fulfil and to sustain Bevan's vision. That vision is now being systematically undermined. </p><p>The ticking time bomb that is the private finance initiative is set to blow away the legacy of the past 50 years. In the motion we are asking Parliament to stop that bomb going off. The rush to PFI means an ever-increasing takeover of public assets such as schools and hospitals by private consortia that are driven by the profit motive rather than by public interest. </p><p>In the debate, my colleagues have described and will describe how public needs are being overridden; I would like to concentrate on why that is happening.
