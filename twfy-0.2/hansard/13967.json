Neil Bibby and Mark Griffin have got engaged.&#8221; There was just a moment before the look on my face made her feel that she needed to qualify that and say, &#8220;Not to each other.&#8221; I noticed that they sat together at the back of the chamber throughout the debate on the amendments this afternoon. On the record, I wish them and their respective&#8212;on this occasion&#8212;opposite-sex partners every happiness in the marriages that they are about to embark on. [Applause.]</p><p>At the stage 1 debate, the Official Report of which I re-read, we heard some outstanding speeches from Ruth Davidson, Marco Biagi, James Dornan, John Lamont and Christian Allard, who was cut off in his prime by you, Presiding Officer, as he got to the peroration of a wonderful anecdote about two gay French farmers, the conclusion of which I hope to hear&#8212;</p><p>Christian Allard (North East Scotland) (SNP) rose&#8212;</p><p>&#8212;but in his own time.</p><p>On re-reading that Official Report I saw that there were also eloquent speeches from Nigel Don and John Mason, who put the alternative point of view.</p><p>As we move past the amendment stage this afternoon, the Parliament is entitled to take a celebratory attitude to the bill that we are about to pass. I congratulate all those across Scotland who have campaigned to bring this moment about: the Equality Network and its indefatigable parliamentary liaison officer, Tom French, and all the others across Scotland who have done this.</p><p>I know that there will be a big party in Hemma tonight. My clubbing days are gone; I do not know whether Jackie Baillie, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Neil plan to be dancing tonight. I think that Ruth Davidson could be. I look at Jim Hume and see a bit of a wannabe, so it is possible that he will want to be. Today is a celebration.</p><p>I echo what I said when I co-sponsored some equal marriage events. My wife and I have enjoyed 26 years of marriage, not civil partnership. I want every couple in Scotland, regardless of their sex, to be able to have exactly the same opportunity to enjoy a long and happy marriage such as we have had.</p><p>I also welcome the fact that those couples will be moving into modern Scottish family life. That includes the experience of single parents who are struggling, either through fate or circumstance or choice, to bring up children on their own. It includes my experience: my mother and father were married and I am the married father of two highly opinionated young sons&#8212;how they became so highly opinionated, I have no idea. It also includes the experience of same-sex couples. I hope that they will have the opportunity to enjoy marriage, to be able to rear children in a happy and stable family environment and to have everything that goes with that.</p><p>I also take a practical point of view. Our country has an ageing demographic. We do not want people to feel that they have to live alone. I want us to do whatever we can to make it possible for any couple to share a life together. If the marriage legislation that we will pass today encourages that, that will be all to the benefit of our nation.</p><p>There has been huge change in my lifetime from the brutal atmosphere in which gay people had to live when I was a teenager and young man, when gay people felt that they had to strangle their sexuality. I know some of those people&#8212;I am in the Tory party after all. [Laughter.] Okay, it is a common point for everyone else.</p><p>Today is a fantastic change to be celebrated in the mood, style, signature and stamp of my country, Scotland. Let me chuck in a bit of musical theatre, because it is that kind of debate, is it not? Rodgers and Hammerstein&#8217;s 1943 musical &#8220;South Pacific&#8221; was made into a movie in 1958, the year before I was born. As a 12-year-old, I was confronted by this particular lyric:</p><p>You&#8217;ve got to be taught to hate and fear,</p><p>You&#8217;ve got to be taught from year to year,</p><p>It&#8217;s got to be drummed in your dear little ear,</p><p>You&#8217;ve got to be carefully taught.</p><p>You&#8217;ve got to be taught to be afraid</p><p>Of people whose eyes are oddly made,</p><p>And people whose skin is a diff&#8217;rent shade,</p><p>You&#8217;ve got to be carefully taught.</p><p>You&#8217;ve got to be taught before it&#8217;s too late,</p><p>Before you are six or seven or eight,</p><p>To hate all the people your relatives hate,</p><p>You&#8217;ve got to be carefully taught!</p><p>I do not ascribe any of those prejudices to anyone in the chamber this afternoon, but what that song said to me as a 12-year-old is that we can come into politics and hope to change the attitudes in the country about sexual, racial and religious equality. We politicians have the opportunity today to be part of a generation that teaches the next generation, without prescribing the word &#8220;teach&#8221; too strongly, about the kind of country that they want to work in, to live in, to marry in, and the country that I want to vote for tonight.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When this parliamentary year started and we came back from the summer recess in full anticipation of passing momentous legislation on same-sex marriage, my personal assistant greeted me at the office and said, &#8220;Have you heard the latest?

Any national strategy has to be based on actions, and I welcome what the minister has said about that. If that is what it is about, that is fine&#8212;I agree that the last thing that we need now is to have some additional comprehensive review.</p><p>The various reviews that have been undertaken will all surely be useful in themselves. However, it is only within the structure of a national strategy that the various conclusions and, even more basically, the understanding of a definition will achieve a clarity of purpose and direction.</p><p>The danger with a small d is that, in this subject of intense sensitivities, politicians&#8212;unless they come from a background of professional experience, which some do&#8212;are inevitably several steps removed from the realities of the issue. The danger is that they wade in with calls for specific actions and recommendations that might make for much action and activity but be misplaced in their purpose.</p><p>The committee report notes, for example, that the automatic desire of the committee to meet those who have been affected and to examine their experience at first hand proved impossible, for wholly understandable reasons. Deeply affected and mistrusting, those who have suffered are suspicious and, in many cases, they are still too vulnerable to be subjected to the ham-fisted public or even private examination of well-intentioned politicians. Therefore, it is testimony at second hand on which the committee has drawn and which David Stewart detailed, to an extent, in his speech. Although it is not as satisfactory, it is still compelling.</p><p>As David Stewart noted, the intention of the committee was to be helpful. It was therefore careful not to embrace a remit that would have had it chasing shadows down dozens of avenues. In consequence, it has produced a series of practical recommendations and, through its work, has allowed others to ask other searching questions, not least why there has been such an underuse of the provisions of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 and the Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005.</p><p>On the other hand, the recommendations of the report somewhat casually stray into one popular area of policy recommendations for politicians: education. In so many areas of policy, whether public health or whatever, we have become fond, as politicians, of recommending that schools and teachers should take the lead, and in a somewhat generalised way. This report does that to an extent, too, and I am less persuaded by it.</p><p>Although we have introduced and enhanced the detail of sexual education in the school curriculum, it is impossible to demonstrate that we have been successful in our intention. We still have alarmingly high rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease and there is an ever reducing age of reported sexual intimacy. We have provided no ends of facts and practical routes for further assistance and support and yet, in an effort not to obstruct, we have, in the opinion of many, eschewed context and value.</p><p>If we are to make a valued educational contribution, it must be one that ensures that we do not counterintuitively promote a greater incidence of that which we are seeking to curtail and prevent. Moreover, the report identifies the all-too-depressing incidence among children who are already in lives that demonstrate recognisable chaotic factors.</p><p>At no point does the report talk about families or parents as a positive source of support, which I think is an oversight. Annabel Goldie talked in the previous session of Parliament about parenting. We should not ignore the education of parents, the majority of whom have no experience of this issue themselves but are deeply concerned by the modern world and the opportunities for evil that exist within it.</p><p>I know of many parents who will be confronted regularly by newspaper or magazine case histories, which are sometimes willingly sensationalised for reasons that we all recognise and deplore. Those histories can alert parents to a particular tragedy without offering them validated best practice for ensuring the wellbeing of their own children.</p><p>There is a case for ensuring that any national strategy looks to produce helpful and informed guidance for parents that is endorsed by Government. Otherwise, they rely on the anecdotal and, in so doing, can seem to children as if they are removed from the realities of their world. The world has moved on at such a pace that saying, &#8220;My mother always used to say&#8221;, &#8220;We won&#8217;t discuss this further&#8221; or &#8220;You will not do that&#8221; really no longer suffice. Parents need evolving, sensible and practical advice.</p><p>On the publication of a report, it can seem that the issue at hand is endemic among the whole population, when in fact the vast majority remain unaffected. The sexual exploitation of children has become widely discussed, just as child abduction was in the past. It is not in any sense a marginal issue, and the report details in the most authoritative and at times harrowing way it can the all-too-often inexplicable dark side of human behaviour.</p><p>What I am seeking to say is that any strategy must not become so diluted in order to be national as to lose bite and focus in rooting out actual child sexual exploitation, supporting those affected or prosecuting effectively those who exploit.</p><p>I welcome the recommendations on police education, the support of a named individual acting on behalf of children involved in the legal process, the training of front-line police officers to disrupt perpetrators, the greater use of sexual harm orders and, more generally, the effective implementation and use of legal remedies that are already available.</p><p>I believe this debate is also an opportunity to pay tribute to the many who have, with the greatest sensitivity, immersed themselves in understanding the world in which this activity takes place in order to lead those who have been traumatised and damaged by it to a safer future. Therefore, I thank Barnardo&#8217;s, NHS open road, Who Cares? Scotland, the Aberlour Child Care Trust and Say Women, among the dozens of organisations and individuals who have acted and from which written and oral evidence was received.</p><p>Like David Stewart, I think it worth pausing to reflect on the closure&#8212;even as the work of the committee progressed&#8212;of Scotland&#8217;s only refuge for children who have run away from home, which was operated by Aberlour in the Glasgow area. The loss of this three-bedroom unit is surely by any standard a regressive step, and I hope that further work will be done to establish why the unit was not sustainably viable.</p><p>Were the central recommendation of this report&#8212;that a national strategy be established&#8212;to fall on deaf ears, it would be impossible to conclude other than that child exploitation will continue without our proper understanding of its extent and evolution or the effectiveness of any of the actions already taken or envisaged. Countless groups will work on, each gathering further understanding but without the authority that a co-ordinated approach may bring.</p><p>This is a report in which politicians have tried, with reticence and humility in terms of our understanding and experience, to advance a policy agenda for the good of those affected and against those who perpetrate evil. It is for the Government to step in and provide leadership and to draw on the talent of those who have the experience and commitment. I welcome the minister&#8217;s focus on actions, rather than further reviews.</p><p>The report is bristling with practical, commonsense suggestions, which I hope that the Parliament will commend to the Scottish Government tonight for action.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with the minister&#8212;I hope that I have not been giving a false impression.

At the time of my visit, a debate had begun&#8212;one that was touched with obvious controversy&#8212;on the future conservation of the Nazi concentration and death camp. Just as the shadows lengthen and the people who have first-hand recollections of what was suffered and&#8212;by a few&#8212;endured there, pass into history, so too have the buildings that constitute the camp begun rapidly to disintegrate.</p><p>Auschwitz-Birkenau, along with Dachau, Theresienstadt and a handful of other camps&#8212;several dozen&#8212;remain. For 70 years, they have served not just as a testament to what was done, but often as painful but necessary destinations to visit, for those who survived to remember those who did not survive, and for the families of those who survived to bear witness and&#8212;in some all too painful cases&#8212;to speak words of farewell at the location of their forebears&#8217; darkest hours. Other camps&#8212;for, example, Sobibor and Treblinka&#8212;exist no more, because they were ruthlessly demolished and concealed at a point in the rout of Nazi Germany when the retreat of Hitler&#8217;s armies was not yet confused or panicked.</p><p>Many in Parliament have borne witness to Auschwitz-Birkenau and the striking and harrowing images, remnants and sense of evil that emanate from that place. More than 1&#160;million people died&#8212;were murdered&#8212;there. Today, the annual number of visitors exceeds that figure, and the infrastructure is crumbling. Since my visit in 2009, the number of buildings that are open to the public has been further restricted, and anyone with an eye for these things can see that it will soon not be safe for any of the buildings to be available to those visiting.</p><p>The discussion over what to do has been resolved in favour of restoration. That decision cannot have been easy. With the Polish Government appealing for $150&#160;million to preserve something so ghastly, it is a thought that, however correct it is, must have troubled the soul. On balance, however, it is the right decision. Germany has pledged $80&#160;million, the United States has pledged $15&#160;million and Poland has pledged $13&#160;million. At least 23 other countries, including the United Kingdom, have pledged considerable sums, in addition to those.</p><p>Work has begun. By last summer, only three of the 45 brick barracks could be entered safely, and an immediate restoration of the others is under way at a cost of $1&#160;million per barrack, each barrack having housed 700 victims at a time. The ruins of the gas chambers, which were sinking significantly, have now had their foundations underpinned.</p><p>The hundreds of thousands of personal effects, many of which have lain untouched since being collected and displayed decades ago, are receiving individual attention. For example, each of the 100,000 shoes that were left behind at the war&#8217;s end takes some two hours of careful cleaning and, even now, there has been the heart-stopping revelation of a note from history&#8212;the testimony of one desperate individual, that had been tucked into the sole of a shoe, being discovered seven decades after the liberation, and brought to public light.</p><p>I say with a heavy heart that it is the right decision. That is not because I believe any longer that the history of Nazi Germany and its genocidal extermination of 6&#160;million Jews across Europe can or will be forgotten; it is more because Auschwitz remains as a grotesque physical representation of what evil is capable of. It has to be seen to be believed in its scale and, uncomfortably, in its proximity to the normal life of those who lived adjacent to it and carried on in ignorance or fear of&#8212;or complicity in&#8212;what was happening on the other side of the perimeter wall. It has evolved into a place of education and, in the darkest sense, of memorial. However, it must surely be an exception, if not the only one.</p><p>I can find far less excuse or rationalised argument for the debate arising from the gruesome find in the Bavarian national museum in Munich of a Nazi guillotine that was used to behead one of Hitler&#8217;s youngest and bravest opponents, Sophie Scholl, her brother Hans and other members of the White Rose group in 1943. Perhaps 1,500 others were also executed by that vile instrument. The options that are under consideration appear to be to hide it away or to put it on display. Franz Josef M&#252;ller, who at 89 is the last surviving member of the White Rose group, has argued that</p><p>&#8220;no entertainment should be made of their violent deaths&#8221;.</p><p>Surely he is right. What, other than a puerile sense of the macabre, will draw people to a museum that is exhibiting a guillotine&#8212;the blade and apparatus of which dispatched so many to their deaths? There is a sharp distinction between the restoration of Auschwitz-Birkenau&#8212;which is being undertaken with the support of the international community&#8212;and the tawdry lust for a good turnout at a local town museum, however well intentioned the exhibition&#8217;s aims.</p><p>All those who died defenceless and without compassion or reason at the hands of the Nazis deserve to be honoured and remembered in perpetuity. Official memorials where tributes can be paid, sites of historical significance, or much more personal tributes, are appropriate. However, as I said when I began my remarks, as the shadows lengthen, let us resist and argue against theatre and entertainment being made inappropriately or unintentionally. Instead of hiding away that guillotine or displaying it, let it be destroyed.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell&#8217;s motion, on which I, too, congratulate him, invites us to celebrate</p><p>&#8220;the Holocaust survivors who have enriched Scotland as a nation&#8221;,</p><p>and recommits us</p><p>&#8220;to ensuring that racism, sectarianism and bigotry are never allowed to go unchallenged in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>Let us do that with respect, humility and determination.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holocaust Memorial Day 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have spoken before of my visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau in 2009, as other members have spoken of their visits over the years.

What Sir William donated to the city, which is now contained in the Burrell collection building in Pollok park, is probably one of the finest individual collections ever to be assembled anywhere in the world. It is hugely eclectic in nature and includes Egyptian artefacts; a very fine Chinese collection; medieval suits of armour; one of the world&#8217;s largest collections&#8212;which I found on my tour of the items in the basement that are rarely displayed&#8212;of Tudor bed frames, which is perhaps not the most exciting draw that one can imagine; its pastels, and the fantastic Degas collection.</p><p>I remember, as a young man, being struck by Boudin&#8217;s &#8220;The Beach at Trouville&#8221;, which shows the Empress Eug&#233;nie promenading there. I remember buying a print of it, which stimulated in me a desire to visit the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris, where all the impressionist paintings were gathered at that time before they were moved to the Mus&#233;e d&#8217;Orsay.</p><p>I am sure that, for other people too, the Burrell collection stimulated interest in arts in the widest possible sense. In addition to the things I have mentioned, the collection contains the Warwick vase, a fine collection of bronzes including busts by Rodin, and a tremendous collection of Turkish carpets, which I have to say looked a bit gloomy to me as a young man of 24. It has terrific collections of tapestries and wonderful stained glass, and, from Sir William&#8217;s own home, four rooms that were imported in their entirety into the fabric of the building.</p><p>It was one of the most exciting new museums of its time, but sadly tastes and times change. For all that we would have wished&#8212;as other members have said&#8212;that the building had proved to be more robust, the committee was persuaded that a phased renovation of the Burrell collection would simply not be possible because of the membranous nature of the roof, which has absorbed so much water and moisture that it is leaking at points that are unrelated to the originating point of any leak. The building must now undergo a major renovation.</p><p>It is also fair to say that what was new and exciting in display and presentation in 1983 is far less so today, and that the museum&#8217;s attendance figures have fallen sharply over the years. The committee was persuaded that the building needs to be renovated, so the question then was whether to accede to the council&#8217;s wish to vary the terms of Sir William&#8217;s will in order that the collection could travel internationally.</p><p>Sir William never had any objection to the collection being lent elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but at the time when he made his bequest, he specifically stated that he did not wish it to travel internationally. We were in no position other than to try to consider what was underpinning the terms of Sir William&#8217;s bequest at that point, and we were reasonably satisfied, given that he had no objection to the collection being lent, that his principal concern was that international travel at that time was such that there was a very real risk of the collection or parts of it being lost if it were to be toured internationally.</p><p>That was then; this is now. We heard from many witnesses, some of whom are involved in transporting arts and antiquities, who are satisfied that we could now allow that variation to take place without undue risk to the collection.</p><p>People who have made representations&#8212;which, it is interesting to note, are still coming in from those who are concerned&#8212;have objected in essence to one of two things. First, they point to examples of artefacts&#8217; having been damaged in transit without appreciating that, nine times out of 10, the damage has been done by porters in the museum in which the exhibit currently rests when moving it from one part of the museum to the other, rather than because of anything related to international travel.</p><p>Secondly, a slightly academic argument began about whether we were setting a precedent for bequests in general and the terms that are associated with them by agreeing to variation of Sir William Burrell&#8217;s bequest. We took evidence on that from Professor George Gretton, who made an interesting point&#8212;which was beyond the committee&#8217;s brief&#8212;with regard to how long after a bequest is made one can reasonably expect its terms to be maintained. Professor Gretton thought that, if we were to have that debate, a period of some 50 years would be reasonable.</p><p>However, our concern was about what benefit there would be to the collection being toured. The answer is, quite simply, this: attendances have fallen from 1&#160;million to barely 200,000. The Burrell collection is still in a wonderful location, which is being refurbished, including parts of it that I did not even know existed&#8212;a theatre, artists&#8217; rooms and various conservation rooms, which will be adapted to display more of the collection.</p><p>With the publicity that is attendant on taking this wonderful collection that belongs to Glasgow and Scotland around the world, we will, in effect, make a magnificent shop window for tourism to the city and the country. We will also then be able to borrow other items that Sir William bid for but did not get, and which would form a complete set of some of the artefacts that are on display.</p><p>Parliament has the opportunity to give the Burrell collection, Glasgow and Scotland a chance to boost our cultural representation abroad, and to recreate that fabulous collection in a refurbished facility in Pollok park in Glasgow.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854644", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Burrell Collection (Lending and Borrowing) (Scotland) Bill: Final Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Findlay invites me to do something that I was planning to undertake in any event.

Therefore, our contributions are all circumscribed by that fact.</p><p>To my surprise, we last touched on this topic&#8212;I can remember the debate quite clearly&#8212;on 24 January last year, when we spoke about mental health issues. I thought that the debate was much more recent than that. There were excellent speeches in that debate from many who have not contributed today&#8212;we heard then from Fiona McLeod, Malcolm Chisholm, Richard Simpson, Mary Scanlon, Dennis Robertson, Mary Fee and David Stewart.</p><p>In that earlier debate, when we were talking about mental health issues more generally, suicide became a feature of our discussion and at that point the SAMH two too many campaign was mentioned. Even though we are having this debate against a background of a falling number of those who are taking their own lives in Scotland, the two too many campaign illustrates that, each and every day, two people in Scotland take their own lives. In total, that is 14 deaths in every 100,000 against a European average of 16 deaths in every 100,000.</p><p>As Neil Findlay said, if we roll it all up into a global figure, the number of people who commit suicide is astonishing. It is not the norm but the exception, but it is against that background that we are seeking&#8212;through the strategy that I think all of us are very happy to support&#8212;to effectively understand why people commit suicide and to seek to reduce the number further.</p><p>Historically and in different cultures there have been different attitudes to suicide, but in Scotland it is a long time since it was a heroic act to defend a nation&#8217;s wellbeing in war or since we had any correlation to some sort of old imperial Japanese code of conduct. I have to assume that, for most people, the decision to commit suicide is a bleak, cold and lonely one that is almost always taken for reasons about which our despair should match that of any unfortunate soul who contemplates such an end.</p><p>Let us understand the context that we will not eliminate suicide&#8212;I agree with James Dornan on that&#8212;but that we should pursue policies and actions that will continually militate against the reasons that drive people to thinking of it. In Michael Matheson&#8217;s foreword to the strategy document, he sums up the issue by saying simply:</p><p>&#8220;Every suicide is a tragedy that has a far reaching impact on family, friends and the community long after a person has died.&#8221;</p><p>That is the general point that every member understands and which is at the heart of the tragedy.</p><p>During the debate, all sorts of reasons why people commit suicide have been advanced. As Kenny Gibson said, although he chose not to talk about it today, some people who are faced with some sort of medical prognosis decide that suicide is the right course. Others are driven by a breakdown in relationships or a radical change in fortunes, which might well be relationship driven or to do with careers or finance.</p><p>Some people are driven to suicide because they are different. On that issue, as a country, we can take considerable pride in the way in which our culture has changed, certainly since I was young. At that time, if someone was disabled, they could be the subject of ridicule or, if people were gay, that was to be disowned and denied, or worse. There were all manner of other social stigmas that drove people to suicide. As a society at large, we have moved on considerably and, I hope, not so many of those stigmas are now apparent.</p><p>Neil Findlay talked about Touched by Suicide, social groups and what we can do to assist people to be better able to develop the skills that will allow them to intuitively recognise those who are at risk. Nanette Milne talked about the impact and potential consequences of the web, which Kevin Stewart and Christine Grahame also touched on.</p><p>I am not being flippant when I say that my sons certainly receive lots of comments for being the sons of a Tory MSP, and they have learned to cope with that. It is incredible how many young people find themselves the subject of bullying that is driven by the actions of their parents or the perceptions of their parents. That has a wholly corrosive effect on some young people, but they can have a great reluctance to discuss that in the family, because they feel that in some way they are protecting their parent from what has been said about them. On some dreadful occasions, that has driven young people to suicide.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854657", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Suicide Prevention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is one of these debates to which we contribute as politicians wishing that we knew more about the subject&#8212;much more about the subject than any one of us probably does.

This is the time when, free of national elections, we can collectively look objectively at the plans that we must make to secure Scotland&#8217;s health service for the future in the face of the demographic and other challenges that could all too easily overwhelm it if it were left to chance and fortune.</p><p>There are two halves to the debate&#8212;the now and the hereafter. As we enter 2014, we look forward in the months immediately ahead to the resolution of and reporting back on recent actions and initiatives. We are especially interested to establish the outcome of the discussions and the plans that are being made in conjunction with the Scottish Medicines Consortium that will afford greater access to new medicines&#8212;in particular, to new cancer medicines. I am grateful to the cabinet secretary for his actions on the matter, and I know that we will meet in early course to hear what practical actions will follow. We also look forward with keen attention to the outcome of the consultation on the future treatment of chronic pain.</p><p>We note that, in May, it will be two years since we offered the Government our support for its minimum unit pricing legislation, but we remain no clearer about when or whether the Government believes it will come into force. Meanwhile, we urge the Government to look afresh at proposals from Richard Simpson and others on how we continue to tackle Scotland&#8217;s relationship with alcohol. We are keen to see the noises regarding universal health visiting translated into actions, to know what the benefits of the senior charge nursing programme are proving to be and to see real encouragement in future nursing capacity.</p><p>Although we unreservedly welcome the increase in nurse training that was announced this week, we do so mindful of the significant and sustained change in the demographic profile of our nurses: they are getting older and nearing retirement. In short, we believe that we are overcomplicating nursing to a point at which it is proving to be significantly less attractive to new entrants as a career. We need to address that now.</p><p>We also have an ambition to make the pathways from hospital to care effective. That, and all that I have mentioned before, are just parts of the sum and substance of the job that is currently in hand. In that, we have supported the Government constructively when we have been able to, but&#8212;if you will excuse my saying so, Presiding Officer&#8212;for all the cabinet secretary&#8217;s celebrated bonhomie, it is not enough for him just to acknowledge and address the shortcomings of his predecessor.</p><p>It was the great privilege of the Labour Party to create the national health service. At times, over the years, as I have listened to speeches from around the chamber, I have been left wondering whether others believe that the Conservative Party was opposed to its establishment. We were not. Let me quote from Churchill&#8217;s 1945 manifesto:</p><p>&#8220;We propose to create a comprehensive health service covering the whole range of medical treatment from the general practitioner to the specialist, and from the hospital to convalescence and rehabilitation; and to introduce legislation for this purpose in the new Parliament.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is the mid-point&#8212;just&#8212;of the current session of Parliament, and on such a fundamental issue that is already devolved in its entirety to this place, we believe and have argued that the time is right to set decisively to one side the &#8220;We did this, you did that&#8221;, &#8220;We built this, you built that&#8221;, &#8220;We spent, but you cut&#8221; and &#8220;We opened...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Jackson", "last_name": "Carlaw", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80538", "house": "4", "member_id": "80538", "person_id": "13967", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "West Scotland"}, "section_id": "22843652", "hpos": "139", "gid": "2014-01-15.17.42", "epobject_id": "22843694", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2014-01-15.17.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13967+section%3Asp#g17.42", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80538"}, {"body": "<p>I will do so in my closing speech.</p><p>It was Attlee&#8217;s privilege to establish the NHS, but the policy enjoyed Churchill&#8217;s support.</p><p>However, the NHS that was established then no longer exists, other than in name. The Blair Government substantially broke the links between the health service in England and elsewhere, and the Westminster coalition Government continues to do so. Some of what both Governments did works, and we should not be afraid to acknowledge and consider that, but the reality is that there are now substantially different health services in the United Kingdom.</p><p>We in the Scottish Parliament are entrusted with ensuring that the Scottish health service, by which name we should perhaps call it, is the best by any standard. Let me make it clear again that that means accepting Scotland&#8217;s wish to have a publicly funded, publicly owned, publicly run Scottish health service. It does not mean that we accept everything that is done in the service&#8217;s name, that we excuse outmoded practice or that we justify the unjustifiable. It means, rather, that we accept a basis on which we can proceed collectively.</p><p>It is likely&#8212;I put it no more strongly&#8212;that one or the other of the two largest parties that are represented in the debate will form the next devolved Government of Scotland in 2016. We will take account, with great care, of which party&#8212;we are between the devil and the deep blue sea&#8212;proposes the most substantial and thoughtful programme for the development of Scotland&#8217;s health service. We will take account of which party is prepared to stop bragging and grandstanding and instead to stand prepared to ask difficult questions and to act on the answers.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives question whether the current structure of tertiary and non-tertiary health boards is sustainable or desirable. There is a case for embracing the most talented management, wherever it is to be found in Scotland&#8217;s health service, and for inviting those men and women to lend their talents to the whole service, by which I mean that I envisage a slimmed-down board structure.</p><p>If we are to meet the challenge of providing the best health service for the people of Scotland, in the face of everything that we know, we must also substantially beef up what we require of people in Scotland in relation to their commitment to the service. For example, it is not acceptable routinely to fail to present for a clinical appointment. That not only wastes time and money but seriously undermines opportunities for other people who are in need. The responsibility of all of us for our health service goes much further, and Scottish Conservatives will have more to say about that in the months ahead.</p><p>Surely sterile name-calling about our respective love of Scotland&#8217;s health service serves little, if any, purpose. Is it futile to expect that we can move beyond our imaginations, our enmities and our ambitions? I hope not. Now is the time for us to participate collectively in a full and comprehensive debate about the NHS in Scotland.</p><p>I have a great deal of sympathy with what the cabinet secretary said about reviews: they can take a long time and can paralyse decision making. However, if it is our duty not to seek ownership of health as a partisan battle-cry but to achieve nothing short of the best outcomes, the best access, the best practice and the best delivery, to meet and beat the demographic, clinical and other challenges that lie immediately ahead, a collective plan, if such a thing is possible, is surely desirable.

While I accept that it is very difficult for any report to offer the correct model, it would be better if we were to go forward with greater unanimity.</p><p>One of the things that the Kerr report did not anticipate effectively a decade ago was the ageing demographic. Scottish Conservatives have today revealed that there were 116,000 emergency admissions to hospital among the over-75s in 2003. Last year, there were nearly 150,000. That further illustrates the enormous change and challenge that the ageing demographic represents.</p><p>I was struck by Kevin Stewart&#8217;s contribution. He was absolutely right: if every patient who was treated by the NHS came to MSPs dissatisfied with the service that they had received, we would do nothing but deal with them. In fact, it is still the exception rather than the rule that a person suffers the shortcomings of the service. We should be fearless in rooting out those shortcomings and learning from them, but we should also recognise a point that is appreciated on all sides of the chamber, which is that the job that is done by the overwhelming majority of the people who work in the NHS is the very best and the most admirable that we could wish or hope for.</p><p>I was slightly saddened by Gil Paterson&#8217;s contribution.

She has asked me to read the following message:</p><p>&#8220;I am sorry not to be with you for the debate and am most grateful to Jackson Carlaw for stepping in. Lest my political opponents get too excited I&#8217;m on the mend and hope to be back to normal next week. I thank everyone for their kind messages of support.&#8221;</p><p>She tells me that she hopes to get out of hospital tomorrow, with oral antibiotics, which I suppose are preferable to any other, I say with some relief. I know that she is disappointed to be missing the debate, because she very much wanted to sing the praises of HM Prison Greenock&#8217;s throughcare support project. It is my pleasure to stand in, particularly as the project does good work in a prison in my constituency and as I welcomed the announcement of the pilot in May last year. I thank members from all parties for supporting the motion.</p><p>The idea for the debate came after a visit to HMP Greenock in December, when Annabel met the acting governor, William Stuart, to see at first hand the work of the pilot project, which is designed to extend the supportive role of Scottish Prison Service staff beyond the prison gates. The project has had an investment of approximately &#163;70,000 and employs throughcare support officers to assist offenders who leave custody with accessing services on issues such as housing, benefits and addiction. That strikes Annabel and me as common sense. In short, HMP Greenock has recognised that prisoners who leave custody need assistance and support.</p><p>The project acknowledges that, when prisoners are released, they face a daunting situation. They have been incarcerated in a safe environment, fed, sheltered and given routine. The moment that a prisoner is released, they need to be organised, to have access to services, to be able to fill in forms, to find transportation and to face the practical and immediate problem of fending for themselves. That is difficult enough for offenders leaving a controlled environment and entering the big bad world, but we know that prisoners are likely to have literacy and numeracy difficulties, which bring even greater challenges.</p><p>The throughcare support officers provide vital support to prisoners who have signed up to the scheme&#8212;it is not compulsory. They carry out six weeks of preparation with the prisoner prior to their release and then assist the individual in the community for six weeks after their release. That can make a real difference to an individual&#8212;the difference between a prisoner who has no help in the outside world and who reoffends and a prisoner who is assisted and encouraged and given the right tools to start a rehabilitated life in the outside world. Of course, the end goal is to prevent the individual from reoffending, and this helping hand might well be the right tool to do it.</p><p>Individuals need help to quickly find and access the appropriate services and to make new positive connections with the community. The officers undertake various tasks, from accompanying individuals to appointments to simply being the voice at the end of the phone that offers assistance and guidance. They are known to the individual and, more important, they are trusted.</p><p>On visiting HMP Greenock, Annabel was impressed with the ethos behind the project; the can-do attitude of the staff; the commitment to look at a prisoner as an individual; and the officers&#8217; desire to see the potential in an individual and not just view them as someone who is no longer the prison&#8217;s responsibility once they are released. On my own account, I repeat the comment that I made in a previous debate that it is also the responsibility of employers across Scotland to recognise that they have to give some opportunity and show some understanding if prisoners are to be properly rehabilitated and brought back into society.</p><p>Annabel understands that HMP Low Moss is trialling a similar scheme, with a dedicated throughcare worker and care plan for every short-term prisoner. We know that throughcare projects work. Moving on Renfrewshire, a mentoring scheme that is managed by Action for Children and which works with young offenders at Polmont, found that 74 per cent of those working with the scheme had not returned to custody within two years, compared to a figure of only 50 per cent among young offenders who were not on the programme.</p><p>Such projects are important because, although reconviction rates are falling, they remain far too high. Nearly 45 per cent of offenders who are released from prison reoffend within a year. Although that has fallen from a high of 50 per cent in 2003-04, it still compares poorly with the reconviction rates among those who receive other sentences. In 2012, an Audit Scotland report on reducing reoffending found that more than a fifth of offenders who were convicted in 2010-11 had ten or more previous convictions.</p><p>We simply cannot afford to do nothing about that. The Scottish Government estimates that the total economic and social cost of reoffending is about &#163;3 billion annually. Although the Government spends about &#163;128 million a year on reducing reoffending, rates remain far too high, and we continue to spend more than &#163;250 million punishing the same offenders time and again.</p><p>The United Kingdom Government is pushing throughcare as a priority, and provision of throughcare is arguably wider south of the border. The Secretary of State for Justice there, Chris Grayling, is leading a rehabilitation revolution that will include a roll-out of prisoner mentoring and throughcare schemes. In England and Wales, statutory supervision and rehabilitation will be extended to those who are sentenced to less than 12 months, and a nationwide through-the-prison-gate resettlement service will be established, meaning that most offenders will be given continuous support, from custody into their community, by one provider.</p><p>The key difference between that and the approach in Scotland is that Chris Grayling is exploring the use of payment by results so that the public, voluntary and private sectors can all compete for funding and will be rewarded if they achieve real reductions in reoffending. The use of public-social partnerships at HMP Low Moss will open reoffending projects to the third sector, but if results can be achieved by the private sector that should not be ruled out.</p><p>More needs to be done on reducing reoffending in Scotland. Projects such as the throughcare support project at HMP Greenock are certainly a step in the right direction and I commend the staff there for their excellent work in tackling reoffending. I hope that best practice from the pilot can be shared and adopted across the prison estate.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843781", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Throughcare Support Project (HMP Greenock)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I stand in my best Jaeger two-piece, and I am delighted to speak on behalf of my colleague Annabel Goldie, who unfortunately cannot be here because she is unwell.

It relates to someone who had been at school with me but was not one of my closer friends. He was someone I got together with in the morning to discuss the previous evening&#8217;s episode of &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s Flying Circus&#8221; and to relive every one of the sketches. I had no idea of what his sexuality was. When he left school, it turned out that he was homosexual. He was not someone who was open about that. He eventually had sex and, on the one occasion that he did, he caught AIDS, which he then died from. He died from it in misery because his family were ashamed of him and more or less kept him isolated from the wider family, the community and his friends.</p><p>Such experiences, which were not unique, fundamentally changed the attitude of the generation that subsequently emerged. It made us realise that this was an illness that had to be faced and, like all other illnesses that have affected populations, it has to have every resource and effort put into defeating it.</p><p>I do not wish to distinguish HIV and AIDS from all sorts of other sexual diseases. We have appalling rates of chlamydia in society. At a school that I was speaking at last week, it was clear that many young people do not know that the Government has a first-class website that is designed to educate young people, in terms that they can best understand, about sexual health and all the protections and so on of which they need to be aware. That is true whether young people are gay or straight, which is another big issue that everybody is now perfectly open to discussing.</p><p>More must be done. As each new generation of children comes through school, we tend to forget that we launched something to people who have now left school, are off to university and have gone beyond.

Both President Obama and former President Bush were in Tanzania earlier this year, and President Obama again commended President Bush&#8217;s president&#8217;s emergency plan for AIDS relief, as part of which the biggest single donation by any state in history to tackle a disease was committed by President Bush.

But the fact is that so far he has not done as much to help Africans as President Bush did. We understand he has problems at home, but truly we are still hoping that he will help us more before he retires.&#8221;</p><p>The United States is the international leader in all of this, although we play our part as a community and as a country here.

Based on the old three-score-years-and-ten rule, most of us have known only an era in which the aspiration that most people continue to share begins with a starter home, leading to marriage and partnership and a family home, and then in due course for some downsizing, or for others the hope that they will end their days in their family home so full of memory and personal attachment.</p><p>However, our housing model has depended on houses becoming available to the market and&#8212;speaking frankly&#8212;on people dying. A radically different society, in which people consciously aspire to live alone and in which at least one adult of a couple may live on to great age, makes that model increasingly unsustainable. If larger family homes do not become available as regularly, and if affluent singles occupy sizeable properties, we have an even more acute crisis ahead of us.</p><p>It seems to me that we have to recognise now that, if we are collectively going to live much longer and to an age when we are more frail and less able to manage a larger property, we need to evolve a model of living that actively anticipates that it is a natural transition, rather than an exceptional one, to expect to vacate a substantial family property for more suitable accommodation in order to enjoy the new fourth era of life, great old age, with as much self-sufficiency as possible. We need to plan for that by recognising that the spread of new-build housing must focus much more directly on the building of properties that make that possible&#8212;not building ghettos for the old where they will be isolated from life and from the people they knew, but using a significant planning requirement to provide within new developments properties that are specifically designed for independent living in greater old age.</p><p>If housing policy does not plan now for an ageing population, not only will we have the challenge of the huge demographic change to meet in our health service, we will be compounding it by having those in great old age living in completely unsuitable properties, however suitable they may once have been, suffering falls and incurring huge and unnecessary maintenance bills beyond their means. By doing so, we will have even more families unable to find the homes that they desperately require.</p><p>I look at all the facts, promises and claims by one side or the other to have the unique recipe for housing salvation&#8212;a wave of the independence wand or a simple change of Government or the renouncing of past policy. It is a delusion to imagine that any of those will transform our position. If we worked with a greater sense of purpose and one free of rhetorical legislative flourishes that see barely a brick laid as a result, and if we accept that we need a hugely mixed model and one that requires bold, visionary planning, thinking and financing for the future, underpinned by wider political co-operation, we might just make some progress.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22784886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps I will give way later.

As well as to his experiences in France&#8212;which I, of course, regard as a model for nothing at all&#8212;he referred several times to the experiences of his generation. I do not know what age Christian Allard is, but the concept of generation struck me because, I have to say, when I was growing up in the 1960s, drug taking was presented as a highly glamorous thing. Drugs were the food of film stars, of Hollywood, of fashion, of racy society in London, of smart parties. If people died of drug addiction, it was due not to &#8220;an overdose&#8221; but to &#8220;an attack of the vapours&#8221; or to their having &#8220;a fragile constitution&#8221;. Nothing bleak really was portrayed in that language. As we went through later into the 1960s, drug taking was the way that people escaped the realities of Vietnam and LSD was the creative food underpinning the pop movement of the time.</p><p>Yet, in her opening speech, Roseanna Cunningham, in a completely unadorned and factual way, got us right back to the fact that in the second decade of the 21st century the reality is that we had the highest number of deaths in Scotland through drugs. Those were not people at smart society parties or film stars or people who were part of the creative process; in all too many cases&#8212;though some, perhaps, might have had too much money&#8212;they were, as has been said through the course of today&#8217;s debate, people who through circumstances of poverty and inequality had been led to that situation.</p><p>An important point underpinning the reason why we are considering the report is that, for the first time, a majority of those drug deaths were as a result of methadone. The fact that a majority of those on methadone who died were not on a methadone prescription led to the need for the recommendations that we have been considering. Another depressing fact is that, even within that, the death rate in Lothian was twice as high as the rate in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, although they are similar demographic areas. There are all sorts of underpinning trends in there that require to be addressed.</p><p>That is why it is important that there must be a real equality and a standard in the way that community pharmacies dispense methadone and in the services that they deliver. Those who have been dying of methadone not on a prescription have sourced that from somewhere. Unfortunately, it has probably come from those who were being prescribed methadone, so that standard is very important. In saying that, I do not take anything away from the tribute that Dennis Robertson paid to the commitment of community pharmacies. I have visited community pharmacies as well and I have seen that, and I understand that their commitment is very real.</p><p>Underpinning many of the recommendations is not just a legislative will. The reason why Roseanna Cunningham could be so unadorned and frank in her speech is that there is appreciation in the Parliament that the subject should be approached on a cross-party consensual basis and that there is no mileage to be gained in exploiting bad news where bad news exists and requires to be dealt with. Underpinning many of the recommendations is not some legislation but a tremendous effort and commitment by human capital going forward in what is not a glamorous task. That represents a huge task, which we should appreciate.</p><p>Sandra White introduced the issue of prisons. Information that came to me that I found depressing suggests that, in Saughton prison, some 400 of the 800 inmates are on methadone. They rarely detoxify. There are only two full-time addiction nurses, who have a case load of 200 people each compared with, say, a case load of 30 to 50 in the wider community. That depressing fact is another example of the huge challenge that we need to tackle.</p><p>On a lighter note, Presiding Officer, when you said that you were unable to hear Jamie Hepburn, I was going to offer to swap seats with you. Of course, Mr Hepburn makes a profession of gently admonishing me in debates, so let me return the compliment by saying that today his contribution was a model, if not a triumph, of improvisation.</p><p>Willie Rennie told us about Phoenix Futures and how everyone was hugging each other as they came through the door. As a father with children, I would do much the same at the sight of a Liberal Democrat&#8212;particularly on &#8220;Scotland Tonight&#8221;, I should say.</p><p>We heard from Stewart Stevenson about his personal experience in the reign of King James VI, while Jim Eadie and other members mentioned the need to tackle the stigma that substance misusers face.</p><p>I pay tribute to the work of the Scottish Drugs Forum and the addiction worker training project. I know that the minister has visited that project because on the wall there was a photo of her along with many of those there.</p><p>Without exciting the temper of the debate, I note that one thing that would most help women to recover would be greater childcare. I hope that we can resist making the obvious point in that regard in the context of this week. Anne McTaggart focused on the trauma that affects families and the circumstances that led to that trauma. Those families want to see a greater understanding, appreciation and projection of that into recovery and, as Willie Rennie said, recovery is an improving situation if we define it as such.</p><p>Elaine Murray and Graeme Pearson argued the Labour Party&#8217;s amendment in constructive terms, and we are happy to support it.

I was only four years old and surprisingly I can remember where I was when I heard about Kennedy. It was the following day and I could not understand why my grandparents were so uninvolved in the first episode of &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221;. I was enthralled. &#8220;The President has been killed,&#8221; they told me by way of explanation. Yeah, well, who? Whatever.</p><p>Then, blow me, because of &#8220;That man Kennedy&#8221; the first episode had to be repeated the following week and it was a whole fortnight before I could find out what had transpired. That was the perspective of a four-year-old at the time.</p><p>Back to Kennedy. I have read plenty about him and his family since, and, despite all that, I remain fairly unimpressed. His father was a fascist-supporting ambassador to the United Kingdom who did all that he could to frustrate any US involvement in disrupting the progress of Hitler and the Nazis. His mother acquiesced in his father&#8217;s sanctioning of a lobotomy on her sister. His younger brother abandoned a woman to drown in a car crash. When in office, he and his brother Bobby shared women, took drugs and behaved reprehensibly and in a way that would lead to their being hounded out of office today. They gave J Edgar Hoover all the material that he needed in effect to blackmail the presidency of the United States. His father fixed votes in the presidential election in 1960 that saw JFK elected as President. He initiated America&#8217;s substantive involvement in Vietnam. He was responsible for the Bay of Pigs fiasco. It was his successor, Lyndon B Johnson, who did all the heavy lifting on the landmark civil rights legislation. He did not do that just in memory of JFK. LBJ was personally hugely committed to driving through that civil rights legislation and it was LBJ who drove through most of the social legislation that remains at the heart of the US today.</p><p>To Kennedy&#8217;s credit, he conducted himself heroically when the ship that he was commanding, PT109, was attacked and sunk in the second world war. His single-handed rescuing of members of his crew demonstrated outstanding and immense personal courage. Although there are some who carp over the details and the cold war consequences, he deserves every credit for the way in which he managed the Cuban missile crisis.</p><p>Deborah Devonshire, the dowager duchess and the youngest and only surviving Mitford sister, knew him well. JFK&#8217;s sister Kathleen, known as Kik, married Deborah&#8217;s brother-in-law. Kik and her husband were to die in an air tragedy, the consequence of which was that Deborah&#8217;s husband acceded to the dukedom. The Devonshires and the Kennedys stayed in touch. The Devonshires attended the inauguration and JFK, when President, visited Chatsworth to the wide-eyed astonishment of the people who were queuing up to tour the house on that day. In her autobiography, &#8220;Wait for Me!&#8221;, Deborah Devonshire testifies to JFK&#8217;s immense charm, vitality and sense of purpose. For those of us under a certain age, that is something that we never saw, but I defer to her assessment. The Kennedys had charm.</p><p>That charm was manifested in Jackie&#8212;Jackie, who created Camelot and captured the imagination of the wider world. Like Camelot, though, it was an idealised fiction. In my view, JFK is remembered because his assassination was the first globally televised news event of its kind. In 1963, people in the US and across the world shared the shock and raw emotion of his assassination, of Dallas, of Lee Harvey Oswald, of Jack Ruby, of the flight home to Washington, of Jackie&#8217;s blood-spattered suit, of the horse with the reversed boots, of John junior&#8217;s salute to his father at the funeral, of the Zapruder film footage. This was a President who represented the youth, glamour and ambition of the post-second world war generation. They mourned the &#8220;what might have been&#8221; of all that youth, vigour and purpose being cut off so dramatically before their eyes and in his prime, but it cannot disguise that he was flawed and must remain a largely unknown quantity.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755033", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: John F Kennedy Assassination (50th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, &#8220;From Dallas Texas, the flash, apparently official: &#8216;President Kennedy died at 1 pm Central Standard Time.&#8217; 2 o&#8217;clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.&#8221; I think that most people have seen Walter Cronkite&#8217;s broadcast, in which he brought to the world the official confirmation of the President&#8217;s assassination.

It is a magnificent red sandstone, glass and steel construction, and I very much welcomed the opportunity to have the tour and to go into the bowels of the Burrell collection to see the thousands of exhibits that have not yet seen the light of day.</p><p>Some of them, I have to say, may be less fascinating than others. Sir William had an extensive collection of Tudor beds. I do not know whether, if we brought all the Tudor beds out and lined them all up, we would draw in the public from around the world to see them. They looked somewhat less than fascinating to me. However, in addition to the Tudor beds there is a terrific array of art that has never yet found its place in the presentation of the collection.</p><p>People sometimes forget not just the range and size of Sir William&#8217;s collection but the fact that, whether it is a Chinese vase, a Degas pastel, a Flemish tapestry or a renaissance bit of silver, he collected only the very best. In the Burrell collection, Glasgow and Scotland have a priceless jewel of art that reaches across everything that we could imagine.</p><p>The building is in a terrible state, as Mark Griffin and others said. I ask members to imagine a giant sponge, which is now waterlogged, between the ceiling and the roof. That means that the leaks can manifest anywhere in the building but not necessarily where they manifested in the roof above the sponge.</p><p>Having first thought that the renovation could, perhaps, be phased, we were persuaded that it could not and would have to be undertaken with the museum closing in the interim. We then had to decide whether the promoter&#8217;s proposition of putting the collection on tour was appropriate. Could it somehow be put in the local church hall or something like that in the interim? Of course, modern standards of presentation and for ensuring that the collection is secure in temperature and every other sense mean that just shoving it into the building next door is not a possibility.</p><p>The question then came down to whether the committee felt&#8212;this was a very serious proposition&#8212;that we should set aside Sir William&#8217;s will. It was mentioned that Edinburgh and London had both argued for the collection in the first place. If they had known that they were going to be able to set aside all the conditions of the collection, they might have bid that much harder.</p><p>We agonised in some detail over whether to set aside the terms of the will. We took legal advice on how long from the point at which a collection is gifted the terms of the will must prevail. Can they prevail in perpetuity? Is that reasonable? Circumstances change and 50 years have passed.</p><p>We heard about the way in which art is now exported abroad and the security that is attached to that. It turns out that the most dangerous period for art is not when it is in a plane being shifted across to some far country but when the porters remove it in the first place to put it in the box. They are likely to drop it, and that is where some sensational failures have occurred.</p><p>We were persuaded that it is right to give the fantastic collection an opportunity to be seen on a one-off tour around the world, promoting Glasgow, Scotland and the collection itself. We hope that that tour will, in future, bring to Scotland visitors who will see and promote the collection.</p><p>I, too, thank the clerks and everybody who gave evidence.

It is good to have him back.</p><p>When we started the debate, I feared that we would get involved in the ritualistic and tribal attacks on the health service in England and the coalition policies there. I have said previously in debates that we hold no candle for what goes on in the health service in England. This is a devolved Parliament and we have a devolved health service. We are quite happy to seek to make the health service in Scotland the best that it can be and we understand and accept that that is on the basis of the health service that exists just now.

She also talked about the way that patients are dealt with in hospital. I say to Fiona McLeod that I do not think that Nanette Milne referred to the 1950s; that would mean that Dr Milne was in her mid-80s. It would be ungallant to suggest that&#8212;indeed, it is impossible that it could be so.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm also made the point that patients have to be talked to as persons, not things, when they are in hospital. GPs manage that interaction better. Many of us who have been in hospital have found ourselves being spoken to rather loudly and as if we are in some way incapable of understanding the normal English that is spoken to us.</p><p>I do not know whether Bob Doris is going to like this at all, but I found his contribution this afternoon one of the least blindly tribal that I have heard him make in all my years in Parliament, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I have to tell him that I was nominated for that once and then lost to Shirley-Anne Somerville, who then lost her seat. I leave it to him to establish what the moral of that example is.</p><p>I turn to the issue of GP access. We underestimate the public response to the way that we have talked about accident and emergency departments being centres of excellence. We have all understood that the greater the range of specialisms that exist within an A and E department, the more successful treatment of patients is likely to be.</p><p>However, we have underestimated the success of that approach, which a lot of members of the public have registered by cutting out the middle man and going straight to A and E. We must ensure that people understand that GPs are there for a very particular purpose, and that is why I welcome what the cabinet secretary said about making GPs more accessible.</p><p>We have talked about the provision of walk-in centres in some of Scotland&#8217;s cities as a way forward, and I hope that that happens. They already have walk-in centres in England. It is interesting that, when patients were asked where they would have gone if not to the walk-in centre, 40 per cent said that they would have gone straight to accident and emergency, with only 20 per cent saying that they would have gone to their GP. We must ensure that there are online repeat prescriptions and that appointments are made available. Perhaps our GPs would benefit from spending some contractual time in accident and emergency departments in order to persuade patients that, in going to their GP, they are going to a local centre of excellence, just as an accident and emergency department is a centre of excellence. That idea, which has been suggested by some down south, is worth exploring.</p><p>We should also look at the growing number of people who do not attend the appointments that are made for them. Effective communication must underpin the appointments system. My most recent visit to hospital as an in-patient was a couple of years ago, after which I had follow-up appointments. I invariably received notice of my appointment on the day that it was taking place. As it happened, I was not doing anything else, so I was able to attend, but that was not ideal. Indeed, some people will miss their appointment because some sort of slow mail process is used to advise them of when their appointment is. It is also not helpful that people are unable to get appointments in our hospitals and GP surgeries because the appointments are booked by those who then find themselves well but are not disposed to let anybody know that they no longer need their appointment, thereby freeing up the service for others.</p><p>I have talked before about the Conservative view of a national universal health visiting service. I still believe that that would be of fundamental value to much of what we are discussing, because it relates to preventative care, which, in the long run, is how we reduce the burden on GPs and hospitals.</p><p>We will support the rather cheeky amendment that the Labour Party slipped in. Maintaining waiting time targets will be a challenge this winter, and all the health boards would do well to follow NHS Lothian&#8217;s example and be candid about exactly where they think that the pressure points will be. It is better to know those now than to find out in a distressed situation.

Indeed, as Neil Findlay, Malcolm Chisholm, Christine Grahame and several other members have pointed out, the whole process began with petitioners raising the issue for us. From that, we got a far better understanding of the reality of what was happening and, as politicians, we had to confront that truth. Mr McDonald said that he was unique in being a member of the Health and Sport Committee and the Public Petitions Committee but I can assure him that Nanette Milne was bristling with impatience at that point, having also been a member of both when these matters were being discussed. However, although his experience might not have been unique, we can agree that Mr McDonald is and leave it at that.</p><p>I particularly liked two speeches in the debate. First, I was very impressed with Ken Macintosh&#8217;s personalised speech, which detailed individuals&#8217; very practical experience and really spoke to the point that I tried to make, which is that we are living in an era of rapidly advancing technology, to which we must be able to respond quickly. We must not forget that every sufferer is an individual.</p><p>Mr Macintosh mentioned ipilimumab, and the effectiveness of the new PAC system will be determined by whether it improves patient access to innovative treatments. An early test of the system might lie in whether patients are able to access a new drug for melanoma. Ipilimumab is expected to receive a European licence next month for first-line treatment of patients with melanoma, having already been approved by the SMC for patients requiring second-line treatment. When the drug first received a licence in 2011 for patients who already received therapy, it represented the first advance in treating the disease in 30 years. Several of us attended an excellent briefing at which we met relations of those who suffered and died from that cancer but who had an extraordinary end-of-life improvement as a result of access to the drug through trials elsewhere. In fact, some using the drug survived well past the original expectations. Despite that, however, all 30 IPTR applications that clinicians made for the drug were turned down. We must not see history repeating itself over the coming months.</p><p>Christine Grahame said that some constituents were not told about the IPTR process. I think that some clinicians and GPs simply lost faith in the process. Indeed, some will say that they were told not to bother making an application, as a determination had already been made and there was no point. Such things must be overcome. Ms Grahame also made points similar to mine about the importance of knowing what is going to happen in the here and now, between today and the end of the year, to ensure that, after all the positive stuff that we have discussed today, people do not find themselves left in the wash.</p><p>Presiding Officer, you have given me an extra minute, which I was not expecting.

In the middle ages, the witch who drowned was deemed to be innocent; she was burned if she did not drown. As late as the Victorian era, children were still hanged for relatively minor offences. I know that some people would like to portray the modern-day Conservative Party as wanting to return to such methods of justice.</p><p>Almost to the disappointment of some&#8212;but to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s relief, I hope&#8212;the debate has proved to be consensual. All sides have quickly recognised that the response to the question that was posed in the motion that the cabinet secretary moved is, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; We are all of a mind that it is time to look at the subject.</p><p>My substantive contribution will be about employers and rehabilitation. Before I discuss that, I pay tribute to Christine Grahame, Mary Fee, Alison McInnes, Roderick Campbell, Anne McTaggart, Jamie Hepburn&#8212;whose filibuster was extraordinary&#8212;and John Finnie for their speeches.</p><p>I will speak about the position of employers as somebody who was one&#8212;I employed between 500 and 600 people. Kenny MacAskill was right to say that some employers see it almost as their duty not to employ people who have criminal records. As an employer, I recognised that. I found that people in my organisation believed, the minute that it was established that somebody had any kind of previous criminal conviction, that that automatically excluded them from any future role in the business. I fought quite hard against that.</p><p>However, it should be recognised that employers are taking a risk. It is not a sure-fire bet, as Roderick Campbell might have tried to suggest; there are occasions on which employers take risks but find that they were wrong to do so. I am looking across at Graeme Pearson because we talked on a train one afternoon about a perfect example of that; he discussed the position of a particular individual when he, wearing his former hat, was in the business.</p><p>There is risk, but there is also responsibility. The definition of rehabilitation is that people will get jobs and be able to be reintegrated into society. Therefore, we should talk up the public duty and worth to employers of being prepared to employ people who have criminal records. We acknowledge employers who give to charity and those who participate in public life in other ways, but we do not really talk up the advantage of employing former offenders or the duty that we should perhaps require.</p><p>I remember participating in something that was known as the Airborne Initiative, which was a worthwhile project that involved ex-military people working hard with offenders. The late Tommy Burns and I were both introduced to it by George Younger. We should think carefully about how to make employers feel that they have a responsibility to become more publicly associated with such initiatives. It would be useful to discuss that.</p><p>The second area that I want to mention is rehabilitation. It so happens that one or two Conservatives whom I have known have ended up behind bars. I know that there are those who think that that is an appropriate place for all Conservatives to end up, but I mention them in the knowledge that they met some Labour Party members when they were there, that the Liberal Democrats have a recent Cabinet example, and that the SNP side might in due course also, under early release, have some fairly fresh knowledge of its own about the criminal justice system.</p><p>The point that I want to make is that Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken, who were both in prison, spoke about their experience when they came out, and about the thoroughly depressing fact of illiteracy among prisoners and their inability to complete basic forms that would allow them to be employed. They were able to help with that, but the cohort of people in prison who can do so is limited. A moment ago, I was talking about employers being more encouraged to introduce people into the world of work. In the same way, perhaps we as a political class need to work with employers to see whether we can get some of them to participate within prisons to prepare people for the world of work when they come out.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There stands a motto for the afternoon.

It was a terrific way of illustrating something that should be celebrated.</p><p>I was quite struck by the pre-debate briefing. I have been watching the television series &#8220;Who Do You Think You Are?&#8221; and this season opened with a profile of Una Stubbs. I sometimes find such programmes rather contrived but this one was particularly interesting because her relative, Sir Ebenezer Howard, founded Welwyn Garden City in 1919&#8212;quite a bit of time after Westerton was founded, although the same principles were at stake. Sir Ebenezer gave most of his wealth, health and life to the establishment of a community that was meant to be one in which everybody would have access to space, to services and to a community, as well as one that would be affordable. Yet several years earlier, just to the north of Glasgow, a community was established on the same basis. That is very much to be applauded.</p><p>What strikes me in the photographic montages that I have seen is the sheer class of the design. This was affordable social housing that had style. In fact, many would envy it if they were to see it replicated today. It was designed to be affordable social housing but not perfunctory&#8212;there was not a lower standard of expectation. It allowed people to enjoy a much higher quality of life. How disappointing it is that that did not continue. For decades thereafter, in essence I suppose because of the rush and the need for housing, that model of planning was perhaps lost. Westerton survives 100 years on, while many examples that were built much more recently have long since been demolished and are gone.</p><p>Is there hope? I think that there is. I was very pleased to be able to tour&#8212;as I know other members have&#8212;the Commonwealth games village that has now been built and which of course is designed to be very much an affordable social model. When people go round that village, they see the opportunity for a whole new community&#8212;not dissimilar to Westerton&#8212;with facilities and with access to open areas around it. It is of a standard that I think will inspire families to enjoy life rather than simply having a roof over their heads. That is one of the things that, from back in 1913 to now, we should celebrate.</p><p>Sir John Stirling Maxwell obviously had a personal commitment to the project and it is interesting that, subsequently, Sir John donated Pollok house, his home in the south of Glasgow, to the National Trust and Pollok gardens, now Pollok park, to the people of Glasgow as a green lung, so opportunities for the public to participate in a community that offered so much more extended way beyond Westerton.

Yesterday&#8212;extraordinarily&#8212;the Government made a virtue of the small change that it will make to early release, which is a U-turn of extraordinary proportions. For the past six years, when Annabel Goldie and Ruth Davidson have raised the issue, the First Minister has not said that he agreed with them and that he would make the change when he could; he has said that they were fundamentally wrong. We have accepted that the legislation that we passed in 1993 was wrong. In 1997, we had proposals to change it.</p><p>For those of us in the chamber yesterday afternoon, it was an extraordinary spectacle to see the First Minister having to prompt the Cabinet Secretary for Justice on the scope of the proposed legislation. We have a U-turn that would end automatic early release for just 2 per cent of the people who were convicted last year. That programme does not substantiate the claim that the Government will end automatic early release. It will do the bare minimum and, even in doing that, it owes an apology to the people who have for the past six years campaigned for the policy.</p><p>I pay particular attention to Aileen McLeod&#8217;s speech, if only because I think that the words &#8220;I believe&#8221; were used in that remarkable contribution more often than in the Bachelors&#8217; song. I revisited the lyrics of that song, which I commend to her for a future speech. She could paraphrase them like this:</p><p>&#8220;I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows&#8221;</p><p>in an independent Scotland.</p><p>&#8220;I believe that somewhere in the darkest night our candle glows&#8221;</p><p>in an independent Scotland.</p><p>Aileen McLeod lambasted the Conservative Government&#8212;the coalition Government&#8212;at Westminster&#8212;</p><p>Members: Oh.</p><p>I do not understand the drama. Aileen McLeod lambasted the Conservative Secretary of State for Health in the coalition Government at Westminster for not proceeding yet with plain packaging of cigarettes. All summer we heard from the Scottish Government and SNP members that the SNP would introduce legislation on that, yet page 74 of the programme says that the Government</p><p>&#8220;will consult ... with the intention of introducing legislation in 2014-15.&#8221;</p><p>That is no different from the Westminster Government&#8217;s position. We can wait and see what happens in Australia and, if that proves to be effective, we will introduce legislation elsewhere, too. That is another example of rhetoric not being matched by the programme.</p><p>Nearly 500 days after the minimum unit pricing legislation was passed, the Government has had two debates on its programme, but it has not had another word to say on alcohol. To that extent, I applaud the contribution of Richard Simpson&#8212;whom I am pleased to see with us in the chamber&#8212;in bringing forward constructive proposals, which we urged on the then Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy when we supported MUP as the next stage. The Government, not the Opposition, should lead on that.</p><p>The debate has been all about independence. I believe that independence would be deeply damaging for communities across Scotland. In my support, I call Dennis Robertson, who commended to us over the summer a motion to congratulate Banchory trampoline club on winning the British championships and to wish Graham Ross every success in the future. Poor Graham would be denied the chance to defend his title; I say to Dennis Robertson that Graham would not be able to compete in the British trampolining championships. I have no doubt that the First Minister will tell us that he would personally see to it that such participation was still allowed.</p><p>We are in a five-year parliamentary session&#8212;the longest session at Holyrood. Two and a half years into it, we have a lacklustre and uninteresting programme. All that the Government concentrates on is independence in the future. By September next year, we will have spent two and a half years debating independence. That was the Government&#8217;s judgment. Next year&#8217;s programme for government speech will need fresh leadership to give this tired Government a way forward. If Scotland rejects independence, the people who were responsible for putting Scotland through the agony of two and a half years of the debate will need to stand down and be replaced by people who can offer the people of Scotland a more imaginative programme.</p><p>As Mike Russell said&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "All of us in the chamber distinctly heard Annabelle Ewing refer to her experience as a Westminster MP.

I thank Duncan McNeil for lodging the motion, and I note that ASH has endured for 40 years.</p><p>After that, I am afraid that I am not going to be very nice, because I have a number of reservations. First, I declare a vested interest: I am a lifelong non-smoker. I abhor smoke. Growing up, I would come home on the school bus, which had the bench seats upstairs. You could have cut the atmosphere on the top deck of the bus with a knife and fork. I agree with everything that Stewart Stevenson said about smoking and its effect on public health, and the loss of life that it has caused over many years.</p><p>I am prepared to attribute to ASH some of the credit for many of the initiatives that Duncan McNeil listed, although many of those initiatives were progressed by committed politicians on all sides of the political divide out of conviction, and not just because an external agency was lobbying for them.</p><p>My reservations about ASH relate to its funding. Of the &#163;1.2&#160;million that it received last year, only &#163;23,000 came from donations that it received, as a charity, from the public, whereas &#163;569,000 came from the Government. Of the voluntary income component of &#163;307,000, a further &#163;250,000 came from the Government, and &#163;33,000 came from NHS Scotland.</p><p>I suppose that what really concerns me is that donations were received from the British Heart Foundation and Cancer Research UK. I say that because I do not know that, when people give money to those organisations in voluntary appeals, they realise that some of it is transferred directly, by way of a grant, to a campaigning organisation such as ASH. That knowledge would not change my donation. I donate a considerable amount of money to Cancer Research UK each year, but I do so because I think that the organisation is researching into a cure for cancer. I think that there needs to be more transparency on where the funding comes from and where it goes.</p><p>I look at where the money was spent. Of the &#163;1.2&#160;million, &#163;910,000 was spent on salaries. Very little was spent on campaigning; indeed, expenditure on publications and the website fell over the past year. At the same time, expenditure on fees to consultancies and on travel to attend various conferences increased.</p><p>I want to see direct action to assist people to reduce their smoking. I want to see smoking levels being reduced. I want people who want to give up smoking to be given every encouragement to do that. I want every effort to be made to reduce smoking among young people.</p><p>However, I am also pragmatic in as much as I do not want to hitch myself to every bandwagon that is going. I note that ASH says that it supports only things that are fundamentally evidence based. If that is the case, I would prefer to see the empirical evidence from Australia on plain packaging before I assert that that will make a difference. If it does, I will be very happy to support it, but if it does not, the campaign for plain packaging is a campaign towards a false promise. If it does not contribute to reducing smoking, a legislative solution that promotes something that, ultimately, is proven not to work is not a sensible use of our time.</p><p>Similarly, I note that ASH Scotland says that we should support the member&#8217;s bill to make it illegal to smoke in cars where children are present. I have huge concerns about the enforceability of that. For example, will children, as the only witnesses, be called to give evidence against their parents? I do not know.</p><p>For all that, I think that people at the age of 40 should stand on their own two feet, not on public subsidies, and I want ASH to cease its public funding and make its own way in the world by encouraging the public to give it the money that it needs.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: ASH Scotland&#8217;s 40th Anniversary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I suppose that, in what constitutes an all-night sitting for this Parliament, it is appropriate, at the fag end of the day, that we should be discussing ASH.

I will not add to the flattery, because they have had 10 years of that and have found that it does not butter many parsnips. I think that they will have whole-heartedly welcomed the cabinet secretary&#8217;s speech.</p><p>I am a co-convener of the cross-party group on chronic pain and a member of the Public Petitions Committee, which heard the Susan Archibald petition. Margo MacDonald asked, &#8220;What is chronic pain?&#8221; She knew the answer, but she legitimately asked how people who do not suffer from chronic pain can define its severity.</p><p>Some might have thought that you were the definition of chronic pain, Presiding Officer, when you said that we had a 14-minute speech from the cabinet secretary ahead of us. Some of us in the cross-party group have found new ways to define pain that I am sure that some members present today will recognise.</p><p>Chronic pain is sterilely described as</p><p>&#8220;continuous, long-term pain lasting more than 12 weeks, or pain persisting after the time that healing would have been expected to occur after trauma or injury.&#8221;</p><p>I cannot pretend to know what chronic pain that lasts longer than 12 weeks is. I am a chronic migraine sufferer, and have been all my life. My migraines last for 72 hours. I can only describe what that is like for me.</p><p>Imagine a plain red brick, which is central to the entire construction of a four-storey building. It suddenly shatters. You can see that if you pulled it back into alignment, all would be well, but you cannot.</p><p>Imagine now that brick inside a human being. Imagine the grating noise of that brick and your every function starting to become debilitated and unable to operate normally. Your neck cannot support your head. There is pain and a feeling of nausea that exudes not from your stomach but from every pore in your body.</p><p>Other people laugh at a joke. You laugh, too&#8212;you still can&#8212;but at the end of it, that pain, nausea and discomfort are still there. You go on holiday, as other people do. They enjoy the view; you sit there absorbing the view while absorbing the continuous pressure and pain. Other people eat a meal and enjoy it; you eat a meal because you have to&#8212;no enjoyment comes from it at all. The pain is continuous.</p><p>Last week I had for the first time in years what I call a chronic migraine. It lasted three days, during parliamentary business. In the time that I was not in the chamber, I was flat on my back, unable to sleep or get any relief.</p><p>I participated in a debate, but I wrote the speech out because I was not sure that I could recall any of it or have the ability to construct sentences were the speech not in front of me. Afterwards, I was told by some people who wrote to me that it was one of my better speeches&#8212;I am not sure what the moral of that story is. Migraine also affects your vision, which becomes blurred, and you cannot concentrate. Even Paul Wheelhouse looked young and Tory again from where I was standing. Migraine is completely debilitating.</p><p>If, when suffering a chronic migraine, I had an electric drill, I could put it to my head and drill into the source of the pain to relieve the pressure. So, I understood Susan Archibald when she told the Public Petitions Committee that she has considered suicide because of the pain that she has endured. It becomes a mental health condition and leads to people having alcohol problems&#8212;they try to dull the pain that they endure&#8212;or to problems with drugs. People with chronic pain take medication at the prescribed dose but it makes no difference, so they take more than the prescribed dose and it still makes no difference. It is a fundamentally debilitating condition, but they look perfectly normal to everybody else around them and no one has any sense of what they are suffering or enduring.</p><p>For the past 10 years, despite people knowing that we have been talking about chronic pain in Parliament, there has been no significant or material progress towards any kind of long-term relief or hope for sufferers. I therefore welcome whole-heartedly everything that the cabinet secretary has said. I was not being flippant when I said that we would like all three ways of delivering the service to be implemented, because I think that those who suffer from chronic pain would like that approach.</p><p>I suspect that having one centre has appeal because of the cynicism that has grown up among sufferers about the lip service that is paid by health boards and the variable delivery of treatment across health boards in Scotland. A physical centre would exist and would have to be resourced, but I think that many people would also like the option of a local facility to which they would have access.</p><p>Jackie Baillie talked about sending people to Bath. Has anybody been to Bath of late? From Scotland, that is a monumental journey for anybody. I do not suppose that taking one&#8217;s family there is the equivalent of trying to get there while suffering from chronic pain&#8212;although with my family it would feel very similar&#8212;but it takes a long time to get there. I ask members to imagine doing the 1,600-mile round trip while suffering that degree of pain. Having a facility in Scotland is therefore a major step forward and I welcome that.</p><p>Some 780,000 people suffer not as I do, periodically for a 72-hour period, but for weeks on end or permanently&#8212;for the whole of their lives. Chronic pain is not a sexy condition in the sense of lots of nurses standing in front of a brand new, shiny building that we can point to while saying, &#8220;There we are. We&#8217;ve now addressed it.&#8221; It is a condition that it takes will, courage and a sense of purpose to deliver progress on. I think that the cabinet secretary is up to that task. I will not say that he is Prince Charming to the Ice Queen of old, although Jackie Baillie tried to turn it into that metaphor, but I think that he is genuinely committed to our making that progress.</p><p>In a fraternal way, I lend my support to Ms Baillie&#8217;s amendment. More important than anything else, this must be the watershed debate after which chronic pain sufferers will be able to say that parliamentarians finally rose to the challenge and made a commitment to deliver real relief to those who suffer from the condition.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the many volunteers to the Parliament.

We are both aware of the strength of feeling expressed through the petition to which others have referred, which has attracted in excess of 10,000 signatures&#8212;no small feat for an island with a population of around 1,400. The public meeting organised by Katy Clark MP gave further expression to that strength of feeling only a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>As the motion notes, some 30 islander jobs are at stake. That is all the more concerning given that Cumbrae is classed as a fragile economy. Together with the loss of the many visits to the station, which are detailed in the motion, that represents a potentially mortal blow: the further loss of around &#163;1 million to the island&#8217;s economy. It is difficult to see how that can be easily absorbed.</p><p>What is not in doubt is the excellence of the facility, which gives rise to the question why has the Higher Education Funding Council for England withdrawn funding to the University of London? What are also not in doubt are the location of the university marine biological station and the excellence of the education experience to be gained. Cumbrae is ideally situated for the field courses in marine biology and microbiology. There is a variety of shore to hand and other coastal habitats are all within walking or cycling&#8212;which everybody does&#8212;distance of the marine station. In addition, the diversity of species and environmental conditions provide many opportunities for learning and investigation.</p><p>As Professor Mark Blaxter, a biologist at the University of Edinburgh, who co-ordinated the petition observed:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only coastal field station in the UK that students can visit&#8212;1,200 from all over the UK visited last year.</p><p>It&#8217;s the place they go to experience on the shore and on boats what they&#8217;ve only heard about in lecture theatres. It&#8217;s where we see students turning from rank amateurs into being able to spout Latin names&#8212;it&#8217;s an incredibly important resource.&#8221;</p><p>For all those reasons, some 30 UK and European institutions use the facility, utilising some 6,000 to 7,000 bed nights annually.</p><p>In suggesting that the cabinet secretary intervene, I do not mean to suggest that he has shown any lack of interest. He is not a superficial man, and I am certain that he will have a complete and genuine grasp of the issues and what is at stake. Nor do I underestimate the future investment that seems to be required. I also support the considerable efforts of North Ayrshire Council, which will be all the more productive the more inclusive they prove to be. However, the arguments support the retention and development of the station not only because its loss will have a negative impact on those who wish to study marine science, but because its loss will have a lasting negative impact on the fragile Cumbrae economy. It can never be an industrial hub for heaven&#8217;s sake, but it is a unique centre of marine biology academic excellence that Scotland can ill afford to lose.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691323", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: University Marine Biological Station Millport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Margaret McDougall on securing the debate and on the comprehensive motion that she has advanced.

In addition, we know that many offenders have drug and alcohol problems, which create additional challenges that they must face.</p><p>The pilot strikes me as common sense. It establishes a point of contact between an offender and a named individual and, importantly, it manages the transition from prison to release into the community. Throughcare is routinely available only to offenders on longer sentences, meaning that short-term prisoners who are often in and out of prison for the equivalent of a longer sentence slip through the net. I understand that the pilot will provide support for prisoners who volunteer for the scheme, regardless of their sentence.</p><p>In some ways, Scotland has some catching up to do. In England and Wales, Chris Grayling has said that the United Kingdom Government wants all but the highest risk prisoners to have a dedicated mentor on release from prison. Interestingly, that will see the use of private and voluntary sector groups, who are funded on a payment-by-results basis, something that I hope the Scottish Government will explore. As we heard yesterday during the Queen&#8217;s speech, the UK Government intends to introduce such a scheme in England. A good place to start would be to listen to a detailed interview that I heard this morning on Radio 4 with the voluntary project in England that has been doing just that and whose initiatives have been evaluated as a success.</p><p>We will see further legislation to tackle reoffending south of the border. That will mean that all offenders released from prison will receive at least 12 months&#8217; statutory supervision. That must not be dismissed as a hug-a-hoodie strategy. Anything that ultimately integrates people back into society and reduces reoffending is what we hope will be a consequence of the system.</p><p>We must look at providing throughcare services to all prisoners. Yesterday, we heard&#8212;as Lewis Macdonald said&#8212;about an Education Scotland programme to be rolled out at Polmont, which is to be welcomed. However, those projects should be offered across the prison estate alongside other measures to tackle reoffending.</p><p>On other measures, the Scottish Conservatives have been calling for the introduction of a working week for prisoners to better tackle illiteracy and the lack of employable skills among offenders. We have also talked about the end to automatic early release&#8212;irrespective of whether we at one time introduced it, albeit that we were set to repeal it&#8212;which my party has long campaigned for. That would mean that offenders spend more time in prison being punished but, de facto, they would also spend more time being rehabilitated before the post-prison mentoring programme that we advocate. More needs to be done, and I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s acknowledgement of that point.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690657", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reducing Reoffending (Prisoners&#8217; Assets)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mary Fee&#8217;s first members&#8217; business debate is on a cause well chosen, and I congratulate her on it.

When it was first discussed in the Public Petitions Committee that we should bring the petition to the chamber for debate for three hours, Adam Ingram gave me something of a sideways glance and raised his eyebrows. David Stewart was, however, emphatic that there would be an overwhelming demand among members to participate. He then promptly put his leg in plaster and ensured that he would not be here to participate himself.</p><p>In so doing, David Stewart has missed a debate with what must be a record number of record-length speeches from members. There have been almost House-of-Commons-style opportunities for members to speak and develop their arguments, and I congratulate all the members who have done so. The longer length of speeches has allowed real issues to be explored and teased out in a way that we sometimes do not see. At one point, when Nigel Don and Elaine Murray explained that their political offices had been washed away by floods, as a Conservative I began to wonder whether there is, after all, an upside to the whole issue. However, when I heard that those were parliamentary offices and taxpayers&#8217; money was at stake, that thought was immediately quashed.</p><p>When a debate on the same subject was held just a few weeks ago in the House of Commons, the minister Richard Benyon, who has been referred to several times, summed it all up by saying that most members&#8217; contributions can be assessed as this:</p><p>&#8220;We want a decision and an announcement soon, because our constituents are worried.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 26 March 2013; Vol 560, c 1545.]</p><p>We should not lose sight of the point of the petition. In 54 days&#8217; time, the statement of principles expires. In the event that we do not have an alternative arrangement in place, there will be a free market arrangement in place for the insurance of homes across the whole United Kingdom. That will have dramatic consequences for some people, who will find that their homes are virtually uninsurable. When we bear in mind the fact that, for most home owners, a primary condition of their mortgage is that they have insurance in place for their property, that is an issue not just for people who will need to find new insurance but for home owners who will find that they are in breach of their existing mortgage covenant. Therefore, the issue is of enormous significance.</p><p>As has been said, some 23 per cent of properties in England but only 4.5 per cent of properties in Scotland are at risk. It is also important to remember that the petitioner was not seeking a renewal of the current statement of principles, which is a separate agreement with each of the Governments of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. He recognised that that might not be in the best interests.</p><p>The point that the petitioner was making is that the statement of principles&#8212;which was underpinned by a demand in 2002 that the Governments have stricter planning, that more money be spent on structural flood defences and that more resilient building regulations be adopted&#8212;has largely been implemented in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland but not in England and that, therefore, people in Scotland are to some extent subsidising insurance costs in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p>This chamber wants the Scottish Government to represent the argument with the Westminster Government. When Paul Wheelhouse said that Scottish interests are being represented, I tried to tease out what exactly those interests are. We want to encourage him to have a dispensation reflected in whatever emerges for Scottish home owners, given that the situation now is not as critical as it is elsewhere in the United Kingdom. I will return to that point.</p><p>As Anne McTaggart said, four of the five wettest years on record have occurred since 2000. We have heard about the consequences of that in Stonehaven from Alex Johnstone and Nigel Don, in Cowdenbeath from Helen Eadie, and in Edinburgh from Marco Biagi. Nigel Don went beyond the other speakers in almost qualifying to be a member of the United States Senate with a filibuster special in the time that he was allowed. I should not overlook Elaine Murray, either, who spoke about the River Nith. As I think that Nigel Don said, we do not necessarily want such flooding situations to be examples that we can point to of communities rising to the occasion, but what happened in December in Stonehaven was certainly one such example.</p><p>Maureen Watt made an important point about new development, the addition that it makes to the water table and the displacement that it causes, which is sometimes overlooked. We should recognise that, regardless of the arguments that we might have from time to time about climate change&#8212;I see that the Greens have now arrived; they normally detain us with their views on these matters but they did not feel it necessary to be with us while we were talking about flooding and climate change&#8212;one of the realities that we face as a result of climate change is flooding. Therefore, we must consider how much money we are investing in flood defences.</p><p>Flood management investment was an issue that Sarah Boyack mentioned. As Owen Paterson said in evidence to a House of Commons committee, effective flood defence work also brings back into use land that was otherwise not suitable for development, which can have a profound effect on economic regeneration in the area concerned.</p><p>Am I going to be able to keep this going?</p><p>Sarah Boyack rose&#8212;</p><p>Ah!</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The brief for this speech is that I must be consensual and non-partisan, which is of course what I do.

Maureen Watt, Helen Eadie and others touched on the fact that much of our infrastructure is an old infrastructure that was built to deal with the consequences of a different climate and that it is under enormous pressure.

I was at a hotel at which one was allocated one&#8217;s space for the week. A gentleman arrived at the hotel, and they thought they had better find him someone who was interested in politics to sit beside. I was reading a biography of Margaret Thatcher at the time. The gentleman came up to me immediately and we continued to speak for the rest of the week. That man was Mikhail Gorbachev. He said, &#8220;I want you to know that Margaret Thatcher, together with me and Ronald Reagan, was equally responsible for the great changes that came about in Europe. Those changes came about as a result of the efforts that we made. Each one of us was responsible for that, and don&#8217;t let anybody ever tell you otherwise.&#8221; So, yes&#8212;there is such a thing as society.

That allowed John Major and then Tony Blair to achieve their subsequent success.</p><p>Was it this great society where there was a stampede for industrial candles and small camping stoves to allow us to see and eat during the three-day week of 1974? Was it the land where the Labour Party of all parties, the only party in the history of this country to do so, cut nurses&#8217; pay&#8212;it did not just peg it; it cut it&#8212;in 1976? Was it the land where 29&#160;million days were lost through industrial disputes, but where, by the time Mrs Thatcher left office, the number had declined to just 1&#160;million days? Was it the land where there was a two-year wait for a telephone and where one had to apply for one?

They were divisive because there was no consensus as to how we should go forward. Somebody had to act; she acted and I believe that the country is the better for it.</p><p>More homes are now owned in Scotland and more social houses were built by Margaret Thatcher&#8212;64,000&#8212;than in the entire period subsequent to that, almost. There were more share owners, more cars&#8212;giving people personal mobility&#8212;and more people in further education. Here in Scotland, in each of the three elections that Margaret Thatcher fought, she fought the SNP into a cocked hat. She returned more members of the Conservative Party in Scotland by a ratio of 10:1 than there were SNP members.</p><p>The Labour Party mounted a greater defence, but let us just check the record, because in each of the elections that Margaret Thatcher fought as leader, the share of the vote that the Labour Party obtained in Scotland was less than the share of the vote that Margaret Thatcher obtained throughout the rest of the United Kingdom in total. Yes, there was a coalition against Margaret Thatcher, but there was no coalition in Scotland in favour of any other political party, so she was able to proceed and to change things in Scotland&#8212;I believe for the better.</p><p>I knew Margaret Thatcher; it was the great privilege of my life.

For a number of men who are asked anything about the nether regions, the traditional response is to look the inquirer in the eye and say, &#8220;Church of Scotland,&#8221; before moving on to a different subject. We must recognise that while we have in Scotland an excellent screening programme, we do not have an excellent record on bowel cancer.</p><p>I congratulate Sandra White on securing the motion. In the cancer debate a few weeks ago, I confused the subject with breast cancer&#8212;I was getting my breasts and my bowels confused&#8212;but I absolutely agree with the sentiment of and everything underpinning the motion.</p><p>My father-in-law died of bowel cancer in his early 60s. Bowel cancer will be detected in 4,000 Scots a year, which is one of the highest incident rates in the UK. We also have one of the lowest survival rates across the European Union&#8212;25 per cent of those who are identified with bowel cancer will die. Crucially, 90 per cent of those whose cancer is detected early through screening will survive for five years, while only 7 per cent of those who are detected late will survive for five years. Early screening is crucial. That is what the motion seeks to promote and what my remarks have been directed towards.</p><p>The campaign is aimed at people in their 50s. I know that for some people in their 50s anything beyond Brylcreem and Old Spice is to be thought about only by those who work in the theatre or the BBC; they do not want to talk about grooming. However, the next generation of younger men are more on the ball about health issues, as are the younger generation of children.</p><p>I must say to men in their 50s that they are no longer on the pull. I know that they think that they are still an icon, the glass of fashion and the mould of form, but I am sorry to say that they are in fact past that. Older women are looking for younger toyboys and younger women are interested only in those with a lot of money and, to be frank, that will not be anyone who lives in Scotland. The primary concern of men in their 50s ought to be their survival. If a screening programme is available every two years, for goodness&#8217; sake, take advantage of it and be part of the 90 per cent of those unfortunate to be detected with bowel cancer who have a genuine chance of surviving it.</p><p>Therefore, my message to younger men and to children who have a father in their 50s who is part of the recalcitrant generation in relation to their health is to be aware that the screening programme exists. Tell Dad, &#8220;It ain&#8217;t pretty, but get over it.&#8221; Tell him that he must have the screening done, and ensure that for himself, his family and his generation, he does what will ensure that he is part of the 90 per cent who survive.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688198", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bowel Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am from a generation brought up on &#8220;Carry On&#8221; comedies.

However, I was struck by the language in the early speeches: &#8220;radical&#8221;, &#8220;inclusive&#8221;, &#8220;delivery&#8221;, &#8220;service users&#8221;, &#8220;carers&#8221;, &#8220;governance&#8221;, &#8220;culture&#8221;, &#8220;vision&#8221; and &#8220;ambition&#8221;. That is the sort of corporate language that sometimes drowns out the good intentions that we are all trying to achieve.</p><p>Jackie Baillie talked about an ageing Scotland. I mentioned in Tuesday&#8217;s debate&#8212;some members who are present were not there, so it is worth saying&#8212;that the Parliament is a reflection of that because, when it first met in 1999, only eight members were 60 or older. By the end of this parliamentary session, 46 will be. That is a considerable change in the demographic of the Parliament&#8212;eight members in the first session, 15 in the second, 22 in the third and 46 in this session. Many of them were keen to contribute this afternoon.</p><p>We are dealing with an ageing Scotland. It was Bob Doris, I think, who said that most of us will be part of that within the next 20 years. However, it is not only in the next 20 years; today&#8212;here and now&#8212;the issue is pertinent.</p><p>Jackie Baillie made an important point about the fact that there are competing practices that must be merged. That is a theme throughout the debate. There will be a battle for somebody&#8217;s current practice and culture to prevail but, in fact, nobody&#8217;s culture and practice can be allowed to prevail if integration is to be successful.</p><p>I thought that Nanette Milne was correct when she talked about the importance of local priorities. Jim Hume touched on that. I will have to read his speech carefully, because I lost the plot at one point during it. I promise so to do. I think that he said that Scotland could sleep easy, because he would keep an eye on ensuring that local priorities were respected. That will be fundamental to what happens.</p><p>Two speeches struck me, the first of which was Duncan McNeil&#8217;s. In it, he made two significant points. The first was a highly impassioned plea that we all remember that an improvement in services is at the heart of what we are trying to achieve and that that objective should not be lost. I think that he was advocating a charter of sorts to underpin that. His emphasis on the fact that an improvement in services was necessary is key. His second point was about workforce planning, and it leaked slightly into what Iain Gray talked about subsequently. It is terribly important that the people who are part of the workforce that deliver the integration that we are talking about are the right people in the right jobs who carry out the right functions at the right time and are suitably motivated to do that.</p><p>In between the speeches of Duncan McNeil and Iain Gray, we had a speech from Bob Doris. To borrow an old phrase, he did the crime, but didn&#8217;t do the time, in the sense that he took the extra minutes that were offered to him, but then did not give way as he had promised to do in return for the award of those extra minutes, and poor Jackie Baillie was left floundering. [Laughter.] That might not be the right description.</p><p>For me, the key speech was Iain Gray&#8217;s. I think that he illuminated the experience that we are all trying to legislate to change. I like the phrase</p><p>&#8220;agree the need but resist the change.&#8221;</p><p>In Tuesday&#8217;s debate on an ageing population, when I noted in the Finance Committee&#8217;s report the phrase</p><p>&#8220;dependent on significant cultural change&#8221;,</p><p>I said that I was not optimistic without being pessimistic, because the exigencies of today often get in the way of and stand against the radical and comprehensive change that is needed to prepare for the future. I am concerned about that.</p><p>I thought that Iain Gray made a powerful point when he talked about the language becoming corporate and complicated. We could get to a point at which the language is all-inclusive, in the sense that we are all included in not understanding what it is trying to say to us as efforts are made to deliver the change. Those pitfalls must be avoided. Iain Gray&#8217;s point that the discussions should be about delivery and not about the share of the budget was also a powerful one that registered with me.</p><p>Thereafter, we had some of the usual have-a-bit-of-a-bash-at-one-another contributions. I do not think that they were necessary. Notwithstanding that, the quote of the afternoon came from James Dornan. I took it down. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Having been a councillor in Glasgow City Council, I have seen a payroll vote at work.&#8221;</p><p>I enjoyed that. As someone who has lived in Glasgow but who has never served there&#8212;I am a Conservative, after all&#8212;I have seen the payroll vote at work as well.</p><p>Let me get back to the point of the debate. It has been a debate on the response of the Government to the consultation. I hope that the Government is still open to listening even now that it has given its response. I was grateful to the cabinet secretary for his response to Nanette Milne on councils potentially coming together to work within a single partnership. I think that there are other areas in which, if we are to make the integration process a success and avoid the problem that Iain Gray identified of another generation of politicians&#8212;given that 46 members will be 60 or over by the end of the session, it will probably not be the same generation of politicians&#8212;confronting the same issues in another 13 years, the consensual approach must continue through a partnership of all the political parties here and of all the organisations beyond that we have talked about.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adult Health and Social Care (Integration)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Well, I look to his civil servants to inject more flair and originality into his performances in the chamber, rather than having him read out documents that are in the public domain.

We are past the point at which we can pretend that nothing is wrong in Scotland&#8217;s NHS. The Audit Scotland report&#8212;I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s saying that there will be an earlier review of waiting times&#8212;has highlighted problems. We know that some accident and emergency targets are being missed; we are in denial if we pretend that that is not the case.</p><p>We know that the accident and emergency performance in December was the worst for six years, that nursing vacancies are at a six-year high, that bed-blocking targets are due to be missed, and that the weather, holidays and IT systems do not explain all that. Some of the criticism in the Labour Party&#8217;s motion is due and it is partly fair.</p><p>I want to put at the heart of this afternoon&#8217;s debate the voice of a nurse whom I know personally, who as a teenager lost a relative in the most shocking circumstances and who pursued a career in nursing, as a result. She posted this, on an online forum, to the BBC:</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe anyone has the right to pass comment on a nurses job without having done it! After years of constant stress from abominable staffing levels, constant verbal &amp; physical abuse, lack of support from hospital management, lack of support from the public (not all thankfully), ridiculous expectations from many &amp; countless hours of my own time spent caring for others with nothing but scorn from those who feel I have not done my job properly; I have now spoken with my feet &amp; left the profession that I worked so hard to enter. People complain constantly about the terrible care they receive, but at the end of the day we are only human ... what you see is not the full story. Relatives &amp; patients see only their own circumstance; a nurse juggles you &amp; many others ALL wishing her attention right then &amp; there! I believe I was very good at my job &amp; cared for my patients to the highest standards that were possible; but at the end of the day I had to manage my time ... a wet bed, a turn due, a dressing needs changed, a patient needs the toilet, a patient needs fed, someone wants paracetamol, someone is about to pass away, someone has fallen &amp; there&#8217;s a really sick patient needing transfer to HDU &amp; a handover needs to be given (this patient needs constant monitoring, IVs, documentation &amp; general care), a relative has been waiting to speak to me for 10 minutes &amp; is now getting annoyed, there&#8217;s another relative on the phone &amp; 4 more wanting my attention before the end of visiting (I&#8217;ve spoken to most of them on the phone already today while trying to look after others), an emergency buzzer, a lady wanting into bed, drugs needing made up &amp; given, notes needing written up, bed managers wanting beds cleared and A&amp;amp;E wanting to give handovers of more patients needing into the ward, there&#8217;s a patient shouting &amp; swearing at me because he wants out for a cigarette, it&#8217;s not safe for him to leave because of the treatment he has had, so someone needs to stay with him, someone else is unhappy because they haven&#8217;t had all their drugs, they do not understand this is for medical reasons, I need time to explain this to them ... but there&#8217;s hardly any staff so what comes first? What should be the priority?</p><p>Yes patients suffer &amp; receive standards that are below those expected by the public but the care most nurses give is the highest standard they can physically manage!!! People have NO idea the stress our profession brings. I studied 4 years for a BSc (Hons) degree &amp; continued to train &amp; develop throughout my career, however this job is changing, not because nurses care less, but because the demands get greater every day while staff numbers decline. I have decided enough is enough, I no longer want to suffer the constant stress &amp; abuse that nursing brings. I deeply respect all my friends &amp; every other person still struggling on in nursing, the public should hope &amp; pray that they can withstand the constant negativity &amp; abuse, as without them many lives would be much much worse &amp; many people would not live to see another day. Every profession has good &amp; bad but no one comes into nursing for the pay or as an easy option ... if they did they wouldn&#8217;t last long! I believe many (although not all) of the &#8220;bad&#8221; nurses are ground down by the job or are just the perception of a bystander who knows little of what they are dealing with!&#8221;</p><p>That is the testimony of a nurse. It is a not a criticism of any one Administration. We know that there are avoidable conditions that we are failing to tackle and that the preventative care agenda is not turning the tide as well as we need it to do.</p><p>At the time, I complained about the previous cabinet secretary&#8217;s abandonment of the health visiting strategy in Scotland. What should the NHS do? Perhaps we need a radical review of the procedures and processes in the NHS that would be every bit as severe and investigative as the Scottish Medicines Consortium review of new medicines.</p><p>We are six and a half years into the SNP&#8217;s time in government and at the mid-point of its current term. Although the Labour Party&#8217;s criticism might be fair, I look across at Labour members and I do not hear a convincing strategy that is deserving of government; the case has yet to be made. At one point during the debate&#8212;on the issue that, above all others, Labour thinks is the defining one by which we should judge the current Administration&#8212;Labour attendance dropped to nine members.</p><p>I do not hold a candle for the NHS in England; it is not my duty to do so. Our duty as politicians is to the NHS here in Scotland, to the patients here who need it, to the public here who cherish it and to the staff here who sustain it. What they are looking for is leadership from the cabinet secretary. That is an acknowledgement that some of what his predecessor did was not a success, however well intentioned it might have been.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This afternoon, it has been a great shame that there has been only water to drink.

The prospect of bingo, reading groups and elderly marathons was a kind of &#8220;Haud me back&#8221; moment; it was a vision of purgatory rather than something to which I would look forward.</p><p>Joan McAlpine and many others made the point that many positives are associated with growing old, and the contribution that older people can make that the debate must be partly in such terms. Ken Macintosh might recall that, during the previous Scottish parliamentary election campaign, a Liberal Democrat candidate&#8212;who was rather hapless&#8212;said in response to a question in a public meeting that we had a very serious problem with people growing old in East Renfrewshire. The majority of the people in the hall at that time were older, and they were somewhat unimpressed to be told that they were a very serious problem. We must avoid straying into such language.</p><p>Many members have touched on the facts, such as the fact that the number of people who are aged over 75 will increase by 82 per cent. Today, there are 820 centenarians in Scotland but if I live to be 75&#8212;some might be pleased to hear that that would be a record for a Carlaw man, as we are not long lived&#8212;there will be 7,600 centenarians. All the age groups appear to be in decline, except the elderly.</p><p>We have only to look at ourselves in the Parliament. When the Parliament had its first meeting in 1999, eight members were aged 60 or over. By the end of this parliamentary session, 46 members will be aged 60 or over, and seven or so of them contributed to this afternoon&#8217;s debate. The Scottish Parliament information centre has been helpful on that.</p><p>Ken Macintosh will know&#8212;because we have both trooped round East Renfrewshire during elections&#8212;that something like 60 elderly persons homes are scattered around the area. There are very few men in them. Men in Scotland have on average not been long lived. In some homes, that is a cause of some distress to the ladies; in others, they regard it as a positive advantage.</p><p>We must accept that, in comparative terms, Scotland still lags behind many other countries on the age to which we can extend our lives and the quality of life therein. Almost the first meeting that I attended outside the Parliament as an MSP was on dementia. In response to a question on whether they could offer any clinical intervention that was likely to assist with dementia, the blunt answer from clinicians was that that would not be for 20 years.</p><p>When I asked clinicians the same question last year, I got the same answer&#8212;that it would take 15 to 20 years. Regrettably, society will have to cope with the pioneer generation that is part of the ageing demographic&#8212;it is no longer in the distance&#8212;on the basis that dementia will become something that people do not hear about and touch on only by anecdote and through other families; instead, it will likely be something that they have a direct experience of in their own family.</p><p>That is difficult to plan for. It may be that, in 20 years, there is a clinical intervention for dementia, but the situation is worrying considering that the generation that is entering old age now is typically not the generation in which people are obese or have drug or alcohol addictions. Therefore, even if we find a clinical intervention for dementia, the older generation that will emerge in the future will be the generation in which those conditions, which are increasingly a health issue today, will potentially be in the future, too.</p><p>Therefore, we must recognise that it is not only a case of planning how to provide services for older people in the future but&#8212;some members touched on this, sometimes uncomfortably&#8212;a case of being stronger in our language to younger generations today. They must be told that they have a responsibility to consider their future health and wellbeing and, where possible, to act responsibly so that the preventative agenda that I think that we all want to see more of works in partnership with their actions to reduce the potential additional costs to the national health service&#8212;the burden of expenditure on the NHS cannot be infinite&#8212;so that we can intervene effectively when we have to in the years ahead.</p><p>The Finance Committee report is excellent. It says that the preventative spend agenda is all</p><p>&#8220;dependent on significant cultural change&#8221;</p><p>I am not optimistic about that, although I am not unduly pessimistic either. The exigencies of politics today&#8212;by today, I mean for whichever Government we are talking about in five or 10 years hence&#8212;get in the way of taking dramatic and bold decisions that will have an impact a generation hence. However, in many respects, that is what we must do. We know how difficult it is to get younger people even just to think about pensions because at that age they think that they are immortal. With regard to all those issues, the change that must be made is complicated and difficult to achieve.</p><p>When James Kelly introduced the subject of concessionary travel, he was not saying that it was not desirable&#8212;I would expect him to think that it is wholly desirable. His point was to ask whether, in the context of the overall picture that Scotland will face 20 years hence, we will be prepared to consider concessionary travel among the priorities that we must address and the decisions that we will have to take, in order to ensure that the many questions that the report rightly identifies and seeks to introduce for discussion move into active policies that will make a meaningful difference to the generation about whom we are talking.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to Kenny Gibson for missing the opening part of his speech, which was delivered in such measured and gracious terms that I was quite beguiled&#8212;it was a change from the normally combative Mr Gibson to whom I am used.

He and Stacey have obviously approached the condition with which they have to live in a positive and engaged way. That positive attitude is probably part of what accounts for their being together still and celebrating continued marriage.</p><p>I am one of those who knows of, but not a great deal about, multiple sclerosis. Therefore, I am probably in the wider majority of the public. It was interesting to see in the briefing that we received that one of the hopes that the MS Society has for the debate is that awareness is generally raised. I now know much about MS that I did not know before; I knew only some of it, in part.</p><p>MS is an autoimmune disorder that is characterised by episodes of inflammation on the brain. It is progressive, but the rate of progression is unpredictable, and the cause remains unknown. It is not hereditary&#8212;I knew that&#8212;but there can be a familial risk. It is not infectious&#8212;I knew that&#8212;but some people think that it can be triggered by a virus. There is no known cure and it affects more women than men.</p><p>MS is usually diagnosed in young adulthood&#8212;between 20 and 40. In particular, I note that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which services West Scotland, said that a record number of young people were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in its area last year, and there has been a sevenfold increase on the number of people who were diagnosed just a few years ago.</p><p>The course of MS is unpredictable and its presentation varies from person to person. People have to adjust to the diagnosis and the lack of certainty about the prognosis. As has been said, there is a common presumption that people will be in a wheelchair, but only one sufferer in four actually is.</p><p>What has struck me as well as the need for a greater understanding of the illness is the context in which the motion is set, which is that of a postcode lottery. I went to the MS Society website, to which many individuals have contributed, and was struck by a contribution from somebody who posted to one of the forums. Having used the phrase &#8220;postcode lottery&#8221; in the title, the person said that they thought that that was a contentious title to use, but went on:</p><p>&#8220;When I read of people having a great consultant or being diagnosed within a year or two of onset (note I said year&#8212;I am reasonable here not expecting a month or two ...) I really honestly do feel really pleased that they have been looked after well. But my next thought is usually I bet you don&#8217;t live anywhere near me!&#8221;</p><p>The term &#8220;postcode lottery&#8221; is a crude one, but I would be interested to hear the minister comment on the extent to which the services that are available across Scotland are equal, and on the areas in which more requires to be done. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has been quite candid about the growing incidence of diagnoses of multiple sclerosis, but it seems that other boards are slightly more circumspect about confirming the incidence in their regions. It slightly concerns me that, because of that, we might be underestimating the focus and attention that are required to ensure that people have equality of access.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis (Availability of Treatment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Liam McArthur on lodging his motion.

Because no party here has a monopoly of concern on the subject of cancer. Why are we here as politicians? We are here, sometimes, to embrace big issues and make progress on them on behalf of the people of Scotland. Such was the progress that we made on free personal care. Similarly, such must be the progress that the Parliament now makes on the treatment and the delivery of the treatment of cancer.</p><p>I acknowledge that there is commitment throughout the chamber. A quick look at motions that are available for members to support will show a motion from John Pentland on the Little Princess Trust; a motion from Jackie Baillie on international childhood cancer day; a motion from Stuart McMillan on the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust sailing hub; a motion from Colin Keir on nico35 and fundraising for various cancer charities; a motion from Kevin Stewart on CLAN Cancer Support; a motion from Siobhan McMahon on NHS Lanarkshire&#8217;s cervical screening award; and a motion from Jackie Baillie on cervical cancer prevention week.

As a young person, it inspired me that here was somebody who was committed in that way, campaigning for funds for a disease that, at the time, many people refused to talk about in public and for which many of us thought that there would never be a cure.</p><p>While Sandra White&#8217;s motion on breast cancer places the emphasis on early detection, we live in an age of remedy and relief if not yet cure. In 2010, Professor Sir Mike Richards noted that, when it came to making available drugs that had been developed in the previous five years, the UK was 12th out of 14 countries. When it came to making available drugs that been developed in the previous 10 years, we were 10th out of 14 countries. That led to the introduction in England of the cancer drugs fund, since when some 25,000 people in England have benefited from drugs that are available under that fund.</p><p>Those drugs include, famously, and now also available by exception in Scotland, abiraterone for prostate cancer; cetuximab for colorectal, breast, kidney and brain cancer; everolimus for kidney, neck and oesophageal cancer; lapatinib for breast cancer, rituximab for non-Hodgkin lymphoma; sorafenib for kidney cancer; bendamustine for non-Hodgkin; fulvestrant and eribulin for breast cancer; and ipilimumab&#8212;which I will say more about later&#8212;for melanoma and skin cancers. Those are the top 10 of 23 treatments for cancer that are available in England but not yet available in Scotland.</p><p>The only point that I will make this afternoon that may be regarded as politically partisan is that there is sometimes suspicion on our side that the reason why the Scottish Government did not introduce a fund for cancer drugs was that the initiative initially came from a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition Government elsewhere.

I will not single any member out, except Nanette Milne, Jayne Baxter, Mark McDonald and Richard Simpson.

I hope that, in the light of the reviews that have been conducted ahead of value pricing, the Government will be able to make access to those drugs for cancer and other conditions available by exception.</p><p>The cabinet secretary asked me how I would fund that. In its recent report, Audit Scotland identified &#163;26&#160;million of waste. Two councils that have blue-bag schemes managed to amass 2 tonnes of unused prescription drugs. Audit Scotland also tells us that, in the three years 2012 to 2015, medicines that will come off patent or which will become generic will release &#163;316&#160;million in the drugs budget in Scotland, with &#163;26&#160;million being released in the current year from a drugs budget of &#163;1.5&#160;billion. I believe that the funding exists in the same way that &#163;21&#160;million was made available from within those resources for the rare conditions medicine fund.</p><p>A new mechanism should be introduced that would, when a new standard of care for cancer or another condition is established outside current Scottish practice, enable a consensus application for funding to be made by Scottish physicians who can provide expert opinion within their clinical field. The Scottish Government could then enter commercial negotiations with the manufacturer to ensure best value, based on the true value that medicines bring to patients.

Fifteen years later, we can see a 60 per cent fall in mortality from cardiac incidents.</p><p>I suppose that it could be argued from the national health service&#8217;s point of view that that is not a financial success. It may have taken the view&#8212;not the individuals in it, but from a bottom line&#8212;that if people were not there, they would not represent an on-going cost to the national health service. In celebrating that significant reduction in mortality, the responsibility emerges. Thereafter, the question is: what do we do to provide cardiac rehabilitation to those whose lives have been saved?</p><p>There is no dispute or concern in relation to the principle or understanding that we need to make advances in cardiac rehabilitation, but a look at the hard facts suggests that whereas the rates of referral to cardiac rehabilitation for those who have had heart bypass operations are considerable&#8212;albeit less than the minimum that we might wish for&#8212;across health boards in Scotland there is an underperformance on referrals thereafter. There is also a very considerable underperformance, given where we are today and where we need to be, on affording universality of access to cardiac rehabilitation.</p><p>In a way, it is tragic if we save lives but leave people with a deteriorating lifestyle thereafter because we do not offer them the support, advice, education and subsequent intervention to ensure that the life that we have saved is a life that remains meaningful.

We know that a strategy is in place and that advances have been made; all that is widely welcomed and has enjoyed cross-party support. The recognition that progress needs to be made in a range of other fields has facilitated the debate, which has been punctuated throughout by specialised and informed contributions on specific areas.</p><p>Richard Simpson referred to the challenge of an ageing population in all its forms. It is sometimes easy for us to pass over and simplify that issue. He also talked about the incidence of adolescents in adult wards, but he was perhaps a bit optimistic in hoping that an alternative trend is being established. There was a spike in the figure, and we have got it back to where it was, but for me to be confident that a new trend has been established, I want the figure to start to drop a little below that. I know that a plan is in place, although I take Richard Simpson&#8217;s point that there are not as many beds as was hoped. We know that the situation is not ideal, and the minister recognises that we want to see progress on that in the future.</p><p>I suppose that the major stushie of the afternoon centred on the introduction to the debate of the issue of antidepressants, as characterised by Jim Hume&#8217;s speech. I kind of understood where he was coming from. It is perfectly true that, as the minister said, the defined daily dose has gone up&#8212;from 88.4 to 120.9&#8212;but the number of items dispensed has also gone from 3.5&#160;million to 5&#160;million. I do not want to simplify the argument, but there is a concern somewhere in there, and the response has to go beyond Fiona McLeod shaking her head and saying that anyone who addresses it is talking nonsense.</p><p>We do not want antidepressants to become the method that we rely on to treat people. They have their part to play, and it would be reckless and foolish to suggest that they do not. That might even require an increasing incidence of their being prescribed. However, we want to know that there is something parallel and in addition to that. That is the point that members were trying to articulate.</p><p>Nanette Milne and the minister touched on the fact that the suicide rate is falling. That contradicted Mark McDonald&#8217;s point that, in a recession, it is inevitable that the suicide rate will increase. Actually, that is not the experience. However, we should not forget or ignore SAMH&#8217;s two too many campaign. If we stop and think about it, that means that, daily, two people are losing their lives by their own hand. That ought to chill us when we consider the individual, the effect on their families concerned and those around them, and the loss of potential.</p><p>Siobhan McMahon&#8217;s speech was in two halves. She had a rather personalised contribution that was addressed to an empty chair, although I hope that what she had to say was nonetheless taken account of. She, Aileen McLeod and Kevin Stewart&#8212;in the second half of his speech&#8212;touched on welfare reform. The debate is not about welfare reform, but I want to try to respond in two ways to the points that were made. I hope that they balance, taken as a piece. Some of the assessments that we are talking about were introduced by the previous Labour Government. Nicola Sturgeon, at the beginning of this session of Parliament, told the Health and Sport Committee that she supported the principles of welfare reform. There is a paint-your-bandwagon approach&#8212;members can hitch their caravan to the end of any bandwagon and start complaining about the consequences.</p><p>There is an acceptance that this country needs to face up to and address welfare reform, but that is not the equivalent of my being comfortable as an individual and as a Conservative with the consequences of the assessment process on the lives of some individuals. Therefore, I accept some of the comments and criticisms on that.

This is depressingly like a debate that I am sure we had within the recent memory of us all.

I know with every fibre of my being that, if I were sitting where Mr Neil is, both Labour and the SNP would do the same to me. That is because this is a perennial debate about the future of the NHS.</p><p>I support Jackie Baillie&#8217;s motion, which refers to &#8220;financial pressures&#8221;. That is not an accusation that the Government is cutting front-line health spending; it is an accusation that the choices that it is making are putting pressures on the NHS. Similarly, I have a certain sympathy with the cabinet secretary. In the previous parliamentary session, the Scottish Conservatives routinely supported the Administration in its decisions, and the way in which it progressed issues, on healthcare. However, we identified concerns that we thought were chickens that would come home to roost&#8212;and I believe they now have.</p><p>We believed that the preventative agenda was being undermined by the dissolution of the health visiting service and that financial pressures would be added to not by the principle of free prescriptions but by the progression of that policy at the moment when financial pressures were at their height.</p><p>In addition, we have pointed out that there is an ageing population crisis that has huge implications for the health service. Collectively, as a Parliament, we need to face up to and address that crisis, because it can only make the situation even more acute in every year that follows. It is no longer a problem for the next generation to deal with; it is a problem the initial stages of which are lapping at the shores of Scotland&#8217;s health service today.</p><p>It is therefore not a criticism of the NHS or the people within it to ask questions of the way in which the service is conducted today. Nicola Sturgeon and the Government were let down by NHS Lothian in the way that the figures were manipulated. However, the questions that Parliament asked at that point were on what assurances we had that that practice was not going on anywhere else and on what investigations were being undertaken in that regard.</p><p>I am not here to apologise for Jackie Baillie&#8212;she and I have had, well, almost fisticuffs on occasion&#8212;but here is what Joe FitzPatrick and the chairman of NHS Tayside had to say when she raised the issue of manipulation of waiting times in Tayside. The chairman said that he had written to Ms Baillie to insist that the health board&#8217;s waiting list data are accurate. Dundee City West MSP Joe FitzPatrick demanded an apology from Ms Baillie and claimed that she had &#8220;besmirched&#8221; the reputation of staff. He said:</p><p>&#8220;This is yet another blunder from Ms Baillie, who jumped to the wrong conclusions, hasn&#8217;t apologised and continues to leave her comments online.&#8221;</p><p>An apology is due, not from Ms Baillie but to Ms Baillie for the way in which her concerns were simply and easily dismissed.</p><p>The health secretary is not in office to get standing ovations from all concerned, as his predecessor sometimes seemed to enjoy. The health secretary is there to support the NHS and to hold the people who run it to account and ensure that they do their job on behalf of the people of Scotland. If we are to avoid a full-blown crisis, we must accept that there are huge pressures, from the ageing population, the incidence of norovirus that is overwhelming hospital wards, the reduction in the number of nurses, and the consequences of delayed discharge from wards. There is also the issue of the integrity of public confidence in waiting times.</p><p>The previous health secretary&#8217;s visits to hospitals became famous for the accompanying smell of fresh paint. Alex Neil is a practical man. He has talked about whistleblowing and he has introduced a hotline. He has talked about access to new medicines.

It is wonderful news. I will pat any SNP minister on the back if they are responsible. It is wonderful what is happening in dentistry and great that there is a focus on alcohol, but none of that is a substitute for a responsible and reasonable debate on the emerging difficulties in the NHS. The repeated refrain from SNP members this afternoon was, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only got four minutes.&#8221; Frankly, anything they said could have usefully been said in two and we might then have had room for an examination of the questions that they refused to answer.</p><p>As I said earlier to Alex Neil, his predecessor&#8217;s style was to be the spider at the centre of the web, weaving, carefully controlling the figures, crisis managing&#8212;and maybe stinging with venom anyone who said anything negative about the conduct of the health service. A smell of fresh paint accompanied her on every hospital visit, and there was a sense that it was all as much about projecting the Deputy First Minister as an entity as it was about addressing the health service and its problems.</p><p>However, that is not Mr Neil&#8217;s style. He is the bull in the china shop&#8212;which is perhaps what the health service needs. I actually think that in the cabinet secretary we have a man who can make the most of the opportunities that are presented, which is why I welcome some of the initiatives that have been taken. Those practical steps are directly contradictory to his predecessor&#8217;s positions, on which she insisted vehemently until the day she demitted office.</p><p>I would therefore like the cabinet secretary to go back and look again at health visiting. In its very well-balanced and sensible proposal on the proposed children and young people bill, the RCN makes clear its belief that health visiting is central to the preventative agenda that in turn will help to reduce many of the obstacles to providing an effective health service in the future.</p><p>I would also like the cabinet secretary to dust down the report on Stracathro hospital that his predecessor consigned to the bin and which showed that the independent sector, acting exclusively for the NHS, produced a service that significantly reduced NHS waiting times at a saving of &#163;2 million. That &#163;2 million would, if it was extrapolated and used anywhere else, alleviate the financial pressures that the cabinet secretary is facing.

Although I have said that we must be careful to speak in a whisper when we discuss drug-related issues, it is important that we recognise that the road to recovery is not for Scotland but for individuals.

Its campaign was successful and another one is now under way. Of course, the lesson might be that our campaigns have to be sustained and that we have to find ever more imaginative ways and opportunities to encourage people who are applying for documents to opt in at those points. We should also bear in mind one consideration that was highlighted in 2008, and which is still pertinent, when we cite Spain as one of the nations whose example we should be following. The fact is that other countries are much more effective than we are in processing and using the donations of organs that many people have offered.</p><p>I am slightly uncomfortable with the process that has been identified in the briefing and detailed in the debate and ask members to consider what it would involve. For a start, every adult member of society would have to be contacted and would have to make a conscious decision, and then all that information would have to be collected and processed without error and established on a database where it could be referred to, again without error. Given everything else that has happened in the health service and elsewhere in life in relation to the security and effectiveness of information systems, I have to say that I am not confident that such a proposition can be delivered. I am particularly uncomfortable with and concerned by the effect on public opinion if it came to be shown that organs were being removed from people who had sought not to be part of that process but whose information had been incorrectly processed. That would undermine and damage public confidence, which, as members have pointed out, is extremely high and in favour of the principle of organ donation.</p><p>I do not suggest that those issues are insurmountable, or that there is not work that could be done to seek a path or a process by which my concerns could be addressed.

Forgive me, but the First Minister celebrates 25 years as an elected politician this year&#8212;we know that, with his imperial ambitions, this is indeed his silver jubilee. Thanks to his natural modesty we have been spared the balcony appearance, the tea towels and the mugs, but, quite frankly, the idea that the Paisley grammar school boy Andrew Neil mugged the inexperienced First Minister such that he could not get his point across on a television programme is by far the most preposterous assertion that the Government made last week. Of course the First Minister could have got his point across.</p><p>Worse than that, when it was discovered that the First Minister knew that he said that he had sought the legal advice, he went on to use taxpayers&#8217; money to cover up the fact. That is completely unacceptable. A fair-minded person will conclude that he was bluffing or incompetent or that there was something more malicious. I am happy to accept whichever of those three is true. Frankly, I do not think that what happened was malicious; I think that the First Minister was bluffing and that the Government&#8217;s covering up has been wholly incompetent.</p><p>There have been extraordinary interventions on Trident by Jamie Hepburn, supported by Stuart McMillan and Bob Doris. I understand that the SNP&#8217;s policy on Trident is now that it supports membership of a NATO alliance, which retains the right to use nuclear capability as a first-strike resort. That is now the SNP&#8217;s policy: it supports an alliance with a nuclear deterrent at its heart; its only concern is whether the submarines sail up and down the Clyde, not the use of nuclear weapons. That is what all SNP members have signed up to. Mr Hepburn has had the opportunity to follow his colleagues elsewhere if he does not believe in the use of Trident, but he has stayed in a party that now believes in its use&#8212;just as long as it does not sail up the Clyde.</p><p>Annabelle Ewing gave us a great lecture on various countries. The point is that we have had the Lisbon treaty since then, and it says that every member must have its own commissioner and that it will have weighted voting rights. We have one commissioner in the United Kingdom; an independent Scotland would require there being two, which would mean 28 commissioners. An extra commissioner for Scotland would require the unanimous support of the other member states. That is the situation now, and no one in the SNP can guarantee that.</p><p>That is the point: the approach is confused. The First Minister has absorbed the politics of Westminster too much in 25 years. At Westminster, people cannot ever accept that they are wrong. Many of us might have hoped that things would be different in a Scottish Parliament&#8212;but no. The First Minister simply could not stand up and say, &#8220;As the Deputy First Minister acknowledged on the radio last week, the impression was given&#8212;even encouraged&#8212;that legal advice had been sought. We apologise for any part that we played in creating that false impression, and we regret using taxpayers&#8217; money to try to cover up that fact.&#8221; He should have said that.</p><p>What is depressing is that we know how the votes will go tonight. However, at the end of the day, the First Minister is leading a campaign to encourage the people of Scotland to vote for an independent nation. He is at the head of that campaign. As a unionist, I want to defeat the SNP on its terms on the basis of a pro vote for the union, not on the basis of people making a judgment in the referendum on whether they trust the First Minister. However, when we look back on the result in years to come, the SNP will have to think carefully if it loses the referendum and independence is defeated. SNP members&#8217; cheers this afternoon will echo back at them because one of the reasons why they will have lost the referendum will be that, last week, people made a decision about the integrity of and their trust in the person who is leading the campaign, and found them wanting.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675104", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Future of Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not accepting interventions.

It is a subject about which he spoke before he was a minister, and it is clearly something that he wishes to see progressed. He clearly understands well the benefits that will come from the legislation succeeding.</p><p>The minister said that the overall purpose of the bill is to make a difference to those in society who need support. His response to the Health and Sport Committee was interesting. Mr McNeil detailed that in a fine speech that was characterised by its illustration of the personal examples that moved him and other committee members in taking evidence. He was too quick with Omar&#8217;s surname for me to scribble it down, but the name was mentioned several times. Through Omar and others, the committee became clear about the difference that can be made. In Omar&#8217;s case, that is through a direct payment to a personal assistant.</p><p>I was also interested in Duncan McNeil&#8217;s comments on the strength and resonance of the appeal against prescription from Pam Duncan of the independent living in Scotland project, who wanted to ensure that, as a result of the bill, as many people as possible have a chance to plot their own lives.</p><p>Mr McNeil identified a conundrum that worries me in relation to the bill and the forthcoming adult health and social care integration bill. It is easy for us in the Parliament to agree that we approve of the principles but, if forces elsewhere are not wholly committed to the process, it will be much harder for our understanding of and support for the principles to translate into the successful introduction and implementation of what we seek to achieve. We know from previous examples such as community health partnerships that such a situation can be unhelpful if we are to make progress.</p><p>Mr McNeil talked about COSLA&#8217;s inability to produce detailed costings, despite the fact that it challenged the Government&#8217;s costings. That inability is extremely unhelpful, because I imagine that the Government would welcome alternative suggestions so that it could robustly test whether its assessment of the costs is correct.</p><p>Some bills will get a second chance in the public mind, but this is one bill that will not. The test of whether the bill, when enacted, has succeeded will be whether people, at the start, feel that they can trust the legislation as implemented and that it meets the challenge it seeks to address.</p><p>Jackie Baillie warmly welcomed the proposed legislation. She made pertinent points when she said that she supported it on the basis that it extends choice. It was hitherto unknown to me that that was a principle in the Labour Party, but I took that at face value and welcomed it. Jackie Baillie touched on the independent advocacy issue, which Mary Fee returned to, and the appeals process, which several members mentioned.</p><p>Gil Paterson touched directly on a difficult area, which is the involvement of family members in the personal assistant role. In a gentle and sensitive way, he made the point that, as the minister said, we need to be able to determine whether there is appropriate involvement and that the circumstances and criteria are appropriate without ending up with a system that is difficult and which obstructs individuals from exercising their first choice.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm alarmed us all with his talk of a Twitter conversation, which I think he said was not with &#8220;the minister&#8221; or &#8220;Ms Cunningham&#8221; but with &#8220;Roseanna&#8221;. I was quite jealous. I thought that I had the perfect working relationship with the previous health secretary, but I called her &#8220;cabinet secretary&#8221; or &#8220;Ms Sturgeon&#8221;, and I never got any more familiar than that. Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s point goes back to the point that I tried to make a moment ago that there is an awful lot of detail and that, unless it is properly understood and worked out, there is a capacity for us to trip over it as the legislation is implemented and for the achievement of our aims to be frustrated.</p><p>Siobhan McMahon is probably a bit worried about the fact that she, the Conservatives and the SNP are similarly minded to progress on the issues. Normally, she would follow me only if I was walking towards a hole in the ground, but in this instance, as a Parliament, we are agreed that we support the general principles of the bill and want it to succeed.</p><p>Christina McKelvie, Dennis Robertson, Fiona McLeod and George Adam all used personal experience to illustrate their points. One point that struck me latterly in the debate was about how common or ordinary it is to have personal experience of self-directed support or care. People in this chamber, as with those outside it, have a first-hand experience of the subject and understand the difficulties and the obstacles that need to be overcome.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For those in the chamber who were in the previous session of Parliament, this is going to be my Jamie Stone summation, in as much as I am tempted to say that I largely agree with everything that everybody has said and sit down.

That is a very considerable thing to say. [Applause.]</p><p>I associate those comments with Brian Adam as well. I know that he has continued in office despite difficulty, and I wish him and Bruce Crawford every success as they take up their positions on the back benches.</p><p>I genuinely regret the passing of Stewart Stevenson from the Government. I do so not for the most obvious reason, but simply because members, I imagine, must now reconcile themselves to having to endure the forthcoming substantial autobiography modestly entitled, &#8220;How I Saved the Planet&#8221;. It will be a required Christmas present.</p><p>I spoke about Nicola Sturgeon yesterday. I am very much looking forward to my time debating across the chamber with Mr Neil, who is to bring his strangulated hyperbole to the subject of health. The days when we see his plate piled high with the best nursery food that the canteen can provide will have to be put behind him. I certainly look forward to playing Bond to his Blofeld. I do not know where that leaves Jackie Baillie. It says much about the Parliament that the cross-party poster team for healthy living should be Alex Neil, Jackie Baillie, Alison McInnes and me.</p><p>I turn to the new ministers. I know that Humza Yousaf will be hugely indebted to me. When Derek Mackay was appointed, I said that it would not be long before Humza Yousaf followed suit. He was dazzling us then. He is an absolute poster boy for the very best of private education&#8212;a good Hutcheson&#8217;s grammar school boy. I was a governor at the school when Humza was a pupil and he had a very considerable reputation. For what, it would be indelicate of me to say, but I certainly wish him well. I, too, pay tribute to the fact that he is the first Muslim minister in the Parliament. I think that he will be a considerable addition to the Government.</p><p>I like to think that a long-term programme to infiltrate the SNP was put in place in the days when Sir Graham Macmillan, who led the Conservative Party, met Helen Liddell, who was the general secretary of Labour. It has succeeded today, in that the former young Conservative leader in Aberdeen, Paul Wheelhouse, has been made a minister in the Administration. Paul&#8217;s mother, Ruth, who was an employed Conservative agent returning Conservative MPs in Edinburgh, kindly donated her son to the project and those of us on this side of the chamber are delighted to see that long-term plan bearing fruit. It gives great hope to us all. I welcome Paul Wheelhouse to the Government. I know that he will do well.</p><p>Margaret Burgess&#8212;modestly, I think&#8212;was not expecting her appointment and was quietly traipsing around the bar the night before. However, I am sure that she will be an excellent addition to the team.</p><p>The most wily of the appointments is surely Joe FitzPatrick. He has been picked because I think that the First Minister recognised the challenge that I said he was creating for himself with a chorus of the great disappointed on his back benches. Marco Biagi will learn from his indulgence in a reckless, red-blooded summer of hot, flushed flirtation with the NATO nine. It is to be hoped that his time will come again.</p><p>I know the conversation that the First Minister will have had with Joe FitzPatrick. &#8220;Joe, I&#8217;m turning to you, I want you to show those rebels on the back benches. Lead them from the fields of rebellion back to the righteous plains of prostrate genuflection in support of the Government.&#8221; It may not prove so easy. Sometimes, a taste for rebellion gained is difficult to lose.</p><p>The politics of all of this I leave to yesterday and to tomorrow.

Never in the short life of this Parliament has the reception of a Government&#8217;s programme been so lacklustre that the First Minister has felt it necessary to reshuffle his team within 24 hours of it being announced, but that is what we have seen today. I note that we are to debate the changes tomorrow afternoon and I look forward to commenting in my own way on some of the new ministerial appointments.</p><p>I want to congratulate Nicola Sturgeon on a personal level. She has been an effective cabinet secretary for health and I thank her for the courteous way in which she has conducted business. I have previously put on record the fact that I believe that she has proved herself to be an extremely capable pair of hands in a crisis, and I can therefore well understand why the First Minister has felt it necessary to put her in charge of the SNP&#8217;s constitutional debate, such is the mess that has been made of it over the summer.</p><p>There are some worthwhile measures in the Government&#8217;s programme. I look forward to the progress of the adult and social care integration bill. It has relatively few words in the programme, but I think that getting it through Parliament and getting it right will be a much more complicated matter than the simple title suggests.</p><p>The children and young people bill and the procurement reform bill are to be welcomed, and the Forth estuary transport authority bill seemed a sensible proposition at the point when we progressed the Forth crossing.</p><p>The land and buildings transaction tax might prove to be a difficult measure&#8212;any new tax is, and I will be interested to see exactly how the Government unfolds the detail of that, and what support for it can be found among the wider Scottish public.</p><p>The marriage and civil partnership bill, which Nicola Sturgeon has spoken courageously on, and which I understand that Alex Neil will take forward, is a bold piece of legislation. On a personal level, subject to the provisions of the bill, I hope to be supporting the bill as it goes through Parliament.</p><p>Yesterday, the First Minister described the initiatives as</p><p>&#8220;good things to do at any time&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 4 September 2012; c 10905.]</p><p>However, over the course of the summer, is that what the SNP&#8217;s talk was full of in the briefings that it gave to the media? Was that the centre of its discussion? No. Its discussion centred on an internal row about the membership of NATO&#8212;oh, how some of those rash heads must be regretting the bold stand that they took on that issue this afternoon. It was about the future of the BBC; Scolympia; and independence.</p><p>Yesterday, on television, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth said that the Government was focused on the economy. Would that it were. It is clear from the reshuffle that we have seen this afternoon that the reshuffle and the Government are focused on only one question&#8212;independence&#8212;at the expense of the wider debate in Scotland.</p><p>Yesterday, the First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;the people of Scotland recognise that Scotland&#8217;s referendum should be made here in Scotland.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 4 September 2012; c 10902.]</p><p>But by whom? Not with the participation of the leaders of any of the other elected representatives in this chamber who, in trying to participate in the construction of a question, have been loftily dismissed; and not by members of the legal establishment, who were told by Mr Russell that they were nothing but a kangaroo court.</p><p>This is not a debate that has been shaped here in Scotland. This is a debate about Scolympia, being shaped on Mount Scolympus, for Scolympians, by McZeus, by the SNP, by Alex Salmond, who will decide this matter unilaterally, on behalf of the people of Scotland.</p><p>The only encouraging thing that the First Minister said on the issue yesterday was that he would be meeting the Prime Minister in a few weeks&#8217; time and would come to an agreement. I hope that we can come to an agreement sooner rather than later. I hope that we can have the debate sooner rather than later. I hope that we can have the vote sooner rather than later. What the people of Scotland want is a debate and a vote on a single clear question&#8212;the question that the SNP has a mandate to put: whether Scotland becomes an independent nation from the rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s record on health is quite good. I paid tribute to Nicola Sturgeon before. I do not stand here as an Opposition politician and simply say that everything that the Government does is dreadful, because I do not believe that to be true. Some of its decisions&#8212;such as dismissing the outcomes of the Stracathro pilot, which were encouraging and perhaps offered a model, and the move to free prescriptions&#8212;are decisions for which there are consequences. I think that there is a fraying at the edges of the health service, with fewer nurses, and there are considerable challenges, regardless of the finance that is available to the NHS.</p><p>However, I would particularly like to see progress being made on cancer. The programme for government states that the Government is keen to identify cancer in advance in order to try to reduce premature mortality. We advanced a proposal for a cancer drugs fund. Such a fund operates in England and some 12,000 people had benefited from it by January. I recognise that, although that remains our policy, it does not command support elsewhere in the chamber. However, we are in an era in which drugs are being developed that can potentially radically improve the life chances of people with diseases for which, for all our lives, we have hoped there would one day be a cure. I will write to the new cabinet secretary and see whether there is an opportunity to find some common ground between the parties and a way in which we can embrace the introduction of new technologies for the benefit of the health of the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We meet this afternoon in the shadow of the kerfuffle of the reshuffle of the Scottish Government.

As we sat and watched the performance in the Fountainbridge theatre last Friday and saw the former suppressed choirboy himself, nodding along John Redwood-like to the music in an effort to increase his Twitter following still further, the thought occurred to me that surely they&#8212;in this centralising force that is the SNP&#8212;would want to sing that entry in the Eurovision song contest themselves. The First Minister would lead, John Swinney would be on drums, Mike Russell and Kenny MacAskill would compose the discordant notes, and Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Neil would murder the harmonies. There we were last Friday, enjoying the full cinematic experience in a movie theatre&#8212;a palace of imagination and fantasy.

They were joined by Alan Cumming, who currently lives in the United States and appears in a production called &#8220;The Good Wife&#8221;, in which he stars as an unprincipled political spin doctor. He was heard to say that he was at Friday&#8217;s event for some on-the-job training. We waited in vain for Sean Connery to appear, but alas no&#8212;we only got a postcard. We did not get the original James Bond, but we got the original Hannibal Lecter. Yes, there was Hannibal the cannibal telling us that he is in favour of independence, all with some fava beans and a nice chianti.</p><p>Then it was all over and we were none the wiser. Three hundred years in the planning, and we knew nothing more.</p><p>I am a unionist who is not afraid of independence, and I say this in support of the debate that will take place during the next two years: the wrong reason for anyone to vote to stay in the UK is because they are afraid of the alternative. Scotland is a proud and creative nation that will make a success of whatever challenge it faces, but that is not the same as saying that it is scaremongering to ask legitimate questions about what an independent Scotland will be like. Those who argue that case during the next two years must be prepared to make it.</p><p>I believe in the United Kingdom with all the passion that the SNP believes in an independent Scotland. Some have said that they are devolutionists and not unionists. I believe in the United Kingdom. There was a country called Britain, which was made up of England and Wales. It became Great Britain when Scotland joined; we are literally the &#8220;Great&#8221; in Great Britain. We then became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I believe that a silver thread unites all the proud culture, tradition, history and ambition of our four nations so that we stand proudly individual but better still united within that United Kingdom.</p><p>That United Kingdom is a home to which the Jewish people came at the start of the 20th century, to which the Poles came when they were confronted by the brutality of Hitler, to which Ugandans came when they were thrown out by Idi Amin in the 1970s, and to which many of the persecuted have come in the past 25 years. I believe that the United Kingdom is a unique alliance and the most successful union of four nations working together. It is greater than the sum of its parts.

Alcohol duty has always been raised purely in an effort to raise money.</p><p>Our preferred route is for the Government to work with industry in the light of what happens, and to seek to generate from it a voluntary contribution towards the rehabilitation of those who have alcohol abuse problems.

Alcohol minimum unit pricing has been the centre of debate in the current session and the previous session of Parliament, almost to the detraction of the wider discussion that the Parliament needs to have about Scotland&#8217;s relationship with alcohol. I do not want to detract from what the cabinet secretary said a few moments ago about the bill being one of a raft of measures that are already in place, but it has undoubtedly preoccupied the debate in the chamber.</p><p>We Scottish Conservatives have changed our position. In the previous session of Parliament, we felt that the legislation that was implemented by the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat Administration had not had time to prove itself, and that the evidence base was not sufficiently balanced to allow us to support alcohol minimum unit pricing at that time.</p><p>In one of my first speeches to Parliament, I said that I personally did not rule out alcohol minimum unit pricing, and in supporting it today, I very much hope that it will work. I fear that the measure cannot achieve all that some have hoped for it as the bill has progressed through committee, but I believe that it will make a contribution. The Parliament must hope in passing the legislation that it succeeds.</p><p>I am pleased that, where Scottish Conservatives have led, London Conservatives have chosen to follow. That is a perfect example of Scotland and Scottish Conservatives showing our colleagues in the south the way forward in tackling major policy issues in public health.</p><p>We are concerned that some of what has been claimed for the bill may not be achieved, and we respect the views of those who, throughout the progress of the legislation, have argued that it cannot succeed. We understand that there is a degree of scepticism, even while we think that the balance of evidence has now tipped very much in favour of allowing the policy its moment to shine.</p><p>That is why we proposed the inclusion of a sunset clause, and we were grateful for the support of other parties in that regard. The cabinet secretary&#8217;s point is worth emphasising: for those who are sceptical about the policy, the sunset clause is their opportunity to know that, in the event that the policy demonstrably does not have the effect that is claimed for it, the legislation will fall.</p><p>On that basis, there is really no good reason for the Parliament not to unite tonight around the policy, and to give it the authority that would enhance it by having all-party support in the chamber so that the people of Scotland can see that we are all robustly in support of it and behind its every prospect of success.</p><p>We are keen that the legal position be established, and we are grateful that the Government will allow the legislation to be the subject of a voluntary notification. I hope that that process will be completed at the earliest possible date, because we want to know that&#8212;in proposing pioneering legislation that the rest of the world will be looking at&#8212;we did everything we could to establish the legal position in advance.

During the committee stages, I understood his reservations about the legislation&#8212;[Interruption.] I am sorry, but until stage 2, I never heard the Labour Party say that it would vote for the bill if agreement was reached on that one respect. In that regard, regrettably&#8212;I have no wish for a party-political debate&#8212;I have sympathy with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s argument that we are divided at this final stage for political reasons.</p><p>I have something to say to Jackie Baillie, to Richard Simpson, and to Drew Smith&#8212;clearly the front runner for the future leadership of his party.

In essence, however, this is a pioneering policy that we are implementing first in Scotland ahead of anywhere else.</p><p>When we were discussing the amendments, I made the point that, although the Conservatives would have liked duty to have been used, the sad truth is that, although duty ultimately raises money for the Inland Revenue and the Exchequer, the public perception of duty is not that it raises money to improve public health, but that it simply raises money for the Government. However, the very point of minimum pricing is that it does not raise money for the Government. Therefore, it cannot be argued&#8212;as Willie Rennie put it in discussing the policy&#8217;s unpopularity&#8212;that the Government is implementing the policy because it wants to raise cash. The integrity that underpins the policy&#8212;the fact that the Government is implementing it because it believes that it will have a material effect on public health in Scotland&#8212;stands as a virtue.</p><p>We would like to see a participative relationship with the industry, and I hope that that will be forthcoming.</p><p>I want to return to the arguments of the Labour Party. I suppose that, in some ways, I should be pleased that the auld enemy is going to vote differently on the policy and to stand apart, but I genuinely do not believe that that is what Labour members, in their hearts, wish to find themselves doing, and the legislation will not benefit from that happening. They have made the windfall argument their red line, but I have to repeat that I do not recall, even when we discussed our joint scepticism of the legislation in the committee, that they stood up and said, &#8220;Look, we might finally be persuaded that this will work, but we&#8217;re not going to support it for as long as there will be a windfall, as we see it, for the retail industry.&#8221; That was never said until, suddenly, at stage 2, it became the rock on which everything was subsequently to depend.</p><p>It is clear that, unfortunately, Labour is not prepared to support a policy that emanates from a Scottish National Party Government unless Labour&#8217;s imprimatur is on it and Labour can claim ownership of it in some way. The Parliament could unite behind a public health measure that will advance the public health of Scotland. In the final analysis, of all the reasons to oppose the bill, for Labour to oppose it simply because the SNP proposed it is the saddest, most reprehensible and most depressing fact of all.</p><p>I know that there are members sitting behind the Labour front bench who do not want to be on the wrong side of the argument, who work closely with the police, the public health service, consultants and people in accident and emergency services, who have said to them, &#8220;This policy will advance public health in Scotland.&#8221; I say to Labour members, although they will probably not believe it, that if they change their minds, we will not exploit that.</p><p>The Parliament has an opportunity to put its differences behind it and to unite behind a policy that we hope will work, which we must see does work, and which will advance the public health of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667845", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a short but slightly depressing debate in the sense that, even at this late stage, the argument about the bill has continued even though, after all the discussion that we have had about it over a considerable period, the balance of evidence has shifted and, despite the Labour Party&#8217;s concern about and position on the alleged windfall, there is a clear view across the...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Jackson", "last_name": "Carlaw", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80538", "house": "4", "member_id": "80538", "person_id": "13967", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "West Scotland"}, "section_id": "22667845", "hpos": "356", "gid": "2012-05-24.42.29", "epobject_id": "22667874", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2012-05-24.42.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13967+section%3Asp#g42.29", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80538"}, {"body": "<p>Dear, dear.

The concern of everybody in the chamber and beyond is about not only what was going on in Lothian NHS Board, but whether there is any suggestion that the practice could be more widespread and whether we should have concerns elsewhere.

I therefore welcome what the cabinet secretary has done in giving Audit Scotland a remit to look at other boards. Are there signs that, over time, such concerns have arisen? There are ways in which we could look at that to see whether signs have been emerging. The compensation that boards have paid has gone up from &#163;2.7&#160;million in 1999 to &#163;26&#160;million in 2009. When we have talked about compensation in the past, I have asked whether there has been a chain of accountability from that compensation back to the problem that was at its source or whether it has been used as a convenient way simply to park the issue and move on.

I assume that people in this building consume those goods. The canteen trays fair groan with produce at lunch time.

It is not really enough for MSPs to hope that we can change public attitudes, but a lot of members have pointed to the direction to take.</p><p>In opening the debate, Shona Robison sold efforts short in one sense. Anecdotally, my impression as I go about is that more people are exercising. I am aware of more people cycling, running and actively participating in health clubs. The issue is not that we are having no success. However, Patricia Ferguson made an instructive point about the disparity between boys and girls. At the age of 12, girls almost cease to take exercise&#8212;they exercise at the rate that men of 40 might. It was interesting to hear that, individually, we walk 63 miles fewer per year than we did in 1975.</p><p>I do not know how many colleagues have followed the series &#8220;Two Greedy Italians&#8221; on BBC 2. In one singularly depressing episode, the presenters went to their home region and heard that, although Italy had had the lowest rate of obesity among young people in Europe, it now has the highest rate in Europe. The social dynamic had underpinned that change. I have always thought of Italy as a country of large families, but they are a thing of the past&#8212;most households now have a single child. There has been a trend away from the family meal, when people prepared good-quality, healthy food, which had to go further to feed a large family, towards reliance on what is available in machines, on fast food and on simply giving people money to go and buy whatever is available at lunch time, which might mean a popular choice rather than a healthy choice, as seems to be the disease in this country. The problem is therefore not just in Scotland, although, as the minister said, our record is not good and stands in the way of progress.</p><p>I listened to what Mark Griffin had to say. I do not know what he is on, but if we could all have some of it, there might be hope. I suspect that he is on youth, in which case we are all doomed. Until I was 27, I was only 9 and a half stone.

Members have recently noted the exploitation of some of the desire to see an extension of pharmacy provision where currently general practitioner dispensing practices have fulfilled the function. In its intent, the presumption in favour of a pharmacy application was sensible enough, but over time it has become clear that some who have no interest in or commitment to the local community are now seeking to ease out responsible GP dispensing practices for narrow commercial advantage.</p><p>One such example exists in my west of Scotland constituency on the Isle of Cumbrae. The Cumbrae medical practice is operated in ideal premises that were converted and supported with the assistance of the health board, providing a 24-hour service to islanders. The dispensing facility has made an island medical practice viable. The alternative&#8212;a mainland-only GP&#8212;is clearly undesirable and, with the island being dependent on ferry services, it is also potentially dangerous. Yet the application for an alternative pharmacy has been granted over the clearly expressed wishes of the community. Representatives of the community spoke to the minister, who, to his credit, wrote to health boards to suggest that, even when a pharmacy application is granted, there is no requirement for the health board to terminate the GP dispensing practice.</p><p>The reality is that, having noted the minister&#8217;s comments, the health board has received legal advice that suggests that the criteria by which a determination to allow the GP dispensing practice to continue are so tight that a successful legal challenge from the new pharmacy would inevitably follow.</p><p>The decision to terminate the GP dispensing practice on Cumbrae was confirmed last Monday. I said earlier that the applicant had no community interest. Members might be interested to know that, within hours, I was made aware that the newly approved pharmacy is up for sale. The application was not rooted in the community interest, but in the narrow commercial interest of an individual exploiting the original intent of a measure to expand pharmacy provision.</p><p>That is wrong. The central Government objective of extending pharmacy provision, which is laudable in itself, is being used to override the wishes and desires of local communities. Scottish Conservatives would devolve the decision-making back to health boards and allow them the broadest possible discretion to determine their own local community interest.</p><p>This Government professes to believe in devolution and in giving individuals their say, but in all its manifestations, the Government has taken to itself the responsibility and the authority for decision making. It is a Government with senior ministers who have been in office too long. They have come to believe, as did Louis XIV, that &#8220;l&#8217;&#233;tat, c&#8217;est moi&#8221;.

Unfortunately, she has been called elsewhere. I will leave it to members to work out which part derives from her speech. I will conclude with a practical suggestion for the Presiding Officer, which he may wish to take forward, as he sees fit.</p><p>In January this year, Annabel received a joint letter from the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens, the allotments regeneration initiative and Trellis Scotland, which informed her that there are more than 500 therapeutic and allotment gardens throughout Scotland, in which more than 12,500 volunteers are involved every year. From small communal gardens to large community farms, all those sites offer benefits to their areas and to those who can use the facilities. Those benefits include community regeneration, improvements in mental health, provision of education, training and volunteering opportunities, locally grown sustainable food, the creation of wildlife habitats and, of course, physical activity and healthy living.</p><p>As someone who let his wife attend to their garden during the Easter recess, I can assure members that many muscles&#8212;some of which I did not know she had&#8212;are used during gardening and that it is, allegedly, hard work. That is the part of Annabel&#8217;s speech that I had to paraphrase. The benefits of gardening to the individual, the community and the environment are extensive.</p><p>The allotments regeneration initiative was launched in 2002 by the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens. It aims to support and develop allotment regeneration and to gather and disseminate information about good practice in allotment management. Its original aspiration was to get more people growing on allotments, and that remains the core thinking behind its ethos. Those are very worthy sentiments.</p><p>In the autumn of 2010, a community council in East Renfrewshire was keen to embark on the establishment of its own allotments. Its experience is instructive with regard to how, between the theory and the practice, an idea can sometimes get caught up in bureaucracy. The community council had identified a site on council property that lay derelict, and it approached the council to see whether it would be suitable for turning into allotments. The group says that the minute that it suggested opening up the derelict site, the ground suddenly turned into a major capital asset, as far as the council was concerned, and the phrase, &#8220;over my dead body&#8221;, was used in relation to its being used for allotments.</p><p>What made the group&#8217;s project possible was the fact that it was awarded a grant of &#163;30,000 from the green network development fund before it got any agreement from East Renfrewshire Council; the fact that it contacted the previous landowner, who was able to confirm that the ground could not be used for anything other than recreation and education; and the fact that it worked with local people adjacent to the site and enlisted their support.</p><p>Last September, the council finally agreed to the proposal, although it took a further six months for the lease to be agreed. Various objections were raised along the way, which all turned out to be spurious. The group was told that an old fuel tank on the site would make the ground unsuitable, but no fuel tank was found. The group was told that it must apply for all kinds of planning permissions before the lease could be agreed, and it was given ridiculous estimates of the costs that would be involved. The group felt that many of those instances of planning permission were unnecessary, given the experience of others who had been involved in setting up allotments.</p><p>At the end of all that, however, the group has succeeded. The topsoil is now being delivered, 50 people are ready and willing to work the ground and new allotments that will involve the community will be established and made ready for use.</p><p>Presiding Officer, the practical suggestion that I have for you concerns the fact that, as I have noticed as I look out of my window in Parliament, many of the Parliament&#8217;s roofs are grassed. It seems to me that there is a perfect opportunity for you and your colleagues to consider subdivision of those grassed areas into allotments for members to experiment on and develop as a beacon of hope to others elsewhere. I realise that they would be suitable only for shallow-rooted vegetables. I by no means wish to insult any member with that observation; I refer to the produce, not the producers.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665614", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Allotments Regeneration Initiative (North Ayrshire)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Kenny Gibson for enticing this subject into the chamber, and I congratulate Christine Grahame on her &#8220;just four minutes&#8221; performance, which was without hesitation, deviation or repetition.

That is an important point. The two concessions of principle and substance that she has offered are therefore important to us. The first, which relates to the sunset clause, arises from the evidence of Professor Brennan, who is the author of the Sheffield study. He said:</p><p>&#8220;If minimum pricing turns out to be completely ineffective or a counterproductive policy, for reasons that are not included in the modelling and which have not been included elsewhere, that is evidence, and evidence should be included in policy making.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 24 January 2012; c 919.]</p><p>The sunset clause is therefore a vital necessity in addressing the scepticism that still rests around the policy&#8212;which Dr Simpson and, in particular, Drew Smith detailed perfectly legitimately&#8212;but which some of us are nonetheless prepared to set aside to give minimum pricing its chance.</p><p>The second concession is the requirement to establish the legal position. The cabinet secretary has said that she adheres to the position that she is under no obligation, which we are happy to endorse, but that she will voluntarily notify the pricing mechanism to the European Union. It is important for the Parliament that that process should begin at the earliest possible date and that, before the Parliament considers the bill at stage 3, we are assured that we have done everything that we can to clarify the position with the European Union.</p><p>A number of points have been made and I want to respond first&#8212;in case I run out of time&#8212;by paying tribute to the performance of Helen Eadie, which I would characterise as quite magnificent. She was impervious to entreaties, from all round the chamber, for the chance to intervene. She asked the position of the United Kingdom coalition. I do not know the answer, but I hope that the coalition will follow Ruth Davidson&#8217;s lead and that London will be governed by the Scottish Conservatives from Edinburgh in supporting what I hope will be a policy that can be pursued across the whole of the United Kingdom.

They gradually migrated from the centre of Glasgow out to Newton Mearns, Whitecraigs and Giffnock&#8212;the community into which I was born 53 years ago. I grew up surrounded by Jewish friends and families, many of whom had very direct experience of the atrocities that took place during the Nazi persecution, but they said nothing of it. It was not something that they shared outwith their community until much later. I would say that that began sometime in the 1970s, as television programmes started to take a greater interest in what had happened and Holocaust deniers began to emerge to suggest that no such atrocities had taken place.</p><p>We should remember that the collapse of Nazi Germany was latterly an organised collapse, but was rapid in its early stages. However, it was not so rapid that the Nazis were not able to dismantle and destroy evidence of camps, of which Treblinka was one, as Stewart Maxwell mentioned. I was therefore fascinated to read last week that new evidence is emerging at the Treblinka site through use of new technologies such as underground radar, which has established the existence of five mass-grave pits and two structures that were the gas chambers. Because of Jewish tradition the graves cannot be disturbed, but people are now in the process of mapping out where the graves are so that, in camps that the Nazis destroyed&#8212;and which some people would like to deny existed&#8212;there will be an opportunity for future generations to pay their respects and for us to commemorate those atrocities.</p><p>In 1947 at Auschwitz, which is mostly as it was during the second world war, a bottle was buried. The Auschwitz museum has for the first time released the contents of that bottle&#8212;sketches that are the only artwork that survives documenting the exterminations at Auschwitz-Birkenau. They represent entirely the stories that we have heard about children being ripped from their parents&#8217; arms while guards smirked, cattle trucks and corpses littering the ground, with chimneys in the background. There are some 6,000 such works from Auschwitz that have yet to be seen but which are now gradually being released.</p><p>I knew that because of my upbringing it would be a difficult visit for me to Auschwitz, so I organised a personal guide. He was a man called Robert Novak, whom I have made friends with and stay in touch with to this day. I asked him, as someone whose grandparents had lived adjacent to the camp and who had operated there as a guide for some 18 years, how he kept his tour and the story fresh. He told me of a tour that he had done the previous week. As he was going round with the group, he noticed the mark on one man&#8217;s wrist and realised that he was talking to&#8212;it is a rare occurrence now&#8212;somebody who had survived. He lost sight of him at one point during the trip and went back to find him in a room. He asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I think this is the room where my father was murdered, so I wonder if I could, with your permission, have just a few minutes to say goodbye.&#8221; We must not forget, when we talk about the large numbers involved, that every murder was the murder of an individual and that those are individual stories that amount to a collective atrocity.</p><p>People ask &#8220;Why?&#8221; I commend to them Professor Ian Kershaw&#8217;s book &#8220;The End: Hitler's Germany, 1944-45&#8221;, which was published last year. It paints a picture of the maelstrom of the final days of the war and of the death march from Auschwitz, and demonstrates that ordinary Germans sought to try and give some comfort or food to Jews on the death march and were, themselves, summarily executed for their trouble.</p><p>Let us reflect today, with a Jewish community that is shrinking in Scotland, on how important it is now that what was once the memory of the Jewish community has become the collective memory of all in Scotland of what happened.

The problem with community health partnerships was that the clinicians withdrew because they thought the whole thing had become bureaucratic and there was really no point to it. It is crucial for business and all the other parties that the structure seeks to embrace to believe that it does something and does not just exist.

I do so because I believe that a positive vote for the union will be empowering. Just like Lewis Macdonald, I believe that all the discussions about how we move forward will thereafter take place in the context of the authority of a positive vote for the union. Scotland will stand tall and will act with more authority, courage and &#233;lan in our governance within a United Kingdom from which we benefit and in which Scotland makes a decisive difference, materially, culturally and morally.</p><p>I accept that, in that debate, the arguments of unionists in the previous century will not be sufficient. However, I also accept that our arguments will be made against the corrosive arguments of the Scottish National Party, which has talked about the parcel of rogues who sold the soul of the Scottish nation 300 years ago. This will be the point at which this generation of Scots get their chance to vote positively for the union and to put that lie to rest.</p><p>I am a proud Scot and an elected member of this chamber and I have every right to be an active participant in this debate, which is what I intend to be. The claim by the SNP that those who vote SNP have some additional pride or more moral authority, or a birthright to speak on behalf of the people of Scotland, is offensive. If you spoke against someone who was gay, you would be homophobic. If you spoke against someone who was black, you would be racist. If you say that people are anti-Scottish because they belong to a different political party, that is a form of political racism, which is absolutely disgraceful and has no part in our politics.

It is the responsibility of Willie Rennie to get those who vote Liberal Democrat to vote for the union.

It matters not a whit to me who sits on what platform.

Then, there were 3.7 million households in which no one over the age of 16 had ever worked; yet, by June 2010, that had increased to some 3.9 million households. Astonishingly, some 1.4 million people have been on out-of-work benefit for nine or more of the past 10 years. As Lord Hutton, Labour&#8217;s former pensions minister, pointed out:</p><p>&#8220;Nine out of 10 people who come on to incapacity benefit expect to get back into work, but if people have been on incapacity benefit for more than two years, they are more likely to retire or to die than ever to get another job.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 24 January 2006; Vol 441, c 1305.]</p><p>Reform is needed. The fact that that reform is taking place in the financial circumstances of the day was not planned by the coalition Government; it is an unenviable inheritance from the previous Labour Administration. I am proud of both the courage and the breadth of vision of Iain Duncan Smith who, far from paying lip service to the objective of welfare reform, is bringing about a simplification of the system, through universal credit and personal independence payments, that I believe will transform the lives of millions of people for the better. On the evidence of the pilot, some 660,000 people who currently receive the disability living allowance will return to work and to all the dignity and human reward that that brings. The alternative to that is the hollow, blank canvas of lurid rhetoric that we hear from the SNP and Labour, which they offer, moreover, in the face of a public who well understand that benefit reform is essential and believe that it is wrong that households on out-of-work benefits receive a greater income from the state than the average household receives in wages. That is the cause that the parties opposite champion. The lurid picture, conjectured by some, of severely disabled individuals being force marched to a tribunal is the definition of recklessly indulgent political scaremongering, given that the minister has made it clear that there will be many circumstances in which face-to-face consultations will not be necessary.</p><p>The LCM is&#8212;as LCMs always are&#8212;a device to assist the Scottish Government in the implementation of legislation. To be clever with it, as the motion seeks to be, is opportunistic, frankly pointless and potentially reckless if in consequence any unforeseen delay transpires in the parallel drafting of primary legislation in this Parliament, which will occasion delays in the payment of benefits to those who need them. As UK Opposition parties beat their chests and posture, individuals will pay the cost.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives point to the detailed and sustained contact between the DWP and the Scottish Government, which the cabinet secretary characterised as co-operative on both sides and&#8212;within the terms of reference at least&#8212;productive. UK ministers have listened with care to and been impressed by the arguments on kinship carers, supported by us all in this Parliament.</p><p>The responsible course is for this Parliament to acknowledge the concerns. The reality is that real progress can be made only through the extended consultation process in which the UK Government has made clear it is prepared to participate with Scottish ministers, as details are clarified through subordinate legislation. We should agree to the LCM.</p><p>Added to this situation, the heady determination of some ostentatiously to strut their majority is a further nonsense. The call is for an unprecedented standing committee of this Parliament to be established not to scrutinise the work and responsibility of any minister here but to maintain a running narrative on legislation for which it is not responsible. That call suggests that the tried and tested committee system of the Parliament is inherently flawed and that the MSPs serving on committees charged with responsibility for the scrutiny and investigation of the issues are somehow incapable.</p><p>With unashamed conviction, we reject the Government&#8217;s motion and call for a clear and conventional passing of the LCM of which we are being invited by Westminster to dispose.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-01638.1, to leave out from &#8220;but regrets&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;and agrees that the relevant provisions of the Welfare Reform Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 16 February 2011 to make provision within the legislative competence of the Parliament and to alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657862", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The reform has its own logic and motivation.

Interest, enthusiasm and motivation are lost and all the intentions that underpinned what was originally planned somehow dissolve and are not realised.

Dr Simpson is in the seat where I expected to find him. Mr Matheson, who used to occupy the lofty seat in the rear that Mr Robertson is in, has bounced down into the ministerial chair at the front. I look to my left, and there is the empty seat once occupied at this time of the afternoon by Ross Finnie and his sotto bass contribution.</p><p>In so far as I did hear the majority of the minister&#8217;s speech, I welcomed what he had to say, particularly the announcement of a &#163;2 million fund for short breaks. He also made interesting remarks on the young carers toolkit, the young carers authorisation card and the commitment to the young carers festival.</p><p>Dr Simpson then fulfilled what I expected of him with a well-understood and thoughtful contribution. He asked a number of questions, all of them worth while, and I hope that the minister will find the opportunity to return to many of them in his reply to the debate.</p><p>My colleague Nanette Milne gave examples of best practice in Aberdeen, and I picked up a quote from Alison McInnes. She said that it is nice to be valued, but that what carers are looking for is</p><p>&#8220;proper help, support and respect&#8221;.</p><p>She asked particularly about the timetable for a carers&#8217; rights charter, and I hope that the minister can say something about that.</p><p>Alison McInnes also spoke about rural respite, as opposed to respite elsewhere, and emergency relief. I have just had another of my little interludes in the national health service. It is always fascinating to take in what is going on, and in fact I pay tribute to many of the improvements that I saw compared with when I was there on another occasion.</p><p>When I was in hospital, I asked the staff about the pattern of admissions, and I was struck to hear about the significant increases in admissions at weekends. I was told by consultants that many care homes take advantage and, when they do not have staff, suggest that there is a sudden deterioration in the condition of people who they are looking after and have them admitted to hospital. That is not appropriate when homes are being paid for care. For individuals, however, such admissions can be the result of failure on our part. People feel the need for relief from a desperate situation, which is exactly why the &#163;2 million fund for short respite care is essential. At times, many people find that their only option is to see whether the care can come from the national health service.</p><p>James Dornan said that it is important that individuals who are involved in caring must be involved in the decisions about how the change fund is spent. That point was powerfully made, as was his point identifying the &#163;10.3 billion that those who volunteer save the state from having to pay. It is impossible to contemplate any alternative to ensuring that people who care on a voluntary basis are properly resourced.</p><p>Claire Baker made a substantial and well-directed contribution on young carers. She mentioned young carers so often that in my notes I abridged it to YCs, but then realised that that could cause me all sorts of difficulties later in the debate&#8212;if only we had several thousand of those on our side of the chamber, but those days are long gone.</p><p>Bill Kidd talked about our knowing people who carry out caring roles. We often say that there are fewer people in society who volunteer but, in the era of caring, there have never been more people who are volunteering. We have to recognise that we are in the salad days of voluntary caring. In 10 or 20 years&#8217; time, given the huge increase in lifespan extension and dementia, more and more individuals in families will find that they know carers or are involved in caring. Although the challenges are huge, these are really still early days in that regard.</p><p>The minister will have welcomed the unsolicited applause from Mark McDonald, which he frequently gives ministers for their progress to date. I say to Mark McDonald that my experience as a father is that older siblings having Xboxes usually means that the younger ones get squeezed out, so I hope that young Connor does not get deprived as Mr McDonald gets carried away with his co-ordination skills. He made a sensible point about public disabled toilets&#8212;not just the facility existing but what it is capable of delivering. The points that he made about his family experiences and his experiences with Stephanie and Connor Chalmers and 24-hour care were consistent and telling. I absorbed his comments on the carers allowance. He was right to be bullish and I will reflect on what he said. I have heard Mr McDonald make a number of speeches now; he makes powerful contributions. I say to him, however, that in health matters it will pay to err on the side of appealing to the reasonable and consensual in making his arguments, because in this Parliament doing so has led to progress being made in a number of areas in relation to health motions.</p><p>Siobhan McMahon made one of the longest contributions that we have had in the open part of debates. That was of course totally unintended and unexpected. Like Mark McDonald, she illustrated her speech with personal testimony, as did Nigel Don, George Adam, Mary Fee and Dennis Robertson, who rounded off the open-debate speeches with a plea on behalf of the individual carer.</p><p>I might have said that I was missing Ross Finnie, but perhaps I am missing less Mr Robertson&#8217;s predecessor, who would have tended to rumble on a little bit at this stage in the debate.</p><p>I thank Fiona McLeod for saying that we have a Conservative council in East Dunbartonshire.

To be frank, the public were bewildered that, when they were stuck on roads unable to get home, the politicians&#8217; first priority seemed to be not how to get them home but which minister to blame for the fact that they had not got home. I think that we should reflect on the fact that the minister who was blamed and who resigned is now back behind a ministerial desk and the individual who led the calls for his resignation is elsewhere, looking for alternative employment.</p><p>I remember, when I was on a radio programme at the time&#8212;&#8220;Call Kaye&#8221;, with that well known Tory supporter, Kaye Adams&#8212;that one caller said, &#8220;The problem with you politicians is that, when the snow melts, you&#8217;ll forget all about this. Nothing will be done, and next winter we&#8217;ll be right back where we started.&#8221; That was a genuine concern because, of course, we had the small matter of the democratic process intervening this year, which led to the dissolution of Parliament in March and our absence from this place for a couple of months. In other circumstances, during that time, the committee with responsibility for this matter and Parliament itself would have focused more closely on the lessons that could be learned from the previous winter and on the preparations for the winter to come.</p><p>I read the winter weather review group&#8217;s report with some trepidation, but I have to say that I think that it is a comprehensive document. It sets out, across all the various agencies, disciplines and areas, a genuine effort to respond to the challenges of last winter and a process by which we can hope to meet that challenge this year. I will come back to the point that Mr Macdonald made about the responsibility of ministers to co-ordinate that effort. Of course, that work might all be in vain because, as we know from the First Minister&#8217;s speech in Inverness, God is now on his side. I imagine that, in the quiet moments that they have together, the First Minister will be doing all that he can to ensure that we are snow-free this winter.</p><p>The point that comes through a number of times in the report is whether communications to the public this winter will carry authority. I am not sure about the details around that. It was lack of authority that led many people to embark on journeys without knowing whether they could complete them. They were told that the police advised people not to travel, but that term has become devalued in the public mind. Does it mean that the police are telling me not to go to my job? Are they saying that it will take me longer to get home from work, so I should allow more time? This winter, if we find ourselves faced with severe weather, the public must have access to information that carries some authority, so that they know that when they are told not to travel, that advice means precisely that. They should be sure that they should not go to the airport in the hope that planes might take off, because the evidence is that they will not and all that they will be doing is creating a problem in the airport concourse. That is one of the key things that has to be addressed.</p><p>In passing, I should say that I am slightly concerned about the fact that the message boards on motorway gantries have continued this year to broadcast messages that are really quite superfluous and unhelpful to travellers. It is important that we do not put up spurious messages there, but instead ensure that the messages that are put up on the gantries add to the notion that the information that travellers are given carries authority.</p><p>I want to pay tribute to ScotRail, which has done a tremendous amount of work in advance. I would like the minister to join me in asking ScotRail not to abandon its plans and investment in preparation for winter. I know that ScotRail will be shocked to the core, as are all the pensioners in Newton Mearns this afternoon, at Mr Macintosh&#8217;s call for nationalisation of the railways, but I hope that the minister will join me in saying that that is an unlikely outcome, and that ScotRail should continue to invest with confidence.</p><p>I have a sneaking regard for Mr Brown. I know that he stood in combat fatigues in front of his vehicles in operation polar storm, recounting glory days of old. However, I think that the public have been most surprised by Kenny MacAskill becoming the poster boy for winter resilience. There he stood this week, in a bright red scarf that clearly was not his own&#8212;it was not bedraggled and scruffy enough to belong to him&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to support the motion in the minister&#8217;s name and the amendment in Lewis Macdonald&#8217;s name.

It helps us to get to sleep. Such is the pacy, racy standard of life in Troon. However, I now have a remedy: the Government&#8217;s economic strategy, which I settled down to read last night, knocked me out cold within half an hour.</p><p>I must congratulate the cabinet secretary for being very strong on good intentions today&#8212;after all, the road to ruin is paved with them. He started off by giving the game away in his opening remarks when he said that &#8220;when the facts change&#8221;, so should the policy, and then went on to say that the euro zone crisis got considerably worse during the past 12 months. However, his remedy would appear to be to join the sinking ship of the euro zone crisis by spending more money, incurring further debt and risking further the economy of the United Kingdom. Let us join the euro zone&#8217;s sinking solution of a ship rather than staying on ours, which, although battered and bruised, remains afloat.</p><p>The cabinet secretary referred to the fact that unemployment is falling. What would be the consequence for employment in Scotland if we took his remedy and massively expanded our borrowing and expenditure, only to end up with higher interest rates, which would have a crippling effect on the economy and, would in turn, lead to much higher unemployment? In fact, the cabinet secretary&#8217;s success in Scotland is entirely a result of the discipline that has been forced on him by the coalition Government at Westminster.</p><p>Mr Swinney said that unemployment is rising in England but falling in Scotland. A year ago, the picture was not so rosy. Why could that be? Well, Mr Swinney was very ungenerous. His economic success in Scotland today is entirely down to the Scottish Conservatives. It was, after all, we who forced upon him the commercial business rate reductions and who insisted on the small town regeneration fund. It was the Scottish Conservatives who looked for the small business bonus scheme and who, with others, frustrated his plans and scuppered the tax on large retailers in Scotland that would have had a profound effect on employment. I know it and, although he will not admit it in the chamber, Mr Swinney raises a glass of Scotland&#8217;s favourite export to our former colleague, Derek Brownlee, who forced that discipline on him throughout the previous parliamentary session and gave him the success that he has today.</p><p>We encouraged Mr Swinney&#8217;s plans, and I do not doubt that he would say that it was the Government sticking to its guns during the previous parliamentary session that ultimately led to the success of the policy on which he is embarked. So will it prove to be for the coalition Government at Westminster, as the benefits of the policy on which we are embarked come around.</p><p>The whole debate has been largely false because it has been about what powers we do not have rather than on what the Government&#8217;s document says. Some of the newer members have sought to argue that nothing in the document would exist were it not for the fact that the Government had brought it before us today.</p><p>However, much of the strategy is supported on all sides of the chamber. We agree with Richard Baker that the Government already has many of the powers that it needs to get on with the job and that it should concentrate on doing so. Indeed, in what was a passionate and energetic speech, Tavish Scott made a similar point when he said&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;that on an issue as profound as ferries, the Government&#8217;s record is not that great. Throughout most of the last parliamentary session, we dithered on various ferry reviews. Those have had to be extended, and we are still waiting to hear what the Government&#8217;s final policy is.</p><p>I am interested to hear more detail on Richard Baker&#8217;s i-bank proposal, but I do not think that we are yet ready to rush to support it. I think that Stuart McMillan had the quote of the afternoon when he said that Mr Salmond is inclined to underplay his success. Is this the same Mr Salmond who was made by John Lewis and is &#8220;never knowingly undersold&#8221;? I thought that that was quite a claim.</p><p>We then had Mr Gibson&#8217;s bludgeon rant&#8212;of which we are all very fond&#8212;and a brace of grousing from a chorus of newer members on the need for corporation tax to be devolved. My problem with the argument that if Scotland had the power we could cut the corporation tax rate, is that in a competitive market England might then cut its own rate to match Scotland&#8217;s. Where, then, would be the financial advantage to Scotland?</p><p>Mr Gibson was followed by Mr McDonald, who was at least easier on the ear. I thought that on the Labour side Rhoda Grant&#8217;s speech on the future of broadband had a lot to commend it. Again, the Government&#8217;s record on the matter does not suffer much examination; in fact, there is really no record to speak of. Mr Neil, who now presents himself as Mr Superfast Broadband, is certainly an improvement on his predecessor, Mr Superslow, but the fact is that in the past four years the Government in Scotland has made no effort on broadband that matches that of&#8212;I have to admit&#8212;Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the previous eight years. Now that the UK Government is coming forward with additional funding, the cry of the Government in Scotland is, &#8220;It&#8217;s not enough.&#8221; Every pound that comes from Westminster is a pound more than the Scottish Government has spent in the past four years. Rhoda Grant was right: if we are to try to establish a low-carbon economy by cutting unnecessary journeys and promoting business in the rural economy, and if we are to explore the opportunity that exists in Scotland in that respect, we need to roll out the broadband connectivity that will give Scotland that economic advantage.</p><p>I know that Mr Salmond is keen to keep his pledges. Several years ago, he published a document called &#8220;The Government Economic Strategy&#8221;, page 4 of which contains a pledge that the SNP certainly kept:</p><p>&#8220;this document ... is 100% recyclable&#8221;.</p><p>So it has proved to be this afternoon.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650703", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;The Government Economic Strategy&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I should share with the chamber the fact that Mrs Carlaw and I are inclined to settle down to a good Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes BBC radio collection play of a night.

However, in all the years, I have never doubted his belief in his desire to deliver separation from the United Kingdom.</p><p>I listened with care to the First Minister yesterday, just as I did in the hours and days after the remarkable achievement of his party&#8217;s Scottish election result. I did so with trepidation, for in 40 years of constitutional debate, the position of all the unionist parties has been consistent: we have said in response to SNP demands for independence that, were the SNP to secure a majority of the seats in a national election, it would have the right to negotiate with Westminster for an independent Scotland.</p><p>Yesterday, the First Minister said that, in the election, voters understood the SNP belief in separation and did not fear it. So on 6 May and in the wake of the majority that was secured, I was astonished that there was no demand for independence. Instead, with the cheers of his supporters echoing at his back, the First Minister marched to London not to demand independence, but with a list of demands not one of which was independence. As lain Gray and others said yesterday, the First Minister has the majority to secure the referendum that, only a year ago, he was still promising was imminent. History might well record that he missed his moment. We can only conclude that the First Minister prefers the certainty of his present office to the fear of an early rejection in a separatist referendum.</p><p>How can delay be in Scotland&#8217;s interests? With the Scotland Bill about to become an act, why spend years debating demands that, if the First Minister is correct in his belief, will prove irrelevant anyway? It would be far better for him to fulfil the commitments that he made to Scotland on entering Government four years ago and to ask the big question: do Scots wish to renew the 300-year-old union with the United Kingdom or do they wish to separate from it?

How can one have faith in anything he says from one election to the next on this subject? The fact of the matter is that he has the ability but he is not taking the opportunity.</p><p>Yesterday the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee heard from the project director for the new Forth crossing, David Climie, who confirmed to us that, perversely, the general economic downturn has underpinned the significant reduction in the anticipated cost of delivering this new crossing over the original working estimates. Indeed the situation may improve further. With the project set to commence as inflation is set to fall, there may be a further dividend to come. With the release of several hundreds of millions of pounds that were to be committed to transport, even in the wake of overall capital expenditure reductions, it is unacceptable that the Government intends to divert that capital funding away from transport and into flashy populist expenditure elsewhere.</p><p>Given that the justification for abandoning or delaying some projects in the strategic transport projects review was the anticipated expenditure on the Forth crossing, that is inexcusable. With Glaswegians and those in central Scotland&#8212;and perhaps even Mr Harvie&#8212;marvelling at the immediate and obvious benefits that have been brought by the completion of the new M74 and the M80, how much more could have been achieved by the sensible reinvestment of the anticipated Forth crossing savings in other transport capital projects? For example, there is the M77 hard shoulder running project between junctions 1 and 4, which together with the Monkton joint venture park-and-ride&#8212;previously postponed for the want of just &#163;5 million&#8212;would offer an express bus transport corridor. If we were prepared to invest &#163;2.1 billion in one transport project on the Forth, we should also be prepared to invest the dividend that has been realised from the tendering process to improve our transport infrastructure throughout the rest of Scotland. The government must explain to the rest of Scotland why it has not done that.</p><p>Finally, I want to say something personal about the subject that I shadowed for much of the last parliamentary session: public health. From the first, I welcomed the Government&#8217;s intention to focus on alcohol when Kenny MacAskill initially led for the Administration on the issue. Like others, I believed that we were right to be sceptical about the minimum pricing of alcohol. Regrettably, as the passage of the Alcohol (Scotland) Bill reached its conclusion, the debate seemed to lose sight of the issues involved and became more strident and partisan on all sides.</p><p>However, since the minimum pricing proposals fell, I&#8212;like others, I imagine&#8212;have spoken to accident and emergency consultants and staff, nurses, the police, those who have suffered from alcohol abuse in all its manifestations, and voters. It is certainly true that there is no compelling evidence that such a policy will make the crucial difference required. My colleagues are right to continue to make this point and to call for further evidence and, in that respect, I agree with the line that Mary Scanlon and Murdo Fraser took with the cabinet secretary yesterday. On reflection, though, it is also true that sceptics once argued that there was no evidence that council house tenants would wish to take advantage of Conservative right-to-buy legislation in the 1980s&#8212;and the cabinet secretary will acknowledge how wrong those sceptics were.</p><p>So although I am instinctively against regulation, l find myself now reluctantly agreeing with lain Duncan Smith, who has publicly backed alcohol minimum pricing. I believe that we should respect the united and clear view of the health community, the police and the wider Scottish public and back the government&#8217;s policy&#8212;with two clear conditions. First, the bill must contain the sunset clause that Nicola Sturgeon previously offered and, secondly, the Government must work with the alcohol retailers to ensure that the windfall profits that arise are not exclusively absorbed but that we take the opportunity to secure vital new voluntary funding&#8212;and I emphasise the need for voluntary agreement&#8212;for abstinence programmes.</p><p>I will be interested to learn in due course how the cabinet secretary intends to proceed and whether she will exercise the Government&#8217;s majority regardless or seek to secure broader co-operation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650216", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was paying attention to the First Minister when, after being elected the first time, he said that the independence referendum was imminent.

As some members will know, my background is in the retail motor industry. A large part of the business that we operated was accident repair, and many of the vehicles that ended up with us were damaged or ones in which people had lost their lives.</p><p>At one point, the business was located next to a police holding compound where vehicles that had been involved in accidents ended up when a prosecution might follow. It was astonishing, at times, to think how many people had survived those accidents and tragic to stand looking at a vehicle in which I knew that several people&#8212;invariably, when multiple deaths were involved, it was several young people&#8212;had lost their lives.</p><p>It is interesting to think how many more people might die on our roads each year had not considerable progress been made both by the industry and by the Government on road improvement. Cars are much safer vehicles than they once were and are now designed with anti-roll bars, airbag technology and impact absorption that seeks to mitigate the potential damage and prevent loss of life. Those things have helped to reduce the loss of life in road accidents.</p><p>I travel home to Troon down the M77, which, as the A77, had one of the worst loss-of-life records of any road in Scotland. That was because there were two lanes in each direction with space for nothing more than a sheet of paper between the four sets of cars that were zooming in either direction. Many of the accidents on that road were caused by inexperienced young drivers who were not necessarily travelling above the speed limit but who simply lost control of the cars while driving on such a road. The dualling&#8212;the motorway status&#8212;of the M77 and the reduction in speed that has been achieved on the section that is not divided through the use of the vulture-type traffic control cameras have had a profound impact in reducing the number of accidents that take place on that road. However, many of the accidents that still take place happen on rural roads or roads on which it is not practical to install vulture-type cameras and which it is not practical to dual or convert to a higher status. It is on those roads that inexperienced young drivers are still losing their lives and are potentially at risk.</p><p>I have read Dr Sarah Jones&#8217;s report, which adds a significant weight of evidence to the argument. I am instinctively nervous, however, about rushing to further regulate although I see that that course may prove to be best. I am slightly anxious because a lot of the support for such a move is fuelled by the concern that some inexperienced young drivers drink. There are also young people who do not drink, who become fairly experienced drivers at an early age. I sometimes wonder whether the imposition of regulation on everybody is the way forward. As with all such things, I would like to see what else can be done first. We are continuing to improve the training processes, there is a new post-test vocational qualification, we are modernising the driver training industry and the insurance companies are considering technologies that would allow vehicles to be adapted to enable young drivers to produce evidence for the insurance companies that would perhaps allow their premiums to be reduced, thereby providing an incentive to drive with even greater care.</p><p>However, if none of those proves to be effective&#8212;and even if they do prove to be effective&#8212;there is an argument that the Government should look further at the issue. If, in doing so, it concludes that there is merit in producing legislation, we would be happy to support it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650209", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young Drivers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Stewart on securing the debate.

Although it was a great loss to those of us who had to sit through many a dull afternoon when he was promoted to ministerial office from his previous back-bench role as chief cheerleader for the Government, it was a great consolation to many of us, too. Given that he is not known as being one who has always been completely on the same wavelength as his leader, his promotion to front-line office is&#8212;how can I put this?&#8212;an inspiration to us all.</p><p>When I heard his collection of responsibilities, I thought that it rather sounded as if his was the ministry for avoiding potential banana skins, because among the many things on that list are areas in which Mr Neil&#8217;s safe pair of hands is being banked on by the Government to steer a steady course. From his first speech in ministerial office, I can see that we are in for a few jolly afternoons as we debate the various responsibilities within his remit.</p><p>I congratulate the Government, because I think that the completion on budget and on time of the M74&#8212;even if the cars &#8220;transgress&#8221; it, now that it has been opened&#8212;is something about which the Government can be pleased. It is also a fine tribute to our former colleague Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, who in his time as a minister played a key role in ensuring that that project would eventually be completed. We must hope that it and not the Edinburgh trams project is the model for the new Forth crossing, the construction of which is under way and which, in terms of capital expenditure, is the single biggest project for which the minister and the chamber, collectively, have responsibility for ensuring completion on budget and on time.</p><p>All that said, there are some legacy issues from the previous session of Parliament, the lack of progress on which members should be concerned about. Some of those fall within the transport responsibility. Where on earth is the Government&#8217;s ferries review? Last session&#8217;s Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee began a consultation on it as far back as 2008, and we were forever making provision in our work schedule for the anticipated conclusion of the Government&#8217;s report on the matter. With some optimism, the clerks told us that space would be cleared in the successor committee&#8217;s work programme to deal with it early in the present session, only for someone to mutter from the background that it might not be until late in the winter that we will hear what is forthcoming. That will be far too late. After all, public subsidy for ferries has increased from some &#163;40&#160;million to more than &#163;80&#160;million, and the new Gourock to Dunoon ferry has, in bringing about a saving of some &#163;1.5 million annually in public subsidy, demonstrated the value of the independent sector, when its use is properly consolidated. Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd is desperate for a new model that will allow it to renew an ageing fleet. I hope that the Government is not holding back on coming to a conclusion for reasons of convenience&#8212;in other words, because of its nervous anxiety about following the mutualisation route, which might be the way forward for the Scottish ferries.</p><p>The other great project for which space was cleared in the committee work programme was the bill on water, news of which we await with interest. It will finally unveil, in terms of specific policies and responsibilities, all the poetry of the First Minister&#8217;s extremely elaborate statement to the chamber. We look forward to that, but I understand that the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee should not expect to be detained by consideration of that bill in the early years of this session.</p><p>I flag up the issue of winter resilience. Had we not had an election between last winter and the coming one, I think that Parliament would probably have wanted to ensure that we dealt with the issue in the high days of summer, which might be the point at which one is least likely to think about the winter ahead. As a Parliament, we have a duty to ensure that the recommendations of the review that I know the Government will publish after the summer are implemented so that, in the event that we experience another severe winter, we are not found floundering, because I think that the public would find it an unforgivable misjudgment on the part of all politicians were that to be the case.</p><p>At this morning&#8217;s meeting of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee and in the debate, the minister has suggested something of a Wilkins Micawber approach to his responsibility&#8212;that is to say that, from having no money, he intends to borrow as much as he can to finance this, that and the next initiative. There is a role for all of that, but I hope that the minister does not max out the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s credit card but instead uses his responsibility and his ability sensibly, because we know from last year&#8217;s report by the Institution of Civil Engineers that our roads network is in a serious state of disrepair and needs proper investment if it is not to collapse completely.</p><p>We support the minister and the Government in their objectives for broadband, which we will have the opportunity to debate at greater length.</p><p>As we go forward, I hope that the &#163;250&#160;million that we are saving on the Forth crossing project will not be squandered on the election flim-flam that was in the SNP&#8217;s manifesto, but will instead be directed to specific capital investment projects that will benefit the country.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649605", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Infrastructure and Capital Investment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the cabinet secretary to his new responsibility.

She wants to embrace that within the coastguard service and accepts that there is a need for modernisation and, indeed, for some rationalisation, but what the Transport Committee has concluded is much what members of the Scottish Parliament and members elsewhere have concluded, which is that the actual proposals that are contained within the Government&#8217;s consultation are the wrong proposals and, as has been said, they are deeply flawed and, in some cases, unsafe.</p><p>I notice that the Secretary of State for Transport, Philip Hammond, has also welcomed the report, albeit that it must have been a little bit uncomfortable for him when he read it.

I was not one of those who called for his resignation before Christmas, and I am genuinely pleased that he is now back in the Government.</p><p>This is the second birthday&#8212;I keep being told&#8212;of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. I repeat the concerns that many members of the former Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee felt over the substantial planning and programme of action&#8212;or rather the lack of it&#8212;that underpinned the chest-thumping ambitions for carbon reduction targets that were contained within. To paraphrase Mr Asquith, there is no point in our ringing the bells this week only to be wringing our hands in five years&#8217; time. I will resist any temptation to revive the debate over sources of national power, but I repeat the concern that I have felt profoundly, which is that the heady ambition of the Parliament to set even headier ambitious targets is not always matched by clear&#8212;or even opaque&#8212;substantive policy, as opposed to discussion, at which we excel.</p><p>We have committed to a target of an 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 39 years, and a 42 per cent reduction in just nine years. We might have willed ourselves the ability to set the target, but I am not satisfied that we have yet willed ourselves the means to achieve it. That is not to say that we have no idea of anything that can or will be done to make progress, as the minister, the Government and others have made many suggestions; it is to argue that all that we presently agree on and contemplate will probably leave us far short of the target that we have set.</p><p>There is a danger in this. If, by 2016, as this session of Parliament nears its close only four years away from the interim target deadline, our economic recovery has perversely reversed some of the recent downturn in emissions that we have achieved and we seem to be some distance away from the objective, the inclination may well be to panic. That would potentially be a disaster, because we could be seduced by notions of compulsory regulation and penalty, which could hugely prejudice the public good will and tempt us, in a still fiercely competitive marketplace, to impose actions on the framework of our economy that would be counterproductive for our economic and employment wellbeing. I therefore do not mean it lightly when I say that we must do what we can now, by doing that which is most benign as early and as comprehensively as possible in order to make progress.</p><p>Over the past four years, I have become persuaded by Mr Gibson&#8217;s ambition to re-wet the peat bogs, even if it is not an ambition to do so personally. It is an uniquely Scottish option, of which we have not embraced the full potential. Emerging evidence suggests that it could be one of Scotland&#8217;s big bangs for its buck in terms of carbon emissions reduction if we were to embrace the opportunity fully.</p><p>I also welcome the commitment from all sides to the promotion of electric motor vehicles. I have been an advocate of those for several years and I remain excited about not just the opportunity in existing technology but the emerging technology over the next 25 years. We can see how different the motor car of 25 years ago is from that of today, and we can imagine how different it could be again in 25 years. The fact that all mainstream new household car models are appearing in electric form offers us a fantastic opportunity and a much more imaginative one than depressing talk of national speed limits of 50mph. Moreover, Scotland is a huge producer of the batteries that power today&#8217;s electric vehicles, so it is a win-win situation environmentally and economically.</p><p>I remain opposed to draconian methods, but I say in all candour that I fear that at some point during this session of Parliament a lack of material progress towards the 42 per cent target will be impossible to ignore. We have set the targets in law, although I think that none of us is quite sure what will befall us if we fail. However, if we are to avoid a chorus of siren protest from others month in, month out and year in, year out, we had better agree exactly how and when&#8212;and the sooner, the better. I ask ministers from what, by how much and when will we achieve our ambition.</p><p>I, too, welcome&#8212;as Sarah Boyack and Alex Fergusson did&#8212;the minister&#8217;s open-door policy. I was somewhat concerned at his response to Mr Fergusson&#8217;s intervention earlier in the debate, when he rather suggested that unless he is in the room, Scotland is not in the room, which was a sort of modern-day version of Louis XIV&#8217;s refrain &#8220;L&#8217;&#233;tat, c&#8217;est moi.&#8221; I think that there is a distinction between the minister and Scotland. However, if his policy is, as he states, to be as open as possible, then on this issue&#8212;which I think all the Parliament shares the ambition to achieve&#8212;it is absolutely important and fundamental that in these early years we agree how we are going to do it in a way that will carry the voluntary support of the people of Scotland, and which will avoid the need for us to fall back, as some fear we will, on regulation and penalty.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649004", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Rural Affairs and the Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will confine my remarks to climate change.

Plus &#231;a change, plus c&#8217;est la m&#234;me chose, they say. However, while Parliament may look the same it is undoubtedly a very different place from the one we left before the election. Although the balance was fine then concerning the role that nuclear might play in our future energy provision, in this session it clearly is not. I accept that although I will be promoting the case for a role for nuclear, it is now very much a minority case in Parliament.</p><p>I welcome the debate. I was much happier with its title than I was with the motion. I hope that I do not disappoint the minister when I say that I agreed with much of what he said. I would expect nothing less than the commonsense approach of a former Belmont House boy that Mr Ewing was able to bring to his contribution. However, I had not quite appreciated until I saw the motion that it was his intention personally to fertilise debates with incontinent motions. This is something of a bar-room brawl of a motion. I wondered whether, when amending it after every semi-colon, I might not just have added, &#8220;And another thing&#8221;. In its scope the motion does not do justice to any particular aspect of the debate that we need to have. There are about 10 debates contained in the motion. In the time that we have, we will be unable to elaborate on them fully.</p><p>Our amendment supports the green investment bank coming to Scotland. However, it turns to the heart of the matter, which is the SNP legacy from the previous Parliament that renewables would be able to produce 100 per cent of our power requirements by 2020. The First Minister said last week:</p><p>&#8220;We know of our great comparative advantage in natural resources and the opportunities that exist in transforming to a low-carbon economy. In renewable energy, we have just one of many growth sectors, and through our renewable wealth we can and will reindustrialise our nation as we research, develop, export, engineer, fabricate, install and then service the new energy systems that will power this century.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 26 May 2011; c 73.]</p><p>I agree with that, although in her contribution my colleague Mary Scanlon will question whether, in order to achieve that objective, we will by definition be greenlighting every and any wind power scheme that is proposed, and riding rough-shod over any other consideration.</p><p>Like Labour, and like Sarah Boyack, I question whether the ambition is as yet met with a detailed plan to deliver. Sarah Boyack called it a route map. In something of an oxymoron, Mr Ewing called it a road map&#8212;I am sure that Mr Harvie would object to that. However, let us assume that a route map is coming. Given the technologies that we have now, offshore wind and carbon capture are things that we can develop, expand, research and export. However, in the context of where we are today, 30 per cent of our energy is generated by nuclear. While we accept that new builds are by definition off the agenda, given the UK context, the Government nonetheless has a responsibility to meet Scotland&#8217;s future energy requirements.</p><p>Last week, the First Minister talked about</p><p>&#8220;the family in Dumfries that wants to send their daughter to university ... the commuter in Dunfermline who travels daily across the Forth ... the family in Ayrshire&#8221;</p><p>who would have to choose different medicines and</p><p>&#8220;the pensioner in Inverness&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 26 May 2011; c 69.]</p><p>I assume that the family in Dumfries, the commuter in Dunfermline, the family in Ayrshire and the pensioner in Inverness also want the lights to come on when it is dark, to be warm when it is cold and to be able to go to places of employment that are properly and adequately powered.</p><p>How are those requirements to be met? Hunterston is currently producing about 27 per cent of our generation. As this parliamentary session comes to an end in 2016&#8212;in just five years&#8217; time&#8212;Hunterston is due to be decommissioned.</p><p>The SNP motion revives and echoes some of the now familiar refrains on additional powers. My question for the minister is this. Is he confirming beyond peradventure that he has the means, through the powers that he has at his disposal in the Parliament, to meet all Scotland&#8217;s energy needs from renewable energy and non-nuclear generation by 2020&#8212;that is, with no nuclear capacity whatever? If, as the motion suggests, the minister needs additional powers&#8212;those that are not yet available or to hand&#8212;that surely has an impact on his ability to deliver the end result. If he has the means, then he must&#8212;as Sarah Boyack asked&#8212;detail in a route map exactly how and when that will be the case, so that the people of Scotland, not just the Parliament, can be assured that the powers will be there.</p><p>Many people in business and elsewhere believe, as we do, that there has to be nuclear provision. The minister flashed up The Herald earlier. He might also care to recall The Herald&#8217;s editorial of 30 March, which said:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland is right to develop a new generation of renewables but the scale of the energy gap we face means nuclear must remain in the mix. The alternatives are black-outs or expensive imports from England or abroad.&#8221;</p><p>The minister has our support as he exploits Scotland&#8217;s natural renewable opportunities, but he carries a responsibility, for all those standard bearers to whom the First Minister referred and for all of Scotland, to ensure that there is no gap in our energy supply.</p><p>Germany has said&#8212;rather pathetically&#8212;that it will rely on French nuclear provision to meet its needs. Will Scotland, equally, have to rely on English nuclear supply in the future?</p><p>Last week, Iain Gray here and Baroness Hayman, at the Obama address at Westminster, quoted Mario Cuomo, who said:</p><p>&#8220;You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.&#8221;</p><p>On renewable energy, the Government is in danger of both campaigning and governing in poetry. There should be ambition, yes, but not reckless ambition. There should be pragmatic progress&#8212;yes&#8212;and it demands an extension of our existing nuclear provision.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-00169.2, to leave out from &#8220;agrees&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;is concerned that the Scottish Government&#8217;s target of generating the equivalent of 100% of Scotland&#8217;s electricity demand from renewable sources within nine years is wholly unachievable; is further concerned that the Scottish Government&#8217;s refusal to replace existing nuclear facilities will lead to an excessive reliance on onshore wind farms and thereby jeopardise the security of Scotland&#8217;s energy supply; believes that a viable, low-carbon and secure energy capacity for the future requires investment in the full range of renewable sources, the life extension of existing nuclear facilities and the development of world-leading carbon capture technology; further believes that the UK Government&#8217;s Green Investment Bank should be located in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to amend the national planning framework to designate the replacement of existing nuclear facilities as national developments and to introduce robust national strategic planning guidance to ensure that new wind farms are sited only in appropriate locations.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by welcoming the minister to his new responsibility.

In fact, we should be celebrating the success of a commercialised bus industry that does not generate any great burden on the public purse during these straitened times. Virtually 100 per cent of First Aberdeen&#8217;s mileage, and around 98 per cent of First Glasgow&#8217;s, is commercial. Further, the industry employs around 18,200 people.</p><p>Much has been achieved for Scotland since Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s groundbreaking legislation in 1985, which was followed by the Transport (Scotland) Act 1989. Indeed, much has been achieved by the successful companies that have emerged and those entrepreneurs who have flourished, such as Mr Souter. Mrs Thatcher made Mr Souter what he is and Alex Salmond keeps him where he is&#8212;a compliment that Mr Souter seems happy to return. True, there is a commercial fee for that, but what a dividend! Maybe that is the market failure to which Mr Gordon alludes&#8212;a commercial organisation failing to support Labour but free to make its own mistakes.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s 2001 act failed as a catalyst. Mr Gordon&#8217;s bill proposal collapsed in January last year and was neatly dispensed with by my very good friend and current UK coalition colleague Alison Mclnnes when she said:</p><p>&#8220;Any additional legislative approach, as proposed by Mr Gordon, may be unnecessary. In addition, I do not believe that Scotland&#8217;s bus services would be best served by additional regulation. Mr Gordon&#8217;s proposals would have been a strain on Scotland&#8217;s already overstretched local councils. It is likely they would have increased the costs involved for operators, while reducing private sector investment in the bus industry&#8221;.</p><p>It was true then, and it is true now.</p><p>In its briefing for today&#8217;s debate, the Confederation of Passenger Transport illustrates just how much is currently being invested by our commercial bus sector in the best interests of the public, whom Mr Gordon seeks to champion. It mentions the more than &#163;61 million that has been invested by Stagecoach in new vehicles in the last four years, with a bus fleet average age of eight years, 66 per cent of which is achieving the low-floor accessibility targets; the introduction of some 120 hybrid electric vehicles; a 57 per cent increase in McGill&#8217;s Bus Service&#8217;s fleet during the current year; a &#163;39 million investment by Lothian Buses over the past four years in new buses, with an entire fleet achieving the low-floor requirement; and a &#163;15 million investment by First Glasgow in the shuttle service to Glasgow airport. That is all being accomplished without the regulation that Mr Gordon seeks.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives believe that further opportunities exist if we open up our motorway hard-shoulder network and are able to sweat that asset to the advantage of passengers and commuters. That is why we welcome the commitment to complete the M8 and the progress that has been made in recent years on the M74 and M80.</p><p>I express disappointment&#8212;as does Stagecoach for that matter&#8212;at Scotland being allowed to fall behind the widespread rollout of hard-shoulder running in England by the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition Government. The postponement of the all-too cautious M77 pilot park-and-ride hard-shoulder running scheme, which would have facilitated new fast coach access to Glasgow from park-and-ride facilities in Ayrshire&#8212;a considerable additional investment in the area&#8212;is much to be regretted, and we will campaign in the forthcoming election for a major expansion of motorway hard-shoulder running, which will be a non-regulated additional opportunity for major investment in public passenger transport by the commercial bus industry.</p><p>Mr Gordon has provided us with a timely reminder this morning that, as in so many walks of life, Margaret Thatcher lit the beacon and showed us the way. Bus regulation belongs to our prehistoric industrial and political past. The last thing that our successful commercial bus industry requires is for dinosaurs to once again rule the earth&#8212;or, more particularly, the Government of Scotland.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-8177.3, to leave out from &#8220;believes&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;notes that voluntary partnerships between bus operators and local authorities have proved a successful means of delivering quality bus services in many areas of Scotland; congratulates Perth-based Stagecoach and Aberdeen-based FirstGroup on their unparalleled global success; further congratulates Lothian Buses on being named the best bus company in the UK for 2007 and notes the success that this company has achieved since the Transport (Scotland) Act 1989; therefore, in light of the clear evidence, cautions against the inappropriate regulation of bus services, and urges local authorities concerned about services in their area to examine those voluntary partnerships operating outside the statutory framework that have delivered most in terms of results and to consider what lessons can be learned and applied.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not think that I will, today.

I hope that this will be a relatively brief contribution in any event.</p><p>Like others, I begin by acknowledging the role of the Public Audit Committee and in particular the convenership of Hugh Henry, which as others have said has been recognised elsewhere and by Parliament. It is important that that should be so and that the committee should be on form at this time, because the work that it does is crucial in the current climate. David Whitton detailed at some length many of the important contributions that the Public Audit Committee has made.</p><p>At this time, when the economy is under the pressure that it is and public expenditure is under the scrutiny that it should be, it is important that the work of the Public Audit Committee is listened to and respected. The concern that it expresses&#8212;that it is not always able to assure itself that public funds have been spent efficiently&#8212;is something that the Parliament, in this session and the next session, must deal with and determine how to tackle. The report is intended to stimulate that debate and, in his opening speech, Hugh Henry detailed the themes and posed several key questions for Parliament to consider and address.</p><p>The report talks about accountability and governance and, indeed, the failure at times to tackle poor governance. I note that the committee</p><p>&#8220;believes that ... failures, particularly those at a senior level should be more rigorously challenged, rather than people simply being moved to other posts, often in senior positions.&#8221;</p><p>That is a fault not just in the public sector and in Government but in the private sector, where such a move is very often seen as the easy solution. That said, I suppose that, unlike in the public sector, incompetence in the private sector is not being underwritten by public money and there is a need to address such issues more directly. For example, we have got a bit too used to allowing the NHS to pay out record compensation levels of, say, &#163;35 million without necessarily tackling the causes behind such a payout in the first place or addressing the lack of proper accountability and governance that it represents.</p><p>The committee is quite critical of Transport Scotland and the electronic ticketing fiasco. It really beggars belief that something budgeted at &#163;9 million ended up costing &#163;42 million. I am also bewildered at the complete lack of understanding of the whole process that would be involved that the committee managed to establish. Those of us who travel abroad, including, I imagine, everyone in the chamber, are quite used to arriving in other countries and buying a kind of smart card that allows access to buses, trains, the underground&#8212;if such a thing exists&#8212;and various attractions. The whole operation seems to be run in a perfectly competent way. Then visitors come to Scotland, where we are unable to implement any kind of integrated system or, where we manage to implement a limited system, we do so at a quantifiable and subsequently proven public cost.</p><p>I think that the public find all of this confusing. After all, our nation produces more than its fair share of dry and deeply intense chartered accountants, who, in my limited experience, rarely leave their windowless offices other than for the occasional trip to Murrayfield. One would have thought that, with all that expertise, our nation would have been one of those most able to ensure that, when it embarks on public projects, it does so with a degree of accountability and good governance.</p><p>Hugh Henry mentioned the possible future implications of the trams and we should, of course, remember what happened with the Parliament building and electronic ticketing. However, as convener of the Forth Crossing Bill Committee, I am concerned about any potential implications if we do not ensure that the Forth crossing project has the very best governance, transparency and accountability. After all, if its budget were to have a similar overrun as that for electronic ticketing, we would be looking not at a &#163;2.1 billion project but at a &#163;10.5 billion project.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645603", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Session 3 reports of the Public Audit Committee &#8212; key themes&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

Nonetheless, I look forward to further trenchant comments from George Foulkes, even if they are made in his dotage on the red leather elsewhere.</p><p>The key point in the debate is the need of the Parliament and public to be reassured about the governance and transparency of major public sector projects.

When we find that we have been unable to contain the costs of a project and, for example, it has gone from &#163;9&#160;million to &#163;40&#160;million, people feel that it reflects badly on Scotland and belittles our reputation as a country of good governance and transparency, and that it belittles the reputation of the Scottish Parliament as a body that can bring about proper scrutiny in such matters.

It might have taken 11 years, but the new politics has finally arrived under devolution. The Scottish Conservatives welcome a Conservative-led Administration at Westminster, but we will not feel slavishly bound to endorse everything that it says or unable to stand up in Scotland&#8217;s interests when the circumstances dictate it.

Although we accept that the minister is supporting the motorist this afternoon, we have reservations about some of the actions to tackle climate change emissions that may be prejudicial to motorists. However, that is for another day.</p><p>Let us look at the history. As many members know, my background is in the motor industry. For 25 years, I watched changes in access to the motor car. I saw car ownership change from being something that was only for rich people to something to which many people were introduced when company car schemes became widespread. The car then became something that many families could afford and went on to become an essential item for many families.</p><p>The key thing is that, as well as having an effect on the rural economy, the rise in fuel duty is potentially regressive, as it could force many people on marginal incomes out of their vehicles. In future, only the rich will be able to afford to drive while people on marginal incomes and those who work in the rural economy will not. People in the rural economy do not have the same public transport alternatives as others do, so car usage is vital for rural families and businesses.</p><p>Why are we where we are today?

I will start with the most outstanding speech in the debate, which was from the former minister Stewart Stevenson. It takes a politician with a target-culture mentality that brooks no peer to tell us that his speech was his 400th performance in the chamber. Of course, we all know that every one of those contributions demonstrated a different expertise that arises from his many and varied careers.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson summed up matters well. He talked about the history of the motor car. When he bought his first car, it was probably cheaper than a tank of fuel today. My father said that the windscreen and the seat were optional&#8212;he used to bring back cars from the factory and sit on a box. However, the fuel was never optional&#8212;a car always needed fuel.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson made a key point on an argument that Mr Gordon must address in summing up. If the Labour amendment is not agreed to, will Labour support the motion? As we go towards the budget, will the Parliament speak with one voice on cancelling the fuel levy and introducing a fair fuel stabiliser? It will be shameful if we are not united when we leave the chamber tonight and if the Labour Party does not support the motion, which addresses directly the concerns of people across Scotland.</p><p>The second speech that I need to discuss is that from Mr Harvie. Sometimes, I do not have time but, tonight, I have a bit of time, because I have spoken twice. Here we go&#8212;we have the highest fuel prices in Europe and Mr Harvie does not feel that they are high enough. He wants people in this country to be uniquely prejudiced. He wants us uniquely to tackle the whole international oil situation and does not want it to be tackled by the wider community. He was reluctant to confirm whether he would support the 8p increase in the fuel duty escalator of his colleagues down south. I conclude from that only that he will have a much higher figure in his manifesto when he presents himself to the Scottish electorate.</p><p>Mr Harvie referred to the Office for Budget Responsibility, as did Mr Gordon several times. That body raised issues with the fair fuel stabiliser. One, of course, is in looking at the effects of higher energy prices. It is not the case that higher energy prices automatically generate endless additional income for the revenue. The cost of additional fuel means that other receipts from taxation go down and some benefit payments go up. It is not the case, as Mr Harvie said, that if things are made more efficient, we use less of them. Over the past 25 years we have made the motor car more efficient and a vehicle now travels far further on a tank of fuel. The effect of that has not been that people use their motor vehicles less; they use them more. Similarly, if we make homes more efficient, it does not mean that people necessarily use less energy; they may use more. In bringing people out of fuel poverty, we encourage them to heat their homes more than they did previously. It does not always follow that if things are made more efficient, people use them less. We cannot support Mr Harvie&#8217;s prejudiced attitude to the cost of fuel.</p><p>Cathy Peattie&#8217;s speech was typical of the speeches of a number of members. Over the years, I have come to the point where I never discard the genuine sincerity of her contributions, but when she said that the financial situation was not of Labour&#8217;s making and that it was not in its control, I had to take a deep breath. The financial situation with which we are faced is entirely of Labour&#8217;s making. The situation was completely out of control when her party was responsible for it. Instead of crying crocodile tears tonight, Labour members should be hammering their discredited big chum in Fife. He was responsible for the shambles that we find ourselves in.</p><p>David Stewart was quick, as other members were, to say that the coalition Government was a little slow in coming forward with the fuel duty escalator. However, when Mr McArthur intervened on him with the most basic question about the level at which he would pitch the duty, he was unable to answer. Therein lies the inherent difficulty that the coalition Government is seeking to deal with.

At that time, the suggestion of such a plant was dismissed as scaremongering, yet it became apparent within a few weeks that plans existed and, in fact, were far worse than anything we had anticipated.</p><p>What is being proposed for Newton Mearns&#8212;a quiet, leafy, residential suburb&#8212;takes us nearer the world of &#8220;Quatermass&#8221; and the movie sets of James Bond. We are being presented with a hellish vision: an unsolicited application for the largest waste incineration plant in Europe, which will be built on green-belt land, be bigger than the 18-hole golf course that will sit beside it and will have more than a dozen chimneys, each as high as 400ft. The golf course makes it sound quite attractive, but the building will be 1 million square feet in size, with a multistorey car park, a visitor centre&#8212;haud me back&#8212;and two heavy goods vehicle lorry parks. It will be open 24 hours a day and will process 1.5 million tonnes of waste annually. To put that into some sort of perspective, East Renfrewshire will generate 31,000 tonnes of those 1.5 million tonnes.</p><p>The developers, in their dazzling, shiny presentation, risibly call the project a &#8220;Lifetime Recycling Village&#8221;, conjuring up images of a Disney-style retraining and holiday camp for pensioners&#8212;or worse. In fact, one 90-year-old local community activist said to me, &#8220;Jackson, dinnae tell me&#8212;is this where they&#8217;re gonna put me when my time&#8217;s up?&#8221; It does rather sound as if that is its purpose.</p><p>This is East Renfrewshire, which is Europe&#8217;s largest suburb. There is no history of an industrial tradition in Eastwood or Newton Mearns, and the area has one of the largest elderly communities in Scotland. It is true, as the developers said to me, that a number of jobs will be created. In fact, they light-heartedly offered my mother, who will soon turn 80, a job in the 24-hour canteen if she would like it.</p><p>In the literature that the developers have produced in presenting the project, Newton Mearns has regressed to its 1926 boundaries, as it is shown stopping somewhere just north of Clarkston rather than advancing nearer the project. That is all designed to suggest a smaller project than is being proposed. It is not a Disney-style retraining camp. Let us cut to the chase: it is a massive industrial incinerator on a scale unseen anywhere else in the United Kingdom or Europe.</p><p>I get lost in the science of this: biomass, anaerobic digestion, ball mill technology, gasification and plasma vitrification. To the ordinary individual, that is all science fiction, but a colleague of mine is visiting a plasma vitrification plant today in Italy to see the process at work. The key point is that the technology is not available to be demonstrated in the UK; it does not operate successfully anywhere in our country.</p><p>The developers, in their critique of my motion, have said that it is not an incinerator. When is an incinerator an incinerator? LRV&#8217;s chief development officer, Willy Findlater, said in a presentation to East Renfrewshire councillors last week that 900,000 tonnes of waste will be incinerated. I would have thought that if someone is incinerating something, they are probably incinerating it in an incinerator. The European Union defines the gasification process that is at play as incineration, although one of the LRV management team helpfully told us that there are many different ways to label things. Indeed, but we will stick with the official EU description, which is incineration.</p><p>We are told that the project will create thousands of jobs, but the figures move from one week to the next. At last week&#8217;s presentations to the council and the public, we were told that 3,000 construction jobs will be created. However, in today&#8217;s briefing for MSPs, the number has become 4,000, which is a great increase in just a week. We were also told that hundreds of jobs will be created on-site, but the fact is that many of them will displace existing jobs in local plants that deal with waste around the west of Scotland. We were told that 1,000 permanent positions will be created, but that number dropped to 328 in last week&#8217;s presentation to the local community and has gone back up to 700 in today&#8217;s presentation to MSPs. This is just fantasy. From one day to the next, the facts change.</p><p>We are told that it will be a power station, which is why the minister will have an opportunity to consider whether she wishes to approve it. It will generate 96MW of power, 56MW of which will be available to the national grid. Interestingly, however, there is no connection to the national grid, so the developers have said that they will connect this power to the Whitelee wind farm, which, sitting just to the south of Newton Mearns, also happens to be the largest in Europe. When asked how that will be done, they say, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll probably erect pylons.&#8221; How many pylons? What size will they be? When will they be erected? Alternatively&#8212;those who are involved in the Beauly to Denny power line should wait until they hear this&#8212;the power might be transmitted by cables buried underground. Aye right&#8212;we have heard that one before. We have been told that if that does not work, the power will be used to serve an industrial village next door to the plant. What industrial village next door to the plant on green-belt land? The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is concerned that the project will simply vent the heat that it generates into the atmosphere.</p><p>I seek ministers&#8217; assurance on one particular point. The developers are putting it about in the community, with a nod and a wink, that they have received the official nod from Scotland Office officials that the project will proceed.</p><p>There is also the issue of the number of trucks that will be required to service the development. Let me do the maths. Thirty-two-tonne trucks are capable of delivering 22 tonnes of waste when full. Shifting 1.5 million tonnes of waste in 365 days would require 68,182 trucks making 136,364 movements. That is 374 a day, 16 an hour or one every 3.45 minutes. In the time that I have been speaking, two of those trucks would have driven through the chamber. That is before we consider the movements of staff and the visitors to the project.</p><p>I am not here to grandstand, showboat or join a bandwagon. I did not choose the timing of this project. It sits next to the Brother Loch, which is a sentimental place for me. My grandparents fished there&#8212;they settled in the community 100 years ago&#8212;and I was brought up there. Those who know me know that I am not the sort of person who volunteers to lie down in front of bulldozers or mount that sort of protest, but I will in this case. This project, with its chimneys venting invisible clouds of mushroom residue into the atmosphere, is absolutely inconsistent with Government policy.</p><p>In 2009, the national health service, SEPA and Health Protection Scotland said that the science of incineration is inconsistent and inconclusive. The project might well be professionally presented and well intentioned but, if it goes ahead, it will be a descent into hell for the Eastwood community.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644808", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Waste Incineration Plant (Loganswell)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As someone who suggested a few months ago that Parliament should sit a bit longer, it is only appropriate that this members&#8217; business debate should start at 6 o&#8217;clock rather than at 5 o&#8217;clock.

Yesterday, we saw Labour&#8217;s unseemly arrogance in thinking that it is entitled to power, but that arrogance was absent from Des McNulty&#8217;s speech, in which he was humble enough to say that, whether Labour is in government or opposition, he will work with the other parties in the Parliament to address and improve matters and ensure that we have an effective early intervention strategy.</p><p>We have said that we want a national strategy, and we are prepared to see an annual investment of &#163;20 million in that.

Indeed, I commend to Shona Robison the working partnership on tackling carbon emissions that we have evolved with her colleague Roseanna Cunningham. We have resisted the suggestion that others have made that we should put in place a regulatory framework with penalties, because we need to change the culture of people and the approach to carbon emissions.

The Conservatives brought that debate back to Parliament and make no apology for doing so in the cycle of parliamentary business. Des McNulty, too, need make no apology for bringing back to Parliament a debate on the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice, because it is unfinished business. It is a matter on which most, if not all, members have agreed, but which remains unresolved as this session of Parliament draws to a close.</p><p>I have no particular comment to make and cannot add anything new to the debate, so I intend to be brief. Ross Finnie, Gil Paterson and, in particular, Des McNulty have spoken in all the debates on St Margaret of Scotland Hospice during this session of Parliament and are equally committed to ensuring that the matter is resolved. I have said repeatedly that I regard it as my responsibility as a regional member of the Parliament to give every assistance to the campaign in defence of the hospice, which Des McNulty has admirably led.</p><p>Like other members, I am able to give personal testimony, having had relatives who were lovingly looked after in their final days by staff at the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice, so I know what an outstanding job they do. I am also happy to pay tribute to the commitment of both Sister Rita, who is one of the most formidable women I have met&#8212;I will not say that she is scary, as that is probably an oxymoron in the context&#8212;and to Leo Martin, who has taken over responsibility. They have given admirable, obvious, sustained and committed leadership to the campaign that has been mounted on behalf of the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have had to endure endless prevarication by the health board over what needs to be done. That has ended in a ludicrous stand-off, which I previously invited the cabinet secretary to try to break by appointing a special representative to broker an arrangement and draw the matter to a conclusion. However, that has just not happened. With only weeks of the session of Parliament left, we are still more or less where we were. Eighteen months ago, we were told that the hospice could carry on until 2012. I said then that, surely, we do not have to wait until the 11th hour in 2012 to find a resolution. Let us use the time that we have now to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.</p><p>Interestingly, Des McNulty says that there is a commonsense solution. The most formidable woman I have come across in politics once said to me, &#8220;The problem with common sense, Jackson, is that it actually isn&#8217;t very common.&#8221; In the context of the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice, I am afraid that that is very much the case.</p><p>We now have the announcement about Blawarthill hospital. If I were the cabinet secretary, I would be pretty annoyed. The cabinet secretary has given every latitude that she could give to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. She has given it every encouragement and impetus to try to get a discussion going. She has been quite sympathetic to the arguments that it has made, albeit that she has always said that she wants a solution.</p><p>What do we now have from the health board? The suggestion of a review. What can that review do? We know that the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice is ready, willing and able to provide the on-going care that it has always provided. Suppose that we were to consider the options of the review at the end of the summer. Are we seriously to suppose that one of them would be that, between the end of the summer and spring next year, the health board could identify another site, find architects, secure planning and build another facility&#8212;all to frustrate St Margaret of Scotland Hospice and prevent its carrying on? Is the health board so perverse that it would open up portakabins somewhere and put people in them to stop the facility at the hospice?</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644636", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Margaret of Scotland Hospice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We began today&#8217;s business with a debate on health visitors.

The point at the centre of Mr Allan&#8217;s speech&#8212;that of local knowledge&#8212;was compellingly made. I pay tribute to those bold and hardy souls who provide coastguard services in the dangerous waters around Scotland. Countless lives have been saved over the years as a result of their bravery and professionalism and, for that, we are all indebted to them. I have no doubt that local members will give us their direct and first-hand experience of the risks that people in those services take and the lives that they save. If my colleague Jamie McGrigor is fortunate enough to be called to speak in the debate, he will do so.</p><p>Any organisation, no matter its function, must be prepared to adapt to circumstance if it is to remain effective. In the case of the coastguard, the Liberal Democrat-Conservative Government is exploring whether the current structure might support the premise that the service is not as well placed as it might be to respond to the challenges that are faced in modern times. The alleged lack of national co-ordination between the various coastguard centres in the UK can result in limited resilience and an uneven distribution of workload, potentially critically so during busier emergency periods.</p><p>The UK Government has said that it hopes that, by utilising the latest technologies, a more integrated and improved service can be delivered. Mike Penning MP, the UK minister who was in the Scottish Parliament recently, is overseeing the consultation exercise, which, as Alasdair Allan&#8217;s motion explains, foresees two nationally networked maritime operation centres&#8212;one on the south coast of England and the other in Aberdeen. With improved information systems, those centres, so the argument runs, will be capable of managing maritime incidents wherever and whenever they occur.</p><p>Although I am in principle in favour of a review of the coastguard service, I share the concerns that have been expressed about the overall reduction in operation centres in Scotland. Regrettably, I suspect that cost will be at least one motivating factor and I have sympathy with the UK Government regarding that, as ministers grapple with spending allocations. However, cost alone would not be an appropriate justification for restructuring the service, although nor are cost concerns an invalid catalyst for a review of any service. All Scottish local authorities participating in the Scottish National Party&#8217;s historic concordat have had to review their operations and make efficiencies or find new ways of doing things. In truth, that exercise should be on-going, whatever the budget settlement. So it is not unacceptable per se for a review of or consultation on any service to take place.</p><p>As members will know, the consultation, which is available on the MCA website, runs until 24 March. Therefore, no firm decisions have as yet been made. I will play my part in ensuring that the Department for Transport takes note of tonight&#8217;s debate. I will certainly be in touch with Mr Penning&#8217;s office regarding what has been said. In particular, I will draw to his attention Duncan McNeil&#8217;s suggestion regarding a possible appropriate opportunity for MSPs to question him directly on the proposals.</p><p>I am certain that my good friends and UK coalition colleagues the Liberal Democrats will also be to the fore on the matter. The Liberal Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, will, together with Danny Alexander and other Scottish Liberal MPs, use any influence they have to achieve a positive outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, the consultation seeks to evolve and modernise Scotland&#8217;s coastguard services. Nonetheless, Scottish Conservatives accept that there are legitimate concerns and understandable fears about the consequences of plans for Scottish operations. I therefore urge all parties to work together, as Alasdair Allan has suggested, to ensure that the best possible outcome for Scotland&#8217;s vital coastguard provision is achieved.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643628", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Coastguard Centre Cuts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Alasdair Allan on securing this important debate, which is on a matter that the Scottish Conservatives accept is of the greatest significance to Scotland.

Undoubtedly, the public at large and certain sections in particular are committed to the task ahead. Others are less convinced, and I suspect that a significant majority, including many of those who notionally are engaged, are unaware of the enormity of the proposed task.</p><p>For public engagement to be sustained throughout the next 40 years&#8212;not just in 2049&#8212;politicians would be wise to accept that the support of the public can be fickle. For instance, do the public actually accept that the emissions priority, which is set out like no other in legislative terms, should be the supreme point of reference? Will they accept all deeds exercised in its name, however blunt the instruments proposed? I suspect not. If, as we progress, we impose because we have failed to persuade, that will be our failure, not a failure of the public. Were it to come down to a choice between achieving the emissions targets of the 2009 act or regenerating Scotland's economy and the wealth and prosperity of Scots, I suspect that the latter would prevail with the overwhelming majority. It is important, therefore, that it does not come down to a choice. Already, business is suspicious that certain politicians would rather bite off their carbon nose to spite their economic face. For that reason, I have dissented from the committee report on the question of the balance between a voluntary and a regulatory approach.</p><p>The rush by the committee to embrace new measures and criteria for the imposition of a regulatory framework is a depressing admission of a failure that is yet to materialise. By definition, an admission that the voluntary approach will fail and will need to be supported by a regulatory <place-holder colnum=\"32051\"/> framework implies a failure by the public to be sufficiently engaged and committed, but it will not be their failure, it will be ours as politicians.</p><p>I caution now that if we cannot persuade the public, any regulatory framework that imposes policies and views on them unwillingly and in the face of all the circumstances of the moment will lead to bitter resentment and perhaps fundamental disengagement and an alteration in the public mood.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1: \"Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I apologise for the late arrival of myself and my colleague.

There is much more to be done in opening the minds of car users to alternating use of their vehicles with travel by public transport, which they may not have even considered as a more efficient way of accomplishing a particular journey.

The motor vehicle that is sold and driven on our roads today is technically unrecognisable from the one that was sold a generation ago. Last week, the Ford Motor Company unveiled an electric Ford Focus. The development of such mainstream best-selling models in electric form is significant, as is their availability. We should not underestimate the investment that is being made in more efficient vehicles by manufacturers. The market will adjust and the motor vehicle of the future will prove just as unrecognisable technically a generation hence, and an imposed 50mph speed limit in such a world would be wholly irrelevant.</p><p>Finally, I throw my weight behind the long-standing efforts of my committee colleague, Rob Gibson, regarding the potential for the restoration of peatland through rewetting.

In the face of a national emergency, Scots were wholly unimpressed with politicians who scrambled to do what politicians are inclined to do&#8212;to blame one another. People desperately wanted to hear a clear and reliable statement of precisely what was going on and an expression of resolve from politicians of all parties to address the underlying issue&#8212;our inability, which we have seen time and again, to provide an effective national response to a weather emergency and to fix the situation so that we have such a response next time.</p><p>The public understood perfectly well that Scotland and the minister had been overwhelmed by events.

For example, as people drive in perilous snow and look to overhead motorway gantries for essential advice, what is the point of telling them to consider cycling rather than driving or that snow is forecast? When we are told not to make a journey unless it is absolutely necessary, what does that mean? Does it mean that we can proceed with due care and diligence or that we should proceed with no journey unless a life depends on it?</p><p>It was inadvisable of some to exploit a decade of mild winters as irrefutable evidence in support of another campaign, however worthy or essential. We are fortunate not to have experienced regularly the severest winter weather that was once commonplace throughout large parts of Scotland. After 25 years in the retail motor industry, I can attest that we were fortunate last week to have the enormous technical improvements that have taken place in cars and commercial vehicles in the 25 years since we previously had a storm of such magnitude. Given that there are far more vehicles on the roads today, had those advances not been made there would have been 10 times the number of individual mechanical breakdowns. Had anti-lock braking not become standard, the number of serious accidents could have been dreadful.</p><p>If severe weather events are once again emerging as part of the expected pattern of winter life, what can we do to better inform the public of what might well be coming their way? We should be able to implement an authoritative Government code that traffic-lights severe weather warnings, similar to the system that applies to a national security alert, or the system that was used for the national flu pandemic. For the most severe weather, the advice would be clear: do not travel. At a level that is one step less severe, people should appreciate that they must travel with extreme care and be prepared for an emergency. The introduction of such an authoritative system does not require the commitment of any major budget; it requires the application and energy of current ministers to effect its introduction. I welcome the cabinet secretary's advice that the Government is specifically looking into that idea.</p><p>In addition, I urge the Government to enter into discussions with broadcasters, particularly BBC Scotland, to forge an agreement that, when the severest weather emergency occurs, the public can be assured that authoritative statements will be broadcast at least hourly by a partnership of national and local government, Transport Scotland and the police, to seek to give them reliable information on which they can base informed decisions. For those who are stranded and conserving power, the certainty of the regular timing of such broadcasts would provide <place-holder colnum=\"31647\"/> reassurance as well as advice, and it would overcome the difficulties with standalone helplines, which the cabinet secretary identified&#8212;although I also understand the merits of using a helpline.</p><p>Such advice and reassurance was all that many people were looking for last week. They fully appreciated that the event that they were enduring was unparalleled, but they could not understand why they were getting contradictory information and advice that seemed general in character and remote to the challenges that they were facing.</p><p>It is truly ironic that we have never had more media to tune into, but with less reliable, helpful or consistent advice broadcast. Neither Government nor politicians can control the weather, but we can do much more to prepare Scotland to meet the challenge that a severe weather event presents. Parliament and Government must convince Scotland that we are ourselves fit for purpose and capable of meeting these challenges with a sense of urgency that will lead to measures that, next time, will demonstrate that Scotland's national response in the face of a weather emergency is second to none.</p><p>I support Mr Kerr's motion and the Government amendment. I move amendment S3M-7604.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and further calls on the Scottish Government to give consideration to a traffic-light style graded system of severe weather warnings.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145235", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wholly agree with the cabinet secretary.

Although I am leading for the Conservatives, I will combine my remarks with observations as convener of the Forth Crossing Bill Committee.</p><p>The bill was introduced in November last year, passing stage 2 only last month. Now, some 13 months after its passage began, we will conclude stage 3. By most legislative standards, that is a long time for a measure, which itself is the first hybrid bill to be introduced to the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Through its passage&#8212;until today at least&#8212;the bill has been led by the former minister Stewart Stevenson. On a personal note and for the record. I say that I found Mr Stevenson at all times to be courteous, well briefed and concerned for the communities involved, as well as being seized with an understanding of the importance and scale of a new Forth crossing. I am in no doubt that the bill could have foundered had an inappropriate approach been adopted, and it is a tribute to Mr Stevenson that he understood that and ensured its smooth passage. I think it is too much for him to expect that it may come to be known as the Stevenson bridge, but he should be content to know that his contribution was a vital component to holding it together, just as the steel will be in holding it up.</p><p>I also thank the clerks&#8212;Sarah Robertson and her colleagues&#8212;who managed the extraordinary volume of material at the various stages of our proceedings effectively and with aplomb. I point out the effective way that Sarah disappointed those members who, only partly in jest, thought that a tour of bridges around the globe would be the most appropriate fact-finding expedition. Instead, she substituted that with a minivan tour around the precincts of the likely route on a bitterly cold and windswept day.</p><p>I add my thanks to Hugh O'Donnell, David Stewart and Joe FitzPatrick&#8212;my colleagues on the committee. As the bill was a hybrid bill, it was necessary for all members of the committee to be present at all of its meetings, and they did that without fail.<place-holder colnum=\"31588\"/></p><p>Even more importantly, I pay tribute and offer my congratulations to the many individuals and community groups who actively engaged in the process throughout. For most, that involved a very substantial personal commitment. It was, in every sense, worth while. Much-deserved success was achieved in improving many of the bill's provisions. A bewildering array of issues was outstanding at the conclusion of stage 1, but any comparison with the schedule that went before the assessor, Hugh Begg&#8212;whom I also thank&#8212;demonstrates the substance of that success.</p><p>In the event, not every objection or alternative proposal could succeed&#8212;many were contradictory. However, it was important to the committee that it facilitate an opportunity for everyone to challenge the promoter and present their case. The committee believes that, after a shaky start, the promoter&#8212;Transport Scotland&#8212;engaged in the process after stage 1 and it looks forward to that engagement continuing during the construction process if the bill is passed later this afternoon.</p><p>The Forth Crossing Bill was the first hybrid bill to be introduced to the Scottish Parliament, and the committee is keen that its experiences be communicated. Therefore, we will send a short report to the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee at the end of the parliamentary session.</p><p>On completion of the bridge, Scotland will have a new Forth crossing and will have three adjacent bridges from three centuries. That will be an extraordinary and physically visible testament to our nation's engineering and construction heritage. I am sure that it will be an iconic location for observers and travellers the world over.</p><p>I will make one final and personal observation. At various stages, the committee was invited to argue for the inclusion of a public transport strategy in the bill. We resisted, but the future disposition of the existing Forth crossing will become the focus of a subsequent public debate.</p><p>In essence, we provide the new crossing not as a replacement, but in addition to the existing bridges. In short, it is required because it is not possible to undertake necessary remedial repairs to the existing Forth road bridge and keep it operational in any meaningful way during a prolonged period of at least seven years. However, those repairs can be initiated on completion of the new crossing, and the life of the existing Forth crossing can be extended by many decades at least.</p><p>What will the public expect from that further investment? For the moment, a proposal for a dedicated public transport corridor is loosely advanced. That proposition seems to me to be <place-holder colnum=\"31589\"/> publicly unsustainable. The idea that the existing crossing will enjoy a future in which nothing other than a bus or two crosses over every half hour or so is patently ridiculous.</p><p>Of course, we have many years ahead during which the new crossing will be built and, thereafter, the existing crossing will, potentially, be subject to thorough refurbishment. Although the need to agree the future public purpose of the existing bridge is, therefore, not immediate, it should be the subject of an informed public debate.</p><p>Scotland will have a new Forth crossing that enjoys the support of all the main parties that are represented in the Parliament. How we pay for it is now for the Government to determine. Together with my Conservative colleagues and my colleagues on the Forth Crossing Bill Committee, I look forward to the project receiving the endorsement of the Scottish Parliament at decision time tonight.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21142749", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Crossing Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome Keith Brown to his new ministerial post.

I pay tribute to Irene Oldfather for the way in which she set out the committee&#8217;s report with some clarity. She identified in detail the challenges to Scotland from the Lisbon treaty, and the need to ensure that Scotland is able to engage with colleagues at Westminster in an effective manner&#8212;which was the key point&#8212;to further its interests.</p><p>I welcome Irene Oldfather&#8217;s approach to the committee conveners: I was encouraged by the response that she was able to detail and I look forward to seeing how that develops in the new year.</p><p>The minister gave a positive welcome to the committee, and her contribution was the first occasion I can recall on which there was no repetition of the independence litany. I give thanks for such small mercies. I know it was there beneath the surface, unspoken, but we got through the whole debate without having it positioned. Pauline McNeill made a sensible and well-illustrated contribution. Although I may not share <place-holder colnum=\"31483\"/> her enthusiasm&#8212;she had certain reservations, but she is more enthusiastic about the whole European project than I am&#8212;I thought that her points were clear and well made. In particular, I appreciated her illustration of the benefits of and the need for the early-warning system with regard to the potential consequences for the legal system. Helen Eadie expanded on that and brought in to support it evidence from a number of the experts who have appeared before the committee.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank again emphasised the need for vigilance and the need for a formal mechanism. In fact, in some nations in Europe, there is even a constitutionally established mechanism. The key point that I return to, which Irene Oldfather made, is that the mechanism needs to be effective.</p><p>Ian McKee made up for Fiona Hyslop, of course, with a paranoid contribution in which the more naked independence arguments were brought out. He was followed by Christopher Harvie, with one of his idiosyncratic, if illuminating, polemics. His independent commentary is always fascinating and intriguingly caustic. His speeches always make us think, even when their relevance to immediate concerns and matters at hand can be tenuous. We will lose Mr Harvie at the next election. The Deputy Presiding Officer should lobby the BBC. He would be the ideal man to do the Royal Institution Christmas lectures next year. He could give us five polemics over our Christmas holiday period, which I am sure that we would all be better for.</p><p>Frank McAveety illustrated why he will be an engaging and entertaining member of the European and External Relations Committee. Helen Eadie and I must both wish that he had been a member of the Subordinate Legislation Committee during all the years in which we have struggled through its meetings. Mr McAveety talked about engagement for Scotland&#8217;s future advantage. He also brought up the ghost of 1967. What happened then is seared in my memory for reasons that he might not expect. My parents were away on holiday, and the lady who came to look after us did not have a television set, so her entire family descended on us. That evening was an education in many ways that I had not quite expected. It burns in my consciousness even to this day. Bill Kidd made a business-like speech. I will close by taking on board a point that he made, which sums up the great expectation of and hope for the SNP Government. He said that he was sceptical of the treaty initially, but realpolitik means that, in the best interests of Scotland, we must make its provisions work.

With communications and power paralysed, the potential threat of a submarine-based response would be our only effective deterrent.

It is a nonsense to pretend that, in Scotland, we can posture against our own national defence capability while being defended by it.

We supported the reduction in cost of the prepayment certificate, which at that point was &#163;98.70. We did so for a couple of reasons. First, we accepted that there had been a significant increase in the overall contribution to the health service through the rise in national health insurance contributions from the public. Secondly, we accepted that the accelerated rate of increase in prescription charges had got to a point at which a multiple prescription cost for many people was a considerable financial burden. We supported&#8212;and our manifesto committed us to supporting&#8212;a reduction in the costs to those with long-term conditions.</p><p>I want to challenge a point that the cabinet secretary made and explain the argument in slightly more detail. She said that the Conservative position is that those who can afford to pay for prescriptions should do so and that they are the people who currently pay for prescriptions. I do not believe that that is the case: it is a much more complicated position than that.</p><p>The basis on which people currently pay for prescriptions is nothing to do with whether they can afford to pay. My mother is a higher rate taxpayer. She is nearly 80 years old. She could well afford to pay for her prescriptions, but because she is a pensioner she does not. There are millionaires who could well afford to pay for prescriptions for their children, but because the prescriptions are for children they do not.</p><p>Jackie Baillie made the not unreasonable point that there are people among the 600,000 who still pay prescription charges who do not have masses of money to dispose of and for whom paying a prescription charge is a considerable matter. That is why we supported the original reduction in the overall prescription charge. In an ideal world in which there was no financial consequence facing the NHS&#8212;another issue that I will come to&#8212;it could be argued that abolishing prescription charges would be a priority for spending, but we are not in that position.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has never addressed an issue that has come up in many of the debates. It is a point that I will illustrate with an experience relating to my wife&#8212;who said she hoped that I would at least be discreet enough not to say what her prescription was for. I went along to the pharmacy to pick up a repeat prescription on her behalf. The pharmacist said to me, \"Mr Carlaw, the cost of this medicine as a retail item is cheaper <place-holder colnum=\"30589\"/> than what you pay for the prescription. It would be cheaper for you to buy it and tear up the prescription than to pay for the prescription.\" That is what I did.</p><p>Between the ages of 14 and 40, I was a long-term migraine sufferer. I picked up across-the-counter medicine for migraine&#8212;Migraleve&#8212;which now costs between &#163;7 and &#163;10, depending on whether someone buys 16 or 32 tablets. I presume that, when I suffered from migraine, I was sick as in the terms of the cabinet secretary's amendment. Once we have abolished prescription charges, what will be the incentive for people not to go to the doctor for a prescription so that they can get, free of charge, over-the-counter medicines that they currently routinely pay for? What is the cost to the NHS and to GP practices of individuals going to the doctor for a prescription for an over-the-counter medicine? To some extent, that practice has been experienced in Wales and Northern Ireland, and if the health secretary is determined to proceed she owes us at least an explanation of how she will deal with that point.</p><p>In the final analysis, I accept that, with all her customary grace, charm and intelligence, the cabinet secretary has been committed to the policy throughout. It was in her manifesto, the SNP supported it, and it intends to deliver it. That is the complete opposite to the position of the party that seeks to be in government next May. There is no principle in the Labour position; we have simply seen a politically expedient act on its part because it is frightened to stand up for what it stood for at the last election and for what Gordon Brown stood for in the rest of the United Kingdom. There is no principle underpinning Labour's support for the cabinet secretary's amendment, and it is a poor state of affairs to consider that it should ever be in charge of the nation's Government if that is how it seeks to operate.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21091650", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prescription Charges"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Sadly, the invitation to witness the proceedings not having arrived, I can only take the cabinet secretary's word for it.

I might not accept the speech in total, but it was fascinating in the round.</p><p>I congratulate the Royal Society of Chemistry on its further success&#8212;I gather that today's event is the 10th&#8212;and on its reception, from which I have just come. The event had a remarkable collection of speakers, including members such as my colleague Alex Johnstone, who was involved earlier today, and&#8212;most agreeably&#8212;a number of award winners, who were pupils with excellent performance grades in physics, advanced physics, biology, chemistry and advanced chemistry.</p><p>When I was over at Our Dynamic Earth, I was drawn to an experiment in which my colleague John Lamont&#8212;among others in the course of the day&#8212;was set on fire. That is something that many members may want to be able to do. He entrusted his jacket and specs to me when the exercise was undertaken, but he was slightly more circumspect about giving over his wallet.</p><p>Given the emphasis on young people, I was particularly drawn to the Scottish Council for <place-holder colnum=\"30276\"/> Development and Industry sponsorship of the young engineers and science clubs in which many schools around the country participate. On this occasion I was particularly delighted, because the young people had been involved in constructing a full working model of a Dalek. I have to confess that I am the owner of a fully operational Dalek&#8212;a full-sized, talking model. The minister smiles, but when I hear some of his colleagues talking in a very staccato manner during debates, I am immediately drawn to the idea that I am facing the Daleks of the front bench. I do not accuse the minister of that; clearly, he is more of a Master than a Dalek.</p><p>The young people to whom I refer are worth celebrating, although it has to be said that, of themselves, they do not offer the required response to the challenge that Scottish employers are articulating, which is that of encouraging Government to use all available levers to encourage pupils to continue their science and mathematics studies through school and into further and higher education. In short, we must reverse the apparent dearth of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students.</p><p>Given the recession and the potential for rising youth unemployment, it is inarguable that we need to encourage students in this field. Why? Because, as the Royal Society of Chemistry says in its excellent briefing, chemistry research generates 21 per cent of our gross domestic product and supports 20 per cent of jobs, thereby generating some &#163;3.5 billion of manufacturing exports and a revenue stream that is worth some &#163;9.3 billion. That is supported by some 150 Scottish chemical companies, all of which are punching above their weight&#8212;an expression that Bill Wilson himself used. As the RSC points out rather tellingly, we need this new research not least because the Scottish Parliament has adopted legislatively enforceable targets for carbon emission reductions. We have set the ambitious target for renewable generation of 80 per cent by 2020. Thus far, I am not persuaded that we know how we will achieve that. We will have to rely to an extent on new science developments in future years. Indeed, we will have to do that sooner rather than later if we want to avoid some of the unpalatable and politically unsupportable options that we will have to canvass and potentially progress. We should encourage at every level the development of science and research in Scotland.</p><p>Again, I congratulate Bill Wilson. As we debate the subject of science in Parliament and schools, I know that he will have at the forefront of his mind those who entered our trade from a science background, most notably Margaret Thatcher, a woman who clearly understood all of Bill Wilson's <place-holder colnum=\"30277\"/> many educational needs.

Therefore, I commend him at least for slapping down firmly the craven ambitions of his colleagues, putting them in their place and making it clear that he is completely in tune with the Westminster Government's intention that the surplus should be used to develop renewable <place-holder colnum=\"29737\"/> energy opportunities in Scotland.

I accept that the whole debate about the rights and wrongs of having nuclear weapons as part of our defence capability is legitimate and of enormous significance, and that it can have a moral dimension. However, what is moral about hoping that the rest of the United Kingdom&#8212;or Europe, for that matter&#8212;will compensate for our folly if we abandon a nuclear power capability?

That is long overdue, although I fully accept&#8212;as Lewis Macdonald will point out&#8212;that it will not be an easy or straightforward task. Compromises will be necessary, and there are elements of the current system that we would not wish to lose as part of that process, not least to ensure that we maintain our focus on tackling fuel poverty.</p><p>However, a system that is specifically designed to incentivise the siting of generation plants close to centres of demand is no longer in keeping with the policy objectives that successive Governments north and south of the border have set.

He drew attention to the fact that per capita investment on cycling in Scotland was about &#163;3.30. As he was speaking, I looked down and noted that my copy of the report on the subject costs &#163;8.10, which I suppose is some sort of relative reflection on the matter.</p><p>I have to suggest that the minister's masticating habits are something that he might better confine to the privacy of his diary. In his speech, however, he drew attention to the smarter choices, smarter places programme, which was also mentioned in his letter to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee. Seven councils are participating in the programme: Dumfries and Galloway, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Falkirk, Glasgow and Orkney.</p><p>This is where I have some difficulty. In East Renfrewshire, the money is being used to employ a number of individuals who are wandering around the town of Barrhead knocking on doors to discuss public transport options with residents. When people see how money is being spent by the council that has the worst record in Scotland for investment in the infrastructure of roads and pavements, the wish of the public at large to encourage cycling or walking more broadly can be undermined by a perception that it is not actually a priority use for the cash in hand.</p><p>I largely agreed with Charlie Gordon's central point, whereby he drew attention to the elephant not in the room: the Government's cycling action plan for Scotland, which we have to see and understand before we can really appreciate whether the report's recommendations, many of which are commonsensical, are going to have the required drive and leadership behind them. Marlyn Glen spoke about that issue of leadership in her speech, and much depends on it.

It was a choice between being trained in cycling proficiency for an afternoon in the playground in the summer term and spending the time in class doing other work. It is not a big surprise which of the two options they took, but did that encourage them to become lifelong cyclists thereafter? No, it did not. We must be measured in our belief that, simply because we offer training to individuals, they will, as a matter of course, choose to cycle.

I think that it has a couple of hundred thousand pounds, compared with more than &#163;1 million for Scotland's Commissioner For Children and Young People. There was a belief that it made sense for that arrangement to be allowed to establish itself.

Undoubtedly, that combination will enhance the image of Scotland the world over.</p><p>I hasten to add that that thought in no way predisposed us to settle on a bridge as the preferred means of crossing in our early consideration of the available options. Those means were many and varied, and the committee was grateful to those who gave their time, expertise and local knowledge in helping us to grapple with and better understand the issues. They made the process less painful than it would otherwise have been for the committee.</p><p>The project has been the subject of debate for years. The original \"Setting Forth\" studies for a new crossing were carried out in the 1990s, and <place-holder colnum=\"26556\"/> they were succeeded by the Forth replacement crossing study, which began in 2006.</p><p>I do not intend in my remarks to dwell on the current deterioration of the Forth road bridge. Others today may have comments to make about it, building on those a moment ago of the minister. Each suspension bridge must be designed individually to take account of many factors, and one of the most crucial elements for the overall safety of suspension bridges is without doubt the main cable. Although each bridge is individual, around the world there appears to be developing a common problem with corrosion in cables. In any event, what the committee heard in evidence, as summarised in the report, convinced all committee members that there was no alternative to an alternative crossing over the Forth.</p><p>I do not intend either to go into any detail about the choice of a bridge versus a tunnel or the location of the proposed new bridge, as I believe that those issues are set out clearly in the committee's report and in other papers that have been published over the period. Again, the evidence that the committee saw and heard suggested that the choice of a cable-stayed bridge in a location nearest the existing road infrastructure was reasonable in the particular setting of the Forth and considering the topography of the Forth basin.</p><p>It became apparent to the committee fairly early on that the proposed scheme, as set out in the bill, comprises three strands: the bridge itself, together with the road build and infrastructure on the Lothian south side and the road build and infrastructure on the Fife north side, which make up the principal contract. A further two contracts are to be let separately&#8212;the enhancement to junction 1A of the M9 and the proposed introduction of intelligent transport systems in Fife.</p><p>All three contracts have been included in the estimate of the scheme. Although that may seem evident to some, it is interesting how the figures for the scheme have been presented in various ways, some of which avoid acknowledging that fact. The estimated cost of the bridge itself is &#163;543 million, which represents 26 per cent of the total project cost. We will all have seen reports that the bridge&#8212;in inverted commas&#8212;may cost as much as &#163;2.3 billion, but that figure is an estimate of the three separate contracts combined and includes such things as risk allowance, optimism bias and VAT.</p><p>It was an instructive experience to sit on the committee and to discover how costs are put together when building a bridge, what considerations have to be taken into account and the effect that that can have, depending on the part of the world that one happens to be building in. For example, in some other countries, taxation <place-holder colnum=\"26557\"/> is not applied to any of the costs, which makes it difficult to compare on a like-for-like basis. Even the likely prevailing weather during the period of construction has to be taken into account and can vary the cost. However, the committee is satisfied that the Government has taken a sensible and industry-approved approach to costing the scheme.</p><p>Members of the Finance Committee may wish to explore some of the issues that were raised during scrutiny of the financial memorandum, but let me say that we share some of their concerns about funding and the phasing of capital costs. The Forth Crossing Bill Committee took a degree of comfort from and welcomed the minister's assurances in evidence that the project will be a level 3 item in the budget, as befits capital spending, but we retained some concerns about the knock-on effects to other capital budgets. I look forward to hearing the plans, as set out by the minister in his letter, for other capital budgets when the spending review is completed.</p><p>The potential for project cost overruns was also on the mind of committee members&#8212;how could it be otherwise for any politician sitting in the chamber of this Parliament, the most obvious example in recent public memory of a project that exceeded and exceeded again budget and timescale projections? For that reason alone, we were resolved not to forget the potential for cost overruns, about which we were regularly reminded by several witnesses and correspondents.</p><p>None of us wishes the project to prove a bridge too far, and no one wants to see it run over budget. The committee was therefore heartened by assurances that a report will be made every six months to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee. That should provide the means to see where costs are emerging and how much they are and for members to raise issues timeously with the minister.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20810899", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Crossing Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My mother goes.

However, the project has afforded an opportunity to focus public attention on the crossing and to encourage all of us to think now about transport modal shift to manage any future growth in housing and business development and the consequential increase in the number of people seeking to cross the Forth&#8212;a point to which George Foulkes alluded earlier. The minister acknowledges and spoke to the fact that, as the scheme has evolved, the recognition of the need for a public transport strategy has emerged.</p><p>I turn to the code of construction practice for the proposed works. The committee accepts the economic imperatives for a new crossing. That said, we also accept that, should there be a new bridge, it is inevitable that a great deal of construction activity will be associated with it, and I do not wish to downplay that. The committee read all the objections that were lodged by individuals and bodies who feel that their private interests will be affected. The code of construction practice and the noise and vibration policy can provide some comfort to people, and I welcome the minister's acceptance of our recommendation to restrict the expected daily start times for construction specifically associated with the non-bridge works. The committee would like the code to be as robust as possible, and hopes that people will see it as offering protection to them and their families.

When he gave evidence to the Health and Sport Committee on child and adolescent mental health services, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there has been an enormous blossoming in the evidence ... on ways of identifying early in life the children who are going to follow a problematic and painful trajectory ... there has been a big increase in the evidence ... on what works to stop the bad things happening. At a policy level, there has been substantial movement towards an emphasis on the very early years.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Health and Sport Committee</em>, 25 March 2009; c 1728.]</p><p>That inquiry made it patently clear how fundamental the early years are to an individual's development and their mental health later in life. A vast range of variables, including mental health, sexual health, education, involvement in crime and <place-holder colnum=\"26523\"/> employability can be shaped in the earliest years of a child's life.</p><p>David Olds pioneered much of the work that underpins the family nurse partnership in the United States. It is important to bear in mind the reservations of Philip Wilson and others, who believe that we cannot look to the way in which the family nurse partnership has operated in the United States, where health services are such that it has operated almost in a vacuum, away from any other service provision. That is not the case in the United Kingdom, where we have had an active health-visitor service that has performed much of that function.</p><p>If one looks at the experience of the pilot in England, it is clear that a pilot can almost be an obstacle to the progress of a wider service. By definition, a pilot involves putting together a unit that must try to perform functions to certain targets. The pilot in England failed to meet the recruitment target of enrolling 60 per cent of pregnant women by 16 weeks' gestation. In addition, there was quite a fall-off&#8212;only 53 per cent of expected visits were carried out.</p><p>Nonetheless, I welcome the Lothian pilot. It ties in strongly with the direction in which Conservative thinking has moved. I have raised&#8212;for no political advantage, as I hope members will accept&#8212;health visiting, particularly in Bridgeton and Possil, repeatedly in Parliament. I fear that the changes that we have made in the structure of health visiting have devalued the perception of the profession among the dedicated people who have worked in it, to the extent that many of them are now leaving it and there is a significant shortfall in the number of experienced people who wish to go into it. That is reflected in communities in which there are considerable inequalities and disadvantages, where the very issues that we seek to address through the family nurse partnership programme exist. Our inability to bring people in to provide and maintain such concentrated involvement is an issue.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives believe that although the pilot in Lothian is of value, we need to look beyond it to a universal health-visiting service. I know that the minister will say that, to a degree, such a service already exists, but it is not involved in the development and welfare of children over a two, three or even five-year period to the extent that it can identify the issues that the Lothian programme is to identify. If we are to put together a preventive health service that avoids many of the problems that we pay for subsequently, not just in the waste of human talent but, at great expense, in our health service, we need to find a way of providing that universal service across a wider spectrum.</p><p>As a party, we would have put more money into health visiting, to ensure not just that a universal <place-holder colnum=\"26524\"/> service was retained, but that in areas of inequality we could address matters by having more health visitors who perform the role that the family nurse partnership fulfils.</p><p>I look forward to progression of the pilot. I hope that if evidence starts to emerge from developments in England and elsewhere, we can consider providing something near to a national framework for health visiting in Scotland, because I am not sure that it is the right way forward for health boards to pursue different strategies. I hope that we will be able to focus our attention on a community that could benefit enormously from that attention in the long term. It is about developing a talent that is currently being wasted by giving families support that may prevent subsequent breakdown and by giving young people a start that prevents their descent into crime, and other problems that follow from that.

It is a particular turgid example of such reports, with poor use of grammar and high-blown, nonsensical rhetoric, which is the antithesis of the objective stated in its very first page to provide \"Clear communication and explanation\". Indeed, I was struck by the thought that we could easily dispense with anaesthetists by giving patients this report to read instead.

We agree with those aims. We agree with and applaud the progress towards achieving the objectives that is being made, often on the basis of natural common sense, by a dedicated NHS staff.

I feared for her wellbeing at one point. However, the committee thanks Mrs Eadie for the comprehensive and detailed way in which she shared with us, especially at stage 2, the extensive briefing that she had managed to amass on the numerous amendments that she wanted the committee to have an opportunity to consider. Although, ultimately, we did not share the conclusions at which she arrived, many members were grateful to her for the work that she did to highlight some of the issues.</p><p>I thank the minister for the way in which he co-operated with the Subordinate Legislation Committee throughout the process. Today he has resisted the temptation to make his remarks in any way exciting. I do not know whether that is his normal modus operandi but, given that this was a moment for him to shine, I know that he will have <place-holder colnum=\"25744\"/> enjoyed taking the bill through the Parliament so safely and negotiating the withdrawal of the amendments that were to be considered.</p><p>For me, the only real issue of concern was the Balmoral question, which was addressed at stage 2 and to which the minister alluded in evidence to us. I was grateful to him for the way in which he was able to accommodate concerns that might have been expressed about the position of the sovereign in the consideration of legislation by the Parliament. I know that that will come as an enormous relief to all those who sit behind him on the nationalist benches.</p><p>The highlight of the stage 1 debate was the intervention by Dr McKee, who acknowledged that the other parties represented in the chamber that have yet to form a Government in Scotland will look forward to that prospect. At that point, I saw Patrick Harvie sit forward with due attention; I, too, perked up. I do not know whether Dr McKee was anticipating a Conservative-Green coalition from 2011. That may be what it takes&#8212;stranger things could happen. Dr McKee's key point was that, ultimately, there is a requirement for the Parliament to ensure that, although instruments are debated in committee, they are able to progress through the Parliament. I say that as the spokesman in this debate for the one party with substantial representation in the Parliament that has not yet formed part of a devolved Administration in Scotland. The minister made the point that the consequences are not merely political arguments between politicians, but instruments that have a practical effect on the lives of individuals in the country. If we were to delay those instruments&#8212;at one point, the minister said that there was the potential to do so for 119 days&#8212;the consequences for individuals would be considerable.</p><p>Like other members, I am happy to conclude by thanking the clerks and all those who gave evidence to the committee, who have allowed consideration of a technical, necessary, rather dull but worthwhile bill to come to its conclusion.

I want to build on the point that I developed earlier about the possibility of Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Scottish Human Rights Commission merging. Rereading the <em>Official Report</em> of the debate that we had when the ad hoc committee's report was published, I was struck by what Des McNulty said about economies of scale. He argued that such a merger might prove to be sensible or even necessary in the light of the financial pressures that we would inevitably face in the immediate future. We cannot remain indifferent to those pressures.<place-holder colnum=\"24868\"/></p><p>In the view of Scottish Conservatives and of the committee, there are examples of good working practice by the existing commissions, certainly in the case of the Commissioner for Children and Young People but, in themselves, those are not prima facie justifications for the existence of separate commissions. Therefore, those who are pleased that no merged rights commission proposal has been made at this time should understand that, for some of us at least, that is not a matter of principle but one of practical politics, given that the Scottish Human Rights Commission is at an early stage of its life. It is my view that a combined rights commission is a possible option in the near to medium term and that, arguably, it could be desirable.</p><p>Beyond that, I feel that I ought to demand an explanation of the minister when he sums up. Ross Finnie was obviously slightly discomfited by the acronyms to which I drew members' attention. The committee is entitled to know why the Government chose to spurn, to toss aside and to deride the committee's recommendation to create a public life and appointments commission Scotland, or PLACS, in favour of the CESPLS option.

Paying tribute to Mrs Godman, I believe that she has very helpfully and succinctly laid out the bill's terms and the work of the committee that she convened.</p><p>I confirm at the outset that the Scottish Conservatives welcome the bill and support its general principles. It reflects in part the recommendations of the RSSB committee, of which I was pleased to be a member and whose report we debated last June. Other perhaps more controversial matters that we discussed and made recommendations on at the time are being addressed elsewhere, particularly in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill, stage 3 of which will be concluded tomorrow.<place-holder colnum=\"24860\"/></p><p>The measures before us reflect in all but name the RSSB committee's conclusions. With regard to the variation on the name of the new body&#8212;either the commission for ethical standards in public life in Scotland, or CESPLS, or the public life and appointments commission Scotland, or PLACS&#8212;I make no complaint. You pays your money, you takes your choice. Essentially, the end result is the same and represents a sensible reform that benefits the public by reducing administration and complexity while improving accountability and governance. The SPCB has a responsibility and a duty to ensure that economies of scale, however modest, are realised and that the examination of the new annual report meets Parliament's requirements.</p><p>We also support the endeavour to harmonise the terms and conditions of members of the Standards Commission for Scotland with the office-holders and members of the other SPCB-supported bodies. The proposals might appear quite dry, minor, even technical but, like other members of the RSSB committee, I continue to believe that such changes will continue to be important to those who currently hold office and might well be influential in attracting talented successors.</p><p>We support the changes that are designed to improve the operation of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman and the intention to transfer to it the functions of the Scottish Prison Complaints Commission. We welcome the fact that that will place the SPCC on a statutory footing for the first time. In particular, we endorse the changes to the SPSO that will offer access to a wider range of outcomes and options for reporting, including the discretion to determine to discontinue an investigation and to decide whether in those circumstances to send a report to ministers or to lay any report before the Parliament.</p><p>Having read the <em>Official Report</em> of last June's debate on the recommendations of the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee, I would like to return to one theme that recurred in many of the contributions to that debate: the future of Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People and of the Scottish Human Rights Commission. During the working life of the committee, sustained representations were made that those functions should not be merged. They were almost always from those who wished to see the commissions remain separate as a matter of principle, not as a matter of practicality. In the event, a merger was not recommended by the committee and is not part of the bill, but it would be wrong to conclude that such an outcome was inevitable, far less that it was enthusiastically arrived at. In truth, there was considerable discussion as to whether such an amalgamation might not be appropriate as well as, undoubtedly, <place-holder colnum=\"24861\"/> a collective lack of enthusiasm at the prospect of further future commissioners&#8212;for example a victims commissioner or an old people's commissioner&#8212;for causes that are often championed as being ideal candidates. The establishment of a new rights commission had some appeal. However, essentially for practical reasons such as the relative age of the newly established Scottish Human Rights Commission, no recommendation was made at that time. It was not an issue of principle. It is important to make that point explicitly, as that may well be unfinished business.</p><p>For the moment, I join Trish Godman in thanking the clerks and committee colleagues and I thank her for steering us through our deliberations. I agree that the bill gives effect to sensible proposals that are supported on all sides and that can now be progressed. We will be content to support the bill today.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20720517", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Commissions and Commissioners etc Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I hope that you will permit me to begin by saying that Trish Godman's opening speech and the contribution from Labour's front bench are without exception the finest that I have yet witnessed in my time in this Parliament&#8212;and I say that with all the sincerity that I know her very good friend Anne Moffat would be able to muster.

He and I disagree on many things, but I was happy to participate in a public meeting in his constituency in support of St Margaret of Scotland Hospice, and to say on that occasion that the community that he represents has been well served by his efforts on behalf of the hospice.</p><p>I have been quite happy to fall in behind his considerable leadership, in partnership with the hospice, in fighting to retain this valuable facility. I do so as well in tribute to the formidable Sister Rita and the considerable team of people who have been working tirelessly in the community in support of the hospice. Both Des McNulty and Gil Paterson referred to the petition, which has more than 100,000 signatures.</p><p>Like many, I have personal experience of St Margaret's, as an aunt of my wife spent the last few weeks of her life there. Many people have a connection with the hospice because a loved one approaching the end of their life received the best of care there. That is not to say that St Margaret's is the only hospice in the west of Scotland, because there are others and I am sure that many of us have visited them. In my capacity as health spokesman, I try to get round all of them, and I find a consistent theme: they are supported financially by health boards, but the vast majority of the funding that they receive comes from the community itself. Communities therefore feel a tremendous sense of ownership of and commitment to the facilities, and are concerned to see that they survive. Undoubtedly, in the case of St Margaret's, strong wills are being employed by all those seeking to find a solution. I certainly realise that it would not be too strong a statement to say that one could quite easily be strongarmed&#8212;if that is not a contradiction in terms&#8212;by Sister Rita in her support of the hospice and all the people surrounding her.</p><p>I have also been struck by the way in which the health board has approached the issue. As a West of Scotland MSP, it would be easy for me to say on all occasions that the health board is misplaced, that it is acting irrationally and that it consists of a woeful bunch of people who take no cognisance of public opinion. I am afraid that it is true that, as a regional list member, I can cite a number of examples in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area where the community feels that the consultative process that should have been embarked on has not been as comprehensive or as genuine as it should have been. It is against that background that I find it extraordinary that, <place-holder colnum=\"24601\"/> after all this time since the first debate that Des McNulty arranged for us to have in the chamber on the issue, we seem to be no clearer, no wiser and no nearer a solution that will secure the future of St Margaret's. The people working there are not doing so to spend the best part of their careers campaigning for the hospice to stay open; they are spending the best part of their careers&#8212;they hope&#8212;caring for the patients in the hospice. The interminable debate that we are having about its future requires to be brought to a conclusion.</p><p>It is pretty clear to me that our standing or sitting here and wishing that the various parties concerned will, between them and on their own account, arrive at an agreement is simply wishful thinking&#8212;it is not going to happen. There has been an extension, because there was a threat that the funding would cease from April this year and that we would have nowhere else to go. There is now a window of opportunity, but it is only an opportunity if proper and extensive use is made of it.</p><p>I accept that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing's favoured way of resolving areas of major service change&#8212;the appointment of an independent scrutiny panel&#8212;would not be appropriate in the case of a hospice in the west of Scotland. However, I am afraid that we are past the point at which it is possible for the cabinet secretary not to intervene to broker a solution of some kind. I accept that it is not possible for her to micromanage each health board, but it is time now for somebody to be charged with brokering an agreement between both parties involved: the health board and St Margaret of Scotland Hospice. It must be somebody who has the cabinet secretary's authority and the good will and authority of West of Scotland members of the Scottish Parliament and the wider Scottish Parliament. They must be charged with ensuring that we arrive soon at an equitable solution that secures the future of the hospice and the valuable care that it provides.

The most alarming analogy came from Nigel Don, who I think implied that the train does not need to get into the station before people get on or off it. That is a course of action I really cannot advocate.</p><p>In the months since we last debated the matter in anticipation of the report that we are asked to endorse today, there has been some public discussion about the actual measure of the challenge that we face. Once again, all is predicated on doom-laden forecasts from forecasters who have been wrong about the scale of almost every other public health challenge to date. However, while slapping a health warning on the flashing frightener statistics themselves, let us at least accept that there are more overweight people than there were and that there appear to be more still with every year that passes.</p><p>The report is unable to overcome what was feared for it, for it is stuffed full of the worthy, that which is common sense and that which is frankly barking mad and, indeed, insulting. What are we to make of the drivel on portion control in commercial restaurants? Who on earth dreamed up such a preposterous nanny-state idea? Will portions be determined by sex, age or height? <place-holder colnum=\"23931\"/></p><p>How would such nonsense be policed? Would buffet and carvery restaurants be banned? Would the self-service bar in the parliamentary cafeteria be boarded up? To be consistent, will the minister ban two-pies-for-the-price-of-one promotions? Give us a break.</p><p>What is an appropriate portion anyway? As a learner skier, falling off the lift and having to climb up the mountain, I probably feel that I need more to eat when I get down than, say, someone who spends a sedentary day reading the SNP manifesto&#8212;for which smelling salts need be the only sustenance.</p><p>I applaud both amendments. One points to the hypocrisy of the SNP record on physical education. For heaven's sake, can young people not enjoy sport and exercise for its own sake? Must it always be part of a disciplined regime to control and manage weight gain?</p><p>It is Ross Finnie's amendment that says what needs to be said, although I suspect that I mean to be blunter still. For me, there is just far too much sympathy and understanding and far too much fancy talk. The word \"obesity\" is now presented as a diagnosed condition, as if unavoidable and, as I said in an earlier debate, something caught on the train or bus. There are those who have genuine health issues, but there are far too many others who are just eating too much, exercising too little and getting fat.</p><p>That would be fine if all the consequences were borne by those who indulged in that lifestyle option, but they are not. All the addictions&#8212;smoking, alcohol, drugs and weight gain&#8212;are ultimately treated by the national health service, free at the point of delivery. Our national insurance scheme is being asked and tasked with picking up the tab of an unquantifiable future commitment from which each of us is ultimately absolved. I therefore agree with Ross Finnie, possibly more than he does himself. Our own responsibility is not to be glossed over under a welter of fancy schemes and initiatives as an also-ran; it is the key.</p><p>Making people wear seat belts must have saved the NHS enormous sums of money in the years since the law's introduction, as well as countless lives given the massive increase in car ownership. We should look to the more recent change on the wearing of rear seat belts, supported as it was by campaigns to illustrate the lethal consequences to others in a vehicle of an unbelted rear-seat passenger. In other words, the social and moral context of the practice was changed.</p><p>If we do not get a grip individually, the ability of the NHS to sustain its vital service on so many desperate and unavoidable illnesses will inevitably be compromised by the diversion of funds&#8212;the <place-holder colnum=\"23932\"/> minister referred to this&#8212;to treat the consequences of a wanton mismanagement of our own lives. For example, the report finds that blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and heart attacks will increase. More people survive heart attacks today, but they are left with degenerative disease, which needs treatment that, as the heart gradually deteriorates and fails, becomes more intensive and expensive.</p><p>Perhaps our creative and advertising support needs to show how the future NHS could be stripped of its ability to treat mainstream conditions if, as a population, we do not shape up to our moral responsibility. We need to say&#8212;and say it clearly&#8212;that we appreciate that, for some, inequalities have led to personal situations whose circumstances it is the duty of politicians to address and find solutions for. However, we must also be clear that for others&#8212;the majority&#8212;it is a case of politicians saying directly to them, \"There's no excuse.\" I reflected on this message, which I think Richard Simpson thought a bit harsh when I spoke to it in more measured terms in the previous debate&#8212;I fear that he will be shuddering this afternoon, which is a shame, as the attention that he has drawn to trans fats is important. However, as we sit here ruminating and pontificating, what are we doing ourselves? The uncomfortable truth is that there are MSPs who are near or at their target weight and there are those who are over it, those who are fat and those who are obese. We should admit as much when we lecture and legislate. For example, I have never yet met some MSPs on a staircase. It dawned on me after the previous debate on this issue that I had better practise some of what I preach. I have to say that I am 2 stone lighter as a result, and I intend to lose another stone and a half.</p><p>I told myself that it is my responsibility to sort out my weight and not the Government's responsibility to do that. I do not need an information programme or the lack of one as an excuse to hide behind. I do not need Shona Robison or Nicola Sturgeon at my bedside or kitchen table, walking beside me in a supermarket or ordering my meal in a restaurant; nor do I need Ronnie McColl of COSLA for that matter, bursting as he does out of his brochure photograph. The public do not want some gruesome twosome parroting in their ears. We need to complement all the proactive work that the public sector does with a demand that, if health care is to be provided sustainably free of charge, we have a responsibility to take care of ourselves.</p><p>Before the refrain about the wicked, uncaring Tory is echoed, I emphasise again that there are those who genuinely need help; that is why we believe in an expanded and universal health visitor <place-holder colnum=\"23933\"/> service, to ensure that many young and potentially inexperienced new families get the practical parenting advice that they need on how to do the very best for their children.</p><p>All our lives are unique and individually precious; ultimately, they require us to take responsibility for ourselves and for those who depend on us, whatever our income or place in the world.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20647009", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Preventing Obesity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not know what to make of this afternoon's debate.

As I travel round the United Kingdom as a tourist, I often visit those local museums, because they are a worthwhile source of tourism. They invariably have a tremendous appeal to children in particular, who get quite caught up in the romance of the subject. They are a vital local asset in relation to bringing in tourism.</p><p>I thought that the romance of the train could now be celebrated only by doing something slightly more expensive. I have to say that I forked out for a trip on the Orient Express. One might say that the journey was typical of railways, in the sense that there was a strike at the French end, which meant that we were hopelessly delayed. It also meant that, in order to catch up, the train had to <place-holder colnum=\"23625\"/> travel at such a speed that it was impossible both to eat the meal and&#8212;as I discovered subsequently&#8212;to stay in the bunk during the evening. My wife was also somewhat distressed to discover when she was getting dressed the next morning that we had pulled into a busy commuter station somewhere in the Alps, where everyone was viewing whatever it was that she was engaged in at that moment.</p><p>I now realise that our money need not have been spent in that way.

In preparing, briefly, for tonight's debate, I asked how all that came about and what was its inspiration. Invariably, whenever I have visited such museums, I have found that what has been achieved has been down to local enthusiasts and one enthusiast in particular. It is clear that John Burnie was an inspiration&#8212;a lifetime devotee who was committed to the whole atmosphere and spirit of rail&#8212;and that it was he who made such a valuable contribution and produced such a legacy. Although I did not know him, I can see that he has been taken from that prematurely. I hope that the legacy that he created will survive.</p><p>I am enthused by what I have read. Tonight's debate has persuaded one weegie, who now lives on the west coast, to make the journey through to visit the museum. However, I am not terribly sure that the day out with Thomas is the thing that attracts me. A nice swanky evening dinner cruise along the line would appeal most; if the museum could conceive of such a thing, I would be more than happy to support it in that way.

I say to Jamie Hepburn that we would not have promoted the debate had we no concern for the people who we think are being left behind in health care.</p><p>The issues are related, because an unintended irony is unfolding under the SNP Government, in that by standing by and allowing the decline of Scotland's health visiting service&#8212;a service that exists to prevent future ill health and which the Health and Sport Committee identified as being crucial in early years development in its report on child and adolescent mental health services, which we debated a fortnight ago&#8212;the need for NHS intervention will increase and there will be even more prescriptions.</p><p>We should invest in health visiting, not because Scottish Conservatives are convinced of the need to do so, not because the BMA is convinced of the need to do so, not because of the compelling evidence of all witnesses to the Health and Sport Committee, and not even because Jamie Stone's doctor is profoundly supportive of health visiting. We should do so because it is manifestly clear from the evidence, and from debates that have taken place throughout the Parliament's lifetime, that we should invest our limited additional resources in people who can help to prevent ill health, rather than in taxpayer-funded additional health subsidies to the wealthiest people, including the First Minister, the cabinet secretary, me and others who are in the 6 per cent of people who paid the full prescription charge in 2008-09. This is a tax cut by the First Minister for the First Minister, which is unjustifiable and, in the current financial climate, irresponsible.<place-holder colnum=\"22990\"/></p><p>The inevitable response of the cabinet secretary and her praetorian guard involves the customary hyperbole about the need to defend the NHS from the perils that it might face under the Scottish Conservatives. However, the current health debate is not the shallow debate of old about whether there should be a national health service. All major political parties in the 21<sup>st</sup> century are committed to the NHS. The debate in the Scottish Parliament has been about how the NHS can operate flexibly to secure the wellbeing of the people whom it serves.</p><p>Throughout the life of the Parliament, we have been clear and consistent on prescription charges. We supported the reduction of the standard charge to &#163;5 and the halving of the cost of the prepayment certificate. We acknowledged that a charge of &#163;6.85 per item&#8212;and rising&#8212;meant that the cost of treatment, which might typically involve two or three items, was pushing twenty quid, which was on the wrong side of reasonable, even for people who were able to pay. We particularly supported the reduction in the cost of the prepayment certificate, because we accepted that the preferred option of many people, which was to expand the schedule of exempted conditions, would be difficult and potentially invidious.</p><p>However, we served notice even at that stage that, although we supported the first reduction, we were unconvinced that further reductions should be the priority spend within a limited budget. We said that we would wait and see. We did so, and I say to Jeremy Purvis&#8212;who is not in the chamber&#8212;that we opposed last year's reduction and will oppose this year's. I thank Ian McKee for his moderate condemnation of that opposition this year: this year, apparently, Mary Scanlon is merely shameful, whereas, last year, she was \"pernicious and evil\". At that rate of conversion, he will be back in his old Conservative fold before the end of the parliamentary session.</p><p>We oppose the reductions not because they are not a lovely idea, but because people who need to be supported should be, which is why 88 per cent of prescriptions in 2008-09 were issued without charge and a further 6 per cent with the prepayment certificate. We oppose the abolition because we cannot afford it at this time and because there are other immediate priorities.</p><p>The cabinet secretary said in her speech that only those who earned &#163;16,000 and above had to pay. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate for her to come to Parliament earlier in the session and talk about increasing that threshold. We could have supported that proposal.</p><p>There are certainly other financial challenges facing health spending. Last week, in response to a parliamentary question, the cabinet secretary confirmed that the cost to Scotland's NHS in the <place-holder colnum=\"22991\"/> year commencing April 2011 of the Westminster Government's increase in employer national insurance contributions will be &#163;36.3 million. That is on top of the &#163;33 million that this year's reduction and next year's proposed abolition of prescription charges will cost.</p><p>Although I disagree with Jackie Baillie's support for further reductions, I welcome the searching questions that she asked about the policy's future sustainability, particularly given the unfolding experience and increase in demand that took place in Wales. Where is the money to be found?</p><p>The cabinet secretary reminds us of the old Hollywood film star Jeanette MacDonald; she of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald grand melodrama fame, and not only because of their shared interest in shoes. Even Jeanette MacDonald could not compete with the cabinet secretary on that point. It is best put in the words of a song:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I never will forget how that brave Jeanette,<br/> Just stood there in the ruins and sang ... and sang\".</p><p>The cabinet secretary's policy seems to be to acknowledge the huge demographic changes that are coming, but to shut the door to any future assistance from the independent sector. As the financial pillars of her health Babylon come tumbling down around her, her response is to stand there in the ruins and sing the same old song. She sings it well and she sings it true, but it is fast becoming yesterday's hit.</p><p>I make no apology for once again returning to the state of our health visiting profession in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. I have raised previously the position in Springburn and Possil in Glasgow. The minister wrote to me. It was clear from her initial responses that she believed that all was well, but she was slightly more equivocal in her speech in the debate a fortnight ago. On the contrary, to those on the ground, all is not well.</p><p>A few months on from the Glasgow North East by-election, what is the position in Possil? The health centre there serves one of the communities that have been identified as having the greatest concentration of health inequalities. It is the type of health centre that the ending of a universal health visiting service and the creation of concentrated teams was supposed to assist. Finally, a health visitor was recruited, but she has already handed in her notice. Meanwhile, the minimum two full days that have been allocated to the practice have remained unfilled for more than three and a half years.</p><p>In Bridgeton in Glasgow&#8212;a postcode with one of the lowest household incomes in the United Kingdom&#8212;there is now no health visitor. A GP there has 150 preschool children out of a list of <place-holder colnum=\"22992\"/> 2,780 patients. The area will host the Commonwealth games. It seems extraordinary to people there that the community can host the games but cannot access health visiting. Bridgeton health centre, which serves a population of 25,000 patients and has 20 GPs, has two part-time health visitors. Such situations are now commonplace, and the problem is growing and being exacerbated, as Rhoda Grant mentioned in her speech.</p><p>We cannot go on like this. The cabinet secretary has belatedly agreed to meet GPs and others in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde next month. It is not a moment too soon. Last autumn's complacency is now being replaced by a recognition that there may be a problem; we are certainly clear that there is.</p><p>The health secretary and the Parliament need to start singing a different song&#8212;or, at least, to rewrite the lyrics. We need leadership. The Parliament has addressed the overall burden of the prescription charge and the prepayment certificate; now is the time to respond to other challenges. The difficult financial future requires us all to be much less dogmatic and to be prepared to work with everyone who can make a difference to Scotland's health. This is the wrong time for further reductions in the prescription charge and the right time to transform Scotland's health visiting service to achieve a real improvement to achieve a real improvement in Scotland's overall national health.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20514234", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prescription Charges"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scottish Conservatives had no qualms about bringing back to the chamber the issues of prescription charges and health visiting.

So stands the Westminster Labour Government today. Even those who have stood resolutely behind the Government are finding its cack-handed policy too much to bear. How must stand Scottish Labour today? I say that notwithstanding Johann Lamont's spirited defence in the debate. She is a politician who has a personal integrity on the issue&#8212;which this policy risks compromising.</p><p>At first pass, I harboured suspicions that today's debate, originating as it does from the hand of the multitalented and loquacious Minister for Housing and Communities&#8212;a man with an eye ever on the main chance&#8212;may have been a well-timed, but typical, nakedly brazen attempt to further undermine the union, a sometime cause of the SNP. How could I have been so uncharitable? An investigation of the facts demonstrates clearly and alarmingly the confusion and muddle at the heart of the Westminster Labour Government. The minister has rightly alerted the Parliament to the immediate and pressing danger of the policy.</p><p>Surely he is the hero of the hour. The T-shirt says it all&#8212;in the minister's words, \"non-partisan man\". He is right: in statements throughout last year and, particularly, in the debate in the Commons in December, the policy of the Westminster Government as articulated by ministers was both confused and contradictory. That is not wholly surprising, given that the policy is led by the hapless Secretary of State for Health, Andy Burnham. He is a man with an eye on the <place-holder colnum=\"22812\"/> future, so confusion about the proposal is probably his best course of action for the present. On the one hand, he is decorated as one of the last die-hards to stand four-square in the bunker with the author of this policy, the UK's second longest-serving unelected Prime Minister in history. On the other hand, he is being talked up as the winner of the dubious prize of being the next leader of his party. Being confused must be Mr Burnham's deliberate policy. However, in respect of today's debate that must be inexcusable, given that the wellbeing of so many people throughout the UK is at stake.</p><p>The issues arising from the green paper \"Shaping the future of care together\" are immense, and the financial implications are potentially profound for nearly a quarter of a million Scots who are currently in receipt of vital support. The Government and the Secretary of State for Health propose, to a degree that they are unable to make clear, to chip away piecemeal or wholesale at attendance allowance and disability living allowance to fund a new system of care in England&#8212;not so much \"Shaping the future of care together\" as replacing a system in which recipients of the allowances are in control of how the benefit is spent by one that might more aptly be titled \"The state will control the future of your care\". As the minister identified, the proposed changes have the potential to have a profound effect not just on future policy in Scotland, but on the funding arrangements of benefits on which many Scots depend.</p><p>Before I turn to the financial consequences, let me be clear about our view of Labour's policy. An extraordinary coalition of organisations and individuals share the Conservative view that it is wrong. They include the Disability Alliance UK, which supports DLA and AA</p><p class=\"indent\">\"as national, non-means-tested benefits paid to disabled people to meet their higher living costs\";</p><p>the Royal National Institute of Blind People, which says that it is \"strongly opposed\" to the proposal; and the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, which is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"adamant that no one is getting their mitts on vital extra-cost benefits\".</p><p>Leonard Cheshire Disability, Age Concern, the Parkinson's Disease Society and others are equally concerned, opposed and dismayed.</p><p>Our position on the principle that underpins the policy is clear and unequivocal. To paraphrase Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, we make clear today on behalf of Scottish Conservatives our belief that the continuation, in their current form, of disability benefits that were introduced by John Major's Government, such as attendance allowance and disability living <place-holder colnum=\"22813\"/> allowance, will give current recipients of such benefits and those who will be recipients in the future an opportunity, on a non-means-tested basis, to gain access to cash benefits that will enable them to buy a wide range of services such as informal care, family care, support for travel and support for house improvements, based on personal choice and control. People use attendance allowance and disability living allowance to help them, under their own control, to create a quality of life for themselves that helps them to remain independent. It is clear that if we focus narrowly on care needs, we will miss out much that contributes to wellbeing. There is no health without wellbeing, and there is no independence without sustaining people's quality of life.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20497982", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by paraphrasing Johann Lamont: she may come to the debate more in sorrow than anger; the rest of us come both in sorrow and anger.

The present Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Murphy, was previously a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions. What opinion did he offer to the Secretary of State for Health?

We know that the demographics and circumstances of Scotland are such that the total claims for attendance allowance and disability living allowance taken together for over-65s, and claims for each of those benefits for over-65s taken separately, are proportionately higher in Scotland than in England. Abolition of any or all the benefits and transferring the proceeds to an English department lead to a Barnett consequential calculation according to which <place-holder colnum=\"22814\"/> Scotland's recipients will lose out, given our higher proportional uptake.

I congratulate Jamie Stone on his opening speech on behalf of the committee, and endorse his appreciation of the Government's constructive attitude throughout.</p><p>In my earlier remarks, I dealt with the Crown's position. As anticipated, others have referred to section 28 of the bill, and some members favour an increase from 21 days to 40 days, rather than 28 days. Scottish Conservatives have a unique perspective on that point. Of Scotland's four major political parties, only we have yet to take charge of the devolved Government of Scotland. In passing, I accept that that is a rather generous tribute to the influence of the Liberal Democrats in the previous parliamentary sessions, but so be it. I wish to <place-holder colnum=\"22669\"/> reassure members that it can be only a matter of time before the happy day when Scottish Conservatives lead Scotland's Government again. Some may say that it will take a long time, but I am confident that I shall be here to see it.</p><p>Nonetheless, the point is that since the suggestion first emerged in the legacy report of the previous session's Subordinate Legislation Committee&#8212;how my friend Murray Tosh used to salivate over procedural complexities&#8212;the position of the parties that have been in government has flip-flopped and about-turned sharply, depending on whether they were in or out of office. That is not to denigrate the sincerely-held convictions of some members. Although I sympathise with the sentiment that recommendations should at all times favour the power of Parliament, I am struck that that argument could equally be deployed in support of a suggestion to increase the time not from 21 to 28 or 40 days, but to 50, 60 or even 90 days. It seems to me that we should establish what a fair test is.</p><p>I accept that Government has to be challenged, but equally, Government has to be able to progress legislation. Although ministers might construct an overly lurid case example of the delays that might arise if the 40-day suggestion is agreed to, they have a legitimate point. It is the same point that the parties of the previous Administration made when they were in office. For that reason, Scottish Conservatives will support the Government's proposal to settle on 28 days.</p><p>Throughout the bill, there are other occasions on which the Government might be thought to be taking upon itself not so much proposals that modernise or tidy up procedure, but that potentially extend the Government's powers. That is not an unexpected crime, but surely it should generally be resisted. No doubt those proposals will be further interrogated at stage 2.</p><p>Two issues of clarification arise on the position of the Crown and the compatibility of change with respect to legislation arising in Westminster or Brussels. An unlikely, but in the event, quietly important discussion also elevated the issue of the Office of the Queen's Printer for Scotland beyond a level that an initial reading of the bill might have suggested would be likely.</p><p>Dry the bill might be, but after enactment its provisions will, if appropriately amended, modestly improve the Parliament's legislative arrangements. I, too, pay tribute to my colleagues on the committee and to the clerks, who have worked tirelessly.

It is right for me to say at the outset that, even when the subject matter may be characterised as being as dry as dust, important principles are often at stake. As unlikely as it seems, well-intentioned legislation that is sometimes characterised as being sensible housekeeping can conceal ambitions beyond those that have been generally supposed.</p><p>Certainly, the committee had an exceptional series of evidence-taking sessions. Rarely have both the answers to the questions and the questions themselves not always been understood both by those to whom the questions were addressed and by those doing the asking.</p><p>For those of us who have enjoyed Hilary Mantel's Booker prize-winning novel, \"Wolf Hall\"&#8212;a magnificent account of the relationship between Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell&#8212;it was a surprise to find so many references back to King Henry as we contemplated the bill. Colleagues from across the chamber will take their own positions on this, but I mention the former monarch of England only because section 20 seeks to redefine the status in law of the present monarch of the United Kingdom in a way that will be different for laws made in this Parliament compared with laws made at Westminster. Although I do not support that provision, I understand the curiously primitive need of some to strain every sinew to diminish the residual role and position of the Crown. However, ministers are also invariably keen to quote the experts, who in this case were surprisingly unequivocal. The Scottish Law Commission, the judges of the Court of Session and the Faculty of Advocates all believe that the proposals might well lead to considerable confusion in law. That was acknowledged even by those who welcome the proposal. I welcome Paul Martin's comments in that regard.</p><p>It seems to me that now is not the moment to beat the breast in some great quest for egalitarianism or for ministers to pander to their desire to be able to claim some great advance for democracy; pragmatism must have its place. There seems to me to be no case for creating unnecessary confusion, which will be the practical implication of the proposed change in the status of the monarchy. Therefore, we urge the minister to resist those baser instincts and to leave well alone.</p><p>In his evidence, the minister fell back on the defence that the sovereign had not yet found the time to phone him up from Balmoral to complain. In practice, I suspect that the sovereign has <place-holder colnum=\"22661\"/> probably not found the time to phone him up about anything from anywhere, but what a way to contemplate celebrating Her Majesty's forthcoming diamond jubilee. Are we to inform her of the Scottish National Party's intention&#8212;to paraphrase Rodgers and Hammerstein&#8212;to \"Cut you off at the knees, Your Majesty\"? We will lodge amendments at stage 2, on which we hope to enjoy the support of practical-minded unionists and others from across the political parties.</p><p>The Subordinate Legislation Committee report details what came to be the most likely area of disagreement. Indeed, on any other day the outcome of the committee's discussion might have been different. I refer to section 28, which will extend the minimum period before an instrument that is subject to the negative procedure can come into force from 21 to 28 days. I, too, have the honour of summing up for my party and I will detail the Conservatives' position on that when I do so.</p><p>In conclusion, we will support the bill at stage 1. We look forward to the rest of today's debate and to stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20495384", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There are watches to be won in the Parliament, which are to be found in the nuggets that are the appointments in the gift of our political leaders.

With almost shocking clarity, he drew our attention to some of the consequences of a long-term lack of urgency in implementation in CAMHS, even while he acknowledged the additional funding that has been made available.</p><p>I pay tribute to my colleague Mary Scanlon. Since I joined the Parliament, she has been keen to ensure at every turn that everybody on the Conservative side appreciates the underlying mental health problems that underpin many of the issues that we discuss almost weekly in the chamber. That passion is shared by others and came across in Cathy Jamieson's speech late on in the debate.</p><p>Jamie Stone ensured that we did not lose sight of the rural dimension. Ian McKee concentrated <place-holder colnum=\"22447\"/> rightly on accountability and leadership in developing a service&#8212;an aim that has been agreed repeatedly as a policy objective but does not seem to be making progress. Michael Matheson and Hugh O'Donnell made a sensible point about training for pre-school and school staff on how to address and discuss with parents issues as they present.</p><p>I turn to the future of health visiting in Scotland and to the evidence of Dr Phil Wilson and others. For various reasons, the Conservatives have concluded that health visiting is descending into a shambles throughout large parts of Scotland. In his evidence, Dr Wilson said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"catastrophic damage has been wrought to the health visiting profession.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Health and Sport Committee</em>, 25 March 2009; c 1728.]</p><p>He went on to say that the number of health visitors is declining and that morale is at its lowest ever point. I know that the minister does not share that view because she said as much to me in the Parliament late last year, but I am afraid that I disagree with her.</p><p>I say to the minister, for whom I have some regard, that she cannot disguise the fact that, for all her espoused commitment, after nearly three years in government, there is the suggestion of what might be mistaken as an air of complacency&#8212;which I am sure is not intended&#8212;and of a reluctance to question whether the early evidence shows that the changes in health visiting that are now being put into effect are working towards or against the objectives that have been set. Moreover, as a result of many no doubt well-intentioned reviews, we seem to have 14 health boards progressing separate, if sometimes similar, approaches to health visiting in all its forms. I am witnessing, as are others&#8212;nowhere more so than in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&#8212;what appears to be almost the disembowelling of a once effective and quietly magnificent service. Universality has ended, and such is the crisis in numbers, with many disaffected older health visitors leaving the profession, that even the hoped-for concentration of additional resource in areas of inequality has not been achieved.</p><p>The evidence that was presented to the committee was conclusive, it seemed to me, in identifying the need for health visitors to be involved with children for longer than the initial weeks after birth or even the first year, because problems often become apparent in the years after that. As Dr Richard Simpson pointed out, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists showed that referrals from health visitors&#8212;once a principal source of referrals&#8212;have collapsed. To borrow a phrase that I think I heard almost too much of earlier in the week, we cannot go on like this.<place-holder colnum=\"22448\"/></p><p>Scottish Conservatives have during this parliamentary session concentrated our thinking on the development of health visiting policy. We saw first that the changes had the potential to be catastrophic and we called for the appointment of an independent scrutiny panel in Glasgow ahead of the delivery of major service change. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing was wrong to conclude that that was unnecessary.</p><p>We now call for a national health visiting strategy. We believe that health visitors should be attached to GPs, that there should be a universal service and that health visitors should be engaged with children up to the age of five, but particularly in the first three years. We have identified that we would direct an additional &#163;20 million into the development of the service in Scotland. We believe that that is a far greater priority for immediate health spending than, say, further reductions in prescription charges.</p><p>Let me be clear that, while maintaining a universal service, we would target additional resources into areas of inequality not by ending the service for others but by providing for additional health visitors in those communities. While we may differ on the means, I welcome the importance that Malcolm Chisholm placed on extended health visitor involvement and I look forward to seeing the results of the pilot in the Lothians that is based on the American experience.</p><p>We welcome the committee's report and the strength of feeling that is expressed in it. However, it perhaps sadly confirms that, while so many professionals strive to improve the position, we fail to match our appreciation of what needs to be done with the resource to make it happen. We need also to appreciate the associated stigmas that exist. Whereas a generation ago a cancer sufferer may have kept quiet&#8212;embarrassed to share the fact of their condition&#8212;in today's world that individual can talk openly about their cancer to a more understanding and knowledgeable world. However, who, suffering from a mental health condition, can step forward and speak of their condition in the same way and be sure that they will be met with equal understanding or knowledge? Far too few, I suggest. Surely that, above all else, tells us that we have a considerable amount still to do.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20473721", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Wellbeing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I was eager to hear the views of members from all parties in this debate, I will begin by commenting on points by which I have been particularly struck.

Although this is not the first debate on the matter in the chamber&#8212;neither was last week's statement the first&#8212;it is the first debate to be introduced by Jackie Baillie in her new role. I mention in passing the occasionally formidable act, Cathy Jamieson, which Jackie Baillie has to follow.</p><p>This is also my first chance to welcome Jackie Baillie as a health team season ticket holder. I do so with a genuine sense of anticipation. As a fellow West of Scotland member, I can attest to her splendid ability&#8212;repeatedly demonstrated&#8212;to distance herself so adroitly from not just the record of the previous Administration but, as Murdo Fraser pointed out recently, her own previously published positions, recently so heavily advertised on her website. We must all hope that, under Jackie Baillie's direction, much of her party's previous dogma, which was so instrumental in securing its place in opposition, will be abandoned. Jesting aside, Iain Gray has taken something of a political gamble in Miss Baillie's appointment, for reasons I shall touch on later.</p><p>As I observed a moment ago, we have debated the subject previously. That is not to detract in any way from the importance of sustained intervention to tackle this scourge, and the scourge of other health care acquired infections. It remains a tragedy that patients continue to succumb to a fatal, yet potentially largely avoidable infection. Ross Finnie spoke effectively to that point. Also tragic are the 38 deaths in recent months from H1N1 or related complications, and the deaths from malnutrition and many other conditions, about which less time has been spent discussing remedies and action plans.</p><p>Progress has been and is being made on tackling HAIs, and C diff in particular, as a result of events, discussions in Parliament and Government action. The cabinet secretary, Mary Scanlon and other members referred to that. All that is to be welcomed and, in welcoming it, let no one suggest that any of us or anyone in the NHS is complacent. I know from visiting hospitals that <place-holder colnum=\"21354\"/> they are not complacent. Anyone visiting a patient in hospital this afternoon or tonight will be acutely aware of the new emphasis on hygiene and infection control, although I noted with interest the contribution from Rhoda Grant.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have contributed to two areas of policy in particular. First, we strongly support the senior charge nurse programme, although we remain to be convinced that, in practice, that position will be able to exercise the authority that we believe is necessary. I have met the RCN to establish whether it is aware of slippages in any health board, and it has told me that it is not. By 2010, all hospitals should have an empowered champion against HAIs.</p><p>Secondly, the Conservatives have championed the introduction of electronic bed management and infection tracking in our hospitals. We persuaded the Government to run various pilots, which are on schedule. We believe in such a system not just because a relatively cheap, bolt-on, all-systems-compatible package would make the management of hospital beds simpler and more efficient, but because infection tracking could play a substantial role in tackling and controlling future hospital infections.</p><p>Electronic tracking can monitor the bed space, the bed frame, the mattress, the cleaning records and the patient occupation records. It will allow staff to see who may have introduced infections, who is potentially at risk and where those individuals moved to and from. It is a tool designed in consultation with front-line clinical staff, and it means that those staff can have confidence in the quality of information produced and in the simplicity of the system's operation. We are pleased that the cabinet secretary has kept us informed of the progress of the pilots and we look forward to seeing the detailed results in early course.</p><p>I regret the thinly-veiled partisan tone of Labour's approach. How can Labour express regret about the conduct of this health secretary, who is tackling the issue, yet not find the courage to express regret to the people of Scotland for its woeful negligence over the previous decade? At the heart of that is the disaster at the Vale of Leven. It will be extraordinary if the public inquiry does not seek to establish the consequential effect of a decade of uncertainty, underinvestment and downright neglect of the hospital. The regret that needs to be expressed today is about that lack of investment and the disregard of the calls to action by the NHS staff in that hospital. We are entitled to ask what advice Professor Hugh Pennington offered to the former Government. Was Professor Pennington concerned about the litany of disaster, outlined in detail by Mary Scanlon, or did he find a voice and an action plan only when he became a <place-holder colnum=\"21355\"/> Labour adviser, rather than tackling Labour's lack of action when it was in government?</p><p>Contrast that with the transformation at the Vale now. I recently visited the hospital with my Westminster colleague Andrew Lansley, who was keen not to come and preach but to listen and learn so that he can benefit from our experience. What we saw was a committed, motivated staff, relieved that at last the investments were being made&#8212;investments instructed during the tenure of this SNP Government. Herein lies the nature of lain Gray's political gamble for, if the public inquiry into events at the Vale criticises the actions and conduct of the former Scottish Executive, it will be intolerable for Parliament to be detained any longer by the views from the front bench of the local representative of an indicted and discredited former Administration. In short, in those circumstances Miss Baillie would have to consider her position, notwithstanding the obvious personal distress the experience of other families has caused her.</p><p>Tackling Clostridium difficile has become a priority for not just the Government but the Scottish Parliament and all those in Scotland's NHS. Many are the areas of policy in which the Parliament stands divided, but in our collective determination to make further early and significant progress on this challenge, we must not allow C diff to be one of them. The motion, however, seeks to make the challenge partisan and is not consensual so, although we welcome the chance afforded by Labour's choice of business to debate the matter again, we will vote for the Government's amendment tonight.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20389460", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Clostridium Difficile"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "And so we come to the closing stages of this further extended debate on a Labour motion on tackling Clostridium difficile.

I will concentrate entirely on applying that test to the future of health visiting.</p><p>Yesterday, I visited a relatively new medical centre in Glasgow Springburn. I sat below a flashy brass plaque that informed me that the opening ceremony had been performed by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing. Yet, as I sat there in the shiny new briefing suite, I heard how, despite its being one of the 85 Scottish general practitioner practices that feature in the top 100 GP practices that serve the most disadvantaged communities anywhere in the United Kingdom, it is supported by just one health visitor. That is almost too staggering to accept. Eighty-five of the 100 GP practices that serve the most disadvantaged communities are in Scotland, and in Springburn&#8212;a practice that serves some 7,000 patients in one of the most disadvantaged communities of all&#8212;there is just one health visitor. It gets worse. In the Possil practice, which is regarded as the GP practice that serves the most disadvantaged community anywhere in the UK, there has been&#8212;almost unbelievably&#8212;no health visitor at all for four weeks.</p><p>When the Parliament first met after the 2007 election, we debated the need to tackle inequality. The Scottish Conservatives expressed reservations at that time and have done so ever since about the piecemeal approach that is being taken on health visiting throughout Scotland. There are as many policies on how to deliver the service as there are health boards. In Glasgow, despite a petition calling for the health board's plans to be halted and changed, which attracted more than 20,000 signatures, the whole profession of health visiting&#8212;the very fabric of any service at all&#8212;is in chaos and is disintegrating before our eyes.</p><p>The Government can no longer adopt a hands-off approach. The Scottish Conservatives called <place-holder colnum=\"20872\"/> for an independent scrutiny panel to be appointed to review the major changes in this area of the health service that seek to jeopardise both our universal health visiting service and to experiment with the lives of the most disadvantaged. There may not be a shiny building of bricks and mortar to stand and pose outside&#8212;health visiting is not visible in the way that an accident and emergency department is; it is a service that is built entirely on the hard work of dedicated people&#8212;but the changes have had a profound effect, which is proving wholly detrimental. Our request for an ISP was rejected, but such a review is needed more than ever. We repeat our call for an ISP now and as a matter of urgency.</p><p>One GP wrote to me to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have had a near meltdown in SE Glasgow CHCP. In my own practice we now have 4 days cover instead of 6 after 8 months of virtually no cover. I can give countless tales of woe. The problem is we are just too tired to complain any more\".</p><p>A GP in Nicola Sturgeon's constituency of Glasgow Govan told me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I think children are more vulnerable in Glasgow now because of the deficient HV numbers and the inevitable move away from being GP attached. ... The situation is entirely the result of the realignment of the service\".</p><p>Alarmingly, the GP continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I have a fear that paradoxically there may be an improvement in the child protection statistics because children will essentially be invisible under this restructuring\".</p><p>There is now a widespread shortage of health visitors. Just as we forecast, lack of consultation has fuelled resistance to the proposals and has led, in turn, to many older and experienced health visitors feeling hopelessly undervalued and leaving the service. The move away from health visitors being GP attached has led to the loss of vital whole-practice intelligence. New recruits are being brought in on lower pay bands and with less experience&#8212;if they are being recruited at all. To add further to the collapse, the health visitor team leaders who were recruited just a year ago, mostly from among the most experienced health visitor corps and on the basis of their posts being 50 per cent clinical and 50 per cent managerial, have returned all their casework files within the past month following the announcement that their posts are now to be 100 per cent managerial.</p><p>The team approach that is being implemented has led to a breakdown in the excellent working relationships that were established over many years&#8212;relationships that were built on trust between GPs, health visitors and patients. We must call a halt to that. There is no point in taking credit for new legislation or grand advertising schemes that are aimed at tackling obesity, alcohol and drug addiction or smoking cessation if <place-holder colnum=\"20873\"/> we are dismantling the most effective prevention scheme of all&#8212;the direct intervention with every family on behalf of every child at birth.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives said that the Government's approach would not work and we were right.

More of us will be retired and dependent in some way on fewer younger people. The minister set out the figures in detail, as did my colleague Mary Scanlon.</p><p>That position is recognised implicitly by all the organisations that submitted comments before today's debate. Their responses essentially amount to two propositions. The first is that we need to do more in almost every area and that that will cost money&#8212;at a time, too, when resources will be scarce&#8212;although some of that investment might release resources, the seemingly insignificant and trivial matter of toenail care being an example. Secondly, there is recognition that with a scarcity of resources, or even simply in recognition of the affordability issues that are presented by a changing demographic balance, we have to rethink the means of delivery.</p><p>That thoughtful analysis is encouraging because, frankly, if the discussion were to be distilled down to the notion that politicians will just have to find the money to go on as we are but with incremental increases to support both the burgeoning demographic and all the worthwhile initiatives that are actively canvassed, planning would simply run into the sand. Des McNulty made a thoughtful contribution in focusing on that point towards the end of the debate. From the perspective of funding, the Scottish Parliament's policy achievement of free personal care, which Duncan McNeil discussed, will be an enormous challenge to sustain. Successful planning for that alone will be a considerable achievement and we cannot take it for granted.<place-holder colnum=\"20577\"/></p><p>Elsewhere, Conservatives have proposed an increase in the age at which people retire coupled with a restoration of the link between the state pension and earnings, so Christine Grahame can relax and take comfort from the many and varied benefits that the union can and will confer. An unwelcome rise in the retirement age will fund a more financially secure future for older people.</p><p>I want to right the historical wrong to which Robert Brown drew attention. The Liberal Government did introduce the state pension back in 1906. Perhaps it is worth while to say how sad it was that an ungrateful nation was shortly thereafter to consign his party to the fringes of political history. If Jamie Stone has the disc of Mr Asquith that puts him so happily to sleep, I am sure that many older people would welcome the opportunity to purchase it, because I am sure that it would have a similar effect on us all.</p><p>We are still at the crossroads of the lifestyle change that has seen many more people choose to live alone for the majority of their lives, and those people will move into old age having enjoyed and lived capably with that status. We have both an ageing demographic and a general lifestyle change that has seen more people choose to live alone. It is possible that some of the issues around education will be mitigated by the experience gained by those in the generation who have lived a single life prior to old age, whereas it is still common today for many older people who live alone and need support to be those who have been left behind.</p><p>However, Age Concern in particular has identified that too many issues&#8212;such as general malnutrition, lack of knowledge about or unwillingness to take up the many income benefits for older people, which Christine Grahame mentioned, or an issue that I mentioned earlier, toenail cutting&#8212;can lead to problems being severely compounded. Johann Lamont drew attention to the lower-level services that combat feelings of isolation, and I agree that it would be a mistake to class those as luxuries. All this, of course, before the emerging challenge of dementia, which we have debated before, and of which every family must anticipate a future first-hand experience.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives welcome the debate. We recognise and applaud the reasoned analysis by all the organisations that are involved that what we do now will not work in the future and that effective resource management will be vital if we are to sustain the imaginative breadth of initiatives that are envisioned. We support the view that there is an urgent need to develop a policy approach that commands as much support as possible, but it is more urgent still that we take the required time to think through the options and thoroughly discuss <place-holder colnum=\"20578\"/> the potential consequences&#8212;both intended and unintended&#8212;of any changes that we implement.</p><p>As I read the various submissions, I was somewhat stopped in my tracks by one that defined older people as those aged 50 and over. It is one thing for our children to say that we are ancient when we still feel very much in our prime or, at least, we can just about remember what that felt like. In a previous debate, Dr McKee entertained us at some length by talking about his passion for silk underwear. He was at it again today with the sex and games activities of Saga members. However, it is another thing to realise that the debate that we are having today is about a future, which is not so far away, in which we will be the very older people whom we have been discussing.</p><p>This is not an abstract population concept; as the minister noted, we must ensure that older people are not seen simply as a problem and that we create an atmosphere in which people who say that they are 50 or over do not elicit the response \"You poor thing.\" As Mary Scanlon pointed out, not everyone who is aged 65 or over is in need of care. As I say, this is not an abstract concept. We are talking about the care and dignity of our friends, our families and our fellows, so we had better get it right.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20269457", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elder Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This afternoon's debate has been welcomed by members throughout the chamber.

After all, this week sees the climax of the UK party conference season and long-standing tradition dictates our conduct. Last week, Labour said lots of nasty things about the Conservatives; this week, we in turn illustrate dramatically all that is wrong with the failing Labour Government. A fortnight ago, we both shared a universally arrived at national judgment on the Liberal Democrats, but the less said about them the better. On that sentiment, even though I appreciated Robert Brown's speech this morning, I find the Liberal Democrat amendment unhelpful, which will contribute to the outcome at decision time.</p><p>However, the motion requires us to rise above the demands of the season, because it touches directly on an unjust sleight of policy executed by this minority Government against ProjectScotland and the wishes of all the other parties in the Parliament. No great issue of principle was at stake; no great financial burden was relieved for the nation. What was achieved, with all the appearance of first ministerial spite, was the emasculation of an organisation that was created by the current incumbent's predecessor, seemingly principally for that reason.</p><p>I will return to ProjectScotland later, for the motion invites us to recognise and celebrate the extraordinary culture of volunteering bequeathed by generations of Scots past and embedded in the daily practice of modern Scotland. Some 45,000 structured voluntary organisations, managing &#163;9 billion of assets and marshalling 1.3 million adult volunteers from every sector of Scottish life, work to make Scotland and the wider world a better place. That is a characteristic of modern Scotland that I do not doubt every member of the Parliament welcomes, celebrates and is regularly inspired by.</p><p>We have probably all volunteered at some point; it can be an important balance in life. My family volunteers and there is nothing remarkable about it. Like many younger people at school, my sons have come to volunteering through the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. My wife volunteers with the lifeboats&#8212;on the fundraising side of things, I hasten to add. I mention that in passing because all who volunteer would wish the debate to acknowledge the one general irritation felt by all, which is regulation, however well intentioned, <place-holder colnum=\"20404\"/> whose consequence is to obstruct the work of volunteers and demoralise many who volunteer. We need to deal with that problem if volunteering is not to suffer, but it is the stuff of a different debate than ours today.</p><p>Volunteering will prosper irrespective of the fortunes of ProjectScotland. However, what is at stake is the potential loss of an organisation that affords access to volunteering to sections of our young people who are regularly bypassed. As I observed when we debated ProjectScotland nearly two years ago, ProjectScotland addresses volunteering access inequality, which makes the actions of a Government pledged to address inequality all the more bewildering. In the two years since that debate, has something else turned up? Rather like what happened with the Scottish Futures Trust, we were invited back in 2007 to swoon before freshly invigorated ministers breathily promising something better. But something better is there not. To be fair to the minister, he has at least been emollient, at least until a moment ago when, in one breath, he praised ProjectScotland and, in the next, he attacked Murdo Fraser for asking him to back up that praise with practical action.</p><p>The First Minister has been less emollient. On 24 June at First Minister's questions, oblivious to the 50 or so ProjectScotland volunteer champions watching from the public gallery, he descended into a diatribe of ill-informed and ill-judged abuse of ProjectScotland, its volunteer organisers and volunteer successes. At a certificate award ceremony afterwards, there was a heady mix of bewilderment and fury from a new generation of Scots&#8212;and model Scots at that&#8212;receiving awards for the sheer excellence of their commitment to volunteering on behalf of their country.</p><p>Although many voluntary organisations seek out young people in search of life-changing opportunities, and the Government supports many of them in many ways, I remain genuinely perplexed by its indifference to the future of ProjectScotland, which is an organisation supported not just by several of its back benchers&#8212;prior to being told to think otherwise by their front-bench peers&#8212;but by an extraordinary range of not-for-profit organisations that address volunteering access inequalities in every region and community of Scotland.</p><p>Those who emerge through organisations such as ProjectScotland are just the sort of young people whom responsible businesses long to recruit. Businesses recognise that they have journeyed through ProjectScotland from potentially difficult circumstances. Responsible business wants to play its part in giving those young people, who have shown such courage, application and <place-holder colnum=\"20405\"/> resolve, a permanent and hopeful future. Eight out of 10 progress to a positive outcome. Some 40 per cent of those young people come from the 20 per cent most deprived areas in Scotland. Through ProjectScotland, more than 3,000 young people have contributed more than 2.2 million hours of new voluntary work, saved the state some &#163;3.16 million in welfare benefits and, through their talent, increased confidence and application, significantly increased the capacity and quality of the service that is provided by not-for-profit organisations. Never has volunteering had a more important role to play. Harnessed successfully, volunteering will give hope, life skills and work to many and will prepare them for the employment opportunities that will surely come. We should learn from past experience, not repeat it.</p><p>Structured volunteering placements of the kind offered to young people through innovative organisations such as ProjectScotland deserve recognition and practical support from the Government in these times. Today we set aside, however reluctantly, the tribal rites of this crucial party conference season to join Labour by supporting the motion in Johann Lamont's name.

Part 2 of the bill, the necessity for which appears to be validated only by the standing ovations that have been conferred upon the cabinet secretary by the doctors' trade union, to which part 2 seeks to extend an absolute monopoly, is not needed and not wanted and is typical of the vanity projects in which this minority Government is inclined to specialise.</p><p>As David McLetchie detailed, we remain pragmatic. Even as ministers issue briefing papers detailing the extraordinary challenges and demands that face the NHS in the decade ahead, they seek to close down possible solutions to those challenges via a centralised diktat. Even as politicians and the public wake up to the reality of the demographic changes that face the national health service and GP practices, and which arise from an ageing population, the Government moves to foreclose any ability for the independent sector potentially to assist in as yet unforeseen circumstances. Even as we appreciate the challenge of approximately 20 per cent of GPs retiring in the next five years, ministers bury their heads in the sands of ideological prejudice. Part 2 of the bill is the latest in a long line of examples of the minority SNP Administration being more concerned about ideological purity than it is about what delivers the best care for Scottish patients.

According to the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"20028\"/> schools adolescent lifestyle and substance abuse survey, among those aged 13 to 15 approximately 89 per cent are fully aware that smoking can cause heart disease, approximately 96 per cent are fully aware that smoking can cause lung cancer, and approximately 91 per cent are fully aware that other people's smoking can harm the health of non-smokers.

I believe that the measures that we introduce should not be other than firmly evidence-based, likely to be effective and properly enforced once they are implemented.</p><p>As Mary Scanlon, David McLetchie and others have demonstrated, the evidence just does not pass muster. In nearly all cases, the authors of reports cited in evidence clearly state that the claims of causation between the displaying of tobacco and people starting smoking should be made with great care. For a number of technical reasons, including the fact that display bans have been part of a range of interventions, it is not possible definitively to claim causation.

That research was based on the old parlour game of remembering items on a cloth-covered tray. Teenagers were shown photographs and then asked which ones they could remember. Being bright and willing to impress, they did. However, no evidence was subsequently produced to show that that encouraged them to go out and buy the things that they could remember. Indeed, having heard all the evidence, the best that the Health and Sport Committee could say in its report was that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"On balance\"&#8212;</p><p>only on balance, mind&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the majority of Committee members consider that the display of cigarettes at the point of sale constitutes advertisement and ... recognises that the evidence base for this proposal is at an early stage and that the international evidence to date is inconclusive.\"</p><p>That is hardly a ringing endorsement.</p><p>In its report, the Health and Sport Committee accepted that it had not witnessed trials of radio frequency-controlled cigarette vending machines by organisations such as the National Association of Cigarette Machine Operators. It was an extraordinary admission by Christine Grahame&#8212;emphasised by Michael Matheson with pride bursting from his pores&#8212;that the committee would rather not see those machines operate in case they work. Richard Simpson's concerns about pre-radio-controlled machines is shared by the industry, hence its investment in the new technology to address the matter. Rhoda Grant's comments, by contrast, were much more constructive and worthwhile.</p><p>The Government insists that the bill will not prove to be a burden of any consequence to small businesses. With due respect to the ministers concerned, I point out that they have not owned or run small businesses themselves. Small retailers regard themselves as the Government's partners in preventing young people from getting hold of cigarettes. They support enforcement actions and, like us, they support the new licensing proposals. They also expect the Government to respond to the Health and Sport Committee's view that proxy purchasing should be tackled&#8212;that the deliberate falsification of documents to obtain cigarettes from responsible retailers should lead to punishment not just for those who are deceived; those who are doing the deceiving should face consequences, as well.</p><p>This afternoon, we have seen writ large before us that we have a minister for wishful thinking and a cabinet secretary for fantasy politics.

She had the gift of storytelling and a lifelong interest in events and current affairs. Her memories, vividly retold, of the evacuation during the war of her young family through treacherous waters by convoy to Canada, of the abdication, of the loss of the Titanic and of her brother's experiences in Moscow during the Bolshevik revolution, with summary executions and bodies strung up from almost every lamp post, were a fascinating window on nearly a century of history.<place-holder colnum=\"19405\"/></p><p>My grandmother could be rather startling, too. Her matter-of-fact, inside knowledge that she knew&#8212;with a certainty that most commentators lacked&#8212;that Labour would not win the 1992 election was conveyed to me over lunch in a popular restaurant. She said, \"Jackson, Neil Kinnock was never going to win. After all, in the final analysis, no one was going to vote for someone to be Prime Minister who couldn't buy himself a decent suit.\" Maybe it really was the suit what won it. More acerbic was her view that Alex Salmond is so smug he would cheerfully drink his own bathwater. That is now accepted universally by the First Minister's opponents and&#8212;as I know from conversations in this place&#8212;by some of his friends, too.</p><p>Therefore, it has rested on my conscience since my grandmother's passing in 1996 that her final few years were blighted by a constant battle with dementia, broken up by occasional blinding shafts of lucidity, when she would experience the knowledge that this was so. It seemed to me that, surely, if there could be remission&#8212;however brief&#8212;there could equally be a cure. On her 90<sup>th</sup> birthday, when I asked her how she felt to be 90, she replied, \"I wouldn't recommend it.\" There is no disguising the affluent circumstances of my own upbringing and the ability that that gave my family to do all that we could for her in those final years. However, it was not lost on me that there were countless others for whom similar circumstances must have been wretched. Therefore, although we must be exceptionally careful not to attach blame to any individual in the business of caring, who can be surprised by the findings of the report this year of the Mental Welfare Commission and the care commission? That report bleeds into our consciences because we all know that we all knew. Throughout the debate, members of all parties have made references to experiences that must surely stop us all short. Cathy Jamieson and Mary Scanlon gave graphic examples in their powerful opening speeches. The minister was right to call the report \"deeply shocking\". However, candidly, did any one of us expect to be other than deeply shocked?</p><p>Irene Oldfather emphasised the immediacy of the issues that we are discussing. I commend her on the breadth of her remarks, and note that the points that she made were firmly re-emphasised later by Tom McCabe.</p><p>Throughout the debate, and in the motion, tribute has been paid to numerous organisations that are doing heroic work. In particular, we must recognise the essential value of developments in understanding the simple changes that can be made to houses to allow many people to stay at home. That is not always possible but, where it is, <place-holder colnum=\"19406\"/> it is invariably the preferred option of most people, and highly practical advances have been achieved, as those who visit the dementia services development centre at the University of Stirling will have witnessed.</p><p>However, our way forward must be on the basis of waking up all those whom we represent to some pretty unpalatable truths. In the first few weeks of joining this Parliament, I attended a dinner with members from all sides on the way forward with regard to dementia. As we live longer, so too will the incidence of dementia in all its forms increase. It will come to almost every family as the norm and not the exception. Further, we must add to that a phenomenon the reach of which we cannot yet foresee&#8212;the growing incidence of dementia in the population at a younger age. At that dinner, it was suggested that we cannot know what the longer-term consequences of drug misuse will be, even among recovered addicts and casual users. We were told with some certainty that there is no magic pill around the corner, and that whatever breakthrough we might hope to see could be at least 15 years away.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives welcome all that the Government has set forth today. However, it is set forth at the most troubling of times, for just as we appreciate the changing demographics and the longer survival of our fellow citizens, so too do we face an immediate decade of challenging austerity. That is singularly depressing, because it is an inescapable fact that a dementia strategy of which we can be proud has to be labour intensive, and labour-intensive care carries a huge financial cost. However, there is no room for any additional huge financial cost. To find the resource, we will have to examine our health service with a determination to find treatments and proactive health care approaches that reduce the existing burdens elsewhere. Let me set aside for a moment any party-political point and say that, although I do not support some of the Government's plans to tackle the scourge of alcohol consumption, I accept that ministers are pursuing those policies precisely because they recognise the huge burden that alcoholism places on the national health service, and the need to tackle that problem if we are to match our fine words on dementia with effective actions.</p><p>Alcohol is not the only issue that must be dealt with. We need to be brave with NHS reform if we are to release the resources that treatment of those with dementia might require. The worry is that if we do not, the financial pressures might prove so great that our flagship achievement&#8212;free personal care for the elderly&#8212;might itself come under intense scrutiny.</p><p>I said earlier that we had to wake people up to unpalatable truths. I think that we might need to be <place-holder colnum=\"19407\"/> blunt and honest about this: of course Government wants to do more and of course as politicians we recognise the need for such action. However, Scotland needs to accept that our living longer means that every family and many of those who have lived or have raised children alone will have to anticipate a direct experience of a loved one in need of care. Social patterns mean that fewer people will live together to take care of one another, and we can easily underestimate the importance of that reality. Care is something that we will all have to share. It cannot become the sole responsibility of the state, and to pretend that it can is to deny an open discussion on the future shape of our community life. We need to be prepared and that cannot be achieved by our being surprised by events; we need to be educated in that respect.</p><p>I wish ministers well in that work. They will enjoy our support; after all, our approach must be consensual. However, it cannot be denied: the simple title of the carers handbook, \"Coping with Dementia\", might sum up the challenge but it belies its true scale.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dementia Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like many, I owe a great debt to my grandmother.

I also thank committee colleagues for their convivial exchanges. We are particularly indebted to the clerks, because the brief that we were working to and the wide range of both possibilities and probabilities on which we could have settled meant that they had to do their best to discern and anticipate the collective mind of the committee. Given that the individual minds of committee members were not that much clearer for long periods, that was an unenviable task. However, the clerks managed it with patience that was impressive to behold.</p><p>The committee met with the views of various interested parties ringing in our ears. I applaud the resolve, certainty, determination, passion and good humour with which some people advocated their positions. I instinctively sympathised with some of them, but it seemed at times that the arguments were of the \"The country's gone to the dogs\" and \"There's nothing worth watching on the telly these days\" variety. In other words, certain assertions were made, but they were not always evidenced or proven by the examination of the witnesses.</p><p>As well as the big-ticket considerations, we were persuaded that many of the general housekeeping recommendations to do with length of service, termination and subsequent employment were appropriate. I think that most members would have drawn the same conclusions. Those recommendations were not of the racy variety, but they will nonetheless be important to those who <place-holder colnum=\"18548\"/> currently hold office and they will be potentially influential in attracting their successors. Some of the existing provisions are certainly too restrictive. I think that the committee struck the correct balance through collective agreement.</p><p>Certain other potential consolidations were not without appeal, but they floundered in the face of practical obstacles. The future disposition of Waterwatch Scotland, to which the Minister for Parliamentary Business referred, is an example of that. The proposal to amalgamate Waterwatch Scotland and the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman was not without appeal, but because Waterwatch investigates both public sector and private sector complaints, with the latter supported by an industry levy, it was difficult to see how such an amalgamation could be achieved. Merging the public sector element while leaving the private sector element elsewhere would not have enhanced consumer understanding or operational efficiency. However, I note the comments that Bruce Crawford made about that.</p><p>The committee settled on consolidations that it thought enhanced public access and scrutiny and simplified operational structures. Perhaps we could have gone further. Arguments occasionally lay in the balance, and in future sessions, members may well wish to review matters again in the light of the operational experience that will arise should the recommendations in the committee's report be implemented. In that regard, I fear that I may disappoint Robin Harper with the remarks that I will make about the proposal to merge the Scottish Human Rights Commission and Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People.</p><p>Without being unkind to either body, I am not sure that the evidence that was presented on the current operational functions of those two organisations was in itself persuasive. The SHRC is hardly established, and in any event has so structured itself that an early accommodation of the SCCYP would be a fairly substantial, if not insurmountable, difficulty. In the case of the SCCYP, arguments were presented that demonstrated commendable operational practice, but they did not in themselves reinforce the need for a separate commission or commissioner, although SCCYP's work is seen as a benchmark internationally. I think that if we started afresh, Parliament would most likely have recommended the establishment of a rights commission, but we are not starting afresh. Given that both organisations are operationally incompatible, it was not certain what the consequences would be if a merger were forced on them, or whether a shotgun wedding would have been operationally efficient in any definable or quantifiable sense.<place-holder colnum=\"18549\"/></p><p>The committee was not convened to speculate on the hypothetical, but its members were aware of public suggestions that further rights commissioners may be established&#8212;for victims and for older people, for example. The creation of further rights commissioners did not excite&#8212;I am choosing my words diplomatically. It was not for the committee to set out in its report the work of the Parliament in any future session&#8212;indeed, now may not the time to do that&#8212;but I at least believe that there will probably be merit in the Parliament specifically examining the arrangements again in the medium term. In the light of more substantial evidence and a more precisely defined proposition for further rights commissioners, an alternative structure may well prove more compelling at that time.</p><p>A report has been presented to the Parliament that will not meet the expectations of everyone in every respect; indeed, it possibly does not meet the expectations of every member of the committee. However, in the circumstances, in the face of the evidence that we heard, and in the light of the competing conclusions that were reached, the committee agreed the report. The report need not be an end in itself, but for the moment, and with the support of Parliament at decision time today, we support the early implementation of the report's recommendations by way of a committee bill and through other Government legislation, as comprehensively detailed by Trish Godman.</p><p>Finally, I offer Trish Godman my congratulations on and gratitude for her patience and courtesy as convener of the committee.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "17369302", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee Bill Proposal"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, begin by thanking the clerks and all those who gave evidence to the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee over several months.

That lack of understanding about the rise of fascism in Germany and the gradual but inevitable path that led to the world's most destructive conflict is complemented by a more encouraging understanding of the Holocaust, although, among far too many, there is the belief that it was the Holocaust that led free nations into war with Nazi Germany&#8212;it was not. The final evidence of the Holocaust was understood by the wider public only when the war itself was over, and it has been rightly condemned ever since. However, the truth is more prosaic: Governments at the time did come to appreciate the horror that was being perpetrated, but chose to suppress the knowledge and to do little, if anything, to disrupt it. Perhaps they had no choice, if the ultimate objective&#8212;the absolute defeat of Hitler&#8212;was to be achieved at the earliest date. However, with notable and wonderfully honourable exceptions, there was little appetite for accommodating widespread Jewish immigration into other nations before the war.</p><p>At question-and-answer sessions over the years, I have routinely been asked, \"Could it happen again?\" That is surely a false question: it has happened again. It happened in Stalin's post-war Soviet Union, in Pol Pot's Cambodia and in Rwanda. Perhaps people mean to ask whether it could happen again in Europe. The answer is, again, that it has happened, in post-Soviet Balkan states. It can happen, it has happened, and I say with profound regret that it will probably happen again, therefore the work of the Anne Frank Trust UK is vital in engaging the minds and securing the commitment of every new generation.</p><p>The trust's work must be complemented by an understanding of everything that happened in the lead-up to the events that Anne Frank described in <place-holder colnum=\"18430\"/> her diary. The lessons of history must be understood if history is not to be repeated. Whatever recompense there might be in our actions to honour the people who died, at the heart of what we do must be a recognition that a collective lack of popular international will in the 1930s&#8212;a collective lack of will and action on the part of people just like us&#8212;resulted in the ruthless extermination of millions of disabled people, Romany folk, homosexuals and, above all, Jews.</p><p>The experience of Anne Frank and her family engages hearts and minds because her diary encapsulates what happened in a timeless way and enables us all to relate to her experience. The recent BBC dramatisation illustrated afresh how everyday the nuances and complexities of Anne Frank's family life and relationships were. It also showed us how vivid were the assorted personalities with whom she shared her final years in confinement. Her experience moves us to tears in memory of all the people who died because it makes tangible the terrible statistic of 6 million murdered people.</p><p>Prejudice and hatred are not inherited. A song in Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"South Pacific\" succinctly captures a truth&#8212;members should not fear; I will not sing it. The lyric goes thus:</p><p>You've got to be taught to hate and fear<br/> You've got to be taught from year to year,<br/> It's got to be drummed in your dear little ear<br/> You've got to be carefully taught.</p><p>You've got to be taught to be afraid<br/> Of people whose eyes are oddly made,<br/> And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,<br/> You've got to be carefully taught.</p><p>You've got to be taught before it's too late,<br/> Before you are six or seven or eight,<br/> To hate all the people your relatives hate,<br/> You've got to be carefully taught How welcome it is to read the testimonials from people who have seen the touring exhibition, to learn about the discussion that the exhibition has stimulated, and to witness the leadership and engagement of so many young people&#8212;the very six, seven and eight-year-olds whom we can carefully teach to think and act quite differently.</p><p>The lesson of the 1930s and Anne Frank's life and death is that we must not just be vigilant across the world but set an example by fighting prejudice and hatred at home. We must stand ready to accept willingly all people who come here under genuine threat of persecution. We must counter ignorance. We must directly and personally tackle people who seek advancement by encouraging fear and suspicion of other people.

It was not all that I had hoped for, given that it was an invitation to present myself for bowel cancer screening but, nevertheless, it was gratefully received. I confirm that I will take up the invitation and, once again, I encourage all members to do all they can to encourage Scotland's male population to take their health seriously and to take advantage of the screening opportunities that are designed to save their lives whenever they are offered.</p><p>The debate follows various statements, all of which the Government has addressed competently and pretty comprehensively. Scotland's unenviable position in finding itself host to the first UK instances of the virus had the unforeseen consequence of catapulting the cabinet secretary's daily briefings to the screens of 24-hour news channels worldwide. I am told that there were even calls from around the globe for her to become health secretary for this or that nation. That is a prospect to contemplate, although I suspect that the cabinet secretary will resist the opportunity to have her head turned. I trust that, in days to come, she will not lament the passing of these dizzying heights of international fame. However, I congratulate her on setting a tone of calm and authority, which we can all be satisfied has been followed largely by the media and the public.</p><p>We can contrast that tone with the rather lurid hysteria that accompanied the previous avian flu outbreak, when rather alarmist and apocalyptic visions dominated media coverage. Although they certainly attracted the public's attention, they did rather less to enhance public understanding. In any event, today it is avian retreats&#8212;bird-houses&#8212;rather than avian flu, that occupy the favours of media attention. The contrast is important because, as we watch the outbreak progress, witness our reaction to it and measure the response of everything that we have put in place to deal with it, we can be quietly pleased at <place-holder colnum=\"17876\"/> the collective efforts of all those who have been responsible for preparing the ground.</p><p>Mary Scanlon quoted the Royal Society of Edinburgh earlier. I was struck by this observation in its briefing:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The current events in Scotland ... are providing a real life test of plans for pandemics and it is crucial that we learn from it. Never before has the importation of a new influenza virus been studied so early in its progress and in such detail and with so much media attention. The targeted use of antivirals is new. It is also crucial that when the current outbreak subsides both the science of the outbreak and the response by international agencies and governments are reviewed in detail.\"</p><p>Although there are around 13,000 cases worldwide today, the overwhelming majority remain centred on one continent. It seems that, in preparing for a pandemic, we have done much that is required. However, the debate has illustrated the strong will of all participating to avoid any complacency, learn the appropriate lessons and improve further our response plans.</p><p>Richard Simpson brought his professional experience to the debate, with a comprehensive narrative and a series of well-informed questions, including points on diagnostic testing that were also raised by Mary Scanlon. She and Richard Simpson asked sensible questions regarding the possible reliance on one antiviral, Tamiflu.</p><p>Ross Finnie made a thoughtful speech on funding, on which we need to reflect.</p><p>Ian McKee posed a query on how the distribution of antivirals might be sustained if large numbers were affected, including those who are doing the distributing.</p><p>Mary Scanlon asked a number of important questions regarding the preparation of antivirals and vaccines, should there be a recurrence later in the year.</p><p>As the Royal Society of Edinburgh points out, there would need to be the much wider infection rate that we are doing so much to prevent for any recurrence to be classed as a second wave. However, we must prepare for eventualities and it would be useful to know how the cabinet secretary's observation that the flu appears to be affecting those who are not typically in the priority vaccination groups will be reflected in any vaccination programme, given that those people are not the people who might expect to be invited to present themselves for vaccination.</p><p>There has been no absence of candour or information throughout this episode. All parties and the public have been kept well informed. However, there is some concern that local health boards have been slightly less comprehensive in the information that they have disseminated. As Jamie Stone noted, it is important that general <place-holder colnum=\"17877\"/> practitioners are closely involved. Candid, honest, calm and regularly delivered updates have enhanced the authority of those in charge in the public's minds&#8212;a lesson that might be learned by others, including some health boards that are less disposed to such an approach.</p><p>NHS teams have prepared and coped well, and we can be proud of them. A fortnight ago, I visited the Vale of Leven hospital with my Westminster colleague Andrew Lansley so that he could learn lessons at first hand following the Clostridium difficile tragedy there. I can confirm that the hospital has made spectacular progress in implementing the investment recommendations that were made. However, the teams on the ground were talking about their preparations for any H1N1 outbreak, and were keeping a close watch on events across the water in Greenock. We can all be impressed with their attention to detail and willingness to respond as required.</p><p>Stuart McMillan remarked on the response of a community at the centre of the outbreak, and congratulated those people on their forbearance, in which tribute I happily join him.</p><p>As an Opposition party, we have a responsibility to examine the conduct of the Government and question progress that is made. In so doing, we will assist not just in ensuring that this outbreak is dealt with effectively but that lessons are learned to improve further on plans that are already widely regarded as being well prepared and effective.</p><p>It is also our responsibility to offer support to the Government and ministers as they seek to map a route through the issue. We have been happy to do that, and we particularly welcome the easy relationship and willing partnership that have developed in this area between the Scottish Government and Administrations throughout the UK.</p><p>It might be a relative expression, especially to those who have been affected, those who are currently suffering and those who are at risk, but so far, so good.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15014518", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Influenza A(H1N1)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Given that this is the first full health debate since the Easter recess&#8212;I make no complaint about that, given that I felt like I was in possession of a weekly season ticket in the term before that&#8212;during which I turned 50, I thank the cabinet secretary for the communication that I received from her.

No doubt the people of Athens enjoyed high <place-holder colnum=\"16779\"/> expectations for the Olympic facilities that were built in their name and which they could ill afford, but today those facilities stand disfigured, unused and even border on dilapidation, as a tribute to civic incompetence. I therefore echo the cautionary notes that Ian McKee and Jamie McGrigor sounded in respect of examining past experience.</p><p>Ian McKee conjured up for us the memory of the emperor Caligula, who he reminded us was assassinated after an unsuccessful games. He will recall, of course, that Caligula was succeeded by a much older man in Claudius, so he should not despair. From that example, there is clearly hope for his own leadership ambitions. Who knows&#8212;he may yet preside over the games.</p><p>It is no doubt true that benefits were secured in Manchester after the 2002 Commonwealth games, although we should note Ross Finnie's caution. However, I agree with Margo MacDonald that there is now an elephant in the room: the state of our economy as it is caught up in recession. The background to the 2002 games was an expanding economy, but the period between now and 2014 will be harder going. It will be tougher to encourage business to commit, and we should not be naive about that. Some of the future investment potential may be queried by companies that are concerned that legacy facilities and developments will exceed the post-recession demand at the point of availability. The challenge to the Governments here and at Westminster is all the greater as a result, so we should watch carefully the example of the Olympic games in London for any early signs that the expectations of private sector engagement fall short.</p><p>As many other members do, I know that Glaswegians are capable of making a success of anything, whatever the circumstances&#8212;it is in their grain and character&#8212;but however much any of us loves Glasgow, no one can ignore the fact that, at the heart, it accounts for the substance of Scotland's inequalities in health, education and opportunity.</p><p>Having had a business in the Commonwealth games end of the city, I know how much of the progress that Glasgow may be able to make in the next 25 years depends on successful planning of not only the games but of their legacy. Shona Robison set out the bold range of headline legacy objectives. Not least of those is the potential benefit for health, which is of common concern to the minister, Ross Finnie and me. A particular aspect of that is the huge variety of sport and personal fitness options that the games will offer&#8212;which Margo MacDonald touched on&#8212;and the unique experience and opportunity that that will give not only to the emerging generation of young <place-holder colnum=\"16780\"/> people, but to the rest of us, although with due caution and concern for our advancing years.</p><p>I think that I was grateful for Sandra White reassuring me that, although I turned 50 during the recess, I am not that old. Someone told me that 50 is the new 40. Less reassuringly, my wife told me that, in my case, 50 is the new 70. I support Frank McAveety's call that there be the widest possible availability of school facilities to young people and communities in the lead-up to the games.</p><p>When all the papers and pamphlets have been written and all the consultants have reported, it is vital that the people of Glasgow, particularly in the east end, are at the centre of the project's delivery and are not just spectators on the side. That was the lesson of Canary Wharf where, quite unnecessarily, local people felt excluded and were eventually driven out.</p><p>I agree with Margaret Curran that championing the opportunities for the east end of Glasgow is not in any way in competition with the success that the games represent for the rest of Scotland. The legacy of 2014 must not be another playground for developers and end with displacement of the existing population and Glasgow's problems into another deprived and excluded community. It would be a great tragedy if, by 2020, we had successfully rejuvenated the east end at the expense of, rather than to the benefit of, the people who currently live there.</p><p>It is doubtful whether Glasgow will have such a comprehensive opportunity again in my lifetime, so we welcome the spirit of co-operation between the Scottish Government, the Westminster Government and Glasgow City Council. The ambition to secure lottery funding is perfectly reasonable, but we should not begrudge the substantial lottery funding for the 2012 London Olympic games. Its success will aid Glasgow's determination to make our games two years later all the greater a success.</p><p>Nicol Stephen recalled vividly the palpable sense of excitement that was felt two years ago&#8212;and which still remains&#8212;when Glasgow secured the games. We can be impressed by all the organisations and politicians talking and working together then and since. However, the games will be, as will their legacy. While welcoming the progress in planning, we must be certain as we progress that, beneath the surface, the involvement of the business community and the engagement of the community more generally is tangible. There is no point in developing a culture whereby we spend millions saying what a wonderful legacy there will be, if there is none in practice.</p><p>Ensuring that the reality meets the expectation is a huge challenge and responsibility not only for <place-holder colnum=\"16781\"/> others, but for us in Parliament. For Glasgow's and Scotland's sakes, failure to maximise the legacy benefits cannot be an option.

I am sure that that will be a great comfort to the staff at Stracathro.</p><p>I recognise ministers' mealy-mouthed acceptance of the fact that the independent sector can be used almost as a disposable asset whose primary role is to improve treatment waiting times, not for the sake of patients but to add to the spin that polishes ministers' haloes when they take the credit for waiting time reductions. However, that is poor reward. Today offered ministers the opportunity to be a bit more fulsome in their thanks and tributes to those in the independent sector who work as hard as anyone else; yet, as Mary Scanlon observed, the most that they could find it <place-holder colnum=\"16209\"/> within themselves to do was to note those people's contribution.</p><p>I find the Government's hostility to the independent sector perplexing. We are talking about a very practical partnership that was established at Stracathro by Andy Kerr under the previous Executive. It is a bold initiative from which Richard Simpson and Cathy Jamieson have sought to distance themselves this morning by deleting the fulsome tribute that we are prepared to offer. Perhaps in disavowing Andy Kerr's record as health minister they will also accept the mistake that he made in proposing to close accident and emergency facilities throughout Scotland.</p><p>The pilot had a clear intention, which was to consider the potential additional use to which NHS operating theatres could be put when they were not being used by the NHS. Dr Ian McKee advised us that two years was not long enough to judge the success of the pilot. I assume, therefore, that he is similarly unconvinced about the success of the SNP Government after just two years. On that, at least, I think that the chamber is agreed.</p><p>By any standard, the Stracathro pilot has been a success. We have heard how it has performed operations successfully at a cost of some &#163;2 million less than the NHS. We have heard about the outstanding patient satisfaction. Those patients would probably also be concerned about any creeping privatisation of the NHS. However, having benefited from the treatment that they have received, they can also see that a practical partnership with the independent sector that is designed to benefit the NHS makes political sense.</p><p>We can celebrate, too, the record at Stracathro of no hospital-acquired infections. I imagine that a number of us have visited the hospital and have seen for ourselves the commitment of those involved.</p><p>The model has worked. Given that, why would any Government not wish to do for patients across Scotland what is being done for patients in Tayside, Grampian and Fife? This Government, however, positively sizzles at the very presence of the independent sector, as is witnessed elsewhere by its determination to end all contracted-out cleaning, allegedly to improve performance in tackling health care acquired infections, even though the worst example of deaths due to an outbreak of Clostridium difficile occurred at a hospital that had in-house cleaning and, in any event, the reasons for the outbreak were complicated and extensive and the outbreak was certainly not simply the responsibility of the in-house cleaning team.</p><p>We have a Government that has used the independent sector to provide more treatments to <place-holder colnum=\"16210\"/> NHS patients than any other Government and has inherited a pilot that is supported by all of the other parties in the chamber and is proving to be a success.</p><p>We call on the Government to shelve its caustic rhetoric, to recognise the outstanding incremental contribution that the independent sector has made and to set aside its misplaced prejudice against anyone outside of the NHS who might have a contribution to make. We are not asking the Government to set aside for one moment its commitment to the NHS or to the many worthwhile improvements that it has embarked on; we are asking only that it bury its dogma and put the interests of patients first.

It is fair to suggest that such widespread coverage goes beyond what many members of the public assume to be the scope and reach of a pilot. For that reason, it is not enough to be glib about dealing later with general concerns that arise in relation to the pilots. A huge and committed effort will be required by all those who are involved in the pilots to ensure that, as a consequence, local health care is not compromised, but enhanced through greater transparency and accountability.</p><p>We must all wish the pilot areas every success.

The issue is not so much the securing of dedicated parking places as the eligibility to use those places.<place-holder colnum=\"15248\"/></p><p>People who are entitled to use disabled persons parking spaces are registered blue badge drivers, the vast majority of whom benefit from the United Kingdom Motability car purchase scheme. The scheme's history is worth recalling. Most members of a certain age will remember&#8212;perhaps with some affection&#8212;the old rather lurid turquoise three-wheeled Reliant Robin motor vehicle that was made available to severely disabled people to give them essential mobility by car. As a teenager, I probably smirked at those cars as I drove about but, as an employer in my 20s, I most certainly did not smirk, because I had an employee for whom the car was a lifeline. [<em>Interruption.</em>] That might be my phone. The car gave him an opportunity to participate in the world of work and to engage. I recognised what an important aspect of his life that car became.</p><p>However, to be frank, the Robin outlived its usefulness, although its users treasured it to the end. It was determined during the tenure of a Conservative Government that, rather than create a replacement vehicle, a scheme should apply general discounts to and waive VAT on whatever motor vehicles manufacturers wished to make available through the scheme. Initially&#8212;and on the basis that those who were awarded and persevered with the Reliant Robin had shown a determined need&#8212;demand for the product remained stable. In the early days, most of the cars that we supplied under the scheme were entry-level models&#8212;the Ford Escort Popular was the most in demand.</p><p>It is crucial to note that a significant number of the vehicles that initially were supplied were adapted to reflect the driver's physical disability. However, something happened after then. Demand exploded as those who were eligible for the benefit but who had not fancied a Reliant Robin&#8212;many had been able to purchase an alternative&#8212;discovered that the benefit applied to any make or model of vehicle, subject to the manufacturer making it available under the scheme. At one point in the 1990s, before substantial European Union enlargement, and as a direct result of the substantial taxpayer-funded subsidy, the scheme had grown to the point that more people were registered on the UK Motability disabled driver scheme than were registered as disabled drivers in all the other EU countries put together. Perhaps that addresses in part the point that Margo MacDonald made.</p><p>Moreover, less than 2 per cent of the vehicles supplied were adapted in any way whatever. I am not suggesting that only people with a physical disability should be eligible for the Motability scheme, but it is right to ask why the figure for adaptations has gone from a substantial number to less than 2 per cent. When I left the industry, 10 per cent of the UK market&#8212;200,000 vehicles&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"15249\"/> was being supplied annually under the scheme, subsidised by the taxpayer.

It is a serious matter, because taxpayers are now subsidising not just entry models but Mercedes, Audis and even more luxurious models. I contrast that situation with the injustice that is meted out to those who need an appropriate wheelchair&#8212;an issue that has concerned me since I was elected to the Parliament. By definition, every wheelchair user has a physical disability, so access to an appropriate chair is an even more essential lifeline. Although it is true that some also have access to a motor vehicle, only 2 per cent of cars are adapted. The amount of public money that is spent on wheelchair users is relatively pathetic. I am not making a party-political point, but I point to the contrast between spending on the essential transport and mobility needs of wheelchair users and the huge public subsidy that we provide for motor vehicles.</p><p>I do not wish to take away the incredible liberation and lifeline that is offered to people who rightly enjoy vehicles under the Motability scheme, or to detract from the screaming frustration that they can feel when they try to park and find that spaces have selfishly been blocked by others who are too lazy to park elsewhere. Des McNulty detailed the many and varied examples of that problem and the other difficulties that disabled drivers face. However, there are others who find on-street parking difficult but are not entitled to use reserved spaces. Ian McKee touched on the situation of elderly drivers whose joints are not as flexible as they once were and who appreciate the opportunity to park in end bays, as they find it difficult to negotiate the dimensions of mid-row parking bays. Some get blue badges, but others do not actively think of doing so and give up driving, because they think that it will be too difficult. Ian McKee reflected the sentiments of many of those people. Michael McMahon reflected <place-holder colnum=\"15250\"/> the sentiments of many people who feel that, even though they have a disability, spaces should be reserved for other people to use.</p><p>David McLetchie dealt in detail with the substantive concerns that we and others have expressed about the continued uncertainty about the funding that will be necessary to implement the bill.

Although that is regrettable, we will not allow it to prevent us from lending our support to the bill at decision time. This is an important bill that will make the lives of many people better.

I pay tribute to the splendid leadership of the convener and his colleagues. It was with studied relish that Mr Aitken acknowledged the cabinet secretary's endorsement of the report's recommendations.</p><p>For me, this afternoon brings the added pleasure of straying from my health brief. I last participated in a justice debate some time earlier in the session and it is appropriate, in a debate on community policing, to acknowledge my astonishment at the absence of a central plank from the Government's contribution today. Back in that earlier debate, a new word entered the lexicon of parliamentary life. It was a word around which the whole measure of Government policy was to be based. It was a word over which both the cabinet secretary and Mr Ewing salivated, yet it is gone, disappeared from public life. I refer, of course, to \"equivalents\"&#8212;that mighty division of illusory police officers who were to substitute for the real thing.</p><p>I recall being chastised by Mr Ewing in that earlier debate for allegedly deploying dodgy car-selling techniques from my previous occupation to justify the need to fund an additional 1,000 police officers. Yet, under the weight of the argument and the spirited, decisive force of Conservative pressure, Mr Ewing and the Government performed a spectacular U-turn. Equivalents were abandoned and Scotland was promised the 1,000 officers it needed, which should now be&#8212;and are being&#8212;realised.</p><p>The moral of the story is that Mr Ewing has harboured ambitions to be a car salesman himself. For, in the end, he promised Scotland what he then called dodgy car sales financials. Will he and the cabinet secretary deliver? This cannot and must not become another pledge unfulfilled. At the heart of effective community policing are police officers in the community. I assure Mr Ewing that, were the Government to slacken and such a career move to prove necessary for him at some future date, with my experience of the motor industry to hand I could put in a good word for him and attest without reservation that here is a man who possesses such qualities that no used car&#8212;however soiled or dodgy&#8212;would ever be left unsold by him.</p><p>The Government must fulfil its commitment. It is no good waffling on about the challenge that such a commitment presents. Governments are elected and ministers are appointed to successfully overcome the challenges with which they are <place-holder colnum=\"15172\"/> presented. If they cannot do that, they go&#8212;that is the remedy.</p><p>I congratulate the cabinet secretary on what has to be the most charming and consensual contribution that I have heard him make to date. So out of character was his manner that I began to wonder whether his tongue was firmly in his cheek. Indeed, when I heard him use the word \"twee\" I almost believed that I was hearing the fulfilment of a lifetime's ambition, as tweeness is most certainly not a sentiment with which I would generally associate the cabinet secretary. I do not want to be uncharitable, however, so I welcome the cabinet secretary's comments at face value and look forward to the same charm and energy being deployed as he seeks to drive forward the recommendations.</p><p>Robert Brown gave us a history lesson that covered ground familiar to those of us who watched Channel 4's recent drama series on Henry Fielding's early attempts to establish a London police force. I was slightly struck by Mr Brown's bizarre notion that police officers were somehow magnificently transferred into cars under the previous Conservative Government. I think that he was confused and was actually paying tribute to the rapid expansion of new technology under that previous Conservative Government. In any event, \"Z Cars\" was a creation of the 1960s, not the 1990s.</p><p>More soberly, Andrew Welsh made a notable and passionate speech that detailed much of the public concern that provides the context for this community policing report.</p><p>Against the context of a properly resourced police force, Scottish Conservatives accept the additional contribution of an incremental network of community wardens. They have a role, and John Lamont reminded us of the contribution that he has seen them make in the Borders. We agree with the Government that the resource can be further enhanced by ensuring the productive use of officers' time by absolving them of needless paperwork requirements. That is not to be too prescriptive. The conclusion of the committee that there would be limited benefit in providing a strict definition of community policing is one with which we concur, and we accept the belief that flexibility is key. Bill Aitken and Stuart McMillan both talked about that.</p><p>The report's conclusions include a detailing of community policing principles that is a roster of common sense, if I may say so. The conclusions on scrutiny, terminology, tenure and the need to make community policing professionally rewarding to officers, which was highlighted by Michael Matheson, all enjoy our support.<place-holder colnum=\"15173\"/></p><p>We note the strategy of Strathclyde Police regarding abstractions and wish it well&#8212;I note, however, the cautionary, practical point that Paul Martin made. We applaud the commitment of Strathclyde Police to providing a training course that will be tailored to community policing, the importance of which was touched on by James Kelly.</p><p>We have recognised the crucial role that successful community engagement will play, and the desirability of ensuring the sharing of best practice as well as evaluating outcomes, and we urge the Government to ensure that others, in addition to the police forces, consider that.</p><p>Now that all is said and done&#8212;the committee report endorsed, welcomed and so on&#8212;I return to the glue that will hold it together: a properly resourced police force within which are the 1,000 additional police officers that were promised and conceded at our instigation. There can be no substitute; there must be no return of equivalence. A successful community police force will stand or fall on that commitment being fulfilled and I invite the minister to reaffirm, without qualification, that it will be.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14734068", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Policing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As might have been anticipated, this has been a constructive debate on a substantial and measured committee report, the conclusions of which&#8212;as my colleague, John Lamont, has confirmed&#8212;we are happy to endorse.

There are certain things that we expect people to have and which we take for granted they will have.</p><p>For her third operation, the woman chose to use the independent sector. The point that surprised me and her was that she was asked to go to hospital in advance of the operation because she was told that, having been treated in the NHS, there was a presumption that she would carry MRSA and they needed to establish whether that was the case. That is something that ought to give us all considerable cause for concern.</p><p>The Vale of Leven case, if it has done nothing else, has reinforced in the wider public consciousness a concern about health care acquired infection in the NHS that, if allowed to take root and become part of the common currency of people's concerns, will be very damaging to the long-term reputation of the NHS. Decisive action is being taken, but it must be effective.</p><p>I say to Jackie Baillie in particular, if I may, that the political cynic in me, if I can call it that, made me perhaps somewhat sour and ungracious in my initial reaction to the 15-point plan that the Labour Party introduced a few weeks ago.

Colleagues on this side of the chamber told me that that was a threat or a challenge that I ought to take very seriously.

However, I will state for the record what they were.</p><p>I would almost have been better convinced by a plan that had 14 or 19 points. The 15 points led me to think that the plan was somewhat contrived in its construction&#8212;partly because, earlier this week, the leader of the Labour Party had a 15-point plan for the economy, too. I was just slightly anxious about Labour having 15-point plans for everything, but that may have been an unreasonable attitude.</p><p>I also felt that there was no prioritisation in the 15-point plan. It seemed to me that some points had more substance than others and that it would have helped if they had been prioritised.

Our manifesto contained a commitment to support direct elections, but my confidence has been, if not shaken, certainly stirred by a deeper examination of the practicalities and potential consequences.</p><p>When the subject was first raised, I wondered about directly elected members' ability to participate meaningfully in the detailed discussion of many substantive health issues. A feature of boards has been the widespread public perception that lay members have often felt obliged to defer to clinical or professional managerial experience, which is passionately represented, because lay members lack alternative advice or experience or the confidence to go out on a limb and oppose others' wishes. The cabinet secretary imaginatively addressed the potential consequences of that situation at the extreme by establishing her independent scrutiny process, which allowed her to refer a decision by an appointed health board to independent scrutiny. As we all know, that was crucial in vindicating those who fought long and hard against proposed A and E closures.</p><p>In similar circumstances, how acceptable would such a referral be if the decisions were made by a health board the majority of whose members were directly elected? Surely that would make a referral <place-holder colnum=\"14039\"/> more politically difficult and questionable. We need to be assured that all directly elected members, who might well&#8212;although not necessarily&#8212;possess less working knowledge than appointed members, will have access to independent advice and support. That might be easier said than done, but if we are not satisfied of that, we could make dealing with issues that are of enormous public concern more difficult than at present.</p><p>Members have referred to the practicalities of standing for election, which reminds me of the arguments about establishing the Parliament. Some hoped that the Parliament would not be organised on party lines and that it would be a Parliament of all the talents. We have a distinguished independent member and other independent members have been elected, but the reality is that the requirement for the apparatus to mount and sustain a campaign leads inevitably to the involvement of political parties. It is therefore difficult to argue with certainty that in larger health boards at least, the practicalities of mounting an effective campaign would not be insurmountable for individuals, so we might end up with party-politicised health boards. That would be unhelpful. Heaven forfend that politically ambitious elected health board members should showboat in a dry run for political advancement and posture for political expedience rather than act in the NHS's best interests. We need more evidence on how genuinely independent candidates are expected to manage an effective campaign and on how they are to manage the geography of a health board area as they represent the community in it&#8212;Mary Scanlon mentioned that.</p><p>How engaged the public will be is suspect on the basis of international evidence. Ian McKee quoted the figures from New Zealand, which showed a lack of engagement in local elections and health board elections, from which we cannot take comfort.</p><p>The British Medical Association made the practical point that an older person&#8212;perhaps one who suffers from cancer&#8212;could be appointed as a board member, but that such a person would be unlikely to stand for election. Direct elections could mean that some demographics would not be represented on boards, because of the age of people who felt able to participate in elections.</p><p>The proposal that the cabinet secretary should be able to dismiss elected members is curious&#8212;Bill Butler and others touched on that. I appreciate that she can dismiss appointed members&#8212;that is not peculiar&#8212;and that since a minority of members will still be appointed, all must be treated equally. However, the principle is somewhat curious.</p><p>On balance, we support the principle of having pilots.

The motion acknowledges the suffering, about which we have heard testimony, and recognises and welcomes the role that Scotland can play in adding to the international humanitarian relief, even though responsibility for international representation rests with the Government at Westminster.</p><p>The Parliament has a direct responsibility for the public in Scotland. The actions of the Government of Israel are the responsibility of that Government and not of the Jewish population here in Scotland. I therefore express my dismay that the heightened language of some is being used to justify remarks by others, publicly published, that can be described only as dangerously anti-Semitic. We have a duty to choose our words carefully, as do the press in their columns. For example, it was questionable for <em>The Herald </em>to publish remarks <place-holder colnum=\"13801\"/> from a well-known contributor that included veiled threats to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the state of Israel and Jews all over the world.\"</p><p>Two and a half years ago, during the events that culminated in the withdrawal of Israel from Gaza, similar language and lack of editorial control in <em>The Herald </em>and <em>The Scotsman</em>, particularly on their websites, led to an unprecedented level of hostility to the Scottish Jewish community, the vast majority of whom live in Glasgow and the west of Scotland. Many talked of feeling intimidated, for the first time in their lives, when walking the streets and they were appalled by a disgraceful attack on the Jewish cemetery in Glasgow. In the past 24 hours, senior members of the Jewish community have reported to me an increase in nuisance calls to Jewish&#8212;not Israeli&#8212;organisations and the distribution of hate mail to the community. I have a copy of one piece of such mail, which is chilling and as fundamentally unacceptable as are attacks on the integrity of the Muslim population in Scotland, or fear and suspicion of that population, in response to domestic terrorism.</p><p>In this month, when we commemorate the millions of lives that were lost in the Holocaust, we must remember that paying lip service to that commemoration is not enough. The debt that is owed to the international Jewish community was recognised in the establishment of the Israeli state. It has a right to exist and to defend itself. However unwelcome the observation is today, the fact is that, ever since the withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas has continued to pepper Israel with rocket attacks. Those attacks are now being complemented with the use of longer-range successor rockets, the reach of which places nearly a million Israeli citizens at very real risk. It is the duty of their Government to defend them.</p><p>Some people have raised exaggerated expectations for President-elect Obama. He has been reluctant to become involved in the debate ahead of his inauguration, but he has previously commented thus:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that. And I would expect Israelis to do the same thing\".</p><p>I applaud that comment. There is not much difference between Obama's reaction and that of the Bush Administration.</p><p>This is not a time to speak against a cease-fire&#8212;far from it. The Israeli objectives&#8212;to destroy the weapons supply tunnels that are tolerated by her neighbour and effectively to emasculate the Hamas military potential&#8212;need to be secured promptly, as much to prevent the escalation that the rockets that were launched a few hours ago <place-holder colnum=\"13802\"/> from Lebanon might presage as for any other reason. However, the cease-fire must be a cease-fire on all sides. Therein lies the difficulty, for unlike the Irish Republican Army, which, in the talks on and resolution of the conflict in our country, accepted that an armed solution had no future, Hamas has no such compunction. There is no point in Mr O'Donnell ignoring that truth, nor for that matter in Christine Grahame quoting Robert Fisk, passionate as he is, as anything other than a highly partisan anti-Jewish correspondent. Any cease-fire cannot be used by Hamas as an interlude to rearm and recommence rocket attacks.</p><p>Hamas is a terrorist organisation that is determined to have an armed struggle and which has set its face against the reason of most others in the region, who have recognised that a negotiated two-state solution is not only the only proper solution, but one that is actually achievable. Meanwhile, the 1.5 million civilians in Gaza are trapped in the most ghastly of situations. Their security and welfare have been ruthlessly exploited by Hamas, which deliberately sites its rocket launchers in schools, mosques and elsewhere where it hopes to hide behind human shields and exploit the consequences.</p><p>The current conflict must end promptly. We must all hope that the Franco-Egyptian initiative achieves that. Thereafter, with fresh moral authority, the incoming US Administration of Barack Obama needs to work with the people, including President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, who are dedicated to securing a positive and lasting peaceful solution. Hamas can participate if it finally accepts the very clear conditions that were set in 2006: to renounce violence, abide by previous agreements, and accept the basic right of the state of Israel to exist.</p><p>Meanwhile, I give every encouragement to people in Scotland who are responding to the humanitarian situation.

What, they would ask, would be the penalty if their wishes were not observed? Would an illegally harvested organ result in the criminal prosecution of the individuals concerned? If not, what would be the hand that held staff&#8212;passionate to save the life of another patient&#8212;back from making an accidental error? Those would be the public's fears, and I do not think that politicians, given the national record, can with any authority say that <place-holder colnum=\"13655\"/> any computer-based system today would guarantee that an individual's opt-out preference would be honoured. I say that with real regret, because George Foulkes spoke passionately to that side of me that is tempted to support the immediate introduction of an opt-out system.</p><p>Members should reflect on the emotions that would be stirred by the frenzied media scandal when the inevitable happened. That could lead to a massive crisis of confidence in the integrity of the NHS. The task force touches on all that, but I suspect that even the task force underestimates the political whirlwind that could follow. As members on all sides will know, seemingly trivial transgressions can trigger extraordinary attention. For that reason, at the moment I share the conclusion that we cannot proceed with an opt-out system today.</p><p>In our previous debate, I expressed my personal reservations about the national kill Jill campaign. From parliamentary written answers that I have seen on the numbers of people registering since the campaign, I think that my reservations had some foundation. I therefore disagree slightly with Nicola Sturgeon when she attests that the campaign has shown the way forward. On the contrary, I would prefer that we financed far fewer big-bang campaigns, and concentrated instead on enhanced direct mail when opportunities present themselves. For example, when the annual electoral roll form is distributed to households, could not a well-presented organ donation registration form be included? There are many other similar opportunities.</p><p>In the previous debate, Ian McKee suggested that a form might accompany passport applications. In fact, it already does. However, passport applications are a 10-year or five-year affair, and we need to accelerate matters faster than that. In any event, I should share with the chamber some reservations on the issue. My family has just renewed my sons' passports. I was rather taken aback when my 14-year-old son received his passport with organ registration material. I am not sure that all children should be approached directly in that way. Children mature in different ways and at different speeds. Some carry anxieties about life and death into their teenage years, and such material can prove unnerving and distressing. I must also observe that the leaflet that came with the new passports was a small one-colour affair and was undistinguished and, frankly, unimpressive.</p><p>Far better that national advertising and marketing budgets be concentrated and co-ordinated to ensure that high-quality material is produced&#8212;intended to reach individuals at least once a year&#8212;on a sustained basis, than that they produce inadequate and slapdash day-to-day <place-holder colnum=\"13656\"/> material supported by the odd big splash on the telly. I do not know whether Chris Hoy is a registered donor, but some such nationally respected iconic figure should front an individually pitched direct-mail appeal. The challenge is not just to persuade the people, but to get the people to act on their convictions.</p><p>As we go about implementing the vital recommendations of the first report of the organ donation task force&#8212;a report embraced by the Government and supported in this chamber&#8212;we must do more to increase voluntary registration in the wake of the second report. It may be that, in five years, public confidence in Government-run computer systems will have been transformed&#8212;I hope so. However, for now, the challenge year on year is for us to be able to demonstrate that we have acted in a concerted and nationally led way to raise substantially the number of volunteer donors and the number of transplants performed.

At the top of the list of reasons why Labour was kicked unceremoniously out of office in Scotland last year was its contempt for the public mood on health. Labour championed the real health cuts&#8212;cuts in accident and emergency health services throughout Scotland&#8212;and the Government, with Conservative support, reversed even more damaging accident and emergency closures that were planned in Ayr and Monklands. When in government, Labour planned regressive cuts in the net take-home pay of nurses and health service workers through the <place-holder colnum=\"12358\"/> introduction of its hospital car-parking tax, which, to paraphrase, was a tax under which even a consultant married to a duke paid the same as a nurse married to a binman. Annually, that tax was to be greater than the net increase in the average health worker's annual wage. The shame of it&#8212;the Labour shame of it. Again, the Government, with Conservative support, has abolished that disgraceful tax.</p><p>Labour is so desperate to find a strategy back from an emerging wilderness that out comes the old scattergun of scare and shame.

I can hear the familiar charge coming, so before Labour members gobble on their spittle, I remind them again of uncomfortable facts. Labour is the only party in history that, when in government, forced through real cuts in the health service. A generation ago, Labour cut nurses' pay by 3 per cent; doctors' pay by 16 per cent; surgeons' pay by 25 per cent; and overall health spending by 3 per cent.</p><p>The Labour chancellor, Scissorhands Darling, chose to change the health baseline for calculating the Barnett consequentials, resulting in a budget to the Scottish Government on health that is about &#163;342 million less than it would otherwise have been. However, Labour has the brass neck to look in our direction when talking of threats to the Barnett formula. In the election last May, the Labour Party pledged that education would come first. The then First Minister said that other departments would have to \"cut their cloth\". I presume that that would have included health. That would have been on top of the efficiency savings that Labour advocated of 3 per cent, not 2 per cent, as we have now.</p><p>The time will come when the SNP Government has to account for its record. It has argued for a disastrous local income tax and has put the continuity of our electricity supplies at risk by dogmatic hostility to nuclear power as part of the future energy mix. However, on health, the cabinet secretary demonstrated in a magisterial performance why she is a shining beacon of hope in comparison with the tawdry arrogance of Scottish Labour. She is held in such regard that she may even rival Governor Sarah Palin in the esteem of Scots. That may seem like faint praise but, truly, it is not intended as such, for it was the Labour Government at Westminster that chose such a damaging basis for the calculation of Scotland's health service budget; a Labour Government in Scotland that proposed and partially implemented devastating cuts to accident and emergency services; and the Scottish Labour Party in government that forfeited the trust of the Scottish people. When the general election <place-holder colnum=\"12359\"/> comes, Labour will get its just deserts. The most liberating cut of all will be the people's cut on the dead weight of the Labour Government at Westminster.</p><p>Labour's motion is shabby, opportunistic and shallow&#8212;indeed, it is contemptible. It is the motion of a small-minded party&#8212;from a front bench grey in spirit and character, led by a man grey in name.

In opening for the Conservatives, Mary Scanlon asked some important questions about where the proposed bill sits in relation to the set of commitments for action in the 2007 SNP manifesto. Is it an amalgam of the two bills that were envisaged? Why, as Mary Scanlon pointed out, is so little or nothing about redress to be asked of so many in such a wide consultation on such a profound measure?</p><p>The consultation invites contributions under a number of headings, all of which have been well aired in the debate. This is as good an opportunity as any to throw in my own tuppenceworth on a matter that is regularly raised with me and of which I have personal experience. I suppose that, <place-holder colnum=\"12117\"/> although trivial, it falls within the respect remit. It is to do with the use of names. So many people tell me, following a stay in hospital, that the instant use of given names rather than plain Mr or Mrs is a ghastly indignity and a characteristic that is shared by the NHS and pushy, unsolicited telephone salespeople.</p><p>Why has the convention become established? Why, when many people instinctively feel that the use of their given name is based on a shared confidence, affection or acquaintance, are their wishes assumed or cast aside? Why should they lose control of this basic dignity as though they were back in primary 1, being told that what will be will be&#8212;or is that the point? Does the unauthorised use of given names emphasise the institutional nature of the establishment to which they have been admitted?</p><p>I know from experience that the practice is haphazard because the correct given name is rarely sought. Although I have been called Jackson from birth and that has always been my given name, my first name is actually David. I continue to use it on all official documents and it is a comfort to know that, when an individual assures my mother, friends or colleagues that they are David's personal friend and confidante, that person is clearly up to no good. However, it is as David that I have been known when in the bosom of the NHS during my admissions to general wards in the past decade. As it happens, I would gladly have volunteered to be called Jackson, because I am not bothered about being called Mr Carlaw, but I was not asked, so in a small anarchic way I let it be and was called David throughout my stay.</p><p>However, the approach can add to the trauma of others, particularly the elderly, many of whom find themselves in the same position as me, being called by their first name rather than their given name. An elderly friend, who is now deceased, was called Joan all her life, but she suddenly found herself being called Florence at a confused stage of her life when she was admitted to hospital, as if all the world called her that all her days. In another case, I was told that, as the only name on the file was the person's first name and it did not mention their given name, that was how they would be addressed.</p><p>The modern convention of assumed familiarity is certainly prevalent, but it is not necessarily dignified. It might be profoundly important to an individual according to how they define respect. Should the approach be defined in law? Hardly.</p><p>Mary Scanlon mentioned the Conservatives' patients charter of 1991 and others mentioned the Labour Government's 1998 follow-up to that. Those charters did not establish rights and responsibilities within a legal framework. Although <place-holder colnum=\"12118\"/> the consultation's constant theme is the detailing of patients' rights, accompanying that are stated patients' responsibilities.</p><p>Under \"Access\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for:</p><p><ul> <li> attending agreed appointments.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>Under \"Respect\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for:</p><p><ul> <li> treating staff with dignity and respect; and </li> <li> not physically or verbally abusing staff.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>Under \"Safety\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for:</p><p><ul> <li> complying with advice on medication and treatment; and </li> <li> raising legitimate concerns about the safety of their care.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>Under \"Communication\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for:</p><p><ul> <li> providing information about their history, current treatment medication and alternative therapies directly or through their family, carer or other nominated supporter; </li> <li> informing their healthcare provider of any changes in their condition; and </li> <li> taking part actively and constructively in discussion and decisions about their health and health care.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>Under \"Information\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for:</p><p><ul> <li> seeking and using information appropriately to support their own health, for example to enable self-care for minor conditions; and </li> <li> ensuring that they have the information to understand what they need to know about their care, and to provide consent to treatment.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>Under \"Participation\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for</p><p><ul> <li> asking for further information if there is any uncertainty about their care; </li> <li> giving informed consent or not; and </li> <li> participating constructively in decisions about healthcare and service where they wish to do so.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>Under \"Privacy\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for:</p><p><ul> <li> providing the information that is appropriate and relevant to treatment of their condition.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>Under \"Independent Support and Redress\", it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients will be responsible for:<place-holder colnum=\"12119\"/></p><p><ul> <li> offering feedback on their health services in a positive way as far as possible.\" </li> </ul> </p><p>I quoted those responsibilities at length simply to illustrate that, if we strip out the rights, we are left with the most comprehensive and stringent set of patients' responsibilities&#8212;indeed, we are left with a pretty draconian patients' responsibilities bill I have noted regularly in recent debates that the NHS is not an insurance policy in the normal sense. I have talked about leaving the house doors and windows open, being burgled and then finding that the insurance company is not inclined to pay. I have noted that, in the final analysis, no penalty exists within the NHS, so I suppose that I should welcome the responsibilities, but what do they mean? If a patient does not follow</p><p class=\"indent\">\"advice about ... suggested lifestyle changes\",</p><p>fails to provide \"information about their history\" or is unable to provide knowingly</p><p class=\"indent\">\"information that is appropriate and relevant to treatment of their condition\",</p><p>what will happen? How will that be reconciled with the desire to tackle inequalities? Will the patient be sued by the health board or denied further NHS treatment? Will there be a new sanction in law? That is surely inconceivable, but if there is not, what will be the legal and practical purpose of a bill that seeks to establish legal frameworks? In contrast, the existing charters can be updated without the need for primary legislation.</p><p>I applaud Cathy Jamieson's cogent analysis of the value of legislation with regard to the package of rights&#8212;on which I have not dwelt&#8212;over and above the existing charters. I sat spellbound&#8212;that is the word that I wrote down, anyway&#8212;as Ross Finnie encapsulated those arguments as well.</p><p>It is as well that there is a consultation, for there is much to consult about.

My first duty is therefore to serve notice that I am unlikely to avail myself of the whole 11 minutes. However, I suspect that my discomfort is as nothing to that which was painfully experienced by Bruce Crawford just a moment ago. I commend him on his unexpected masterclass on the techniques and talents that are required to give classic spin its head.</p><p>I will start by beginning at the end. Almost the first consideration of members in this third session of the Scottish Parliament was to secure the support of all parties and a willing Scottish Government to ensure that the only drugs that are available&#8212;or that are likely to be available&#8212;to <place-holder colnum=\"12015\"/> alleviate in any way the suffering of people who are afflicted with the terminal asbestos-related condition mesothelioma continued to be available, whatever the deliberations of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence elsewhere. That objective was clear-cut and was, without doubt, an early example to me of how parties working together in the Scottish Parliament can act decisively, and the objective was achieved. That came after the extraordinary partnership in previous parliamentary sessions, in which I was not a participant, and which again drew support from all sides of the chamber, leading to the earlier legislation, the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Act 2007.</p><p>What goes around comes around, for it seems that our business in this matter is never quite concluded. Following the decision of the House of Lords in October last year, this Parliament was rightly afforded the opportunity&#8212;in a members' business debate that was secured by Stuart McMillan&#8212;to discuss the implications that, although they might not be binding in Scotland, are nonetheless persuasive, with the seemingly inevitable consequences already resulting. That earlier debate gave voice to our indignation at the consequential injustices that arose from the ruling.</p><p>What was again striking on that occasion was the cross-party&#8212;indeed all-party&#8212;dismay at the course of events. It is worth re-reading the many speeches in that specially extended debate. They are a testament to the acute suffering of individuals, to the frustration that many have felt in the face of obduracy, and to the unswerving commitment of organisations such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos and individuals in the community and this Parliament since 1999 and before then. I, too, join the minister in welcoming interested representatives to the chamber today. Not one speech in that debate was made without obvious feeling. I expect that several members who spoke then will also do so today. It might reasonably be observed on second reading that, in the wake of the perceived shenanigans at that point, passions were naturally aroused. That is the case not least because of the many examples&#8212;to which members can bear witness&#8212;of impacts on the lives of too many families of the painful suffering and death of those who have been unfortunate enough to endure mesothelioma, the seemingly random nature of its development and the understandable anxiety that is caused in anyone who is diagnosed as having pleural plaques.</p><p>I was struck by Gil Paterson's reflection in that previous debate on his experiences as an employer in the Scottish retail motor industry. Such was my experience in a Glasgow-based family concern that was established in the early 1920s and which operated for 80 years thereafter <place-holder colnum=\"12016\"/> in the burgeoning motor industry, from the earliest Ford products, through the war effort, to the development of the heaviest of commercial vehicles and on to the explosion of the individual retail market.</p><p>On a previous occasion some time ago, the minister referred to my \"car-selling days\". In truth, the industry is far more multifaceted than that: we sold motor products of all shapes, sizes and applications. We supplied parts, routinely serviced cars, vans and trucks and we repaired badly damaged products. We took care and pride in the welfare of our employees and we acted on the best practice and advice. However, by trading continuously on a site that was established in the early 1920s, time proved that the industrial knowledge of those early days was ignorant of many things that were learned later; for example, lead in petrol, the dangers of prolonged exposure to fumes and the asbestos time bomb.</p><p>However, like Gil Paterson, whatever efforts we made as employers were underpinned by comprehensive insurance to ensure that any unforeseen injuries that occurred saw the needs of our people properly met whenever that proved to be necessary. We certainly did not expect our insurers to abdicate their responsibility or, worse still, having met claims in a fashion or by some precedent for many years, to then set that practice aside in a bloodier and less honourable age. What particularly irked me in our earlier debate was the seeming eye to a chance of the Johnston v NEI International Combustion Ltd case and the judgment that brought to an end established grounds for compensatory claims.</p><p>That is not to ignore the technical concern about some overprecedents that the bill might set. However, neither would it have been appropriate to allow those concerns to have derailed its progress and, in any event, addressed as they are, we agree with the general principles of the bill. In the amendment that I will move, we provide Parliament with the opportunity to give voice, if the amendment is agreed to, to the concerns that the Justice Committee noted about the financial memorandum.</p><p>What we seek to achieve with our amendment is reasonable but crucial; simply put, it is the securing by this Parliament of the widest and best-informed judgments and estimates as to what the financial consequences of the bill might prove to be.</p><p>Mr Swinney is not known for being louche with his cash, or rather with the Government's cash&#8212;or, quite possibly, with both. I am not sure whether Fergus Ewing is equally tight. However, it seems reasonable for the Parliament to avoid standing accused of producing damning, wild and self-serving estimates without having to hand&#8212;subject <place-holder colnum=\"12017\"/> to the considerable difficulties involved&#8212;the best possible estimates of our own.</p><p>For the moment, the Justice Committee appears to believe that the more likely costs rest somewhere in between the hyperbole of some representations that were made to the committee by the insurance industry, the even greater speculation in some media and the smaller Government calculation.</p><p>Given that Westminster is not cracking a whip of its own to take a principled stand, it is surely appropriate to pursue the committee's view that the potential cost to the Scottish consolidated fund should be clear, and to establish whether UK departments might be inclined to invoke the statement of funding policy, which is the explicit requirement to fund any costs arising to UK departments from Scotland-only legislation. I anticipate that that will be amply demonstrated by Bill Aitken when he talks about the Justice Committee's report. As he will illustrate, many of the workplaces where exposure to asbestos was prevalent were in the public sector. Potential consequential claims on them following the passage of the bill cannot be based on wishful thinking. I welcome the minister's measured acceptance and recognition of that possibility and his willingness to discuss matters reasonably and as widely as possible.</p><p>It is arguable that, by creating a clearly defined legal right to compensation, rather than using custom and practice, the legislation might in all probability lead to an increase in the numbers that are diagnosed and a further increase in the number of compensatory claims. Both the process of diagnosis and a potential subsequent claim will have an incremental cost attached. Surely we must not allow ourselves to be in ignorance of the best possible evidence on these matters prior to stage 3. If we are to match our moral ambition&#8212;as is, I believe, our collective intent&#8212;with our duty to act responsibly, we should understand properly the likely costs. I welcome the minister's willingness to do so.</p><p>I turn now not to technicalities but to the issue at hand. Others will no doubt set out the medical facts of the condition of pleural plaques. I will confine myself to acknowledging that they are asymptomatic in character. Having pleural plaques is not a guarantee that one will develop asbestosis or mesothelioma, but it is a prerequisite and, as the minister stated, it increases the chances of that by 1,000 times. As such, those who are identified as having pleural plaques will inevitably be anxious in the face of the certainty of a grim prognosis should either condition follow.</p><p>I welcome the recognition that the hopefully unique circumstances surrounding pleural plaques will be properly restricted in the bill. We can <place-holder colnum=\"12018\"/> therefore accept that this exceptional bill is not a fresh precedent to be exploited. That treads on legal complexities that others will, I imagine, discuss with more authority, but the restriction sets aside the one potential objection to our proceeding with the bill.</p><p>Throughout the Parliament there is a determination to act. We can all share that ambition, but we should also all share a collective duty to ensure that all the consequences of the legislation that we might approve are fully understood&#8212;or, at least, that we understand them to the best of our ability. I call on the Scottish Government to ensure that that is so and I invite the Parliament to support the amendment in my name.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-2796.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"but, in so doing, notes the terms of the Justice Committee's Stage 1 report, in particular the concerns expressed with regard to the Financial Memorandum, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide the Parliament with a more detailed analysis of the likely cost implications, from such information as is available to or can be obtained by the Scottish Government, prior to the Bill being considered at Stage 3.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14206682", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am in some consternation, Presiding Officer, having received just before 1.30 a call&#8212;which, on any other day, would have been welcomed whole-heartedly&#8212;to advise me that I would have 11 minutes to speak in the debate, which dreaded fact you have just confirmed.

I congratulate Michael McMahon on his perspicacity and genius&#8212;possibly not a tribute that regularly comes his way from a Scottish Conservative&#8212;in identifying a nuance around which to frame an amendment. Lewis Macdonald spoke to the subject with great verve and passion. It is undeniably true that the Administration rarely passes up a chance to display peacock plumage, although it would be churlish not to lend the Labour Party our support, if only to add real blood and excitement to this afternoon's exchanges. Lewis Macdonald made his point on the self-aggrandisement of the Government most effectively, particularly with the picture that he cast of Scottish ministers elbowing their way up the table to seize the chair and then expecting us to endorse them in their desire to lead on particular aspects of energy.</p><p>Many members, by way of filling in the available hours this afternoon, recalled recent history between Ireland and Britain. It is indeed remarkable to our generation that, in the early years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, such a forum as the British-Irish Council should exist at all. That it should meet harmoniously and without controversy is certainly worthy of note, if not comment, let alone debate. Its very ordinariness and normalcy should surely be celebrated by regarding the council as an everyday matter, not a thing of wonder. I happily join members who have welcomed the fact that we have begun the new century by putting firmly behind us the mutual suspicions and antagonisms that coloured almost all of our joint history during the last, and that we have done so quite suddenly.</p><p>As a Conservative youth leader as recently as during the days of the blessed Margaret, I recall receiving an anonymous and rather intimidating note through the post making it clear that I would not be welcome in either the province or the republic&#8212;at least, I have always assumed that that was because of my being a Conservative youth leader, not in spite of it. Those days are gone, however, and links have flourished, as we always hoped they would. Such a turnaround demonstrates, just as the ending of apartheid in South Africa did, that breakthroughs can be achieved, however intractable and historic the diplomatic challenge. I would not be surprised to learn that Ken Macintosh and Jamie Hepburn are even now seeking to establish a council to resolve charity football disputes.</p><p>Given the history of the past century, it is extraordinary that the legacy of the Thatcher, Major and&#8212;without question&#8212;Blair Governments and their Irish counterparts is that lesser mortals <place-holder colnum=\"11818\"/> are able to gather and blether on matters of mutual interest without the public consciousness being unduly bothered.</p><p>Any diffidence on my part is about the debate, not the institution. We have allocated an afternoon to this matter, but it is interesting that other members of the council have made do with a written or oral statement&#8212;indeed, Westminster has made do with nothing at all. I listened with interest to Mr Swinney, who can usually be relied on to conjure up magic and interest on the most unlikely subjects, but he thrived only when he became involved in the customary exchanges with Lord Foulkes. Mr Swinney confirmed the impression that the British-Irish Council is a sound institution that should be the subject of a workmanlike business agenda and hard, useful, but probably more often than not thankless effort.</p><p>My colleague Ted Brocklebank gave a concise lesson on the history that underpins the potential long-term advantage of the British-Irish Council and talked about economic and tourism relationships, which are of far greater relative importance than many people imagine. Jamie Stone reflected on the wonder of the daily relationships between the UK and Ireland, drawing on a relevant personal experience. I congratulate Aileen Campbell, who was the first member to speak to the debate's subject. She described the importance of dialogue and the challenges that changing demographics present.</p><p>I simultaneously agreed with and was at odds with Hugh Henry. I agreed with almost all of what he said, but it struck me that his and many other speeches belonged to a debate to welcome the changes in Ireland since the Good Friday agreement rather than to a debate on the detail of last month's British-Irish Council meeting. A debate on the former subject would have been worth while; I query the need to devote an afternoon to the latter. When the Deputy Presiding Officer was in the chair he regularly questioned whether we were straying far from the issue in hand.</p><p>David Whitton brought us back to the subject with an interesting speech about work on social inclusion. David McLetchie spoke effectively on the working partnerships between this Parliament and other institutions. Keith Brown referred to Lady Thatcher&#8212;who, of course, led him personally to victory in the Falklands conflict in an act of leadership for which he and the country will be eternally grateful&#8212;by way of an attack on the members who support the amendment, whom he accused of being divisive. That was an example of the pot calling the kettle black. As many members were at pains to point out, the nature of the Government's motion begat the amendment, not the other way round. However, that was nothing <place-holder colnum=\"11819\"/> compared with members' astonishment at Mr Brown's apparent willingness to see many Scottish savers' money lost in Iceland, given his ill-judged attack on the UK Government's efforts to assure those savings.</p><p>We must all be encouraged that the British-Irish Council is flourishing. Through discussion, significant co-operation has been achieved and the model will undoubtedly lead to material progress. We support the forum and the Scottish Government's enthusiastic engagement with it, subject to the Government's always acting within the limits of its devolved powers and appreciating its collective responsibility as part of the United Kingdom.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14183763", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: British-Irish Council"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What a thrilling afternoon it has been.

Seven months ago, the issue was the human rights of wheelchair users. I was delighted to participate in that debate, which left me committed to the issues that were raised in it. Today, on the back of a series of carefully worded parliamentary written questions that have teased out information that has illustrated the comparative enormity of the issue, Trish Godman has secured a debate on thrombosis. I congratulate her on that.</p><p>At the heart of the matter is the tragedy of one family in Trish Godman's constituency and the perseverance of Gordon McPherson, to whose efforts Annabel Goldie paid tribute when she raised the issue directly with the First Minister at First Minister's questions on 5 June.</p><p>As the terms of the motion illustrate, thrombosis is a huge reaper of lives. Because it is a sudden and silent killer, it is routinely identified as the cause of death after the event and, as a result, has not received the widespread public attention that it deserves. It is certainly true that for a time the media became excited about the possibility of fatal DVT developing on long-haul flights. As they competed to be more lurid, the news media gave the issue its 15 minutes of fame, but they have now moved on, even if sudden and unexplained deaths on flights might still make the news.</p><p>As the motion effectively illustrates, the issue has so far had none of the attendant public demand for action that issues that have taken fewer lives have attracted. That is not an argument against tackling MRSA and Clostridium difficile&#8212;far from it&#8212;nor is it an attempt to diminish in any way the lives that are lost through breast cancer, <place-holder colnum=\"11372\"/> from which my sister-in-law is suffering, or as a result of HIV/AIDS or land transport accidents, which as Trish Godman established in a parallel question in May, kill only a fraction of the number of people who are lost to thrombosis.</p><p>The figures confirm that, whether through well-organised support networks or sustained and prominent media attention, other conditions and potential killer situations receive much more prominence and attention than thrombosis does. That does not happen at the expense of thrombosis, but there is an obliviousness to the condition. In other debates, I have argued that men's health issues have similarly received less attention in the absence of the well-organised and proactive campaigns that have been conducted on behalf of women's health issues. I make no complaint against those who have done such progressive work on behalf of women; I merely observe that the absence of an overtly organised campaign seems to leave progress in the treatment of certain conditions out in the cold.</p><p>That situation needs to change, and I commend Trish Godman, Nanette Milne, Jackie Baillie and Annabel Goldie who, with well-chosen parliamentary questions, have in recent months all sought to prepare the ground for what I think we all recognise is needed&#8212;a structured national awareness campaign and a developing debate on the possibility of the provision of a screening programme and comprehensive treatment.</p><p>Ahead of this evening's debate, Trish Godman asked MSPs to revert to the GP's surgery that they might have visited during the summer recess, and she did so again tonight. She wanted us to find out whether the public information leaflet that was produced in memory of Katie McPherson was on display and whether we had noticed it on our visits. The response to the second part of that request is that the leaflet was not noticeable in my GP's surgery, if it was on view. I have not yet had a response about whether it was on view, so I might have to sneak back and look for myself.</p><p>The leaflet sets out the various at-risk categories. The list is not short&#8212;it includes far more people than just those who go on long-haul flights. It includes categories of people, such as those who are obese, who are at risk of a number of potentially fatal conditions and who are targeted by more than one information campaign. It is a good leaflet that sets out the facts and does not shy away from explaining complicated matters; it is certainly helpful and to be commended. Everyone who worked hard to produce it and have it displayed deserves our thanks. However, the leaflet in itself is probably not sufficient to sustain a national effort to improve awareness.</p><p>Those who are at risk can take certain sensible actions, some of which were mentioned by Ian <place-holder colnum=\"11373\"/> McKee: smoking cessation, cutting down on salt, having a balanced diet with less fat, eating more fruit, exercising and drinking less alcohol. We have heard them before and are familiar with the list. Around one in 20 people carries the thromophilia gene and about 3,000 of those who die of thrombosis do so of DVT. That group's susceptibility could be established through a screening programme.</p><p>We have talked about screening programmes before, and I know that the response of all Governments will be that they act on advice. Screening has been rolled out before, but it will be subject to review again. From experience, I am certain that, in this campaign, public awareness and demand will play a part in bringing about screening. However, I suspect that it will not happen soon.</p><p>For the moment, despite our knowledge about the reach of thrombosis, we must contemplate having a long-term campaign with key milestone objectives. Screening for those with the thromophilia gene will be a longer-term goal. However, building on the work of the McPherson family and ensuring that general practitioners give greater prominence to thrombosis to aid a general increase in public awareness should be an immediate priority. Resolving to ensure that those who need it receive good and detailed advice should also be a priority. When the minister sums up, we want to hear how the Government will act to make progress against those objectives.</p><p>Again, Trish Godman has us debating an issue of substance. I suspect that these are the early days of a long campaign, but I wish it well and assure it of my support.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14037961", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Action on Thrombosis"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Once again, Trish Godman has brought to members' business an important and substantial issue.

My speech will principally address co-payments, but I start by saying that the committee has, in setting out the terms of its inquiry and in the clarity of the language that was used, especially in the opening section on defining roles, succeeded in producing a text that will help enormously in informing people who do not deal with such matters regularly, and in mapping a way through the various abridged terms to which Ross Finnie and Ian McKee referred. That section methodically explains a process and reviews it. Although the report accepts that the process can appear relatively complicated, it finds&#8212;as the cabinet secretary noted&#8212;that it is working well and has key strengths.</p><p>Debates about the running and future of the national health service can all too easily become tribal in character in the reality of adversarial <place-holder colnum=\"11346\"/> politics. The Labour Party, which in government founded the NHS, sometimes stands accused of being prepared to ignore or be too sympathetic to any faults within it, while in turn this side is accused of seeking to identify those problems only in pursuit of some ephemeral agenda to privatise the service. Analysis and debate of important arguments often fall at that first hurdle.</p><p>It is, therefore, to the credit of the Public Petitions Committee that it has been measured in addressing an issue that has created such a sense of unease. It is clear, from the many organised submissions that have been received ahead of the debate, that that unease is deeply challenging. Events and developments in science are producing potentially life-saving treatments, but access to some of them appears to be outwith the NHS and they are not universally available. One can almost touch the very real concern that that creates. Given that it is a matter of life itself, none of the submissions is prepared to say no. However, the issue of co-payments or top-ups invites politicians to stray from the universal principles of the NHS. In her statement the cabinet secretary sought, in careful and appropriate, yet simple and impassioned language, to establish a potential route forward.</p><p>The report deals with the issues of availability dispassionately. It makes sensible points about the different approaches of health boards, illustrating that differences in the availability of treatments can often be reasonably explained by geography. What might be appropriate in an urban area with immediate access to a hospital may not be appropriate in a rural area, where the treatment may be quite different. However, that is for reasons of practicality, not reasons of cost.</p><p>On the other hand, concerns persist about there being a lottery. Last Wednesday, the BBC aired a programme that examined the availability of five top cancer drugs across the United Kingdom. All were relatively expensive and, at the time of the survey, none had the approval of the guidance bodies. The results showed huge variation of availability in the NHS and, despite the earlier argument about geography, there were many examples of variation between immediately neighbouring communities. All the treatments are refused in London, while all are funded in the north-west. In Wales, Swansea funded 8 per cent, while Pembrokeshire funded 70 per cent. In Glasgow, all the treatments were refused, while in Northern Ireland all were approved. That disparity is undermining public confidence. I agree with the cabinet secretary that our focus must ensure \"equitable and improving access\" to new drugs.</p><p>However, we must all surely share the anxiety that the protocols of our various systems are now found wanting in an environment in which there is <place-holder colnum=\"11347\"/> such a pace of change. It is not a question of whether someone can jump a place in a queue; it is a challenge to politicians that is more complex, yet basic. Do we have a right, even with a faster approval process and a more generous budget for cancer drugs&#8212;to achieve that will, in itself, be quite a challenge&#8212;to say to people who are literally fighting for their lives that, if they accept treatment from outside the NHS, they will be denied further NHS treatment?</p><p>As other members have, I say that this is a real issue for my family. An immediate family member, a mother of three, is in the later stages of palliative care for a terminal cancer and has had the very best treatment. At no point has it been suggested that a treatment that is available outside the NHS would have made any difference. However, had that been the case, I would have done all that I could to ensure that it was made available to her. As Cathy Jamieson argued, I doubt that others would act differently. I would have been outraged if, in accessing such treatment outside the NHS, she was denied further NHS treatment. That is the human reaction that is shared by all those who have written to me.</p><p>I understand the position that the cabinet secretary outlined regarding the incompatibility of some treatments, which is of real concern. However, it is not understood in the public context of this debate, nor is it the axis around which the debate is growing in the public consciousness. Rightly or wrongly, many people see the issue as one of cost or of dogmatism&#8212;put bluntly, that we should all die together rather than reach for life and that, in trying to live, someone may be cast out thereafter from the NHS. I know that that is simplistic, but the current position is not sustainable: in all the measured words of the many submissions that I have read, and in the report itself, that is understood. I therefore welcome the review that the cabinet secretary is to initiate. If public confidence is to be sustained in the face of complex arguments, the review will need to proceed with some urgency.</p><p>I have concluded that, from today's unsustainable position, however narrow the initial dispensation, the incidence of co-payments or top-ups is likely to grow rather than to diminish. I do not share Ross Finnie's view that it will become more exceptional&#8212;it will not do so while science continues to gather pace and make substantial breakthroughs. I imagine that, in time, it will create its own insurance market, which will be quite distinct from current comprehensive private health care plans. I imagine that co-payment insurance policies will evolve and that premiums for such policies will be minimal by comparison with the comprehensive care model. It would certainly make such an option affordable to millions, rather than a few. I note this in passing not to advocate it <place-holder colnum=\"11348\"/> but because I think that is how the market will eventually respond. We need only consider the experience of countries such as Denmark, where co-payments are allowed. There, specialised insurance cover has evolved and almost a third of the population take advantage of it. I accept that some people will balk at that prospect, but I do not.</p><p>Meanwhile&#8212;even in such an environment, were it to evolve&#8212;we need to be able to respond to new treatments quickly within the NHS. We have campaigned all our lives and in everyone's interests, not just the interests of some, to beat cancer and its cruelty. I appreciate the trenchant way in which Duncan McNeil addressed that point in terms of equality.</p><p>We might face what will be for many a difficult adjustment in policy, but in view of the gravity of the issue, we cannot allow ourselves to dwell on it as if it were some enigmatic puzzle, and neither should we jump to a judgment. It is important that the change is the subject of widespread agreement. The situation is, however, urgent: lives are being lost and will continue to be lost. The cabinet secretary stands ready to adjust policy guidelines within parameters. Let us establish what they are, and proceed.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14037918", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cancer Drug Access"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by adding my thanks to those that have already been offered to the Public Petitions Committee for its report.

I am usually to be found ruminating on the health portfolio but, as a substitute member of the European and External Relations Committee, I am delighted to be summing up for the Conservatives in this debate.</p><p>In doing so, I recognise my own pride in being a unionist. By extension, I take pride in the exceptional role in international development played by the UK, led by the Government of whatever day at Westminster. My party has proposals that it will seek to take forward when in government. Those proposals build on what has gone before and, indeed, on the contribution that the noble Lord Foulkes was very keen to remind us he had made. I say to Lord Foulkes that, although I appreciate that the red leather benches must miss his gentle and tender caress, I am sure that when in government he supported with gusto our joint objective of seeking to increase to 0.7 per cent our contribution to international development as a percentage of gross national income.</p><p>The role of the Scottish Parliament, which was neatly addressed by Michael Matheson, is of necessity complementary and, given its limited scale, the spend that is involved is best used in a focused and targeted way. It is certainly instructive that more than one member with a business background made that very point.</p><p>The previous Administration, which on this matter was led with singular purpose by Jack McConnell, alighted on Malawi&#8212;and with reason and good judgment. As Pauline McNeill made clear, doing so added to the new Parliament's moral authority. I was, from a distance, delighted that the Administration was taking that approach. As it so happens, my wife's late uncle, George Paton, was for many years the dedicated chairman of the governors of the David Livingstone centre in Blantyre, which seeks to promote and celebrate that remarkable man's work, not least in Malawi. I know that George Paton would have been delighted at the amount of Scottish public participation in the life of Malawi and in extending and building on the work of Jim Hume's not-so-distant ancestor in a modern context.</p><p>That illustrates one successful aspect of the Scottish Government's effort. By focusing primarily on Malawi, the Government&#8212;within a relatively short time, it must be noted&#8212;ensured that our association and contribution were widely recognised by the Scottish public. That is of enormous value and, indeed, is not always the case when aid is given. Moreover, the people of Malawi have appreciated this engagement, which <place-holder colnum=\"10893\"/> has genuinely strengthened the links between the two countries.</p><p>Like many members, I have met those who have volunteered their services. The rewards extend in both directions and some fairly useful people believe that their efforts have made a difference. In that respect, I believe that Jack McConnell produced the goods and that, having set out to achieve that wider public engagement, he can be pretty satisfied with the outcome as he contemplates his next challenge.</p><p>The report identifies some of the lessons that have been learned. Obviously, as the Scottish Parliament sought to develop a programme within the reserved margins, lessons were going to have to be learned. The report generously recognises that and makes various practical recommendations that members have alluded to in the debate. Indeed, Malcolm Chisholm opened powerfully with reflections on the widespread public engagement with international development and with some force detailed the report's key recommendations, particularly those with regard to ambitions for a more holistic approach that would build more public awareness of international development and on fair trade. Mr Chisholm also made some powerful points about fair trade to which the minister responded in warm and general terms, although she probably did not address them as directly as the committee might have wished.</p><p>Pauline McNeill asked the pertinent question about the choice of the Indian sub-continent, the case for which, given the committee's views, will need to be substantiated by the Government. Given what I have said, it would be a great pity if we not only failed to engage Scottish public opinion behind a completely new and fresh challenge but diluted awareness of the focus on Malawi and the committee's preference for extending our focus into sub-Saharan Africa. That issue was directly addressed by Jim Hume and by my colleague Ted Brocklebank, who expressed concern at the potential route of future Government thinking. He also drew the chamber's attention to the CPA as an example of a non-hard-cash link that can make a contribution.</p><p>Obviously, I was particularly interested in hearing from Jack McConnell. The thunder and drums of battle leave our respective sides unreconciled&#8212;indeed, they seem to be almost unreconcilable on most, if not all, issues&#8212;but I think that he spoke directly about engagement for people's benefit, which I have touched on, and how that is branching out in many ways. He illustrated what he said with practical examples, as I think most of us could do. The legacy is genuine, and he can be proud of it; I know that he will <place-holder colnum=\"10894\"/> continue to encourage such a legacy, and we should all join him in that task.</p><p>Robin Harper brought to life some of the opportunities that exist, although asking the Government to instruct from the centre undermined the argument, which has succeeded, that persuasion should be used.

I pay tribute to the local member Jackie Baillie, and once again on behalf of the Scottish Conservative party I express our sympathies to all the relatives concerned for their loss and the circumstances that brought about the loss&#8212;which, in most cases, will have been entirely unexpected. I join Margaret Curran in welcoming their presence in the gallery today and I welcome the moving of her motion. Let me also say that not only were the deaths unexpected, they were inexcusable, and they may well have been avoidable.</p><p>Relatives have faced something of a dilemma. There was clearly a colossal failure at the Vale of Leven, but my impression is that local people are understandably but needlessly nervous that by pursuing the investigation of the tragedy they may in some way contribute to a further general undermining of the hospital.</p><p>Let us be clear, as the independent review was: the threat of closure under which the Vale of Leven hospital laboured for more than a decade led to a significant lack of investment and, one has to suppose, a general lack of interest from the management of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. However, we should not confuse a desire to investigate the deaths properly with any lack of support for the future of the Vale of Leven, a hospital for which tens of thousands have demonstrated their sustained support.</p><p>The independent review is excoriating: there was a failure of leadership and supervision and inconsistent infection control and isolation practice. The hand washing facilities were inadequate, there were insufficient toilets and there was a lack of space between beds. Since the outbreak and the independent review, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has announced urgent investment to remedy those basic failings, and to a significant extent other recent announcements have made clear that there is a permanent future for the Vale of Leven hospital.</p><p>The independent review also uncovered the frankly astonishing lack of clarity among staff or supervision of staff when it came to basic hygiene. There was a lack of understanding about the role of soap and water in the control of C difficile, despite health board assurances of adherence to all manner of action plans. That apparent paying of lip service to fundamental standards should concern us in our examination of the broader lessons that should be learned throughout the NHS.<place-holder colnum=\"10681\"/></p><p>Scotland does not have a proud record on hospital-acquired infection. Our incidence rates are higher than those of our United Kingdom neighbours, and the costs of &#163;183 million are substantial and were unheard of even a decade ago. In 2006, 164 lives were lost to C difficile&#8212;the chilling reality that underpins any financial cost.</p><p>I have detailed the foregoing without any political spin or attribution of political blame. Like Margaret Curran, the Scottish Conservatives are not interested in rooting today's debate in the customary partisan political exchanges. We will not indulge in denunciations of political masters past or present. We want the lessons learned to have an impact on the NHS battle against health care-acquired infections throughout Scotland.</p><p>We believe in a named individual with executive authority being in charge of our hospital wards, and we appreciate that the Government's senior charge nurse review may move matters further in our direction. We mean executive control: the power to direct staff, visitors, patients, volunteers and even the hospital royalty&#8212;consultants. They should have the power not just to direct but to instruct&#8212;to be able to have facility deficiencies rectified expeditiously and without reference to an anonymous bureaucratic approval process.</p><p>In one important respect, however, we agree with the cabinet secretary: the independent review is now with the Crown Office and procurator fiscal, and until we know their determination it is premature to call for a public inquiry. Admittedly, that is at one level a judgment about the nuances in the Labour motion, but we do not feel that the relatives' real concerns are best aided by adopting a resolution that is underpinned by premature calls for a public inquiry.</p><p>The courses of action that are open to the Crown Office and procurator fiscal are significant in law and are of the utmost seriousness for the individuals and organisations concerned. We acknowledge the powerful representations of the grieving relatives and that calls for a public inquiry may have their moment&#8212;sooner rather than later. A public inquiry is, to use Margaret Curran's phrase, \"on the agenda\".

To be fair to myself, I was probably not expected to win my contest in the winter of 1982 in Glasgow Queen's Park&#8212;which is, incidentally, the last Glasgow seat to have been represented by a sitting Prime Minister, the Conservative Andrew Bonar Law.

However, I have observed in previous debates a gnawing concern that our NHS should be seen by all who access it without <place-holder colnum=\"10567\"/> fear or favour as an insurance policy that demands no responsible action on the part of all who benefit from it. If any of us went out leaving the doors and windows of our home open, we would hardly be surprised if our insurance company said \"Too bad\" when we reported that our home had subsequently been ransacked. However, no such sanction can exist within our NHS. In the final analysis, it is there when we need it.</p><p>What do we do to avoid every lifestyle choice, however irresponsible, becoming a subsequent demand on the taxpayer? How do we plan to mitigate the horrendous future cost predictions for the economy and the NHS of poor lifestyle choices?</p><p>I accept&#8212;and indeed have supported in previous debates&#8212;many of the arguments about the inequalities in our communities and agree that they underpin this debate.

No: a legislative requirement to wear a seat belt was established, then the legislation was rigorously enforced. Before we consider altering age limits, we should be completely satisfied that the existing laws and those that are pending are being, or will be, rigorously enforced. For the present, I believe that the proposal to raise the age limit is counterproductive. It will initiate a campaign that, over the summer, might overwhelm the broader issues that the Government is trying to have discussed.</p><p>The second proposal relates to pricing. Again, I have some sympathy with the Government because undoubtedly the increase in consumption has been matched by an increase in the relative affordability of alcohol as a product. Compelling as that is, I do not see how the Scottish Government's proposals could be implemented, even if they were appropriate. We acknowledge that pricing is a factor, and Conservatives at Westminster have made detailed proposals&#8212;costed and evaluated by Grant Thornton&#8212;for a restructuring of duty, which would see increased duty on alcopops and super-strength ciders and beers, with reductions on lower-strength varieties. However, such changes would be made within the United Kingdom marketplace and would not be prejudicial to Scotland in particular, which I fear the Scottish Government's proposals are. In any event, how would cross-border shopping sprees, or internet or telephone sales by companies based <place-holder colnum=\"10131\"/> in England, be avoided? It is also true that we share commercial pricing points with supermarkets in England, but that Scotland has a bigger alcohol abuse problem than anywhere else in the UK, so pricing on its own is not the issue.</p><p>One of the features of research on this subject is that it shows how countries across the world have and deal with alcohol problems in a hugely variable and contradictory way. Again, this is a bit like the inconsistency in age limits to which I referred earlier and I am tempted to ask&#8212;regarding the experience of other countries with the social impact of alcohol&#8212;so what? The French and the Italians are, after all, French and Italian. Other countries have a different climate, history, social environment and daylight hours. Although I am agnostic, I am aware that, in many of those countries, the church continues to have a far more profound influence than it has in the UK, where I fear the church has lost much of its moral resonance, especially with the young.</p><p>Compare the attitudinal differences to drink of the young generally with young Moslems, for example, or with a more church-attending continental or American youth. All of that points to the deep-seated nature of the historical Scottish cultural relationship with drink. Scotland's relationship with alcohol is not maturing; it is deteriorating and we all have a stake in the outcomes. The libertarian refrain, \"Leave them to it,\" is woefully misplaced. We are all paying a price, directly or indirectly. One way or another we must engage the will of Scots generally and not just that of politicians, professionals and health boards.

From time to time during its passage, the extraordinary age of some of the legislation it succeeds has been mentioned, in particular the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889 and the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897. In reflecting on that, I thought that it might be interesting to consult the <i>Hansard </i> official record of those earlier times to see what lessons might be learned.</p><p>Coincidentally, in the wider context of public health, it should be noted that Coca-Cola was invented in 1889. Indeed, it was originally produced by a company called the Pemberton Medicine Company. I presume that, if its status as a medicine had not changed, it would in due course have been available on free prescription. On this day in 1889, the Eiffel tower had been open for just a few weeks, from early May, and 88 souls perished in an Irish train disaster. Otto Frank, Anne Frank&#8217;s father had just been born&#8212;ironically, days after the man who would destroy his family and shatter the peace of the world half a century later.

I am sure that colleagues here today will want to reassure Mr Stone that, together, we would cheerfully and willingly march in his defence were he, as the member for Caithness in the Parliament, unable to set that outrageous wrong of history right. It is just a great shame that Mr Stone has no intention of doing so this afternoon, but I had not anticipated that small matter.</p><p>I am not sure how riveting the notification of infectious disease was to Westminster, for the lord mayor of Dublin&#8212;all Ireland then benefiting from membership of the union&#8212;was moved to comment:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have been here through a most fatiguing week.

It caused some controversy then, too; the member for Lincolnshire, Spalding somewhat fatuously argued against the measure on the basis that a report he had seen demonstrated that there was less incidence of disease where it was not reported.</p><p>By 1897 and the passage of the Public Health (Scotland) Bill, the Irish author Bram Stoker had just published \"Dracula\"; the first fingerprint bureau had opened in, curiously, Calcutta in India; the word \"computer\" had been used for the first time in connection with an electronic device; Anthony Eden was born; and Queen Victoria had celebrated her diamond jubilee. There was a rather cantankerous exchange in the Commons, and memorable phrases, such as the bill being </p><p class=\"indent\">\"remarkable not so much for what it contained as for what it did not contain\",</p><p>were coined.

Farewell, then, to our guardians past.</p><p>I have two points to leave with the Government. First, Mary Scanlon&#8217;s amendment 1 was sincerely offered. We are concerned that GP morale has softened. I have noted previously that the removal of the notification fee&#8212;although not substantially material in its own right&#8212;was seen by GPs in the context of recent renegotiations as a further chipping away at earlier commitments. Whether the GPs were right or wrong, I hope that future outcomes do not cause the Government to rue the day.</p><p>Secondly&#8212;although I do not wish to labour the point&#8212;the Government might note that members of the Subordinate Legislation Committee had our attention drawn to some lazy drafting with this bill in particular. I hope that we can move on and that the matter has been duly noted and addressed.</p><p>We congratulate the Government and the members of the Health and Sport Committee on investigating succinctly many of the queries and concerns of the stage 1 debate. We also congratulate the clerks who assisted them.</p><p>With the measures in the bill, Scotland will be better prepared to meet future challenges to our public health. We have incorporated into the proposals sensible actions to regulate the use of sunbeds.

As I speak now, I remember many of them vividly and with the greatest affection. I understood the persecution of the Jews in biblical terms and in an historical context but, in all my recollection, not once did I hear discussed these events or the raw grief for deeds that had been committed just 20 years earlier. I have never quite fully understood why. Perhaps there was a driven need to put it all behind them and to get on with life. Perhaps, too, there was a feeling that families everywhere had suffered one way or another. Perhaps, in those more innocent days, it was felt to be just too awful a burden for any child to bear.<place-holder colnum=\"9490\"/></p><p>Not until my teens did I become more generally aware of the Holocaust that had been perpetrated by Nazi Germany. Jacob Bronowski's landmark television documentary, \"The Ascent of Man\", ITV's \"The World at War\", which for the first time screened the raw images, and the Labour peer Lord Janner's personal testimony in Parliament all played a part in encouraging me to investigate for myself the crimes against humanity about which the wider world had been made aware in detail only on 29 November 1945 and 19 February 1946, when the American and Russian prosecution teams respectively screened evidential documentaries at Nuremberg before the 21 Nazi defendants and international opinion.</p><p>Dr G M Gilbert, the American psychiatrist in attendance at the trial, summarised the truly shocking footage:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The acres of corpses of Russian POWs murdered or left to starve, the torture instruments, mutilated bodies, guillotines and baskets full of heads; bodies hanging from lamp posts; the ruins of Lidice; raped and murdered women, children with heads bashed in; the crematoria and gas chambers; the piles of clothes, the bales of women's hair at Auschwitz\".</p><p>In the years since, it seems to me, Auschwitz has in some ways almost been misrepresented as the only centre of atrocity. Overlooked, it seems, are the 1.5 million to 2 million Jews who were shot in the occupied Soviet Union and all those others who perished in concentration camps such as Sobib&#243;r, all evidence of which the Nazis ruthlessly eliminated in their retreat. Indeed, had that retreat not become a rout, all trace of Auschwitz would, in all probability, have been similarly concealed.</p><p>Even now the detail of an event can strike a chord. Just 20 years ago, and some 43 years after the event, an episode that had remained shrouded, a testimony untranslated, became public. As a parent with two young sons of my own, I was certainly stopped short when I learned about it. On 20 April 1945&#8212;a day with which, unwittingly, most members will be familiar&#8212;Hitler made his final public appearance, which is recorded in a photograph in which, outside his bunker for the last time, he is seen caressing the face of a very young German boy who had been press-ganged into the final defence of Berlin. Even as he did so, and as British forces reached the outskirts of Hamburg, events unfolded that were recorded by the German author Gitta Sereny in a documentary that has still not been seen by any English-speaking audience.</p><p>A column of trucks coming from Neuengamme concentration camp in Hamburg delivered their loads at the door of an empty school building in the north of the city: 26 men, two women and 22 children. The children, boys and girls of mixed nationalities but all Jews, between four and 12 years old, had been used for medical experiments <place-holder colnum=\"9491\"/> in Auschwitz. As Auschwitz was evacuated they had been transferred for the continuation and, if possible, completion of the experiments. However, time had run out. The SS knew that, alive, these children represented the most horrible evidence of their crimes. So, on that April afternoon, they took them into the large gymnasium of that Hamburg school, which had been equipped with looped ropes placed symmetrically 2m apart, and they hanged them. When they had finished with the children, they hanged the two French doctors and two Dutch nurses who had looked after them.</p><p>Children today are familiar with the events of the Holocaust. As my childhood friends' grandparents and parents who endured and survived depart this earth, we have resolved that the crime of mechanised murder and cruelty on an industrialised scale must never be forgotten. Nor should we be naive&#8212;it happened before the second world war, in Armenia, and afterwards, in Stalin's empire, in Cambodia and in Bosnia. It is happening today in Darfur and it will happen somewhere else soon.</p><p>The objective of our generation must be to do all that we can to commemorate the Jews, the disabled, Gypsies, homosexuals and others who were murdered by Hitler's regime, and to educate people against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms. I welcome the work of successive Governments here and at Westminster, particularly during the past decade under Labour and the Liberal Democrats, to realise that ambition. Such work is also our duty in a Parliament that has no Jewish members. A community that was 48,000 strong at the end of the war has declined to some 17,000 members.</p><p>This is awkward, and I hope to say what I have to say in a measured way. I will never question a member's faith and it would take extraordinary events before I questioned a member's humanity. Division should play no part in our conduct in the Parliament in respect of our unity in the face of the challenge that is presented by the legacy of the Holocaust. Therefore, more in sorrow than in anger I must say that I deeply resent the implication of one member and his Westminster colleague that I, my colleagues or any members are less concerned that the lessons of the Holocaust be remembered.

I say that somewhat wearily because, as others have observed, this is not the first worthwhile debate on a health topic in recent weeks, and I am sure that it will not be the last, because all manner of other initiatives for us to relish are pending. If talking about health were to make us healthier, I am sure that we would all be fit specimens, although when I look around the chamber and in the mirror, I see that that does not follow. I can only hope that a debate on anaesthetics is not planned for the immediate future.</p><p>None of what I have said makes today's debate any less important. As Mary Scanlon said earlier on our behalf, we support the conclusions of the remote and rural steering group report \"Delivering for Remote and Rural Healthcare\" and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing's announcements. We also recognise the work of the previous Administration in preparing to tackle the challenge. Presiding Officer, perhaps you could issue hats to all members, as that would make it much easier for us to doff them to the previous Administration in the ritual act that we are required to perform.</p><p>The problems that the report seeks to address are fundamental but particular: higher suicide rates; a higher incidence of alcohol-related disease; a higher number of accidents, whether on the roads or through climbing, farming and fishing; a palliative care load that is higher than the urban equivalent; and the huge seasonal fluctuation of population. Rob Gibson spoke convincingly about the need for a flexible funding model.<place-holder colnum=\"9381\"/></p><p>As a visitor to the remote north and as something of a townie&#8212;although a fan of the countryside&#8212;I am struck by the sheer isolation of many communities and individuals there. It is quite a thought that in some places the population can be so low for much of the year. The consequential loneliness can have a particularly strong effect on the incidence of alcoholism and, tragically, suicide. We welcome the actions that are designed to improve mental health in such areas, as the unique lifestyle conditions that I have described can fuel the depression that often leads to tragedies, many of which we ought to be able to avoid.</p><p>As Mary Scanlon said, we welcome the cabinet secretary's acceptance that six hospitals should provide core services and her intentions for other local community hospitals.</p><p>I was encouraged by the fact that the cabinet secretary sees an opportunity to develop of e-health, where appropriate, especially where it can obviate the need for long and unnecessary journeys. I listened with interest to the sensible comments of Ross Finnie and Rob Gibson on telemedicine. We welcome the emphasis that the cabinet secretary is placing on designing a solution that allows care to be delivered as near to home as possible and as safely as possible. In particular, we look forward to a successful outcome to the extended pilot in the west of Scotland.</p><p>It will be interesting to see what role directly elected health boards will play in rural communities, especially given the challenge of geography and the need to ensure that in any one health board&#8212;especially a rural one&#8212;the elected representatives do not all come from one street or community, as, in theory, they could.</p><p>Another emerging challenge is the consequences of the new NHS funding formula. I understand the cabinet secretary's position on the issue. She is essentially correct when she says that a more up-to-date funding method should be applied. However, having seen such arguments lost in politics and business before, I remind her of the old adage that perception is the truth, even if it is not the reality. Whatever she says today, the perception is growing and becoming entrenched that rural health boards face budget cuts&#8212;saying that they do not will not be enough. I give her fair warning that NRAC will need careful explanation&#8212;and soon&#8212;if the Government is to avoid finding itself unable to persuade a public who have reached a conclusion, however inaccurate it may be. It would not be wise for her to rely solely on the argument that people are scaremongering.</p><p>However, the cabinet secretary is right to caution the Labour Party against alarming and misleading the public, in its desperation to find a <place-holder colnum=\"9382\"/> line of political attack, by being lurid rather than factual.

John Lamont spoke movingly about the practical consequences of proposed service reductions in his constituency and raised the important issue of rural dental care. Christine Grahame spoke with particular reference to the board's proposals for bed cuts at Hay Lodge hospital. I should credit the member, as last week I saw her local paper and can confirm that, as she said, she was all over it fighting this battle.</p><p>Rhoda Grant made a fair point about the additional responsibilities of ambulance staff and the need for training and reward.

Now is not the time for back-slapping all round. No one is yet blaming the cabinet secretary for any deteriorating position, but if she simply takes the view that not much is wrong, they certainly will do. I am relieved that her opening speech showed more understanding of the situation than does her amendment. We all support the staff who do an invaluable job for the Scottish Ambulance Service but, as we might have observed in the motor industry, the enamel on the paint work is chipped, the vehicle is in need of an urgent inspection and, if nothing is done, we risk seeing the big end go.</p><p>I have been contacted by constituents about their recent experiences. In one instance, when the ambulance turned up, my constituent was asked to sit with the driver to direct the way to the hospital. In another instance, a relative was asked to lead the way by driving in front of the ambulance. On both occasions, the ambulance drivers were strangers to the area and did not know the location of the hospital. Other members have referred to such experiences in the many <place-holder colnum=\"8890\"/> letters, e-mails and representations that they have received.</p><p>Written answers that I have received to parliamentary questions show that the overall number of vehicles in the Scottish ambulance fleet has dropped. That has been explained as a drop in the number of auxiliary vehicles rather than of ambulance and response vehicles. However, I am bound to point out that, as journey time consequences take effect as a result of the consolidation of A and E services and the cross-city travel that is required for the new Victoria hospital, substantially more vehicles may be required in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.</p><p>Nor is it acceptable to be breezy about the implications of single-manned rapid response vehicles. In the response to another parliamentary question, I learned that the number of incidents of violence and aggression towards ambulance staff has soared by more than 450 per cent in the past three years in west-central Scotland. Over the same period, the number of complaints against the Scottish Ambulance Service has increased by 120 per cent. Attempts to arrange a meeting with the chief executive have been fobbed off with suggestions of meetings with local management, which have subsequently been postponed.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have raised the plight of volunteer drivers, who are a vital resource for the ambulance service. I have been contacted by many such drivers, who are in despair because they feel that, given that there has been a 17 per cent real-terms fall in the mileage rate payable over the past year alone, they are now subsidising the service. As a result, there has been a 14 per cent fall in the number of volunteer drivers, and many more tell me that they are close to giving up. That is a dreadful situation.</p><p>This month, in response to another written question, I was told that the Scottish Ambulance Service had no plans to review the rate payable. However, the answer added, somewhat enigmatically, that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the service was asked to look again at this matter, and have confirmed that they will now be reviewing the rates\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-05-13.S3W-12662.h\">[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Written Answers</em>, 13 May 2008; S3W-12662.]</citation></p><p>By whom was it asked to look at the matter again? There is no point in the cabinet secretary suggesting that the service should have autonomy and recommending that the Health and Sport Committee should investigate matters if, at the same time, the Government is directing the service to review mileage rates and other matters.</p><p>All this is potentially tragic for patients. Volunteers are an essential element of the service. Patients already wait for ages, often in distress, because they are not deemed to be of sufficient <place-holder colnum=\"8891\"/> priority. What are their prospects if we lose more volunteers? As hospital services are merged, might not we need more volunteers?</p><p>The debate is not an attack on ambulance staff, who do an outstanding job. It is an opportunity to air a series of concerns that, it transpires, has been growing among members. The cabinet secretary should acknowledge that, collectively, those concerns amount to more than a row of beans.</p><p>The cabinet secretary is due to hold her annual review with the Scottish Ambulance Service on 12 August. Yesterday she made the welcome announcement that the opportunity for the audience to participate in the review will be extended to allow spontaneous contributions from the floor. We must hope that questions will not have to be pre-submitted and carefully vetted, and that they will not be ruled out of order. If the review event on 12 August is sufficiently well advertised, I hope that members of the public will turn out.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cabinet secretary must turn her urgent attention to a service the performance of which might well be improving against certain measurements, but which is spluttering overall.

It is estimated that 1 per cent of the Scots population&#8212;twice the percentage of elsewhere in the United Kingdom&#8212;is infected by this blood-borne virus. We are told that too few are aware of their infection and that thus far we have treated far fewer of those who are infected than is the case in Germany, Italy or Spain. We are also told that, in France, people who are infected are five times more likely to have been treated than is the case in this country.</p><p>We welcome the fact that phase II has followed on from a phase I. We do so not only because that is the rather obvious and natural order of things, but because we can see that phase I has been implemented almost in its entirety&#8212;all but one of 41 actions have been implemented. During phase II, the Government will endeavour to tackle directly the enduring ignorance that, if corrected, could be <place-holder colnum=\"8809\"/> so influential in the success of the preventive campaign.</p><p>We therefore applaud the Hepatitis C Trust's assessment of phase II that it is comprehensive and evidence based, that it involved wide stakeholder consultation, that it addresses health inequalities and that it takes account of Scotland's geography.</p><p>That said, perhaps we should be concerned at the sheer volume of public health information that we find ourselves having to, or planning to, communicate. We have vital messages on sexual health, such as those on the need for chlamydia screening among young girls and especially young men; the message on drugs generally; the effort to tackle obesity; the forthcoming strategy to address the ever-worsening scourge of alcohol abuse; and the statement on smoking prevention earlier this afternoon. The list goes on. To an extent, every new message and campaign competes for public awareness, often among the same demographic groups. We must be concerned about and alert to the possibility that that may begin to dilute the effectiveness of individual messages, however vital they are, and could lead to a need for even higher expenditure to break into the consciousness of any target group. We must therefore learn to be increasingly imaginative and versatile in our approach. Using the same medium every time may produce diminishing returns. At some point, we need to pause and dwell on the array of public health initiatives that are under way and planned. We do not want to stand accused in years to come of having been willing to spend money, but in a manner that became contradictory and confused.</p><p>The Government is to be applauded for being prepared to tackle the public health agenda head on and with fresh urgency, building&#8212;I say without hesitation&#8212;on what went before, which was also bold. However, the agenda is becoming wider and more ambitious in its reach every week. It is in all our interests that it succeeds, so I repeat that, at some point, we should find time to draw an understanding of the breadth of the competing and complementary strands. My colleague Mary Scanlon gave an immediate and worthwhile practical example of that when she referred to the forthcoming strategy on drugs. It is important that the immediate initiatives work effectively and concurrently. Richard Simpson identified a parallel issue about records.</p><p>As others have done today, we welcome the aims and objectives of phase II of the hepatitis C plan over the next three years and measures such as the direct support to health boards as they seek to meet the challenge. Taken together, the announcement of the inquiry and the phase II funding represent a significant and undeniable <place-holder colnum=\"8810\"/> effort by the Administration to do justice to the historical hepatitis C issue, coupled with a striking commitment to mitigate future incidence. Surely none of us has any ambition to carp or complain. We must ensure that the money that is allocated is spent effectively and that the various strands of the strategy are monitored closely, as they all need to succeed so that, on hepatitis C, Scotland achieves a clear strike, even if it is in isolation. Lives will be saved if we do so.</p><p>I conclude by answering Charles Gore's challenge, which I mentioned earlier, by quoting from him today. He welcomed the Scottish Government's approach and concluded by saying that it will mean that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"thousands more patients are diagnosed and treated and this will save lives\".</p><p>We must see that it does.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13704565", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hepatitis C"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Once again, on a matter that enjoys support across the parties, the subject of debate has brought out the qualities of a concerned, informed and collective chamber by way of members' contributions.

I thought that Michael Matheson's speech was particularly sour in that regard.</p><p>Yes, the Sutherland review has arrived at trenchant conclusions, but the appropriate response from all of us&#8212;given that the conclusions have been generally welcomed and accepted on all sides&#8212;is to act to ensure that further progress is made in support of those who are in need. As Mary Scanlon said, and as the Labour amendment states, we should enter into discussions with Westminster in a mature and dignified way. We support the Government in its efforts to secure the &#163;30 million that has been withheld and we hope that it proceeds in a manner that ensures a successful outcome.</p><p>Certainly, I believe that the Government has grounds for optimism. After all, if &#163;2.7 billion can be found at the drop of a hat in a fruitless effort to salvage the reputation of the Prime Minister ahead of Labour's expected defeat by the Conservatives in a Westminster by-election for the first time in 26 years, it ought to be possible, without visiting a by-election on Labour members in Scotland, for &#163;30 million&#8212;which is trivial by comparison&#8212;to be found by the Treasury to meet Lord Sutherland's judgment. Lord Sutherland states that the money should be reinstated in the short term, which implies a sense of urgency, while accepting the need for larger work to proceed in reassessing the funding streams, which speaks to the Labour amendment.</p><p>I turn to some of the issues that have been raised by members during the debate. Mary Scanlon returned to the subject of integrated care homes and made the point that she has made before. David McLetchie spoke at length on the subject of our amendment, just as he did in response to the statement last week. I am sure that he will be invigorated by Helen Eadie's endorsement this afternoon. It is a matter on which he has led in recent times and we make no apology for our demand today that those eight councils that continue to charge should take the intentions of the Government&#8212;expressed last week and again today&#8212;as the signal to stop doing so now, ahead of any legislation, and to refund all those who have been harangued into paying, quite wrongly, for assistance with food preparation. I repeat David McLetchie's assertion that, although legislation may be required to clear up the confusion, it is not a confusion in law but a confusion that has been created by Scottish Executive contortions on the matter. Indeed, one wonders where an individual who specialises in such policy contortions might find employment today.<place-holder colnum=\"8735\"/></p><p>Ross Finnie hugely exaggerated the emphasis that the Labour amendment places on the Wanless review.

In acting to improve matters in practice, we all have a responsibility to those who will follow us. I agree with Margaret Curran&#8212;who made this case with characteristic passion this afternoon&#8212;on the demographic trends and predictions, which most members have seen. Many of us know the <place-holder colnum=\"8736\"/> concerns of professionals about the likely future incidence of dementia in the population. We have been told about the public health need to change lifestyles and to tackle obesity and the various addictions, such as to alcohol and drugs. We see the deteriorating standards of sexual health and the still too low immunisation percentages. With our policy of free personal and nursing care, do we send an unintended contradictory signal?</p><p>The policy of free personal and nursing care is proudly advanced by this generation to ensure that those who went before us who did so much are rewarded with a standard of care to which we feel all should be entitled. However, the policy should not be seen as a signal to those who follow us that we or they can be casual or reckless in life about our health and lifestyles in the certain knowledge that the state is now set up to pay up. If free personal and nursing care is to be a gold standard, it is essential that we bring about a culture in which people understand that the policy has been achieved to ensure that those who need such care receive it but that all of us, throughout our lives, must act responsibly to minimise the need to access such care in the first place.</p><p>There is a concern about the future affordability of the policy. In truth, we can offer only our best guess on that. Changes and advances that could massively affect the future position&#8212;for good or ill&#8212;could occur at any time. However, to make the policy affordable and sustainable, we need to avoid being rosy-eyed about the future by ensuring that, whatever future funding streams are eventually set up, it becomes part of the public grain that we all have a duty to the national health service to act responsibly.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660353", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Free Personal Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are not being asked to endorse the Wanless review; we are being asked to support the Labour amendment, which merely notes the review's recommendations in the context of a wider debate.

Their difficulty is quite literally out of sight and out of mind of the vast majority of us. As was the case with the debate on alternative and augmentative communication and that on the concerns of wheelchair users, which you recently brought to Parliament, Presiding Officer&#8212;I am delighted to use the word \"you\" in the appropriate context&#8212;we are discussing a matter that, if properly and more widely understood, would without question result in a demand for action by the majority. The Scottish Conservatives offer their support for the action that is encapsulated in the RNIB's campaign.</p><p>For children who are blind or partially sighted, the ability to read is just as profound a need as the ability to be mobile is to those who require an appropriate wheelchair or as the ability to communicate is to those who are denied the usual powers of speech. The campaign seeks to address that need not by hothousing some pressure group theory but by inviting the Government to learn from the experience of many other communities in Europe and America, where centrally provided funding ensures equal access to nationally based resources. That is the obvious route to address the geographical dispersion of a minority requirement.</p><p>It is not enough to offer warm words and then abdicate responsibility for delivery to councils. In any event, sufficient expertise does not exist to enable every council to replicate the effort that is required, so we support the campaign for the establishment of a national transcription service on which schools, teachers and pupils can rely and call.</p><p>Initial capital funding is sought; subsequent operational costs will be met through council subscription to the services that are offered. Alison McInnes and Stuart McMillan detailed the various benefits that that will bring to all. Once again, it is possible, for a relatively small commitment and investment, to transform the lives of a disadvantaged minority who, as a result, will be capable of achieving life-altering outcomes. What is required is willingness and the will. Today we can be unanimous in offering our support to the demand for progress.<place-holder colnum=\"8525\"/></p><p>I will briefly consider the role of spoken word, of which I have always been an advocate and admirer. The quality and range of material that is now available in spoken word format is extraordinarily diverse. It was originally conceived as a useful tool for the blind and partially sighted. The breadth of material that is available is sustained by wider public demand. Even for children who can read, the enjoyment that spoken word can bring can introduce them to the joys of speech rhythm and accent, the thrill and drama of expression and the context of the wider use of vocabulary and nuance.</p><p>I hope that members will not think it rather sad or, indeed, pathetic if I confess that Mrs Carlaw and I often nod off in bed to the BBC radio collection&#8212;to pristine recordings of Francis Durbridge's Paul Temple serials, some of which are now half a century old, the organisation's extensive Agatha Christie adaptations or its unique Sherlock Holmes collection, all the stories in which are performed by the same lead cast throughout. We try anything once, although we have found it impossible to warm to the inescapably dreary and ludicrous \"The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency\".</p><p>Rather than give the impression that I have painted a comprehensive portrait of our private life, I want to advertise the wider benefits and enjoyments of spoken word, which can be experienced on CD, download and radio. I also wish to emphasise the particular interest that the format can have for children, who are now almost entirely denied any spoken word service on radio, except as an annual seasonal event. Spoken word can engage the imagination and bring to life text.

The previous Administration was working to achieve such a measure as well, as has been acknowledged. I doff my cap yet again. Inevitably, the consensual tone has been reflected in this debate and in the published report of the Health and Sport Committee.</p><p>Interesting&#8212;or, as Mary Scanlon might put it, \"interesting but not exciting\"&#8212;points have been made by members in all parts of the chamber. I have no doubt that the Government will reflect on them.</p><p>I wish to focus on the withdrawal of fees for general practitioners and the extent of the powers that are being sought to compel the examination, quarantine or detention of individuals.</p><p>Like the members of the Health and Sport Committee, I note Shona Robison's comments about the withdrawal of fees to general practitioners in respect of the reporting of notifiable diseases. I have some sympathy with the minister's view. The sums that are currently paid are relatively minor and claims are not always made. As she said during an intervention, the claims relate mainly to chickenpox.</p><p>I attended a local GP practice recently and raised the issue with the partners. The initial reaction was quite gung ho&#8212;\"If fees are no longer to be paid, we will no longer be notifying\"&#8212;but it quickly became apparent that only the practice manager was aware of the system or the fee payable. When the GPs understood the actual sums involved, tempers cooled and shoulders shrugged. I suggest to the minister that timing is everything and that the proposal to end fees is being seen by GPs in the general context of their current disgruntlement in relation to practice contracts. The perception is that an agreement <place-holder colnum=\"7751\"/> reached some years ago to protect a GP network that was failing to attract new doctors is being undermined piecemeal with each annual settlement.</p><p>This is not an argument to support the retention of a fee, but the Government should reflect on the politics of its intention and, at the very least, ensure that it does not allow the argument to become an overblown headline. It should demonstrate the effect of the change to individual GP practices. By so doing, it should ensure that GPs are persuaded such that they can support the change.</p><p>I share the concerns that other members, including committee members, have expressed about the proposed exemption from giving an explanation for compelling an individual to be medically examined, quarantined or detained, or to providing an appeal process. I have read the minister's explanation with care, but I remain sceptical&#8212;as does Christine Grahame&#8212;about some of the associated issues that arise. It seems that when Governments draft legislation&#8212;I do not mean this Government in any particular way&#8212;they establish, quite properly, specific circumstances for an event, but then tack on at the end a general sweep-up section. It could be argued that that section renders all the particular circumstantial sections redundant. It is a bit like a job description in which someone is told that their job will be to do this, that and the next thing, but that they will also be responsible for anything that those who wrote the job description have forgotten about. As a member of the Subordinate Legislation Committee, I have noted examples of that quite regularly.</p><p>At Westminster, there is a similar debate about the Government's proposals regarding the length of detention without charge. Although it may be the Government's role to seek to secure such provisions, it is Parliament's role to scrutinise them and, in principle, to resist them. If a proposal does not withstand proper scrutiny, it is our duty to resist it strongly.</p><p>I share the Health and Sport Committee's concern that the Government has not yet explained satisfactorily why it may be necessary to detain or examine people without explanation or appeal. I note that the minister will reflect on including provision for a post-event appeal and an obligation to provide an explanation without delay&#8212;but the Government in Zimbabwe is under a similar obligation to provide, without delay, the result of its election.</p><p>I accept that it may be uncharitable to compare our Government in any way to that of Zimbabwe, but I remain nervous about incorporating into legislation sweep-up sections that can be characterised as draconian&#8212;although I share the <place-holder colnum=\"7752\"/> concerns of Mary Scanlon and others about the balance between the protection of public health and the need to uphold the rights of the individual. I look forward to hearing the Government's further thinking on that issue.</p><p>Like other members, I look forward to the incorporation in the bill at stage 2 of proposals in support of Ken Macintosh's proposed bill on sunbeds. The member has pursued the issue assiduously, with all-party support, and has argued his point cogently to the Health and Sport Committee and here again today. I hesitate to go as far as to pay tribute to Ken Macintosh, for fear of reading about that in a local leaflet, but his engagement with the issue has been impressive.</p><p>Other points of substance have been identified in committee; I am sure that the Government will reflect further on them. Notwithstanding those points and the comments that have been made about drafting, all members can congratulate the Government on the progress that it has made and on its constructive attitude to the issues that have been raised. In that spirit, we will support the bill today.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402509", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Health etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When, last year, the Government declared its intention to introduce a public health bill, the announcement was welcomed on all sides.

This is one of those problems for which there is a commonsense remedy that is all too often absent, or the message is in danger of becoming overcomplicated in its delivery.</p><p>My experience of being a hospital patient is relatively recent, as an accident and emergency admission within the NHS with what turned out to be a fairly routinely diagnosed complaint of gall stones one year and kidney stones the next. After treatment had helped alleviate the immediate discomfort, I found it fascinating just to watch. So much is made of the experience of patients by politicians that&#8212;admittedly, this is almost a perverse logic&#8212;it was almost a privilege to be a politician who was also the patient.</p><p>It was fascinating to watch the endless stream of individuals who strolled through the men's general surgical ward. There were committed public servants going about their business and there were patients and their families. The newspaper trolley man was astonished and unable to oblige when I requested <em>The Herald</em>&#8212;he ensured that the ward was made aware of the special delivery for \"the professor\" the next day to my bed in a window corner. There was the self-evident suspicion of fellow patients at the various baskets and bowls of spring bulbs that were delivered to the same corner&#8212;it was seemingly further evidence of, at the very least, some extravagant erudition.</p><p>There was the delight of the man opposite me, whose colostomy bag burst frequently in the night, or of the Irishman in the bed next to me, who did a runner because, as he confided to me, \"The Southern general makes a much better job of <place-holder colnum=\"7349\"/> drilling open a seized rear end.\" He was replaced by a young gentleman substantially the worse for wear after a Scotland match, whose excessively noisy comeuppance through the night was less than endearing. The hospital porters arrived, like buses, all at once&#8212;sometimes to ferry patients who had blocked a bed throughout the day and night for a routine X-ray, after which they could be discharged, but who as a result of lack of organisation lingered on, so other patients could not be admitted.</p><p>The staff&#8212;nurses, doctors, consultants, deliverers of meals and cleaning staff&#8212;were all doing their best, and the other patients were an on-going delight. There was the disembodied conversation heard over the partitions between an elderly man, who asked \"When did you get in, son?\" and a recent arrival, who responded, \"Just the day, big man, and no for long. And yersel?\" \"1952\", came the reply. There was a daily procession of visitors, family and friends.</p><p>Not once, on either admission, did I hear anyone being challenged, or asked, to wash or sterilise their hands or not sit on the beds, nor was I ever savaged by a tie&#8212;the poor defenceless tie, around which now can be heard the clamour of indignant outrage as it is identified as the source of all infection. Ties, if worn, were tucked away within a coat or a jersey.</p><p>It seems to me that the most obvious action is the one that is least applied&#8212;washing or sterilising hands. In part, that seemed to me to be because there was no dragon enforcing the rule. I know that Conservatives have in the past called for matron, and I hope and believe that that has been for practical reasons and not just to fantasise about the swish of uniformed authority&#8212;I look over my shoulder, but no, she is not here. What is needed is a figure who has both the authority and confidence to bawl at anyone&#8212;patient, visitor, visiting politician, nurse, doctor or consultant&#8212;that they should wash or sterilise their hands and not sit on the beds. It appears that there are currently too many different chimney stacks of employee accountability and that in this grievance-rich age no one is able or prepared to take the risk of assuming overall command.</p><p>In saying all that, I accept that developments in medicine now keep us on the go until a greater age, often when hospitalised and with longer recovery times, and that our potential exposure in wards for longer and in a weakened state is a consequence of that. Therefore, when the BMA tells us that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"compliance with hand hygiene among professionals varies as a result of a lack of understanding of the associated risks and a lack of knowledge of the basic guidelines\",</p><p>I cannot help but feel that there is considerable window dressing of a perfectly simple and <place-holder colnum=\"7350\"/> straightforward concept: people should wash or sterilise their hands regularly and thoroughly. For hospital professionals, doing that and addressing the associated issues that Irene Oldfather raised should be as routine as is putting on a seatbelt for the driver of a car.</p><p>I have sympathy with the BMA's concern about inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics. I read its briefing on that subject and instantly recognised my mother, who&#8212;like Jamie Stone's mother&#8212;is a serial attendee of her local general practitioner, with an unshakeable belief that an antibiotic is the cure for all ills, from something genuinely serious to a blocked kitchen sink. There is a widespread belief that, even if an antibiotic is inappropriate, no harm can be done, yet those who prescribe them must know that harm is being done, as resistances are diminished. Again, public education is important, but the resolve of the medical profession in the face of what sometimes amounts to badgering is necessary, too.</p><p>In general, we believe the Government to be sincere in its objectives and we will support it today and will watch with interest the emerging outcomes. If the measures are successful, they will be a considerable achievement that will benefit the NHS hugely. I started by saying that common sense ought to be the rule but, as I have observed before, the problem with common sense is that it is not very common. The challenge for the Government is to make it so.</p><p>I hope that I have not made light of the subject. My sister-in-law&#8212;a mother of three in her 40s&#8212;is in the later stages of facing the cruel fate of the complications arising from untreatable breast cancer. Her journey has been made all the more stressful and grim by a hospital-acquired infection along the way.

Almost at the stroke of a pen, Nicola Sturgeon acted to restore the badly bruised public confidence in decisions on major service delivery change. Both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives fought last year's election on a pledge to reverse the damaging closures of accident and emergency departments and bring to an end the seemingly messianic obsession with the centralisation of acute health services. That promise has been emphatically delivered at Ayr and Monklands hospitals.</p><p>The establishment of an independent scrutiny process was a bold step, but by ensuring that decisions are reviewed afresh by experienced professionals who are one step removed and take <place-holder colnum=\"6813\"/> a broad view, public confidence in the conclusions that are reached has been restored. We owe a debt of gratitude to professors Andrew Walker and Angus Mackay and those who have served them so far.</p><p>The consultation on what future role an independent scrutiny process might have is appropriate, important and timely if public confidence is to be sustained. However, we should not lose sight of the reason why such a process proved necessary, because that should inform what happens next. The reason was surely the almost complete collapse of public confidence in the modern consultative process.</p><p>The public have become both wary and cynical of consultations, the outcomes of which appear to have been pre-determined. People's anger is aroused by the presentation of so-called options, many of which appear to have been drafted merely to be subsequently dismissed as either ridiculous or impractical. Indeed, several of the so-called options are often rubbished by the very organisation that has included them in its consultation. A clear impression is given that they exist as options only to reinforce the prejudice that underlies the preferred course of action of those who are consulting. That might be an unfortunate caricature of the actions of those involved but, to be frank, as far as the public are concerned the perception is the truth, even if it is not the reality. Even more unfortunately, it now appears that the perception was the reality in relation to the A and E departments at Ayr, Monklands and the Vale of Leven hospitals.</p><p>The modern consultative process is not unique to the NHS&#8212;for evidence of that, we need look no further than the Westminster Government's consultative process on post office closures&#8212;but it is particular to the NHS. During the past decade, many people joined consultations on major service changes in good faith and demonstrated the substantial public support that underpinned their local campaigns. It is no wonder that they recoiled in frustration and outraged disbelief when all that they had achieved was dismissed out of hand.</p><p>The previous Administration's record on the NHS is not without merit, but it suffered the public's disapprobation and contempt for its apparent arrogance in pressing forward with enforced major service change and never hesitating in the face of public anxiety or will. Perhaps ministers persuaded themselves that that was leadership. In response to the ministerial statement a fortnight ago on the decision to retain A and E departments at Ayr and Monklands hospitals, which arose from an independent scrutiny process, Andy Kerr vaingloriously railed against the fresh decisions that were reached, <place-holder colnum=\"6814\"/> seemingly oblivious to the change in the public mood.</p><p>Labour supremacy in local government and at Holyrood is a thing of the past and Labour bombast and edict will no longer serve.

They are right to wonder just how safe that change will prove.</p><p>Although I understand and respect the cabinet secretary's pragmatic view that decisions reached years ago and now being realised cannot be subject to yet further review, I believe that there is a special case in greater Glasgow, which serves <place-holder colnum=\"6815\"/> such a vast community, not for fresh independent scrutiny of the immensely complicated infrastructural decisions that were reached, but for an external review of their implementation and the opportunities for service enhancement that might be accommodated to mitigate a sustained public concern by communities currently served by Stobhill and Victoria hospitals that was voiced again at public meetings just last week.</p><p>We all appreciate that the management and running of NHS boards is a huge undertaking. Boards have to get on with it and cannot have some permanently seated quango ranging casually across Scotland, second-guessing their every decision. That would paralyse the NHS.</p><p>If we can ensure renewed public confidence in the consultation process, the need for later independent scrutiny of decisions should diminish. We should work to achieve that end. The public have responded positively to independent scrutiny, and they clearly have confidence in it. We should ensure that they are reassured that no future Government will in the final analysis abdicate its responsibility in a welter of self-justification, but will instead reserve to itself the means to scrutinise independently what is recommended. All parties now need to accept such a process, and the cabinet secretary can be assured that we will look positively at whatever proposals finally emerge.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400232", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Independent Scrutiny"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. As I said a moment ago, the public perception of some consultations that have been initiated on major service change&#8212;not just in the health service but elsewhere&#8212;has been that, although options were presented, they were not credible options and the organisations that were consulting sought to undermine the very options on which they canvassed views.

While researching the situation, I became convinced that progress to improve the position for wheelchair users had run into the sand.</p><p>I am drawn to the conclusion that a ministerial statement and questions might have been the more appropriate format, because we are in danger tonight of treading a well-worn wheel, given that a perfectly practical and sensible report has been produced and was previously welcomed&#8212;yet here we are. For all the work and detail in the \"Moving Forward\" report, it seems that it has been gathering dust rather than traction. Fundamentally, the recommendations still need to be implemented and they must be supported by an adequate&#8212;by which I mean incremental&#8212;level of funding. I make no party-political point. I accept that the previous Executive acted in good faith and that the present Government is doing so, too. It is just that a pretty cursory glance at the recommendations in \"Moving Forward\" and at the supporting evidence confirms that the current forecast levels of funding are inadequate and, although the funding is welcome, it will see us treading water rather than making substantive progress.</p><p>In addition, the case for creating a national structure to implement the recommendations remains unanswered&#8212;the recommendation to create such a structure remains unfulfilled&#8212;and the painfully frustrating practice of ensuring that the right type of chair is identified for the particular physical impairment remains unaddressed.<place-holder colnum=\"6641\"/></p><p>To those coming to the discussion anew, it must seem that the inherently antediluvian practices that the report sought to rectify belong to another age. I guess that, once again, it is a case of out of public sight, out of public mind. In no other area of widely accessed public service would a similar situation be tolerable any longer. If the reality of the current situation was widely understood by those who are not in need of wheelchairs, it would not be tolerated.</p><p>The submissions detailing progress, which were made available to members of the Scottish Disability Equality Forum and Quarriers, are disappointing&#8212;desperate even&#8212;in their astonished bewilderment at the seeming total lack of practical progress. It is extraordinary that technical advances have led not to practical steps forward but to real steps back&#8212;all because the available improvements cost more.</p><p>All that is being borne stoically by our vulnerable and courageous fellow citizens and veterans who are waiting for an incorrectly allocated, inferior product and who are expected to do so with some sort of old-communist-state gratitude for the privilege.</p><p>I find myself ranting against the sheer ineptitude of it all while recognising that that in itself will not serve much purpose&#8212;but, hey, it is late in the day, and I thank Trish Godman for the opportunity to rant.</p><p>This is the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We are all quick to use politically correct language, sign petitions advocating equality for all our citizens and offer our support for reports that promise that all will be well. However, we are witnessing advantage being taken of a vulnerable group. We should be able to celebrate the extraordinary advances that have been made in wheelchair technology and design, which should be liberating many wheelchair users.</p><p>The failure is as ridiculous as it is shameful. We need resolve&#8212;Parliament has shown it before on a breathtaking scale, with the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. Surely in a modern Scotland, in which every citizen seeks to play their part, a national strategy and a national wheelchair stock of the first order should be achievable?

I was also much struck by David Whitton's speech. All those speeches were in addition to those that were made during George Foulkes's members' business debate in January, <place-holder colnum=\"6622\"/> which was also on the issue of presumed consent. In passing, I might say that things came to a pretty pass today when John Farquhar Munro gave the impression that Lord Foulkes, as a Government minister, initiated this afternoon's debate.</p><p>Having reread the account of the previous debate ahead of today's, I should also state that many fine contributions on this as yet unresolved business were made on that occasion by, among others, Claire Baker, Nanette Milne, Cathie Craigie, Kenneth Gibson and Malcolm Chisholm. Several of them also spoke this afternoon. They all, in one way or another, supported a move towards presumed consent. However, the speakers in the previous debate also included my colleague Mary Scanlon and Roseanna Cunningham, who were more sceptical and restated their reservations this afternoon.</p><p>The cabinet secretary stated ahead of the debate that she hoped that the issues surrounding presumed consent would be aired today. I will return to those issues shortly, but it seems important first to acknowledge that the discussion on improving Scotland's rate of organ donation has been seamless. All parties, when in government, have tested public temperature and made progress.</p><p>As many members have said, the report on which the Government will act is comprehensive. Crucially, if its 14 practical recommendations are acted on as a whole, they have the potential&#8212;according to the task force's chair, Mrs Elisabeth Buggins&#8212;to realise a 50 per cent increase in organ donation in the UK within five years.</p><p>In the previous debate on presumed consent and again this afternoon, Mike Rumbles alluded to the recommendations in their entirety when he made the point that increasing the number of registered donors will not of itself make a manifest difference if the systems for retrieval and proper co-ordination are not vastly improved. That point could not be more emphatically put than it is in the report.</p><p>Much more ought to be achievable on a voluntary basis if it is indeed true that, in opinion polls, some 90 per cent of respondents say that they would be willing donors but only 29 per cent of respondents in Scotland go on to register. Given people's apparent willingness to be donors, surely a more overt soliciting of registration would now be appropriate. I fully support Nanette Milne's comments on that.</p><p>I note the new media campaign that is under way and do not doubt that it is well researched. We know that reactions to such campaigns must always be subjective but&#8212;without wishing to be in any way churlish&#8212;I must say that, unlike George Foulkes and David Whitton, I do not much like <place-holder colnum=\"6623\"/> what I have seen of it so far. While driving to an engagement last Friday, I very nearly collided with one of the new 48-sheet billboard poster sites that feature the campaign. Setting aside the possibility that that was the intention, I wondered whether it was appropriate to confront motorists at a busy traffic junction with a \"Live or die\" challenge. I would prefer an uplifting donor campaign that focuses on the life-enhancing experience of those who have benefited from the gift of organ donation rather than on the ghastly choice that confronts those who need to make the decision at the critical moment. I fear that the campaign may turn some people off, rather than on, when they consider registration.</p><p>I prepared my remarks before I saw the video, which I saw a few moments ago. To me, it seemed like a bleak episode of \"Torchwood\"&#8212;a programme that I normally enjoy&#8212;or like a live-or-let-die phone-in vote in a reality show. It did not suit my taste. However, I hope to be proved wrong and look forward to experiencing all the different elements of the campaign during the month ahead.</p><p>I return to the fact that 93 per cent of the public indicate that they are willing to register. Like others, I wonder whether an invitation to register might accompany key pieces of national domestic mailing, such as council tax notices, electoral roll registration forms and student examination results. I understand that people are already approached by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in that way.</p><p>Ian McKee proposed that the material be included with passport applications. Offence ought not to be taken if the opinion polls are right and people are looking for ways to access registration on a sustainable basis and not just on the back of one burst of media activity. Although, like the cabinet secretary, I am sympathetic to a move towards presumed consent, such a move must follow and not precede our being able to say&#8212;and our being convinced when we say it&#8212;that every possible effort has been made to improve registration by other means. We cannot say that yet.</p><p>The measures that I have described are vital because I fear that, when examined in detail, presumed consent is less attractive to people than their initial reaction suggests. If we proceed with it, we must be confident that the obstacles can be overcome. I agree that any debate on presumed consent must be informed and extended. In view of the recent and seemingly inexhaustible examples of massive losses of computer data, what confidence would the public have in politicians who tried to assure them that their wish to opt out of presumed consent had been properly recorded and would be respected? Members <place-holder colnum=\"6624\"/> should consider on whom the public's wrath would turn if examples of organs being harvested from those who had opted out became part of a future media storm&#8212;and the potential of such examples to undermine confidence in the whole organ donation system.</p><p>Mindful of the personal testimonies that we have heard from the public and from colleagues, we must do all that we can to increase the total number of voluntary registered donors. However, as I said at the start of my speech and as many other members have noted, that is just one aspect of what needs to be done. Co-ordination and retrieval of organs on a UK basis will be the key to our future success.</p><p>In the previous debate on organ donation, Malcolm Chisholm pointed out that a simple comparison with Spain is not a solution because, in Spain, which has one of Europe's highest road death rates, more suitable registered donors become available. That is not a development that we are seeking to encourage. However, there are significant operational lessons to be learned from Spain and other countries, which form part of the package of recommendations that the organ donation task force report urges on us. Conservative members will support the Scottish Government as it acts on those recommendations. We hope that it will ensure, during this parliamentary session, that the problems that need to be overcome to implement the report in its entirety are addressed urgently. The prize will be the many lives that the authors of the report believe will be saved or transformed as a result.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399784", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Organ Donation Task Force Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In a compelling and considered debate, we have heard many admirable speeches from members in all parts of the chamber.

We heard that as many as 40 per cent of pensioners do not claim the pension credit to which they are entitled, 40 per cent do not claim their council tax benefit and 16 per cent do not claim their housing benefit. We must increase the uptake of benefits that are needed and available. I welcome what Nicola Sturgeon said about that.</p><p>Mary Scanlon and others talked about the need to get people off welfare and into work. People too often become entangled in the safety net that used to catch them and then bounce them back. I think that all parties agree that dependency should not be assumed. However, that is not a solution in itself. Homelessness, addiction in all its forms, health inequalities and huge variation in educational attainment all feed poverty.</p><p>Fuel poverty reared its head again today. Many members have drawn our attention to the needs of the estimated 700,000 fuel-poor households. Jamie McGrigor ensured that the issue of rural poverty was heard, and Jamie Stone touched on debt, which is equally important.</p><p>As a response, the Government has published a discussion paper. We will engage in the discussion process and with initiatives to involve the business and independent sectors, although we have noted some jarring remarks in the paper, despite having had only a short time to study it. It is claimed in paragraph 45 that independence will solve poverty, as if no independent small nation has poverty, yet Mary Scanlon contradicted that point by drawing attention to the table on page 17. It is suggested that a local income tax will reduce poverty, but it will shift significant burdens on to others, who might find themselves driven into poverty as a result, to use Alex Neil's phrase.</p><p>The paper says that free prescriptions for higher-rate taxpayers will reduce poverty. Joe FitzPatrick said that that would be a progressive act, but what is progressive about a tax cut for the highest-rate taxpayers, which is what free prescriptions would be? Higher-rate taxpayers tell me that they would be happy for such money to be targeted on people who are in need. Why have a tax cut for higher-rate taxpayers, who are not in poverty, rather than target that money on the people who are in poverty and are the subject of the motion? We also need to do more to bring disadvantaged young people back into work, even while the SNP appears to be cutting the feet from under ProjectScotland.</p><p>I fear that the poverty powwow is being so touted that it will only raise unreasonable expectations of a magic solution.

I have to wonder what Labour members think is the reason why they lost the election. They have to wake up to the fact that it was partly because of the way in which the cabinet secretary's predecessor went around the country, beating his chest and saying, \"Vote for us&#8212;we're going to close down critical primary care facilities.\" Those of us in the West of Scotland who have expressed the gravest reservations about the primary care proposal that is being visited on Glasgow now have legitimate reason to wonder whether that process must be reviewed urgently. Although I accept and fear that we are too far down the road for profound change, surely we have not gone too far for significant marginal change. We need an independent scrutiny process to validate what is being done and to establish whether delivery is on schedule and is proving practical. For example, where are the detailed transport infrastructure plans on which lives will depend? Why are people in Glasgow being denied a scrutiny process that has been granted to their neighbours in the Clyde area?</p><p>I lend my party's support to aid the cabinet secretary's resolve. It seems that some health boards hope that her time in office will be brief, so that they can resume their normal, old style ivory-tower establishment practices. When the crunch comes&#8212;as it will soon enough&#8212;she must face it down. We welcomed the consultation on public participation through direct elections to health board and, when the Government made its statement before Christmas, I highlighted the issues that we feel need to be underpinned.</p><p>My second theme is men: Scottish men, in particular, their attitude to their health and, indeed, the attitude of all those who promote men in the arguments over health. In essence, men have become recklessly disengaged from the debate about their own health. Whenever they feature, they are too often portrayed as boozed-up wife or child beaters or as emaciated victims of chain <place-holder colnum=\"5434\"/> smoking. With regard to sexual health, men will likely feature only if they are gay, as if only gay men are at risk. Last week, for example, when the latest statistics on chlamydia were reviewed, every newspaper that I saw accompanied the report with a picture of a woman, as if chlamydia is a sexual disease that women spread by some form of osmosis, without the involvement of men. My understanding is that that is not so.</p><p>When it comes to prostate cancer, 66 per cent of Scottish men do not even know where the prostate is. Many men cannot even say the word \"prostate\", but confuse it with \"prostrate\", a position in which some men may from time to time find themselves, but which is quite definitely a different thing.</p><p>When it comes to testicular cancer, men would sooner don their pinny for a spot of housework or learn to dance the tango than contemplate self-examination, let alone discuss it. In a nutshell&#8212;for want of a better phrase&#8212;men are dying because they have failed to get organised in anything like the way women have over the health matters that are most pressing for them.</p><p>When I raised that issue with the cabinet secretary, she sought to reassure me that all screening programmes are entered into on the basis of sound advice, but that is only partly true, I think. It would be foolish to deny that lives have been saved not only through breast cancer and cervical cancer screening, but as a result of a well-organised and sustained campaign over many years by women and on behalf of women. That is quite right, too&#8212;I make no complaint&#8212;but where are the men who are prepared to champion their cause?</p><p>One in 14 Scottish men will die of lung cancer, but one in 15 will die of prostate cancer. Every year in Scotland, some 2,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer, 800 of whom die. Worryingly, the increase in the disease's incidence is in men in their 50s. In the United States, 70 per cent of all men know their PSA&#8212;prostate specific antigen&#8212;score, and their partners know it, too. Any man who is over 50 should know his PSA score. It is not a perfect test&#8212;it is understood that we cannot rely on it&#8212;but it is indicative of the disease. What is stopping us promoting an investigation of prostate cancer? I do not seek to make a party-political point on the issue. Indeed, in recent years the Labour Party has been the only party to have referred to prostrate cancer in an election manifesto, but it was the Labour Government that decided against screening.</p><p>A national effort to improve the health of Scotland is being prepared and embraced on numerous fronts. Scots men need to wake up and join the campaign for a culture that puts the discussion of their health and detection of the diseases that threaten their lives on an equal <place-holder colnum=\"5435\"/> footing with the discussion of the health, and the detection of the life-threatening diseases, of Scots women.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13396583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Improvement"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have already said that the Government must be held to account for its record.

We may even welcome it as a rare example of a report delivered by an independent scrutiny panel established by Labour when it was in government.</p><p>It is particularly interesting for me to participate in a debate outwith my normal responsibility&#8212;it has highlighted some key themes and messages to me. One substantiated conclusion of the report, although alarming, is not a surprise. I refer to the finding that, for all the attention and investment that is given to education in primary 1 to primary 3, the differentiation in achievement really takes root in primary 5. Many members have drawn attention to that point this afternoon.</p><p>The finding must call into question the Government's obsession&#8212;and that of some other parties&#8212;with early years class sizes. I note how often the Government is chastised for failing to deliver on key education pledges that it made in its manifesto&#8212;Jeremy Purvis was hot to trot on that this afternoon&#8212;but, ironically, the OECD report's conclusion on early years class sizes may be that the Government's failure to implement its manifesto should be welcomed.</p><p>The fact that the differentiation in achievement takes root in primary 5 is not a surprise, because those who are involved in schools routinely confirm that when they are asked. Children arrive at primary 1 keen to learn. By and large, they see the school, in partnership with their parents, as the source of all knowledge and influence. As any parent will know, P5 is for many, if not for all, a measurable point at which many other influences intervene and the parent ceases to be the source of all wisdom.</p><p>Apparently, it is at P5 that social inequalities kick in and influence&#8212;profoundly&#8212;likely formal education outcomes. Although that is easily said and noted, it is an extraordinary challenge for us all. We can be tribal and argue ritualistically for and against whether all would be well if this or that were different but, as Elizabeth Smith said in opening for the Conservatives, our ambition must be to ensure that success is achieved anywhere with the right and locally appropriate approach, even while we legislate and act elsewhere to tackle obvious social inequality. The differences between us, to which Mary Mulligan drew attention, may not be as real as she imagines.</p><p>It is also a false argument to say that building a lot of new schools is a solution. In Ken Macintosh's constituency, pupils at the new Williamwood high school, which is consistently one of Scotland's best-performing schools, must <place-holder colnum=\"5093\"/> maintain the high standards of their predecessors, which were achieved regularly in much older and less suitable buildings. The logic of overstating the importance of new buildings is that standards will fall when those buildings cease to be new.</p><p>New builds are desirable, especially as they provide new facilities in which a wider social networking and out-of-hours platform of activity can be established, but in themselves they may not produce more engagement or better results. No, it is the recommendation that schools be afforded greater autonomy that offers head teachers the potential to create bespoke schools, to respond to the needs of their pupils and communities, and to act to engage P5 children and sustain that engagement into secondary years.</p><p>An interesting aspect of the report is that it points to the fact that some of our comparator countries with best educational practice are those where there is greater autonomy and diversity in the system. That is particularly true of countries such as Sweden and Australia, although we need look no further than my part of the world&#8212;Glasgow&#8212;where Jordanhill has boasted an outstanding educational record, many would say directly because of its autonomy within the Scottish system.

We support a pilot city academy to deliver vocational education.</p><p>I reaffirm our welcome for the report and our support for its central recommendations to avoid any complacency. Peter Peacock made that point and many others with which I agree. We need to devolve greater autonomy to schools to allow them to make the most of their local situation and talent. We also need to ensure that while we tackle social inequality elsewhere, all schools are able to act to ensure that their P5 pupils remain engaged into their secondary years.

As the constituency member, he is entitled to look to his colleagues in Glasgow and in the West of Scotland region for support&#8212;he and the hospice certainly have my support.</p><p>St Margaret's is an outstanding facility. Our hospices generally are outstanding. They share a commitment to our fellows in the final stages of their lives and discharge that commitment with warmth, compassion and understanding which, when it is encountered at first hand, is profoundly moving. The ability of the people who are dedicated to such a vocation to sustain their commitment in the face of the inevitable, continual <place-holder colnum=\"5028\"/> fading of lives, is inspirational. When people find their way to St Margaret's, as did my wife's aunt in the final stages of her life&#8212;if that is deemed an interest, I declare it&#8212;there is contentment at last for them and for the families that they leave behind.</p><p>After 57 years of compassionate service, St Margaret's does more. St Joseph's ward deals with the terminal stages of life and St Margaret's ward offers 30 beds, which are always occupied, for the continuing care of older people who require complex medical and nursing care. Let it be said clearly&#8212;without in any way denigrating any other facility&#8212;that St Margaret's is a modern, welcoming, magnificently facilitated hospice that has an outstanding team that is led by the thoroughly committed&#8212;formidable, even&#8212;Sister Rita.</p><p>St Margaret's enjoys the wholehearted endorsement of its immediate community and the wider public. It is managed such that the national health service funding that it receives in respect of care for the terminally ill sustains more than twice as many beds as there are at the Prince and Princess of Wales hospice&#8212;another outstanding facility&#8212;which receives comparable funding. That is made possible by committed and professional fundraising staff.</p><p>Why is NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde so belligerently determined on its strategy? Why do I &#8212;a regional member for the West of Scotland&#8212;find time and again that a consultation process that the board has entered into seems to be clumsy, predetermined or structured with a series of options that are designed to support the board's initial ambition? Is that why consultations are widely regarded as half-hearted and insincere, whether they are on the Vale of Leven hospital, the redefining of the role of health visitors, the rehabilitation of people with serious traumatic injuries, hospital car parking charges or the future provision of accident and emergency care? Margaret Curran made that point.</p><p>Why has the discussion on St Margaret's been so thin? Why does the board continue to promote the alternative uses for which Mr Divers persists in speculating that the 30 beds in the St Margaret's ward might be put, although they have been discussed and, by mutual agreement, found to be inappropriate? What sort of consultation is it when it is simply announced to St Margaret's that funding will be withdrawn? Where is persuasive evidence of a lack of need in the west of Glasgow for a facility that is permanently full? Des McNulty made that point convincingly. Why is it that Her Majesty the Queen found time in her schedule to tour St Margaret's but Mr Divers, who is determined to undermine the hospice, has not done so?<place-holder colnum=\"5029\"/></p><p>The board's reasons are perverse. Since May, I have spoken regularly in support of the complementary role that the independent sector can play in assisting with the speedy and effective delivery of NHS patient care. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and I disagree on that, although I always emphasise the complementary nature of independent sector provision. However, in the case of St Margaret's, a not-for-profit facility is to be replaced by a private-sector alternative&#8212;so I find myself on the same side of the argument as Nicola Sturgeon in that regard. Moreover&#8212;and consistent with that position&#8212;Southern Cross, the independent provider, specialises in exactly the sort of nursing and residential care that the board has suggested be accommodated unsuitably with final-stage-of-life care at St Margaret's. The board could make use of Southern Cross in a complementary role elsewhere, without disrupting anyone.</p><p>For 57 years, all those concerned with St Margaret's&#8212;since its first house opened in Millbrae Crescent and since 1971 at its present site, which is now the subject of a &#163;4.3 million investment&#8212;have, by their example of leadership, enjoyed the good reports, gratitude, support and wholehearted endorsement of those they have nursed and their families, and of the wider community. Their record deserves much more respect than the shabby treatment that is being meted out by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. If the weight of public opinion and tangible public support is to mean anything, Sister Rita and all her team should expect St Margaret's to continue to do that at which it excels with confidence, into the future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395717", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Margaret of Scotland Hospice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am happy to congratulate Des McNulty, not just on securing the debate but on his sustained support for the St Margaret of Scotland hospice.

I appreciate that a review is under way. I have lodged motions in relation to Stobhill and other hospitals that are in a similar situation. The management of hospital car parks is undoubtedly a matter for the NHS, but it is clear that the advice given by Malcolm Chisholm during the previous session has been hijacked by some hospital boards, particularly NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, to justify the implementation of car parking charges. It is clear that the advice was never designed to justify the imposition of blanket charging across all hospitals within any health board area&#8212;which is what Greater Glasgow and Clyde is now doing.</p><p>The effect on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde employees is that, even after the discounts that have been offered, the charge will be greater than the net salary increase that they will receive and that the health secretary was keen to promote as a single-phase payment. That is completely unfair and it means that the net earnings of health board employees throughout Scotland vary according to whether they work in an area in which the health board charges for car parking. For health workers at Stobhill, it means that their net earnings are less than those of health workers who do a similar job in an area where the health board does not charge for car parking. I do not see why nurses and health workers should be penalised for having to work unsocial hours and respond to emergencies.</p><p>It is worrying that NHS hospital consolidation in Greater Glasgow and Clyde will require people to travel even further. There is a suggestion in Glasgow that hospital car parking charges are essential because, otherwise, the traffic routes that support, for example, the Southern general, where Stobhill patients will go in future, will not be <place-holder colnum=\"3395\"/> able to cope. That undermines the presumption of the original case.</p><p>I wrote to the cabinet secretary ahead of the announcement of a review, for which I naturally take full credit&#8212;I thank her for that. In her reply, she said that the NHS has a role to play in</p><p class=\"indent\">\"reducing the impact of motor-cars on the environment\"</p><p>and that the board has an obligation</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to encourage the use of public transport\".</p><p>I mulled that statement over, and asked myself why.</p><p>We all agree, as a general proposition, that congestion is something we want to discourage and that we want to reduce unnecessary use of motor cars, but if there is such a thing as unnecessary use of motor cars it begs the question what is necessary use. Hospital visits must fall into the category of justifiable and necessary use of the motor car. Even if public transport were available, we would want it to be as good as possible. Surely we want to encourage people who have a hospital appointment to get a lift with a family friend, and to encourage people to visit patients in hospital on dark evenings. The NHS should therefore have no part to play in reducing car use or making the sick feel guilty by penalising them for using their cars.</p><p>I have paid to park in a hospital car park. When I did, I had to anticipate how long I would be there, because the charge is not a flat fee. I have a vision of elderly patients scurrying around car parks in hospital gowns to feed the meter as they realise that they have been in the hospital for longer than they have paid for. The health board has not made clear what the penalties will be if people exceed their stay. The considerable threat of not anticipating correctly the length of a stay and ending up with a fine could prove to be true.</p><p>In her letter, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing said that she accepted</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that car parking charges are a legitimate response\".</p><p>That is slightly different from what she said in opposition, which was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have seen the introduction of many bad changes like the sky-high parking charges in our hospitals\".</p><p>Brian Adam has referred to the ridiculous</p><p class=\"indent\">\"creeping commercialisation of the NHS\",</p><p>but I have established that private hospitals do not charge for parking. It is ironic and peculiar that if people use a private hospital they do not pay to park, but if they use an NHS hospital, they do.</p><p>The review that is under way must reach a decisive result. The situation is wholly unfair and blanket charging is inappropriate. Stobhill is a <place-holder colnum=\"3396\"/> perfect example of a hospital at which parking charges are not justified.

Why should he not have done so? He, the First Minister and their party had just fought an election during which they had made an unequivocal commitment in print and in speeches that they would recruit an additional 1,000 police officers&#8212;they had been almost foaming at the mouth with indignation and resolve. The money had been set aside; all that was required was an SNP victory and the deal would be done.</p><p>However, the saliva had hardly had time to drip off the end of the ministerial ties when the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and the First Minister began their ignominious retreat, which is breathtaking for the scale of the climbdown and for the complete lack of credible explanation for its rationale.</p><p>What has motivated the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to turn tail? Surely it is not evidence that has been received since the election. The review by the guru of the Labour Party, Professor Arthur Midwinter, confirmed what the SNP and the Conservatives had said, which was that spending increases on police per head in Scotland had fallen way behind those in other constituent parts of the UK. In that context there should be little surprise that recently published reconviction rate figures show that almost half of offenders are back in trouble within two years. This week's gun crime statistics show a 25 per cent increase in injuries resulting from firearms offences during the past year. Politicians are directly to blame, but although the Cabinet Secretary for Justice was happy to fight an election on the side of the angels, he now descends into the abyss.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives continue to believe that there should be a real increase in police numbers. Let us be clear: we are talking about providing 1,500 additional police officers after we have <place-holder colnum=\"2698\"/> redeployed equivalents to the front line and managed retirement capacity. If the Government honoured its explicit and solemn promise to recruit the lesser figure of 1,000 additional police officers, it would make a genuine impact. If Strathclyde Police, which serves the region for which I am a member, were given its pro rata share of the additional recruits, it would gain some 480 officers. That amounts to 50 more officers in the Glasgow central and west division, 41 more in Glasgow north and East Dunbartonshire, 52 more in both Glasgow east and Renfrewshire and Inverclyde, 63 more in Glasgow south and East Renfrewshire, 43 more in Argyll, Bute and West Dunbartonshire, 59 more in North Lanarkshire, 51 more in South Lanarkshire, and 69 more in Ayrshire. A round number such as 1,000 sounds all very well, but individual divisions throughout Scotland were promised additional resource. Those divisions and the communities that they protect are right to feel betrayed by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.</p><p>Will the Cabinet Secretary for Justice come clean?

Those pressures <place-holder colnum=\"2645\"/> are admirably summed up in the motion, which I am happy to support.</p><p>We are all aware of fostering. It is important to say that the skills required&#8212;generosity of spirit and heart&#8212;are found in individuals who are moved to foster not because they are motivated by financial gain in any way but because they have a calling, for want of a better description.</p><p>My direct experience of fostering is virtually non-existent, but some years ago the sister of a close friend, who had a large family of her own, took to fostering with her husband. Hers was a chaotic household with several children of her own competing for their own space and agendas, accompanied by a bewildering array of family pets. The pets were evidence of her huge heart, as more than one had an extraordinary&#8212;reckless, even, as I thought at the time&#8212;budget spent on veterinary bills to keep it going when others, me included, might have opted for a quieter alternative. It was evidence of her nature that she would do her best for the animal whatever.</p><p>I dropped round over the months; some foster children would have come and gone, others would have stayed longer. I particularly remember one child&#8212;who on my earlier visits had spent the day curled up under a table in the corner&#8212;emerging and becoming an engaged and happy member of the family. The satisfaction of that was the couple's real reward. It struck me that theirs was not a household of intellectuals or high achievers but a happy home where the adults had a huge capacity to give and to be interested in the well-being of children other than their own. That is the sort of commitment that deserves financial reward and that should be rewarded more regularly by our national honours system.</p><p>Christine Grahame's motion highlights the increasing need for such people to come forward and for them to be certain that their capacity to offer an essential fostering environment will be properly compensated. In particular, there is a need for people from minority communities, in which there is an acute shortage of foster carers, to come forward. Sadly, there is a greater requirement for foster carers now than ever before and, if it is a consequence of the same factors that arise in other areas of public policy, it is set to continue to grow.</p><p>Regrettably, we now need to intervene as early as birth if it is apparent that there is a history of addiction to alcohol or drugs that may well have started with the grandparents, plagued the mother&#8212;likely a single mother at that&#8212;and left the child with potential health deficiencies that need third-party intervention and care if they are to be addressed at all. Then there are children who are abused or children to whom fate deals a sudden and unexpectedly cruel hand. They all share one <place-holder colnum=\"2646\"/> thing: they are vulnerable and in need of our engagement&#8212;as are children all the way through to young adulthood.</p><p>Such children need to be cared for. It is not a question of foster care or nothing. The state and our councils have a responsibility to intervene, and a cost will attach itself to the care of such a child if they are placed in a formal facility. There are alternatives: care in a home or foster care. Evidence shows that most children want to be part of a family, to have the chaotic buzz, excitement and normality that the family of my friend's sister provided. From what we can establish, the outcomes for children in foster care are, generally, better, for obvious reasons.</p><p>The argument should not be whether foster carers are paid and whether that represents some huge additional commitment&#8212;the care of every child will have a cost in any event. What the motion seeks to establish is that, if foster caring is desirable&#8212;we all believe that it is&#8212;the cost of caring for a child should be willingly paid to the foster carer at an appropriate rate, not on a discretionary basis, as sometimes happens.</p><p>It might not always be possible to find a suitable foster home, and that might be even more difficult if the shortage that is now evident becomes ever more acute. If, however, we can encourage an increased fostering community and ensure that it is paid for the costs that are associated with caring for any child, we should do so&#8212;particularly after the commitment that is shown by foster carers&#8212;partly in recognition of the exhaustive approval process that they have gone through to achieve that status.</p><p>Not everyone has a natural capacity to foster. We should recognise that and be grateful to those who do. Christine Grahame is right: the problem is not in retreat. The shortage is current and urgent.

Enjoying the Conservative party conference in Blackpool as I was, it goes without saying that I am elated to have returned early to contribute to the debate.</p><p>Only last week, in a characteristically dynamic contribution, Charlie Gordon advised the Conservatives that we were set for an imminent electoral drubbing&#8212;that from a man who, just a few short months ago, had confidently predicted that his party and not the Scottish National Party would form the next Scottish Government. When it comes to predicting election outcomes, Mr Gordon might care to reflect that Labour fools rush in where we Tory angels fear to tread.</p><p>The far-reaching findings of the Crerar report illustrate what can unfold when politicians, however well meaning they are, try to micromanage every aspect of our lives. The words that are used to describe the outcome of such meddling will always be the same&#8212;complicated, burdensome, complex, inefficient, expensive and wasteful. I could go on but I am sure that members get the picture.</p><p>Professor Crerar was asked to evaluate the system of external scrutiny that the previous Executive had built up during its eight years in power but which had, as Tavish Scott fairly stated, existed far longer than the lifetime of the Scottish Parliament. How did Professor Crerar sum it up? Why, he did so with the adjectives that I reeled off a moment ago. Given that that was always going to be the potential outcome of the report, the previous Administration deserves to be applauded <place-holder colnum=\"2356\"/> for having been prepared to set forward Professor Crerar with the report that he has completed.</p><p>It is little wonder that Professor Crerar paints a depressing picture. As he points out, since devolution we have seen the creation of 11 new scrutiny bodies with many of the organisations established beforehand seeing their responsibilities increased, and the cost to the taxpayer of all this direct scrutiny increasing by more than half during the past four years alone&#8212;from &#163;60 million to more than &#163;90 million. In 2005-06, direct costs that were racked up by Audit Scotland, the care commission, and HMIE increased by 20 per cent, 35 per cent and 95 per cent respectively.</p><p>Another point that has not been mentioned so far, but which I find striking, is the extent to which the bureaucratic edifice of regulation has drained experienced people from front-line public services. The natural place from which to recruit experienced people into the regulatory bodies is among people who were previously doing the job. I have often been struck by the number of people whom I meet&#8212;including friends&#8212;who have worked in public services and have then gone on to accept jobs in the regulatory authorities, often at higher remuneration, to regulate the people who do the job that they previously did. It is a shame and it is regrettable that people with talent who work on the ground and in proper front-line services are being lost to the regulatory bodies. The career path for people in public service should not be to aspire to go into the regulatory body.</p><p>However, I suppose that it would be worse if the regulatory bodies&#8212;as is sometimes the case&#8212;were full of people who had no experience of the industry that they are set to regulate. Where that happens, the people in those industries resent the fact that the regulators do not seem to know much about the job, or seem unsympathetic to it. That is also a concern.</p><p>Those who hope for tax increases because they imagine that such a policy will put more police on our streets, more health workers in our hospitals and more teachers in our schools would do well to reflect on the Crerar report. If one takes into account the fact that the figures in the report relate only to one isolated area of our public sector, one can understand how difficult it is to exaggerate the amount of money that can be wasted when it is put into the hands of politicians who embrace public expenditure as an end in itself.</p><p>As Derek Brownlee and Elaine Murray pointed out, the regulatory bodies sometimes seem to have been constituted to regulate a fear, inspired by a single incident, that a general public service will fail. Part of the practice of all Governments has been to say that they will increase duplication, bureaucracy and waste by, among other things, <place-holder colnum=\"2357\"/> providing for a burgeoning external scrutiny industry. External scrutiny has often been used as a way to counter risk through a series of knee-jerk reactions that have been thrown together. External scrutiny has then often become an obstacle to those who seek to deliver public services.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crerar Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I express my regrets at having missed the cabinet secretary's opening speech and part of Andy Kerr's speech.

That is the first time that I have heard the SNP deploying the nuclear weapons argument in favour of its patients' rights bill. Jamie Hepburn said that there had been no legal intervention yet as a result of the patients' rights bill in Norway, but that is because patients in Norway have the choice of treatment in an independent hospital or abroad. If the SNP is to rule that option out and prevent the private sector from making any contribution, it is entirely predictable and correct to say that more lawyers will be involved and that they will be parading down the corridors of the NHS.</p><p>Helen Eadie reminded us that the SNP is now contributing to government not only in the chamber but in minority councils throughout Scotland. As I have said before, the record that it is laying down is the record on which it will be judged in due course.</p><p>Nicola Sturgeon said that patients have been waiting for a very long time. I do not think that they have been waiting for the patients' rights bill; they have been waiting for more effective treatment. Had she visited the Vale of Leven demonstration a couple of weeks ago, she would have seen health campaigners bring before the meeting dozens of reports from previous health secretaries, all of whom have said that they will put patients first. How can patients be put first if we rule out options that would treat them faster? The SNP makes \"private\" sound peevish and sinister. Stuart McMillan went on at great length about a great conspiracy to privatise the NHS. With the exception of the SNP, all the other parties, which have a far greater tradition either for or against the <place-holder colnum=\"2204\"/> traditional private sector, accept that there is a role for the independent sector in bringing about more effective treatment of patients. I implore the cabinet secretary, not because I love her&#8212;who could love this Administration more than it loves itself?&#8212;but because I want the Administration to succeed in its objective of reducing hospital waiting times, to reconsider her approach. I do not see how the Administration can achieve that objective if it is determined to deny itself one of the key ways in which the result could be achieved.</p><p>With a heavy heart and with due deference to the derision that I think should choke the Liberal Democrats, we believe that the questions asked in the motion deserve to be answered.

As an employer for more than 25 years in the motor industry, which involves many disciplines and employs people with all levels of skills and ability, I believe that it was part of our duty to offer employment, when appropriate, to those who had served their sentence. That typically included young males aged 16 to 30, to whom Alex Neil referred, many of whom had demonstrated a fascination with cars. Crucial to our approach was our belief that those whom we were considering had paid their penalty and were willing themselves to seize a better future. It was not always easy and we did not always pick winners. At one time, we employed the late Arthur Thompson Jr; there are some tales about that that I have yet to read in any book and would still be reluctant to discuss. Generally, there were issues of anonymity, and colleagues had some legitimate concerns, but we had our successes too.</p><p>If our system is to work, employers throughout Scotland must accept their responsibility to bring those who have served their sentence back into the workforce. However, that is barely mentioned as a priority in our penal policy. How many proactive initiatives have there been to reassure, encourage or incentivise employers? I did not see one in 25 years as an employer in a business that operated throughout central Scotland and employed several hundred people.</p><p>I acknowledge the role of the Prince's Trust and the other organisations that Alex Neil identified, but we need a bolder vision of working with employers to reduce reoffending. But&#8212;here is the but&#8212;for rehabilitation to work, everyone must have confidence in what has gone before, not just the public and potential future employers but those caught and sentenced. If they believe that for most crimes they will be out and about within a football season, they will think, \"Why bother?\" The reoffending rates prove that point.</p><p>If we are to make our penal policy progressive, we must act from a position of strength.

In that spirit, I begin by repeating the objections that other members have made to the SNP's proposed flagship grant of &#163;2,000 to first-time buyers. The proposal would be expensive; in 2005, such a grant would have cost some &#163;272 million if it had been taken up by the 34,000 first-time buyers. We cannot see how such a grant would be meaningful. We share the view that has been expressed inside and outside the chamber that it might simply be taken for granted and incorporated into property price inflation.</p><p>However, there is a more fundamental inconsistency. In recent weeks, both the First Minister and John Swinney have said that they object strongly to the Scottish Conservatives' proposal to extend a council tax discount of 50 per cent to pensioners as the discount would be <place-holder colnum=\"1073\"/> universal to all pensioners, which would mean that it would assist better-off pensioners. However, does not the SNP's grant do exactly the same thing? Will not all first-time buyers benefit, irrespective of income? Alex Salmond said that the Queen would benefit from our proposal, as she would get a 50 per cent council tax rebate on Balmoral. However, surely, if Prince William or Prince Harry choose to set up home in Scotland, they will benefit from the first-time buyer grant. That is where the minister and the First Minister stand&#8212;they are sometime republicans who are set to launch an initiative, the unintended consequence of which might be to encourage a series of young royals to come to Scotland, tempted by the prospect of a bung from the Scottish Executive for a deposit on their first country estate. How very egalitarian.</p><p>Not only is the SNP's policy hugely expensive, it is the wrong response and represents a monumental inconsistency in the principles at the heart of the Government. Why should taxpayers subsidise those who can, ultimately, afford to buy their own home? In any event, if concern for first-time buyers is sincerely held by all the other parties, why did they support Gordon Brown's abolition of the mortgage interest relief at source scheme, which hit first-time buyers especially hard? I well remember the Liberal Democrats in Westminster salivating at the prospect of the abolition of MIRAS.</p><p>However, we share the ambition of the SNP to release more public land for housing and will support initiatives to bring that about. We support action on Communities Scotland and look forward with anticipation to the minister's bold thinking in that regard. As Mary Scanlon and Jamie McGrigor have said, there are clear parallels between the SNP's Scottish housing trust fund and the Conservatives' affordable homes trust. We have urged the SNP to overcome its serial objection to the involvement of the private sector, particularly in this area, in which such involvement would have a profound effect, and I am glad to note that the SNP appears to have done so. The involvement of the private sector would make a great difference to first-time buyers and people who undertake essential community roles in nursing, teaching, the police and fire brigades and who are urgently in need of affordable homes in the places where today's report says that, in just three years, the percentage of homes deemed to be unaffordable has increased alarmingly.</p><p>I hope that the Executive will listen to us and work with us&#8212;whether or not Tricia Marwick thinks that our scheme is preferable&#8212;to give effect to a policy that will make a real difference.</p><p>The Executive's proposals do nothing about the depressing 46 per cent rise since 1997 in the <place-holder colnum=\"1074\"/> number of homeless people and the 123 per cent rise since 1999 in the number of families living in temporary accommodation. That is a grim legacy. I pay tribute to Willie Coffey's thoughtful remarks in that regard.</p><p>There is no single solution. However, we believe that housing stock transfer offered meaningful progress and we will continue to urge an area-by-area transfer, which, it seems, the minister has agreed to this afternoon&#8212;an even bigger U-turn than hitherto, and the antithesis of the blistering rhetoric employed by the SNP in relation to local referenda. The obvious financial and vital investment benefit is too great to allow us to walk away from the recent difficulty. The option might not strike everyone as being ideal, but it is the only big-bucks show in town and it will make a real difference.</p><p>Poor-quality housing is one of the issues that is at the heart of our poor public health record and, frankly, hope is not a strategy.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385846", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish National Party's fountain of charm, which Mary Scanlon mentioned only a week ago, has suddenly dried up.

It had the immortal catch line:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"She promised to follow him to the end of the earth and he promised to deliver it\".</p><p>It was one of many entertaining posters in a campaign that reached a crescendo in the 1980s and then collapsed, not because it naturally ran out of steam, but because events demonstrated that all those who had passionately fought in its support had been wrong. In essence, those who were wrong then are posing the same arguments again now. The Conservative Government stood alone at first, but then, as it was shown to be right to endure the political pain that was endured by standing firm, we were joined by less consistently brave souls. The majority of the public in the UK consistently supported a nuclear defence strategy.</p><p>The end of the cold war, which was a massive personal political achievement for President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, was the decisive moment in the history of post-war Europe&#8212;I thank the Greens for giving the Scottish Parliament an opportunity to pay a fulsome and heartfelt tribute to President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher. With President Gorbachev, who recognised the resolve that an increasingly discredited Soviet Union could not match, those politicians made our lives materially more secure and, by extension, liberated a continent not only from a menacing shadow, but literally with respect to the democratic and revolutionary changes thereafter.</p><p>When the last real Labour Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, secretly upgraded Polaris, which paved the way for Trident, he could not have foreseen what lay 20 years ahead. The inability of any politician to foresee events not just for their own generation but for the next generation must inform <place-holder colnum=\"724\"/> any decision that is taken now. I accept that the situation now is totally different: there is no natural or immediately credible target against which to aim our missiles with certainty. Some conclude from that that there is no threat or that such threat as there is is so general and non-governmental or regime generated that a nuclear response is superfluous&#8212;ludicrous, even. I think that that was what Bruce Crawford argued, but the failure of that argument is that such a position serves only for today.</p><p>Just as Callaghan, Thatcher and Reagan could not foresee the demise of the cold war threat, Westminster&#8212;the responsibility in question lies there&#8212;is now considering, and preparing for, a future in which we can only imagine, and cannot know, the prevailing dangers to our country. Jim Tolson may have changed his mind, but if he changes his mind again in 10 years' time, it will be too late if we have not made the appropriate investment.</p><p>I support what Jackie Baillie and John Park said. People who work in the community in question should not be made to feel that they are doing anything other than proudly participating in the defence of their country.</p><p>We have chuntered on with another example of the student union politics that the Parliament should eschew. The Green party, which lodged the motion, should, like any other party, reflect on why it suffered defeats last month. However, as I said, if we must have such a debate, we must.</p><p>The world is every bit as uncertain now as the future is unpredictable, and our judgment should be no different from that of the previous generation. Trident remains essential to our future security. We are not required to love it, but our well-being demands that we have it.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384882", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What an indulgence this debate is: it will have all   the force of the early to mid-1980s nuclear-free council nonsense, with their nuclear-free bin bags.

What Conservative would not preface their remarks on law and order and justice&#8212;the great cri de coeur of the so-called Tory faithful&#8212;with the claim made by other members in their first speeches, that the issue is close to their heart?</p><p>I wish the new cabinet secretary every good fortune in his responsibility. As a new boy, I am happy to say&#8212;perhaps naively&#8212;that it has struck me that it has been a hallmark of the new Administration in its early days to convey a sense of the privilege of serving in Government. I welcome that and hope that it will not diminish. To me, at least, it has been a breath of fresh air, which contrasts sharply with the assumption of a divine right to rule that characterised the impression that Mr MacAskill's predecessors routinely gave, both in Government&#8212;and, for the moment, at least&#8212;in opposition.</p><p>It is a pleasure to welcome to office an Administration that is directly committed to increasing the ranks of front-line police officers. Little mention has been made of the fact that we share that objective&#8212;the SNP committed to providing 1,000 more police officers, while we committed to an additional 1,500. It would be <place-holder colnum=\"422\"/> interesting to know how the SNP arrived at its requirement figure; come to that, it would be interesting to know how we arrived at ours. The answer, of course, is through consultation&#8212;but no matter. We are agreed on the need and look forward to supporting initiatives to give it effect at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Critical to making the recruitment of those additional police officers effective will be a resolve to have them concentrate on the prevention and detection of crime and not to have them sidetracked with worthy&#8212;and sometimes less than worthy&#8212;additional but less essential responsibilities.</p><p>I am a west of Scotland man, born and raised in East Renfrewshire, which is sometimes parodied as a Shangri-la residential community for wealthy business leaders. In truth, many business leaders, entrepreneurs and owners of small, medium and large businesses reside there&#8212;it is a wonderful place for families to live. I fought and, admittedly, lost the constituency last month to Kenneth Macintosh. It may well have been our safest seat in the 1990s, but it is a difficult seat to win back, not least when one's socialist opponent looks and sounds more like a Conservative than the official Tory candidate.</p><p>It is a community that has witnessed more sensational crime in recent times. We now have our own local experience of residents having been shot on their doorsteps, been subject to machete attacks or assaulted and violently raped as they waited at a bus stop to go to work on a Sunday morning. I mention that because East Renfrewshire's superintendent of police recently broke cover and said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Blame politicians for the lack of cops&#8212;People want more Police Officers on the beat. I do as well.\"</p><p>Crucially, Superintendent Daniels noted:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The job has changed so much over the past three years and we now have to meet an ever increasing level of new priorities. Officers are being taken away from the front line to fulfil specialist roles ... family protection, drug enforcement. Where have they come from? The front line. We can't provide the level of cover people think we can.\"</p><p>Such expressions of concern should have rung alarm bells with the former Executive, but instead they were met with seeming indifference. I hope that the new minister will match his commitment to increase police recruitment with an equal determination to bring about a fresh focus on front-line policing.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has trailed tackling youth crime as a priority, which he has coupled with a desire for the law-abiding majority to be encouraged and rewarded. I commend him on that and, of the various proposals that he has made today, I particularly welcome the ambition to <place-holder colnum=\"423\"/> reinstate the Airborne Initiative. He will no doubt tread carefully to avoid the package being characterised as an initiative to hug a MacHoodie, but I remind him of the statement at the front of the justice section of his party's manifesto:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"People are tired of excuses for bad behaviour and it is time that we dealt firmly and effectively with the crime and anti-social behaviour that disrupts the lives of too many of our citizens.\"</p><p>Quite.</p><p>I urge him to embrace our suggestion to ensure that 14 and 15-year-old persistent offenders are presented to youth courts and that children's hearings have the power to issue drug treatment and testing orders. We cannot escape the fact that non-custodial sentences have had mixed reviews, so sending a signal that there will be a presumption that all sentences of less than six months' duration will be served in the community&#8212;even if that is recommended by an eminent professor&#8212;does not, on the basis of what has gone before, meet the challenge. What is a tough community sentence?</p><p>I have two further brief points on policing. First, as in other public services, we have an ageing workforce&#8212;many officers are due to retire. Any recruitment programme that seeks to increase the complement of new officers must be ambitious enough to attract and train sufficient staff to address the retirement blip before it can achieve the new complement total.</p><p>Secondly, I wonder whether there might not be more of a role for recently retired officers&#8212;officers who are actually retiring in their prime. By forming a Dad's Army corps, if you will, they could usefully augment the responsibility of the current active force to meet its community ambassadorial role. I say augment because I appreciate the desire of the police to remain active in community work, but such a resource&#8212;casually retained and vastly experienced&#8212;could make a significant contribution to the release of officers for front-line policing. I recognise that that ambition may not be realisable, but it is worth exploring.</p><p>Annabel Goldie led the campaign against the former, much discredited automatic early release scheme. The former Executive defended that scheme with breathtaking passion until the day that it decided not to defend it with breathtaking passion and to rename it and replace it, not with something stronger but with something inherently weaker. For whatever reason, the SNP was duped into supporting that decision when in opposition. Perhaps in Government the SNP will see the need for tough, fair and honest sentencing&#8212;it will have our support and that of the Scottish public if it does.<place-holder colnum=\"424\"/></p><p>A new Administration has the chance to breathe new life into the flagging morale of the police officers with whom I have spoken&#8212;and of those who support them&#8212;who do such a terrific job on our behalf. They have grown weary of lavishly expressed votes of thanks that are never matched by a practical understanding of the demands of the many new roles placed upon them.</p><p>Inevitably, the new Executive will have views with which we may disagree and that we will challenge. However, we and they are both committed to a direct increase in the number of police officers and their redeployment to front-line policing. Let us make common purpose and early progress on that essential investment.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384171", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Safer and Stronger"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to make my first speech on a subject that is traditionally guaranteed to rouse any Conservative conference from its afternoon nap.
