It did so after receiving evidence that criminalising forced marriage could drive the problem further underground, as victims would be less likely to come forward if the consequence of doing so would be a criminal record for their family.</p><p>Instead, the Parliament introduced its own legislation in 2011. It considered that the Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011 struck the right balance. Instead of criminalising the act itself, a civil remedy was introduced that allowed individuals or authorities to apply for forced marriage prevention orders. Crucially, only at the point at which a breach of such an order occurred would the matter become a criminal offence.</p><p>The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill introduces a new criminal offence of using violence, threats or any other form of coercion for the purpose of causing another person to enter into marriage without their free and full consent. Therefore, forced marriage is to become a criminal offence that will carry a custodial sentence of up to seven years.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s position is that criminalisation is necessary for the Istanbul convention, to which the UK is signed up, to be ratified. However, the committee heard conflicting evidence on whether the criminalisation of the act was necessary. In addition, the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to ask for an LCM seems to be heavily based on the need to conform with the convention.

Instead, the consultation that was carried out was conducted in other parts of the UK, and it has been relied on. It showed that a significant minority were opposed to criminalisation. The consideration of the issue has been hurried. Apart from the committee&#8217;s brief evidence session, stakeholders in Scotland have not been given the opportunity to comment on the forced marriage provisions in the LCM.

However, that does not mean that there is only one solution to the problem.</p><p>In seeking to fall in line with the UK proposal on forced marriage, the Scottish Government has put forward two main arguments. In the first place, the Government states that there is a need to fill the gap and legislate to ensure consistency across the UK. That is not a convincing argument in relation to forced marriage, as the law here and the law south of the border have never been consistent on that. Indeed, in Scotland it was considered that, with the introduction of the Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011 and the balance that was struck in the approach to criminalise only when an FMPO was breached, the law here offered a better solution to tackle the abhorrent problem.</p><p>Secondly, while giving evidence to the Justice Committee, the Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport, Shona Robison, stated that the Scottish Government was keen to conduct research on the effect of criminalisation, admitting that</p><p>&#8220;at this stage in our knowledge, we do not know what the effect of the legislation would be&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 10 December; c 3946.]</p><p>As John Pentland pointed out, the minister went on to promise that research would be forthcoming but that it would be done alongside adopting the UK Government legislation.

That, coupled with the conflicting evidence that the committee heard on whether the current approach to forced marriage in Scotland satisfied the requirements under the Istanbul convention, would have made it not unreasonable to take some time to look at this important issue again, especially in view of Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s comments in the debate about ratification.</p><p>Disappointingly, the Government has made it clear that it will support the LCM this evening, so the political reality is that the LCM is guaranteed to be approved.

The negative impact of that on young people&#8217;s attitudes towards violence and on their own safety and self-esteem must not be underestimated.</p><p>Research carried out by Dr Nancy Lombard confirms that those attitudes exist and goes on to challenge the distorted and grotesque view that somehow male violence towards women is acceptable. Dr Lombard also advocates early intervention for children as young as pre-five to prevent those attitudes from being perpetuated.</p><p>What is not in doubt is that children are the innocent victims who are caught up in and have to live with domestic abuse, and we all seek to eradicate that situation. Currently, the concentration on outcomes for offenders tends to overshadow efforts to provide help for those who are directly and indirectly affected by domestic abuse. In carrying out essential work to support those victims in an informal and safe setting, the CEDAR network addresses that imbalance.</p><p>The project began in Fife, Edinburgh and Forth Valley and now extends into South Lanarkshire and other parts of Scotland. In South Lanarkshire, the CEDAR project&#8212;or, to give it its full title, the children experiencing domestic abuse recovery project&#8212;is run by Women&#8217;s Aid and builds on existing CEDAR work in the area. This involves mothers and children assessing pre, parallel and post-support programmes. It will benefit 216 children and young people and 120 mothers in South Lanarkshire over a three-year period.</p><p>Violence generally, and this kind in particular, can and does ruin lives, which is why tackling it must be made a priority. That makes sense on a number of levels. As well as there being an obvious emotional impact of violence in the home, a study conducted by the United Kingdom Government shows that there is a financial cost, which is estimated to be a staggering &#163;4&#160;billion a year. In addition, Police Scotland is estimated to spend an average of six hours on a domestic abuse incident.

Those include educating owners on how best to train and control their dogs, intervening on irresponsible owners and tough sentencing, including banning orders that disqualify a person from owning a dog. The question is whether those measures are sufficiently robust and are working in practice. I therefore welcome the Government&#8217;s decision to consider whether further measures such as compulsory microchipping&#8212;which is to be introduced in England and Wales next year and which can benefit all dog owners&#8212;are necessary.</p><p>It is important not to exaggerate microchipping&#8217;s potential impact on responsible ownership. The Government has revealed that it is estimated that only 50 per cent of dog owners held a licence at the time when mandatory licensing of dogs was abolished. That highlights the problems to do with enforcement. Irresponsible owners will continue to be irresponsible. It would therefore make sense for breeders to be required to microchip the puppies and dogs that they sell.</p><p>Compulsory muzzling of all dogs would be excessive and would penalise the vast majority of dog owners, who are responsible and whose dogs present no threat to the public. Furthermore, it would do nothing to prevent the vicious attacks that take place in the home. Nor would it help to address dog attacks on Royal Mail postmen and women&#8212;there are more than 100 such attacks in Scotland each year. However, the home assessments to which Paul Martin and Christine Grahame referred would certainly help in that regard.</p><p>There should be a move towards tougher banning orders for irresponsible owners and harsher penalties for breaching a dog control notice. South of the border, measures are to be introduced to increase the maximum sentence for an owner whose dog injures or kills, which should help to address the problem of dangerous dogs being bred and trained to act as weapons for their owners. The penalties should be equivalent to sentences for the use of conventional weapons. Such dogs are a world apart from the hundreds and thousands of dogs in Scotland that are not just pets but integral members of the family.</p><p>I very much welcome the Government&#8217;s consultation, but it is essential that measures that are taken to prevent irresponsible dog ownership are fair to the vast majority of owners who have well-behaved dogs. The real objective and difficulty will be to strike the right balance between sending an uncompromising message to irresponsible dog owners, who range from hapless individuals to people who breed dogs with the intention of using them to cause injury, and recognising the rights of responsible dog owners and dog lovers&#8212;among whom I count myself and declare an interest, as the owner of 15-month-old West Highland terriers Jack and Jamie.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830452", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dog Control Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Paul Martin for bringing this important debate to the chamber.

As the minister, the committee&#8217;s convener and other members have pointed out, and as all MSPs know from their constituents&#8217; cases, the provisions within it relating, for example, to the factoring of properties, impact on peoples&#8217; lives and their relationships with their neighbours.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s response to the report&#8217;s recommendations was published in September 2013.

However, due to the pressure of the legislative programme and the priority that is given to introducing new legislation, the debate is only now taking place.</p><p>The inquiry was relatively short and covered only one part of the 2003 act. It is significant that, despite that, the committee felt it necessary to make as many as 11 recommendations. I will concentrate on a couple of the major ones, starting with the concerns surrounding the dismissal and appointment of factors. Of concern is the 30-year period that prevents owners of properties that were previously the responsibility of local authorities from switching factors. Clearly, that period is too long, which is why the committee recommended that the timescale be reviewed. The Government rejected that recommendation and instead stated that the Property Factors (Scotland) Act 2011 should be allowed to bed in before further changes were made. Although it is a pity that the recommendation was not accepted, it is, nonetheless, welcome that the 2011 act introduces a code of conduct for factors and more regulation.</p><p>It is important that the application of those provisions is closely monitored, as the issue of switching factors was of concern in the debate surrounding the 2011 act and remains a concern now. The minister&#8217;s assurances in that regard are appreciated.</p><p>The committee also heard about the problems that are associated with the appointment and dismissal of landowning land maintenance companies that have been well documented in today&#8217;s debate and have been detailed by my colleague John Lamont. I very much welcome the Government&#8217;s agreement to introduce a new code of conduct for those companies.</p><p>Concern was also expressed about the operation of section 53, which gives rights to enforce restrictions on property to arguably too many owners.

In these areas, a worrying trend is emerging. Although the incidence of other crimes, including violent crime, is falling, the statistics show that violence against women appears to be on the rise. Last year, more than 60,000 domestic abuse incidents were recorded, which is nearly double the figure of 10 years ago. In the same time period, incidents resulting in a report to the procurator fiscal have risen from 9,000 to more than 23,000. Rape and attempted rape are also at a historic high, and sexual assaults rose by 3 per cent last year. Although that increase is partly due to increases in awareness and the commendable efforts of the Government, voluntary organisations and the police to encourage victims to come forward, the statistics nonetheless make for depressing reading.</p><p>Violence against women can and does ruin lives. Based on a study that was conducted for the United Kingdom Government, violence against women is estimated to cost &#163;4 billion a year. The emotional cost and damage is beyond measure.</p><p>Quite simply, for significant progress to be made on tackling and seeking to eliminate violence against women, the Parliament&#8212;with a majority Government, that means the Scottish National Party&#8212;must do more than merely reaffirm its commitment to tackling this violence in its ever-increasing forms.</p><p>The harsh reality is that women are being let down by sentencing that is not as robust as it should be. Only 12 per cent of those who were convicted of domestic abuse were handed custodial sentences, and the vast majority of them were sentenced to less than six months, which are the very sentences that the Scottish Government has taken steps to phase out.</p><p>Zero tolerance of domestic abuse is being let down by zero sentencing. When many of the perpetrators of this violence are being let off so lightly, it is not surprising that many women question whether the violence that is perpetrated against them is taken seriously. Furthermore, almost a third of those who are convicted in court are admonished and, to add insult to injury, the automatic early release of prisoners means that the vast majority of these violent criminals are released after serving only half their sentence.

Amendment 25 makes it clear that when referring to an alleged crime&#8212;that is, one that has not yet been proved in court&#8212;the use of the term &#8220;victim&#8221; would not prejudice the presumption of innocence.

In reality, no legislation can be drafted to cover every eventuality. As is the case with any piece of legislation, if changes are necessary further amendment can be made. The important point is that by linking the definition to offences we would ensure that it automatically applied to victims as the nature of crime changed and when new offences were legislated for.</p><p>Amendment 25 is intended to cover natural persons and legal entities in three sets of circumstances: when a crime is directly committed against the person; when a relative or dependant of a person suffers harm as a result of a crime that was committed against the person; and when a person suffers as a result of intervening to help another person, against whom a crime is being committed.</p><p>&#8220;Harm&#8221; is defined in such a way as to cover physical or emotional harm, economic loss and damage to property.</p><p>It seems strange that a bill that confers a range of rights on victims of crime does not include a definition of &#8220;victim&#8221;. The inclusion of a clear definition would help to provide clarity for individuals in what might be traumatic circumstances, thereby helping them to avoid further distress and anxiety. There is little point in making things easier for victims if we are unclear about who victims are.</p><p>A definition would assist the police, the Crown and the Scottish Court Service in determining and complying with their duties and obligations under the bill.

Worryingly, and astonishingly, David McKenna of Victim Support Scotland told the committee that victims have to tell their story &#8220;around 16 times&#8221; to various agencies, which clearly should not be necessary and can only add to victims&#8217; distress.</p><p>Amendment 28 seeks to tackle this problem for the first time in legislation, through a requirement that the Lord Advocate, Police Scotland and the Scottish Court Service work together on the provision of information to victims. Crucially, it would require all victims and witnesses to be offered a single point of contact to help them through the justice process. The amendment would provide for properly trained individuals to give much-needed support to victims, who are currently not treated with compassion or given the time that they deserve in all cases. To provide someone who can answer questions and offer support in what can be a very daunting process for witnesses does not seem to me to be a particularly arduous requirement&#8212;it should be a bare minimum.</p><p>If the cabinet secretary is really serious that things should be made easier for victims, amendment 28 is necessary. Justice organisations might be considering or discussing how they can work together, but legislating to require them to do so will certainly focus their minds and make sure that it is a priority.</p><p>Furthermore, despite the cabinet secretary having talked consistently about improvements for victims over many years now, little has been achieved.

The key findings of the research make for concerning reading: 72 per cent of trials involved an application to introduce sexual history or character evidence, and only 7 per cent of those applications were refused. Despite the cabinet secretary&#8217;s assurance that the Crown Office has comprehensive guidance in place to ensure that victims are given a full explanation of exactly why any sensitive information is sought, the fact of the matter is that, in practice, that guidance is not effective and is failing to protect complainers.</p><p>Rape Crisis Scotland&#8217;s on-going research on the information that is sought makes compelling reading, too. Nearly 60 per cent of those who have responded said that they felt that they had had no choice but to provide sensitive information, and 35 per cent said that no one had explained to them why the information was being looked at. Less than 15 per cent said that they were clear about why the information had been requested. The concerns about inappropriate use of such evidence, which is designed to play to a jury&#8217;s prejudices, are well documented.</p><p>Amendments 29, 30 and 31 reflect some of the points that were raised at stage 2. Amendment 29 would allow independent legal advice to be offered to victims of sexual offences as soon as the police, the Crown or the defence sought to access health or other sensitive records. More often than not, that is when the complainer is at their most vulnerable, which is why independent legal representation at that point is so important, especially as complainers and victims feel that they have no choice but to consent.</p><p>Therefore, it is the intention that such legal advice will be offered to victims and that some form of financial support will be available for that. Amendment 29 leaves it open for the Scottish Government to set up a dedicated fund, if appropriate. It would, of course, be open for legal aid to be extended to include provision of such independent legal advice, although further amendments would be required to allow that to happen.</p><p>Importantly, amendment 30 would allow the Scottish Government to run a pilot to assess how provision of independent legal advice would work in practice and to collect much-needed data. Rape Crisis Scotland has been in touch with Scotland&#8217;s largest law centre, the Legal Services Agency, which tackles the unmet legal needs of disadvantaged people. One of the areas in which the LSA undertakes work is in protecting the rights of refugee and migrant women and children, which it does through its women and young persons department. The proposed pilot would be affiliated to that department and would allocate one specialist solicitor one day a week for six months to provide initial advice regarding access to medical and other sensitive records. The advice could be provided at the premises of the LSA or of Rape Crisis.</p><p>During the pilot phase, the specialist solicitor would undertake collation of case outcomes, identify the costs of providing legal support, evaluate the pilot from the point of view of its clients and external parties, including the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22804833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Amendments 29, 30 and 31 seek to tackle the long-standing and vexing problem of use of sexual history and character evidence in sexual offence trials.

If one partner was hospitalised, the other had no legal right to be given any information about their illness or care because they were deemed not to be a relative. The Civil Partnership Act 2004, together with the inclusion of same-sex cohabitees in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006, ended that terrible injustice. Provision was made to recognise legal rights to, for example, inheritance and property ownership for same-sex couples.</p><p>The point is that discrimination has been addressed, as I have described.

Without them, individuals would either lose an avenue for redress or be forced to take their grievances into a court system that is already overstretched and&#8212;I am sad to say&#8212;likely to become more so with the court closures that are planned.</p><p>In some instances, a tribunal is a forum for citizens to challenge decisions made by public bodies on their entitlement to benefits and services. Because of that, it is imperative that they are independent from Government and the public organisations whose decisions they regulate. In other cases, they are a forum for the resolution of private disputes&#8212;as we see, for example, in the Lands Tribunal for Scotland&#8217;s work&#8212;or issues arising from employment. In essence, tribunals offer a less formal and less costly dispute resolution mechanism as an alternative to the courts. However, as the Justice Committee heard from a wide range of witnesses, the current complicated tribunal system, which has developed in an ad hoc way over the past decades, needs to be reformed, and the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report confirms that users and experts generally welcome the bill as a step towards revising the administrative justice landscape.</p><p>The bill creates a first-tier tribunal for first-instance decisions; an upper tribunal to deal primarily with appeals; and a standard system of appointment, training and appeals. However, although all of that is generally to be welcomed, there are, as the stage 1 report notes, certain areas of concern that will need to be addressed as the bill progresses, including the balancing act that the Government will have to perform between establishing a simplified uniform system and recognising that tribunals deal with very specialised areas of the law.</p><p>That challenge was reflected in the evidence that the Justice Committee received from the Lands Tribunal, which is a vocal critic of the bill and the creation of a uniform system. In its written submission, it noted that</p><p>&#8220;to aim for common standards and procedures, including review and appeal, as a significant plank of policy risks creation of a serious impediment to identifying the most efficient way of serving the different needs of individual users&#8221;.</p><p>Consequently, the Lands Tribunal has argued that, instead of occupying a division in the upper tribunal as the Scottish Government has proposed, it should be placed in a separate pillar. Indeed, that position has been supported by the Lord President.</p><p>The difficulty with the Lands Tribunal for Scotland not being included in the new structure is the precedent that that would set for the approach to other tribunals that are equally specialist, which would result in a complex arrangement under the new system, representing not a lot of change. The challenge for the Scottish Government is to establish some standardisation without compromising the interests of users of the tribunal system. I note that the minister has recognised that with the requirement for flexibility.</p><p>The stage 1 report also highlights the legitimate concern that has been raised about judicialisation or so-called courtification. In other words, there is a need to ensure that the characteristics of tribunals, as distinct from those of courts, are protected. That concern springs from, among other things, the provision that sheriffs, sheriff principals and part-time sheriffs will be eligible to act as judicial members of the first-tier tribunal by virtue of their judicial office alone. Although the Lord President is supportive of that proposal, an influx of judges and former judges risks turning tribunals from informal and generally non-adversarial environments into courts in all but name. The Justice Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report therefore recommends that the Government seriously consider amending the bill to remove automatic entitlement in the appointment of judicial members. A further concern is that, because judicial members may be appointed to the first-tier and upper tribunals, the current gender inequality that is present in the wider judicial system may be replicated in the new tribunal structure.</p><p>The bill makes provision for the newly established Scottish Civil Justice Council to propose procedural rules for the Scottish tribunals through a specialised tribunals committee. However, without additional resources, it will be years before the SCJC, which must first rewrite a mountain of civil court rules, will be able even to consider tribunal rules. The Government has proposed that, in the interim, Scottish ministers should make rules for Scottish tribunals, but that interim rule-making arrangement poses serious constitutional issues, as it would result in Scottish ministers writing the rules of administrative justice and significantly drafting the rules surrounding the newly created upper tribunal. Although that may already happen on a limited basis, it remains, as the Faculty of Advocates pointed out to the committee, &#8220;undesirable on constitutional grounds&#8221;. As Jonathan Mitchell QC said:</p><p>&#8220;Scottish Ministers should have the same rights as other parties to proceedings before the tribunals to comment on proposed rules, but no power to write them.&#8221;</p><p>Scottish ministers can be challenged in tribunals, and it is simply not appropriate for them to be involved in setting the rules. An alternative must be found in either the creation of a new, independent interim body or the additional resources that the SCJC would require in order to carry out that role.</p><p>All those issues will require to be addressed in the future. In the meantime, I confirm that the Scottish Conservatives will support the general principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22732166", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunals (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "According to that committee, a tribunal is &#8220;A body which resolves disputes between citizens and state and between private parties by making binding decisions according to law, does so by a process of adjudication which is specialised, relatively informal and less adversarial as compared to the model of adjudication applied by the courts and is independent of both the executive and the...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Margaret", "last_name": "Mitchell", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80489", "house": "4", "member_id": "80489", "person_id": "14065", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Central Scotland"}, "section_id": "22732166", "hpos": "146", "gid": "2013-11-07.18.21", "epobject_id": "22732187", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-11-07.18.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14065+section%3Asp#g18.21", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80489"}, {"body": "<p>I congratulate the Scottish Labour Party on lodging its motion on the proposed closure to members of the public of police counters.</p><p>The closure of police counters at more than 60 stations and the reduction of the opening hours at 80 stations are a significant blow to communities.

There are therefore unintended and adverse consequences associated with the introduction of strict liability.</p><p>A presumption that drivers are liable if they are involved in an accident with a cyclist is not likely to encourage the mutual respect that should be present between road users.

That important and complex act has a difficult balancing act to achieve in seeking, as it does, to accomplish its dual role: namely, on the one hand, protection of the public&#8212;in particular the most vulnerable people in our society&#8212;and on the other, seeking to reduce reoffending by acknowledging that people who commit crimes can change, be released from custody and contribute to society. A key to pulling off that balancing act is certainly meaningful and effective rehabilitation in the community but, crucially, that must be complemented by the same commitment to rehabilitation in prison.</p><p>Part of the consultation on the 1974 act should involve taking account of the findings of the Justice 1 Committee&#8217;s 2003 report &#8220;A Comparative Review of Alternatives to Custody: Lessons from Finland, Sweden and Western Australia&#8221; and the Justice 1 Committee&#8217;s 2005 report &#8220;Inquiry into the Effectiveness of Rehabilitation in Prisons&#8221;. Both those reports highlighted the lack of rehabilitation opportunities for people who serve short-term sentences but, as the committee heard from Dr Nancy Loucks, rehabilitation should be a priority for both short-term and long-term prisoners, with prisoners being given the opportunity and the motivation to continue rehabilitative work on release.</p><p>In addition, last year&#8217;s report by the commission on women offenders highlighted the lack of throughcare for prisoners who are serving less than four years because they are not the subject of statutory throughcare, which is where most resources are focused.</p><p>Some fantastic work is being undertaken in our prisons to help to rehabilitate offenders. Examples include the literacy programme for dyslexic offenders at Saughton prison, which is supported by Sir Jackie Stewart. However, unless we can provide meaningful support to those who serve short-term sentences, the prospects of achieving and maintaining effective rehabilitation in the community are greatly diminished.</p><p>In general terms, the 1974 act makes provision for offenders who have been successfully rehabilitated to wipe the slate clean, in effect. Those provisions are supported by all parties. However, the legislation has been criticised for being cumbersome and in need of modernisation in order that it can achieve the delicate but necessary balance to which I referred earlier.</p><p>Therefore the question is this: after nearly 40 years, does the act get the balance right between protecting the public and supporting rehabilitation of offenders? Here the Government&#8217;s consultation poses a number of interesting questions. For example, are some offences so serious that they should always be disclosed? In the limited time that is allotted to me, I want to concentrate on one aspect of that question. Crucially, one of the most important areas that requires further close examination is how sex offenders are dealt with on release under the 1974 act.</p><p>The conviction of Ian Huntley, who worked as a caretaker at a school in the village of Soham, Cambridgeshire, where the murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells took place, prompted the setting up in December 2003 of the Bichard independent inquiry into child protection, record-keeping, vetting and information sharing between Humberside Police and Cambridgeshire Constabulary. That independent inquiry was set up because Huntley was able to work in a school despite a string of allegations of criminal activity having been made against him in the past, including some concerning sexual offences against children.</p><p>Recommendation 19 of the Bichard inquiry report, which was published in June 2004, stated:</p><p>&#8220;New arrangements should be introduced requiring those who wish to work with children, or vulnerable adults, to be registered.&#8221;</p><p>The Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 was the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to that recommendation. Under the PVG act, offenders who are subject to a notification requirement under part 2 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2003&#8212;commonly referred to as the sex offenders register&#8212;are required to disclose that fact. However, given the concern about the potential consequences when sexual offenders breach the conditions that they are required to adhere to, I believe that offenders who breach the register conditions and go missing should lose the right to anonymity. Also worthy of consideration is whether, for some occupations and for some very serious cases, the convictions of sex offenders should never be deemed as spent.</p><p>In conclusion, I say that this is a vexing and pressing issue, which I call on the Scottish Government to ensure is thoroughly examined by all stakeholders. Although the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 is almost 40 years old, the principle behind it is still sound. I welcome today&#8217;s debate and encourage all those who work in the criminal justice system, together with employers and ex-offenders, to help to inform the process.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion, which the Scottish Conservatives are happy to support, agrees that it is now &#8220;time ... to consider whether the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 needs to be modernised and&#8221; perhaps even &#8220;reformed&#8221;.

They include the permitting of wider definitions of corroboration in cases of rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and domestic violence, a regular feature of which is the unlikelihood of there being a witness, while still maintaining fairness to the accused; further consideration of the introduction of more circumstantial evidence to help support corroboration in a chain of events; more systematic and constructive use of expert witnesses; and reviewing the application of the time period element of the Moorov doctrine&#8212;which has offered the opportunity for justice to victims of crimes of interpersonal violence&#8212;in cases where the modus operandi is similar, as it would lead to more flexible marking of cases by fiscals. The group made many more evidential suggestions that could and, I believe, would improve the application of corroboration.</p><p>Despite the fact that, under its terms of reference, it was competent for his review to do so, Lord Carloway failed to consider the option of retaining corroboration in the context of looking at the law of evidence to improve its application.

In effect, the images are made public.</p><p>With the advance and proliferation of modern forms of communication, there are a host of ways in which those private images can be made public&#8212;for example, by posting them online on social networking sites such as Facebook and on specific revenge porn sites. Images can also be sent via emails and texts as well as by post. Distressingly, those images, in whatever form that they are made public, are often accompanied by the individual&#8217;s name, address or place of employment.</p><p>That would be horrific for any individual who is the subject of revenge porn, regardless of age, but Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid is particularly concerned about the impact on young people. That is a very real issue, as evidenced by an NSPCC investigation that revealed an increasing pressure on girls aged as young as 12 to send sexually explicit images to their boyfriends.</p><p>In addition, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre has highlighted that 70,000 still and moving indecent images of children were created in the United Kingdom last year, a fifth of which&#8212;some 14,000&#8212;were self-generated. Given that, there is an urgent requirement not only to educate our young people about the dangers of giving someone else possession of such an image but to ensure that young people learn about and appreciate the importance of establishing healthy and compassionate relationships based on mutual respect. In such relationships, there would be no question of either party being coerced into taking an indecent picture of themselves; nor would either party consider making an image of their current or former boyfriend or girlfriend public as an act of revenge.</p><p>Significantly, as the Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid campaign points out, the threat or the actual distribution of such material is a form of domestic abuse because of the implicit humiliation and control involved. Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid therefore seeks to reassure women who have been victims of revenge porn&#8212;an issue that affects men as well as women but, as Joan McAlpine pointed out, in much smaller numbers&#8212;that they are not at fault and that support and help are available. Crucially, the Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid campaign places responsibility firmly back on the perpetrators who made the image public without consent.</p><p>Once an image is put online, it is incredibly hard to remove it, as it might have been downloaded and saved on other computers. In effect, it never really disappears. The loss of dignity, the impact on people&#8217;s reputation and the effect that revenge porn can have on an individual&#8217;s working and personal relationships cannot be undone.</p><p>I therefore very much welcome Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid&#8217;s campaign to support women who have been victims of this atrocious act, and I hope that it can encourage more people to come forward and seek help.

It is encouraging that the draft SPP consultation document states that enforcement is a core value of the planning service, and the minister has confirmed that he supports our amendment.</p><p>In reality, our planning system is only as good as the level of enforcement that is carried out to ensure compliance once decisions have been made. It is essential, therefore, that in determining the final SPP the Scottish Government ensures that councils have robust, transparent and detailed planning enforcement charters that reflect modern conditions in order to safeguard the effectiveness of the planning system.</p><p>If we are to achieve that objective, there is an urgent requirement for more meaningful data on enforcement and how it currently operates. It is a matter of concern that, since the end of 2011-12, served planning enforcement notices are no longer broken down by type, which makes it impossible to monitor properly the extent to which enforcement is working.

They include the central Scotland green network, which covers all three of the local authorities in Central Scotland; the Grangemouth investment zone; the Grangemouth and Peterhead carbon capture and storage project; and Ravenscraig. All of that is very good news.</p><p>It is expected that the development of Ravenscraig will lead to the creation of 12,000 jobs and make a significant contribution to the local economy, creating new opportunities in housing, education and leisure. There are clearly significant opportunities for regeneration and renewal at the Ravenscraig site, which will complement the new Motherwell College campus and the regional sports facility. In view of that, I sincerely hope that Ravenscraig remains one of the 14 new designations following the consultation.</p><p>When the minister gave evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee on NPF3 and the SPP, one issue that was raised was the removal of the term &#8220;brownfield site&#8221; from the draft SPP. Among the possible connotations of the term are that the land in question might be contaminated or in poor condition. That is often not an accurate assessment of the land, and the term &#8220;previously developed&#8221; might make such sites sound more attractive. However, as the term &#8220;brownfield site&#8221; is widely understood by the general public to mean land that can be developed and which is quite distinct from a greenfield site, I think that, on balance, it would be helpful to retain the term.</p><p>In the same evidence session, the minister indicated that the town centres review would report &#8220;shortly&#8221;. Given the town-centres-first approach that has been taken in the draft SPP, as well as the importance of the review to many other policy areas, I would be grateful if he could confirm when the external advisory group will report. I hope that that will happen prior to the close of the consultation so that it can help to inform stakeholder responses to the draft SPP.</p><p>In the Scottish Conservatives&#8217; most recent energy policy review, a Scotland-wide zoning exercise was suggested, with the resulting zoning plan to be included in the SPP. The zoning plan would clearly identify areas in which wind farms or other renewables projects could never be granted planning permission and areas in which they might be suitable. Given that, we cautiously welcome the suggestion in the draft SPP that a more rigorous zoning system be adopted for onshore wind developments than currently exists.</p><p>That said, although around a third of the countryside will potentially be protected by the proposed guidelines, there is no commitment from the Scottish National Party to reduce the overall number of turbines and no sign that its enthusiasm for wind energy is beginning to wane. In such circumstances, the fear is that zoning might simply result in more pressure being put on the remaining two thirds of the country that will not be spared in the guidelines.

Furthermore, 70 per cent of sudden cardiac arrests occur outside hospital. Of those, only one person in 20 currently survives and death from sudden cardiac arrest can occur within 10 minutes.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, an estimated 4,000 people a year die from SADS&#8212;sudden arrhythmic death syndrome&#8212;which is a genetic heart-rhythm abnormality. In Scotland, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, is the main cause of deaths. There were 17,000 deaths from CVD in 2010, which equates to almost a third of all deaths in Scotland that year. It is worrying that 50 per cent of the people who require defibrillation do not have a previously diagnosed heart condition, and that many of those individuals will be young and seemingly healthy.</p><p>The campaign therefore calls for AEDs to be placed in public places, in remote communities and in all fire and police vehicles in Scotland, and in other strategic locations, because cardiac arrests are, by nature, unexpected and sudden. One relatively recent high-profile case involved the collapse of Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba on the pitch during an FA cup match in 2012. Television footage that is now part of a British Heart Foundation advertising campaign shows the shock and distress that registered on the faces of the other players as they watch the previously fit and healthy 20-year-old lying motionless and face down on the pitch. Although he was technically dead for 78 minutes, Fabrice survived, partly thanks to the use of a defibrillator.</p><p>The Isle of Man already has a number of AEDs, and a local Manx charity, Craig&#8217;s Heartstrong Foundation, aims to raise &#163;60,000 in 2013 to equip all 34 primary schools on the island with lifesaving AEDs and training from St John Ambulance. Craig&#8217;s Heartstrong Foundation was established by the Lunt family in memory of their 25-year-old son Craig, who was a popular young footballer who tragically died as a result of previously undiagnosed heart defects.</p><p>AEDs that are located in Scotland include one here in Parliament, and a number that have been donated by the British Heart Foundation which has, by working in partnership with the Scottish Ambulance Service and Scotmid, succeeded in placing 40 AEDs in Scotmid stores. In 2009, Strathclyde Partnership for Transport bought AEDs for six of its subway stations and plans to extend that provision to all 15 subway stations. SPT also intends to place AEDs in East Kilbride, Greenock and Hamilton bus stations.</p><p>It is not just the efforts of big organisations that have seen AEDs being placed. For evidence of that, we need look no further than the small village of Collieston, where the community raised nearly &#163;3,000 to fund and install a defibrillator in the village. However, there are still far fewer AEDs in Scotland than there should be, hence the call from the AEDs in Scotland campaign and the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health for AEDs to be placed strategically in public and remote places.</p><p>According to a recent online discussion that was hosted by the Scottish Ambulance Service, which asked members of the public where they would like AEDs to be placed, the following locations were cited and suggested: public places, especially where large numbers of people gather; remote communities, where it can take an ambulance much precious time to arrive; village halls; old phone boxes; places that are accessible 24 hours a day; and schools.</p><p>Given that, alarmingly, each week 12&#8212;potentially more&#8212;young people die from SADS in the UK, the argument in favour of placing AEDs in schools is compelling. In March, as part of the SADS campaign, Samantha Clinton from Bellshill started a petition calling for all schools to have AEDs; in the light of that, the joint decision by North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire to provide an AED in each of its 24 secondary schools is very much to be welcomed and it is hoped that more local authorities and NHS boards throughout Scotland will follow their example.</p><p>However, as more AEDs are placed in our communities, they must be mapped to ensure that, should one be required, its location is known. All the AEDs on the Isle of Man have to be registered at the emergency services joint control room, which handles all 999 calls, to allow people to be directed to the nearest defibrillator. That is particularly useful as it helps to identify AEDs in private locations such as office buildings that can be accessed by the public in an emergency, as well as those that are provided in cabinets. To ensure that the locations of defibrillators are known, the AEDs in Scotland campaign has undertaken its own mapping scheme. So far, it has found 104 AEDs in Scotland, but only 29 that are accessible 24 hours a day. The Scottish Ambulance Service believes that there are 327 AEDs in total, but it does not know where they are all located.</p><p>Despite people&#8217;s apprehension, defibrillators are, in fact, very easy to use; once it is switched on, the AED guides the operator through the procedure using a computer-generated voice. Once it is connected, the AED automatically analyses the victim&#8217;s heart rhythm and delivers the shock only when it detects the presence of a rhythm that requires defibrillation. It also gives the operator guidance on when to begin and stop chest compression. As a result, anyone who is involved in an emergency can be confident that they will be able to use the AED safely and correctly.</p><p>In conclusion, the fact that AEDs can save and have saved lives is the reason why campaigns such as the one that is being run by Laura and Paul Macadam-Slater are to be welcomed and supported in seeking to have more of these important machines located across Scotland, to raise awareness of sudden cardiac events and, crucially, to explain the action that is required.</p><p>I very much look forward to the minister&#8217;s comments on this important issue.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692437", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Automatic External Defibrillators"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The survival chances of people who are affected by cardiac arrest decrease by 14 per cent for every minute without defibrillation.

Given that, at present, the eight community justice authorities work with 32 local authorities, 32 alcohol and drug partnerships, 16 prisons, 14 health boards, six sheriffdoms and now one police force, it is perhaps not surprising that co-ordination between the various agencies and avoiding duplication are proving to be a challenge.</p><p>The Conservative amendment highlights not only that, but shortcomings resulting from the way in which CJAs were set up. First of all, there is inconsistency in service provision in local authorities, particularly over supervised bail schemes and throughcare. Secondly, the distribution of core funding by CJAs does not encourage reduction of reoffending because the funding is based on workload with regard to the number of community sentences that are imposed in a local authority area.</p><p>Next, the make-up of CJA boards is complex and there is concern that councillors find it difficult to separate their responsibilities as CJA members from their responsibilities as local authority elected members, which has limited the ability of CJAs to move funds between constituent councils. Finally, there is a general lack of assessment of the performance of CJAs.</p><p>All those aspects are worthy of in-depth discussion, but I want to explore more thoroughly funding and the allocation of resources.</p><p>Audit Scotland questioned the effectiveness of CJAs&#8217; short-term funding after each of the eight CJAs received an additional &#163;100,000 from the Scottish Government in 2010-11 and 2011-12 for services to support women offenders. That money was allocated following the Cabinet&#8217;s consideration of the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s 2009 report on its inquiry into female offenders in the criminal justice system, which identified the work that one CJA had done in reducing reoffending by women from more than 30 per cent to about 14 per cent.</p><p>Although the Government is most certainly to be commended for providing that funding, it could be argued that if it had gone a little further and given some direction to the CJAs in the form of information on what had worked well for the south-west Scotland community justice authority&#8212;which, by working with the charity Circle and supporting the families of women prisoners and the prisoners themselves on release, had dramatically reduced reoffending&#8212;I believe that a much better outcome could have been achieved, which would have addressed Audit Scotland&#8217;s criticism.</p><p>It is certainly not in doubt that sufficient long-term resources must be made available, not only for the third sector but for community-led projects that have proven track records in delivering and tackling reoffending. The argument for that is compelling; one such four-year project that was run by Circle that involved community-based support being given to marginalised children and families led to the return-to-custody rate among supported offenders falling to as low a level as 19 per cent.</p><p>However, although reconviction rates might be at their lowest level for a decade, in reality reoffending has barely dropped in that time and remains far too high. That is particularly true of those who are in prison, with a staggering 22 per cent of all offenders who were handed a custodial sentence last year having 10 or more previous convictions.</p><p>Furthermore, the introduction and delivery of community payback orders as alternatives to custody has contributed to the problem. The first person who was granted a CPO breached the order. In January, it was revealed that offenders were being credited with two hours&#8217; work just for turning up if a work project could not be found for them, and the latest figures show that less than a third of the CPOs that were handed out last year were completed within a year. Can the cabinet secretary confirm whether the evaluation of CPOs will be completed in time to feed into the Government&#8217;s analysis of the consultation on the community justice system?</p><p>Community disposals and alternatives to custody other than CPOs are undermining community justice and the case for community sentences as an alternative to custodial sentencing. For example, according to the latest fines survey, &#163;3.6 million is owed in unpaid court fines that were imposed in the first six months of the 2012-13 financial year. That includes &#163;1 million that is owed in sheriff court fines, &#163;700,000 that is owed in justice of the peace court fines, &#163;1.1 million that is owed in fiscal direct penalties and &#163;800,000 that is owed in police antisocial behaviour penalties.</p><p>Arrears have built up in 17 per cent of the fines that were imposed in the first six months of 2012-13. Collection rates for some fines are better than they are for others. For example, more than 50 per cent of police penalties that were imposed during that time are being ignored.</p><p>That figure is in addition to the &#163;14.9 million that is already outstanding in unpaid fines that have been imposed since 2009-10, which means that a staggering &#163;18.5 million of fines remain unpaid by criminals who have avoided tougher sentences. Crucially, that money could be spent on projects to reduce reoffending. It is clear that fiscal fines and fixed penalties urgently require to be overhauled&#8212;that is an absolute priority.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s consultation and this afternoon&#8217;s debate are the first step in the process to come up with the more strategic approach that Audit Scotland recommends.</p><p>It is crucial that, as well as containing an element of accountability, either through elected officials or through a publicly appointed figure, the option that is chosen should deliver flexibility in service provision. That will ensure that the new model is better placed to direct resources to projects that are known to be effective.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-06433.1, to leave out from &#8220;solid progress&#8221; to &#8220;achieving this&#8221; and insert:</p><p>&#8220;while some progress has been made in tackling reoffending, rates remain far too high; recognises that the work of local community justice practitioners has been hindered by failings in the way in which community justice authorities were established&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690163", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Justice System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate because it gives Parliament the opportunity to examine why the current arrangement for strategic and operational responsibility with regard to community sentences and reducing reoffending is not as effective as it could be.

It is for the Scottish Government to set priorities, but the closures that we are discussing represent not only the savings that have been talked about but additional costs, which have not been factored in at all.</p><p>Sheriff courts have increasingly come under pressure in recent years because more criminal business has been passed down from the High Court as a result of the Bonomy reforms. The situation has been made worse by the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposal to transfer more civil business to the sheriff courts when the Crown Office budget is being cut in real terms, resulting in fewer resources for fiscals and legal staff.</p><p>The cabinet secretary states that the closures will affect only 5 per cent of cases. To put that in context, according to the SCS&#8217;s consultation figures, that will require in excess of 12,500 cases or JP complaints to be heard elsewhere. More worryingly, that figure does not include the complaints that are heard by the nine JP courts that will close because they share premises with sheriff courts that are set for closure.</p><p>As has been stated, the Scottish Government is at the same time proposing to transfer civil business from the Court of Session to sheriff courts. Although the cabinet secretary has repeatedly claimed that the Scottish Court Service has taken that into account, it is difficult to see how that can be the case, given that the SCS&#8217;s consultation closed two months before the Government&#8217;s court reform plans were even published.</p><p>The cabinet secretary says that the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill seeks to</p><p>&#8220;put victims&#8217; interests at the heart of improvements to the justice system&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;make what is often the most difficult episode in someone&#8217;s life a bit easier.&#8221;</p><p>However, in reality, the attempt to make savings by closing courts and diverting criminal and civil business to already overstretched courts comes at the expense of victims and witnesses, who will have to deal with access to justice issues.</p><p>Interestingly, I note that the SCS recommendations have not been subject to a formal equality impact assessment. There is absolutely no doubt that court users will face increased travel times and distances. For example, the closure of the court in Kirkcudbright will mean a 45-minute, 28-mile journey to Dumfries, which will add to costs and make delays and disruption to court business more likely. Worse still, any potential closure savings will be lost in increased spending on legal aid, police cover and cover for professionals attending court as witnesses.</p><p>Furthermore, as the Federation of Small Businesses and the Law Society, among others, pointed out in their responses to the SCS consultation, courts have a positive economic impact on local areas. Therefore, I welcome the decision to grant a stay of execution to Alloa sheriff court and Coatbridge JP court in my constituency, but the decision to close the JP courts in Motherwell and Cumbernauld will be a bitter blow for struggling town centre businesses in those places.</p><p>The closure of courts will also mean the deskilling of local solicitors and the loss of the continuity that is provided by sheriffs and JPs with knowledge of local communities. Those concerns cannot be dismissed by the assertion that technology can fill the gap. Videoconferences and webcams are no substitute for courts, which maintain visibility of justice for communities.</p><p>That view was confirmed only this week at the Justice Committee, when witnesses from the Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society stated that, notwithstanding some limited exceptions for vulnerable witnesses, the default position should always be that it is better for witnesses to be in court, especially given the importance in some cases of witnesses&#8217; body language and even physical appearance, which are difficult to assess via television link. They also stressed that TV links make it difficult to build up a rapport with witnesses and that technical issues are common.</p><p>I suggest that the outrage would be such that the Scottish Government would shy away from agreeing the closure of a fifth of our schools or hospitals, so why are our courts considered fair game, with all the adverse consequences for access to justice and the Scottish justice system?

If the property owner does not subsequently take any measures to reduce the height of the hedge, the bill makes provision for the local authority to take action to reduce its height.</p><p>It is arguable that the biggest topic of debate during the bill&#8217;s consideration has been whether to include single deciduous trees.

I am speaking in the debate as a member of the CPA Scotland branch executive committee, and I would like to touch on Livingstone&#8217;s early life, his missionary work, his work as a doctor, some of his connections with Africa and some personal connections. I understand that Sandra White is not going to speak today, in order to cut down the number of speeches.</p><p>As James Kelly said, the David Livingstone story is truly inspirational. He was born in March 1813 in a single-apartment home in a tenement building called Shuttle Row in Blantyre, which was built to house the workers of the cotton-spinning mill on the banks of the River Clyde. He left school at the age of 10 and was taught to read and write by his father. As other children in the village did, he worked in the mills from very early in the morning until eight at night. His day did not end there: he attended night school and studied far into the night.</p><p>He taught himself Latin and developed a love of natural history. At the age of 19, he was promoted and with his increased wage had saved enough money by 1836 to enter Anderson&#8217;s University in Glasgow to study medicine. David Livingstone is clearly an example of some of the best Scottish traits: the work ethic, the thirst for knowledge and the recognition of the importance of education. In 1840, he moved to London to complete his medical studies and, at the end of the year, he qualified as a licentiate of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. In the same month, he was ordained as a missionary by the London Missionary Society.</p><p>From 1841 until his death in 1873, Livingstone explored the interior of central and southern Africa. He was one of the first medical missionaries to enter southern Africa and the first in central Africa. He was also often the first European to meet local tribes. He won their trust as a healer and medicine man, and he gained such a reputation among the villages that he visited that he eventually had to limit his treatment to people with serious illnesses.</p><p>Much of David Livingstone&#8217;s time in Africa was spent in what we now know as Malawi. I believe that he would have been immensely gratified to see that the connection that he first made is not only still present but is growing through the work of the Parliament and a number of varied initiatives including the efforts of churches and schools throughout Scotland.</p><p>I well remember Sunday school visits as a child to the David Livingstone centre in Blantyre, where&#8212;as I remember it&#8212;the sun was always shining. I thought that it was a very special place to honour a truly remarkable Scot. As an adult and MSP, like other MSPs I was involved in the happily successful campaign, on behalf of the central Scotland community, to save the centre from closure in 2009.</p><p>Given all that, it was a particular privilege to represent the CPA Scotland branch in the company of Malawian MPs when we attended the David Livingstone bicentennial commemorative service last week at Westminster abbey, where Livingstone&#8217;s body is buried. His heart remains in Africa, of course, where he also left his mark. To this day, missions are set up using his 19th century model, with a church, a school and a hospital.</p><p>Tonight&#8217;s event will see Annie Lennox, our special envoy, give a presentation. I am delighted that she is accompanied by her new husband, Mitch Besser, as I know that Malawi is special to both of them.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank James Kelly for bringing this important debate to Parliament and for providing an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate David Livingstone&#8217;s life and work.

Although today&#8217;s debate on the order gives us another opportunity to discuss the financial settlements for Scotland&#8217;s local authorities for the coming year, it has to be said that the other opportunities have, to date, failed to provide any answers to the questions that have been posed to the cabinet secretary and the minister on non-domestic rates income.</p><p>Therefore, I will cut straight to the chase and ask once more: How much has been collected under the business rates incentivisation scheme so far? [Interruption.] If the cabinet secretary would do me the courtesy of stopping his conversation and listening, he might be able to answer that. It should not be difficult for him to do so, given that we are less than three weeks away from the financial year&#8217;s end.</p><p>In addition, I would like to know what the Scottish Government&#8217;s prediction is for the year&#8217;s total. Again, that should not be difficult to answer because the cabinet secretary receives quarterly updates on collection rates. If he wants to intervene and give me the figures at any time, I will be glad to take an intervention.</p><p>We hear a deafening silence. Okay. Taking into account the above two requests, I would like to know how many of Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authorities are likely to receive money back. To conclude on that subject, I put on record again that today&#8217;s order is another opportunity lost to extend the business rates incentivisation scheme to allow councils to retain 100 per cent of the income surplus above the centrally set targets, rather than 50 per cent, as is the case under the Scottish Government&#8217;s scheme. The obvious advantages of that are that it would provide a greater incentive to councils to support business growth while maintaining the certainty, predictability and administrative simplicity of a national poundage rate for businesses.</p><p>This is the sixth year in a row in which all of Scotland&#8217;s councils have agreed to freeze council tax.

I confirm at the outset that the Conservatives will vote to approve the order. Nonetheless, the debate gives us the opportunity to look at the background to the provision of the order.</p><p>For the financial year 2013-14, the total Scottish Government settlement to local authorities will be almost &#163;10.3 billion, which is substantially lower than the settlement for that year that was originally set out in the 2012-13 draft budget and spending review. As the cabinet secretary confirmed, the reduction can be explained by the transfer of responsibility for policing and the fire service from local government to the new Scottish Police Authority and Scottish fire and rescue service.</p><p>Our consideration of the order follows yesterday&#8217;s stage 3 proceedings on the Budget (Scotland) (No 2) Bill. The order sets out the amount of revenue support grant that is payable to, and the non-domestic income for, local authorities in 2013-14. Excluding the police and fire moneys, to allow us to make a like-for-like comparison, local authorities in Scotland over the next financial year will have a 1.8 per cent decrease in funding in real terms.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have supported the council tax freeze, so the remainder of my opening and closing remarks will concentrate on the revenue support grant and non-domestic rates income.</p><p>The order reveals a projected 7 per cent increase in non-domestic rates income for 2013-14 yet, to date, no information has been forthcoming on the current collection rate for non-domestic rates. Last year, the Local Government and Regeneration Committee and the Finance Committee recommended that the figures should be published regularly and, this year, both those committees again stated that the figures should be published regularly. Given that the cabinet secretary receives collection rate figures quarterly, it is difficult to understand why, despite the recommendation of both those committees for two years, not to mention the best efforts of my colleague Gavin Brown to get the information released, the cabinet secretary has steadfastly refused to do so. As a result, it is just not possible to assess accurately whether that 7 per cent increase is even feasible.</p><p>Furthermore, the cabinet secretary will be aware that the Scottish Conservatives have argued consistently that the decision that local authorities will retain only 50 per cent of the income surplus that is collected under the business rate incentivisation scheme represents an opportunity lost. The similar scheme that the Scottish Conservatives suggested as far back as 2009, under which local authorities would have retained 100 per cent of the surplus, should have been introduced.</p><p>It should be stressed that businesses were desperately looking to the review of business rates that was to be undertaken in 2015 in the hope that it would result in the introduction of more realistic rates that reflect the dire economic circumstances in which they operate. Instead, the cabinet secretary has delivered a cruel blow to businesses by announcing that the revaluation of business rates will be delayed until 2017. That decision was taken without having put in place the sort of transitional relief scheme for businesses in Scotland that is available to businesses in England.</p><p>The coming period will clearly be a difficult time for local authorities. I look forward to hearing other members&#8217; views during the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683985", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2013 [Draft]"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

It certainly makes a pleasant change for members of the committee to be more or less of one mind on the legislation before us, given that the previous bill that we considered was the somewhat more contentious Local Government Finance (Unoccupied Properties etc) (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>The high-hedges issue has been debated in this Parliament for nearly a decade. As other members have stated, few MSPs will not have had constituents coming to them to complain about the height of neighbouring hedges. As such disputes tend to be on-going for a number of years, they can adversely affect the health and wellbeing of both parties.</p><p>For many years, the Scottish Conservatives have campaigned to change the law on high hedges in Scotland. As far back as 2006, when the Parliament considered the Planning etc (Scotland) Bill, we submitted amendments in an attempt to introduce a similar scheme to the one that exists in England. I, too, remember that Scott Barrie made valiant attempts to get a similar bill on the statute book when he was an MSP. Therefore, I am pleased that legislation has now been introduced that aims to provide a solution for those whose enjoyment of their property is impeded by high hedges.</p><p>The bill has the potential to establish a Scottish system for resolving disputes over high hedges. I thank both the witnesses who submitted evidence&#8212;sorry, that sounds as though there were only two, but I thank all the witnesses&#8212;and the Local Government and Regeneration Committee clerks for their hard work in producing the stage 1 report.</p><p>I will restrict my opening remarks to commenting on the main provisions and objectives of the bill. At the outset, it is important to state that the bill is intended to provide an option of last resort. Section 3 makes it clear that, to make an application under the bill, the applicant must first have taken &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; to resolve the matter. In other words, the bill is designed to discourage trivial claims.</p><p>The bill defines a nuisance hedge as one that</p><p>&#8220;is formed wholly or mainly by a row of 2 or more evergreen or semi-evergreen trees or shrubs&#8221;,</p><p>is more than 2m high and</p><p>&#8220;forms a barrier to light.&#8221;</p><p>The Local Government and Regeneration Committee thoroughly debated the definition, taking into account several factors. The first was the issue of single trees. A number of those who gave evidence to the committee, including Scothedge, expressed disappointment that the bill does not cover single trees, which represent 49 per cent of all Scothedge cases. The committee decided against extending the bill in that way at this stage, having heard evidence that that not only would have significant biodiversity implications but could result in a flood of applications, at great administrative and financial cost to local authorities.</p><p>Other witnesses, including the Scottish Wildlife Trust and Bell Ingram, suggested that the definition should exclude native species of evergreen and semi-evergreen plants because of their greater biodiversity value compared with that of non-native species. However, native species can cause as much misery to the lives of home owners as non-native species can and although biodiversity is important, it must be balanced against other objectives that the bill seeks to achieve, such as the right to light and enjoyment of property free from the distress that high hedges can cause. The definition in the bill seems to strike that balance appropriately.</p><p>On fees, the main questions were whether there should be a cap on fees and whether a loser-pays principle should be applied. On balance, we considered that fees should be set at an appropriate level that discourages petty complaints but which is not so expensive as to prohibit legitimate applications. That means that the fees should reflect the cost of the work that the local authority undertakes but should not be unreasonable. Although charging the losing owner fees could act as a deterrent, it was recognised that those owners will make a realistic contribution to the cost of carrying out the works. The committee considered that that would be a deterrent in itself and that it would be disproportionate to impose an additional cost through fees.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives welcome the bill at stage 1. In my closing remarks, I will cover the few areas that might need further consideration and clarification.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683416", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High Hedges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Let me begin by congratulating Mark McDonald on achieving the not inconsiderable feat of progressing his member&#8217;s bill to a stage 1 debate and of doing so with the general support of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee.

The first is accessibility. When Mark McDonald came to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee to answer questions, I raised the issue of escalating costs and the importance of robust legislation to ensure that the cost of high-hedge orders does not become so prohibitive that local authorities and applicants will not use them. Ensuring access to the orders in important, and I was encouraged that Mark McDonald stated that he would reflect on that at stage 2.</p><p>On the definition, as members in the debate have, the Local Government and Regeneration Committee has reservations about the section 34 provision that will give ministers the power to modify the definition of a high hedge. It is entirely appropriate that stage 2 will provide the opportunity to revisit that issue.</p><p>As stated earlier, the bill will create a system of last resort with the provision that all other reasonable options to dispute resolution must have been exhausted before application had been made. However, clarification at stage 2 of what constitutes &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; would be helpful and would strengthen the bill&#8217;s objective of discouraging trivial applications.</p><p>Constituents have expressed concern about the possibility of a local authority having to act as a judge in a case in which it is a party. In other words, there is a potential conflict of interest if a hedge that is subject to a high-hedge notice is on local-authority-owned land. The issue was raised in committee and the expectation that councils will judge applications by objective standards seems to be bit weak.

The adverse childhood experiences study, &#8220;The Origins of Addiction&#8221;, confirms the correlation between addictions in adulthood and adverse childhood experiences, including childhood sexual abuse.</p><p>Those of us who are members of the cross-party group on adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse are only too aware that drink and drug addiction resulting from the trauma of childhood sexual abuse and the impetus to drown or block post-traumatic symptoms such as flashbacks and nightmares have been a huge issue for many years. Despite that, it has been hard to get those individuals recognised centrally on the drug and alcohol agenda. Many of those addicts are parents who have been abused, which not only causes general problems with parenting but means that they tend to be locked in addiction, and fail, time after time, to stay off their addiction. In turn, that raises child protection issues.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is a continuous and escalating financial cost to the state and voluntary sector of providing services in an attempt to cope with males and females with those problems. In some respects, we are merely throwing good money after bad because many front-line public services are not geared to deal with childhood sexual abuse. The motion highlights why. Quite simply, addiction would be treated more effectively if addiction services and psychological support treated it</p><p>&#8220;as an experience-dependent and not just a substance-dependent condition.&#8221;</p><p>In other words, the approach recognises that the root cause of some addictions is an unconscious but compulsive use of materials such as drugs and alcohol in an effort to block out adverse prior life experiences, the majority of which have been concealed by the individual as a result of shame, secrecy or social taboo.</p><p>In effect, in the absence of other alternatives for help with and respite from their trauma, survivors of childhood sexual abuse self-medicate using alcohol, tobacco and drugs in order to seek short-term relief to enable them to escape from their horrific and traumatic memories and flashbacks.</p><p>In 2009, the Equal Opportunities Committee inquiry report on female offenders in the criminal justice system revealed a significant correlation between childhood abuse leading to substance abuse and offending in adult life. Open Secret in Falkirk, a community-based organisation that provides support services for survivors and their families, has done some excellent work with offenders. The provision of the right services for childhood sexual abuse survivors, delivered in the right way, at the right time, has positive outcomes: it reduces the demand on other services and it is a significant contributor to lowering adult recidivism and offending, including violent offending, in Scotland. That is why Stop It Now! Scotland, the national programme for the prevention of child sexual abuse, delivers basic information on child sexual abuse and existing services throughout the prison population in Scotland.</p><p>Most childhood sexual abuse cases remain unreported and undetected because prevention has not been prioritised. Being serious about tackling the root causes of the alcohol and drug addiction of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse not only shows a longer term and informed determination to create a positive lasting change but is an excellent example of where targeted preventative spend can make a huge difference.</p><p>Again, I congratulate Kenneth Gibson on bringing the motion to the chamber this evening.

In doing so, the Government ignored the vast majority of Opposition amendments that would have resulted in a better act. The failure to listen and the adoption of a totally intransigent position means that the act is all the worse.</p><p>The disagreement between Chief Constable Stephen House and the chair of the Scottish Police Authority, Vic Emery, over their respective responsibilities for backroom personnel is evidence of that. It is to be hoped that the disagreement is not indicative of further problems that might emerge. Certainly, the chief constable and the chair of the Police Authority are sensibly working together in negotiations to resolve the matter, but it is deeply worrying that such a major problem with the legislation has emerged at this late date. I say to Christine Grahame and Colin Keir that the governance arrangements could continue to be a significant problem if future appointees do not gel or if the chair of the Police Authority and the chief constable decide to take different stances on support staff.</p><p>As others have said, the First Minister cannot dismiss the issue as merely &#8220;creative tension&#8221;, nor is the Scottish Government&#8217;s response, which, in a paper published today, is to the effect that there is no problem, any more acceptable. There is a problem, and the chief constable agrees. Clearly, who has ultimate control over the heads of backroom departments is an important question, which requires a definitive answer.</p><p>Another concern is that, with the establishment of a single police force, local accountability may be neither maintained nor, where this would be possible, enhanced. During the passage of the bill, Scottish Conservative amendments sought to address that problem by increasing local authority representation on the Police Authority board and by seeking to clarify what happens when there is disagreement between local commanders and local authorities over policing plans. Those amendments were rejected by the Scottish Government, with the result that the single police force act gives great emphasis to a single set of national structures and solutions.</p><p>Happily, despite the Scottish Government&#8217;s steer, the chief constable understands the importance of local policing and has announced that the assistant chief constable will be based outside the central belt and that 14 divisions will be set up across Scotland with a chief superintendent running each division. That divisional approach is welcome, but it is significant that the structure has been devised not as a result of the provisions of the act but because of a proactive decision by the chief constable.</p><p>In conclusion, less than four months from the single force becoming a reality, there remains disagreement over who in practice will control HR and finance, the legislation does not adequately protect local accountability and local doubts remain about the savings that the Scottish Government claims will be made. All of that means that, as Graeme Pearson confirmed, it is essential and entirely appropriate for the Parliament closely to monitor the implementation of the single police force, bearing in mind that important financial decisions must be taken in a transparent and open way and that one size does not fit all.

In essence, the Samaritans are there to support anyone who is feeling down, depressed or isolated or who is struggling to cope. Contact can be made not only over the phone, but by post, text, email or at the branch. People who contact the Samaritans are often at their wits&#8217; end or at a crisis point at which problems appear insurmountable. The Samaritans are there to ensure that no one has to suffer alone. A caller can call once, twice or however many times they need, and the conversation ends when the caller is ready. Crucially, the service is confidential and people can speak freely about any problem that is troubling them, big or small, without being judged.</p><p>Samaritans volunteers come from all walks of life and are of all ages. A selection process is undergone and they are trained to the highest standard in a six-week training programme. Thereafter, they undergo a six-month probationary period with a mentor. Hamilton has 77 volunteers running its entire service, and no full-time employees. The Hamilton office does not operate 24 hours a day, but the national Samaritans service never sleeps. It provides support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, which would not be possible without the dedication of its volunteers.</p><p>In 2010, it was estimated that volunteers contributed approximately 300,000 hours of their time. If the same service had been provided by paid staff, it would have cost &#163;3 million. The stark truth is that, in human terms, the volunteers&#8217; contribution is immeasurable.</p><p>When the Samaritans are mentioned, the first thing with which they are usually associated is a listening service, but the volunteers also provide valuable services to their local communities. For example, the Samaritans&#8217; local community outreach teams provide emotional support through their stands at festivals and other events, and they work to support young people in local schools. Samaritans also work in prisons by operating a listener scheme in which they train prisoners to become listeners, who then provide a confidential listening service to other inmates.</p><p>In addition, the Samaritans have links with a number of organisations that work with farmers, including Farm Crisis Network and the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institution. As a result of poor weather in rural locations and harvest commitments, all of which can leave people isolated, farmers have been identified as a particularly at-risk group, so as well as working with partners, the Samaritans travel to rural shows that farmers attend to take part in exhibitions. Furthermore, increases in feed prices and low milk prices have added to the financial pressures that are being felt by the farming community. Significantly, the number of calls to the Samaritans helpline about financial worries has doubled since the financial crisis and the onset of the recession.</p><p>Nationally, the Samaritans campaign on a number of issues, particularly suicide. Around 800 suicides are committed each year in Scotland, and the Samaritans play a key role in the delivery of choose life, which is Scotland&#8217;s national strategy for the prevention of suicide. They also provide guidelines for the media on the reporting and portrayal of suicide, and work closely with Google and Facebook to maintain an online presence. In addition, they have been working in partnership with Network Rail to reduce the number of suicides on railways by 20 per cent during the next five years.</p><p>What does the future hold for the Samaritans in Hamilton and throughout Scotland? The next challenge for the Hamilton branch is the aim to move from Selkirk Place to new premises that will accommodate callers and volunteers who have disabilities. The present premises were built in 1874 and extended in 1990 to accommodate a training room. However, given the substantial amount of maintenance and overheads necessary for the building, and following consultation with the volunteers, the decision has been made to sell. To achieve that objective, a major fundraising effort will be required.</p><p>More generally, the most immediate challenge for all Samaritans comes during the festive season. This can be a very difficult time for many people. Consequently, the Samaritans estimate that, across the United Kingdom and Ireland, 193,000 people will contact them this Christmas.</p><p>Samaritans are a special group of people who selflessly give their time to provide a life-saving service. Unlike other emergency service workers, they are not highly visible. Despite that, the service that they provide is no less vital. In effect, the Samaritans are the fourth emergency service.</p><p>I am therefore very pleased and consider it to be entirely fitting that today, in the Scottish Parliament, we recognise and pay tribute to that extraordinary group of people who are the volunteers of a very special service. I congratulate Hamilton Samaritans on their 40th anniversary and wish all Samaritans well during the forthcoming festive period when they will be very busy for different reasons than the rest of us. This self-funding charity is truly understated and it deserves our thanks and support for the work that it does now and will continue to do in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679194", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lanarkshire Samaritans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Samaritans opened their first Scottish branch in Edinburgh some 53 years ago in 1959.

The amendment specifically seeks to ensure that the non-domestic rate increase applies only to the small but significant number of commercial properties throughout Scotland that are wilfully left unoccupied. A list of safeguards&#8212;including on how often the property has been advertised, how often offers to buy or let have been received, the state of repair and any other steps that have been taken to encourage occupation&#8212;to test for wilful inoccupation are included in the consideration when a decision is being made.</p><p>I lodged a similar amendment at stage 2 and have taken into account the minister&#8217;s and other members&#8217; comments at that stage. Amendment 8 differs from my previous amendment in the following respects. First, the period of time after which an empty property will be deemed to be wilfully unoccupied has been lowered from 10 years to seven years. That change is made in response to concerns about the 10-year timescale being too long. Furthermore, the amendment now contains a specific reference to the price at which properties have been offered for sale or let as one of the factors to be considered.</p><p>Crucially, amendment 8 would now ensure that the burden of proof that a property is not wilfully unoccupied rests with the owner rather than with the local authority. That addresses concerns that were expressed at stage 2 to the effect that my amendment then presented an unacceptable extra burden on local authorities in terms of determining whether properties are wilfully unoccupied.</p><p>Without amendment 8, the additional tax burden that will be imposed by the bill will fall heavily on businesses and commercial property owners who are desperate to sell or lease their properties but who have unoccupied properties not through choice, but due to a fundamental lack of demand and the current economic climate.</p><p>Amendments 15 and 17 relate to domestic properties and again seek to target the small number of domestic properties that are deliberately being left empty and allowed to deteriorate. The arguments that have already been outlined on amendment 8 and the list of factors to be taken into account are applicable here in determining whether a domestic property is wilfully occupied.</p><p>Amendment 9 relates to existing commercial properties that have a number of different businesses located within the premises. It seeks to ensure that if one tenant were to vacate a business unit within a property, the owner of the building would not become liable for the increase in rates that the bill will impose. Amendment 9 is vitally important in protecting other business that are located within a multiple-occupancy commercial property, given that in these dire economic times even a small increase in overheads could be sufficient to put the owner of a property business into administration, which would result in uncertainty for other businesses located there, and potential job losses.</p><p>I move amendment 8.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675414", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Unoccupied Properties etc) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Amendment 8 would ensure that the bill would actually do what the Minister for Local Government and Planning has constantly asserted is intended.

Initially, the Scottish civil justice council will focus on the daunting task of updating the 3,400 pages of rules for the Court of Session and sheriff court; significantly, however, it will also play an important role in reviewing the wider civil justice system.</p><p>The creation of the council with this remit is a major step that will introduce a new player into the world of law reform in Scotland. Led by the Lord President and with the eminent legal and consumer representation on it, the new council, which is being created by statute, will carry real political weight. In such circumstances, it is essential that the organisation be sufficiently transparent and accountable. Although I recognise and whole-heartedly agree that the judiciary&#8217;s independence is a vital principle that must be maintained, that should not be confused or conflated with the necessity of ensuring that appointments to the new council are not only accountable and transparent, but seen to be so.</p><p>I therefore share the concerns expressed by not only a number of MSPs this afternoon, but a host of organisations ranging from Citizens Advice Scotland to the Environmental Law Centre Scotland that the Lord President&#8217;s appointments to an organisation that is an NDPB in all but name will not be subject to the Public Appointments Commissioner for Scotland&#8217;s code of practice. If they were, it would ensure that the appointment process was transparent and robust and would, crucially, be the subject of scrutiny by the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee. It would also bring the council in line with other comparable organisations, including the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, the Scottish Law Commission, SLAB and the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission. Furthermore, it would follow the recommendations of the Gill review.</p><p>Instead, the bill merely requires that the Lord President publishes a statement of appointment practice without the appointments being subject to any external scrutiny.

For the reasons pointed out by David McLetchie and others, the policy is both unfair and, at worst, risks access to justice, which could mean that it falls foul of article 6 of the ECHR. The convener of the Justice Committee and other members have highlighted that issue. Furthermore, the starting point for the decision to introduce contributions for criminal legal aid is that it will bring criminal legal aid in line with civil cases, where contributions already exist. However, as Malcolm Chisholm pointed out, that is a false comparison.</p><p>Criminal court proceedings are different from most civil cases in that they involve the Crown&#8212;the state&#8212;bringing proceedings against an individual. Criminal cases do not involve financial awards to the successful party, legal costs cannot be recovered in criminal cases and, crucially, the failure to win a civil case does not end up in imprisonment for the losing party. The difference between civil and criminal cases means that if contributions are to be introduced, they must apply only to those who can truly afford to pay. Despite the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response to my intervention, there is a concerning lack of clarity over what exactly we mean by &#8220;disposable income&#8221;, because there is no definition in the bill.</p><p>In addition, the introduction of legal aid contributions without refunds means that individuals who are wrongly accused of a crime and who have to suffer the stress and indignity of criminal proceedings will be out of pocket if they fall on the wrong side of the contributions threshold. In contrast, a guilty serial offender thug will still be able to seek state-funded legal representation to defend themselves simply because of their income level. I suggest, cabinet secretary, that there is no fairness in that. Not only that but, as the Faculty of Advocates told the Justice Committee, the proposed contributions could well create a perverse incentive for accused who feel that they cannot afford to pay to plead guilty, merely because that would result in a fixed or reduced fee.</p><p>Further, there is a fundamental inconsistency in the bill&#8217;s provision that will allow those who are retained in police custody to receive free, non-means-tested legal assistance while means testing for legal aid will apply to those in other cases that go to court. I have no doubt that the spectre of Cadder loomed large in the decision to make that distinction.</p><p>It is imperative that, if this bill is passed, its impact is closely monitored.

This year, Dyslexia Scotland&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Spotlight on Dyslexia&#8221;, and events in Edinburgh will concentrate on dyslexia in sport, literature and youth. As a result, it is a particular pleasure to welcome to the gallery Ellie Gordon-Woolgar, the 12-year-old pupil who not only came up with, but designed the dyslexia ribbon to promote dyslexia awareness week.</p><p>The motion highlights the launch of the updated dyslexia toolkit, which was made available online last month. The original toolkit, which was designed by Dyslexia Scotland with Scottish Government support, was launched in 2010 and has been a great success, and last year Dyslexia Scotland received further funding from the Government to update it. That was welcome acknowledgement that the toolkit must continue to be updated regularly to take account of new best practice and to ensure that the information and guidance that it provides remain current.</p><p>The toolkit&#8217;s objective is to provide guidance for all teachers and early years workers, regardless of their experience with dyslexia and/or their subject area, on how to identify and support individuals with dyslexia. I know that that is very important to Ellie; indeed, she made a point of telling the minister so when he met her earlier on.</p><p>The 2010 document &#8220;Teaching Scotland&#8217;s Future: Report of a review of teacher education in Scotland&#8221; emphasises that teachers should be confident in understanding and addressing the consequences of barriers to children&#8217;s learning and their needs for additional support. That requires teachers to understand how children, including those with additional support needs&#8212;dyslexia was mentioned specifically in the report&#8212;acquire and develop vital numeracy and literacy skills as they learn throughout their school life. The toolkit aims to ensure that teachers support dyslexic children to develop such skills.</p><p>However, although the emphasis is on teachers, the toolkit is most certainly not, in its use, limited to teachers. It is freely available online and is a valuable asset to parents and it provides information that is aimed directly at pupils and students. It is hoped that raising awareness of the toolkit will also lead employers to access it, which will be hugely important for those who are identified in later life as being dyslexic. After all, individuals do not outgrow dyslexia; it affects people of all ages and at all stages of their lives.</p><p>That is the background to the toolkit. If any member is in doubt about its importance for many people in Scotland, they should take a moment to consider that an estimated one in 10 people in Scotland has dyslexia, and that it is thought that one in four of those people is severely dyslexic. According to the 2011 Scottish Government pupil census, there are approximately 670,000 schoolchildren in Scotland, which means that a staggering 67,000 children have dyslexia and more than 16,000 children are severely dyslexic.</p><p>The 2011 census reported that more than 98,000 pupils in Scotland have additional support needs, but if there are 67,000 children with dyslexia, the official Government figure for pupils with dyslexia must be significantly underestimated. That is confirmed when the number of pupils who are reported to have dyslexia is broken down by primary and secondary school in each local authority area. The exercise reveals the considerable underreporting of cases, especially at primary school level.</p><p>A reason for the underreporting is the different definitions of dyslexia that local authorities use. One of the best aspects of the toolkit is the definition that it contains, which was developed by the cross-party group in conjunction with Dyslexia Scotland and the Scottish Government. Dyslexia exists on a spectrum from mild to severe, and encompasses a range of difficulties and strengths, so the lack of a universally-accepted definition leads to confusion and to disparity in the services that people with dyslexia can access. For example, South Lanarkshire Council, which works closely with Dyslexia Lanarkshire, uses the toolkit definition and provides free accommodation for meetings for teachers and parents, which are advertised. However, North Lanarkshire Council is not so proactive in working with Dyslexia Lanarkshire and does not always use the toolkit definition.</p><p>It is not difficult to see that the toolkit is crucial, in that it can provide teachers in Scotland with a uniform definition. If the debate does nothing else, I hope that it will identify the need for, and lead to the implementation of, a policy that provides that the toolkit and its definition of dyslexia must be used in all Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authorities, in order to ensure that there is consistent and efficient provision of services for dyslexic children. That is essential.</p><p>Dyslexia Scotland and its president, Sir Jackie Stewart, do sterling work to support people with dyslexia in Scotland and to raise awareness of the many and complex issues to do with the condition. The forthcoming book, &#8220;Dyslexia and Us&#8221;, contains moving and compelling contributions from a variety of people who are dyslexic, including household names such as Michelle Mone OBE, Sir Steve Redgrave and Kenny Logan, as well as other individuals from every walk of life. The stories in the book graphically demonstrate the huge impact that failure to identify and support dyslexia has in practical and emotional terms, and the pressure that can be put on public services as a result. Tackling dyslexia should be a priority and is a key example of the preventative spend that the Scottish Government wants to promote in order to alleviate pressure on our public services. In the age of austerity, the question is not whether we can afford adequately to resource and prioritise identification of and support for people with dyslexia, through the toolkit and other measures, but whether we can afford not to do so.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674871", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dyslexia"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First of all, I welcome members of the cross-party group on dyslexia, who are in the gallery for the debate, and I thank MSP colleagues who have stayed behind for the debate and are wearing the dyslexia blue ribbon in support of dyslexia awareness week, which runs from 6-10 November.

Today&#8217;s debate provides the opportunity to examine past shortcomings in the justice system in that respect.</p><p>The Carloway review contains a number of useful and well-thought-out proposals that are widely supported, including: streamlining the concept of arrest and detention; having timescales restricting detention without charge; and having a new statutory definition of vulnerable suspects.</p><p>However, there have been mixed comments about the proposal for police investigative bail. Although the Law Society has welcomed the proposal, Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid has raised concerns about the effect on the victims of domestic abuse and has highlighted the difficulties in ensuring that victims are notified of the suspect&#8217;s temporary release prior to charge or report to the procurator fiscal and pending further investigation.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary confirmed, the proposal to abolish corroboration has attracted major and widespread criticism. Therefore, I call on him to implement the other, less controversial proposals of the Carloway review but defer the abolition of corroboration for further consideration. That approach makes sense for a number of compelling reasons.</p><p>First, we cannot predict how many cases would result in conviction if the requirement was abolished. Research for the Carloway review concluded that 81 per cent of 458 cases that had been marked &#8220;no further proceedings due to insufficient evidence&#8221; would have been likely to be prosecuted further without corroboration, with nearly 60 per cent having a reasonable prospect of conviction.</p><p>Furthermore, about 5,000 serious cases are prosecuted under solemn procedure before a judge and jury each year. It is estimated that the removal of corroboration would affect less than 10 per cent and lead to conviction in barely 5 per cent of those cases. As the standard of proof in criminal cases is beyond reasonable doubt, corroborated evidence would be likely to continue to be the norm in practice.</p><p>Some people support the abolition of corroboration as a means of addressing the poor conviction rates for rape cases. It is worrying that only 5 per cent of reported rapes lead to prosecutions but, in England and Wales&#8212;where there is, of course, no requirement for corroboration&#8212;the conviction rates for rape cases are no better. That suggests that many other factors are at play, which is confirmed by some of the members of the cross-party group on adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse, from whom I sought views. Importantly, members of the group emphasised that the justice system must protect the rights of the accused against false accusations. Some had witnessed situations in which there would have been a serious miscarriage of justice had the rules on corroboration not existed.</p><p>Although the members of the group acknowledged that corroboration can make it even more difficult to secure convictions, they also pointed out that complete abolition could lead to yet more plea bargaining, which would drastically reduce sentences that are already viewed as paltry for rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and domestic violence.</p><p>Instead of abolishing the law on corroboration for those interpersonal cases of violence, in which the execution of the offence has relied on secrecy and concealment, a much wider definition of corroboration could be permitted that would maintain the principle of fairness to the accused. Therefore, it was strongly advocated that the current law on the application and definition of corroboration be revised rather than abolished.</p><p>The following measures, rather than legislation, would encourage a more proportionate and considered approach and increase the chances of victims and survivors accessing justice in criminal proceedings.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reforming Scots Criminal Law and Practice (Public Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the review that Lord Carloway carried out into criminal law and practice and the subsequent consultation by the Scottish Government.

They also emphasised that it was not tenable to rush unnecessarily to abolish corroboration for all crimes because it was thought to impede convictions in some instances.</p><p>In conclusion, corroboration was introduced to protect against miscarriages of justice and reduce the prospect of a judge or jury convicting an accused on the basis of a single piece of testimony.

The community empowerment and renewal bill consultation states that the bill seeks to strengthen</p><p>&#8220;opportunities for communities to take independent action to achieve their own goals and aspirations and ensure communities are able to have a greater role in determining how their local public services are delivered.&#8221;</p><p>That is certainly an aspiration that everyone in the chamber will support. I will highlight some of the provisions that are most worthy of support and which I hope can be progressed.</p><p>I welcome views being sought on how common good assets are currently managed and whether communities should be involved in the process. Such assets are left to communities for their use, but there have been countless occasions when local people have been angered and dismayed when local authorities have undertaken, at taxpayers&#8217; expense, legal action to use the assets for a purpose other than that for which they were intended.</p><p>The consultation also asks what changes should be made to better support communities taking forward grow-your-own projects. Recent research demonstrates the clear demand for allotment plots across Scotland. When land is made available, it can be put to good use not only as allotments but as community gardens. The community garden in Bothwell, for instance, became a reality as a result of a concerted effort by local people to have a place where individuals and pupils and organisations can meet and where vegetables, plants and fruit can be grown. Subsequently, numerous positive physical, mental and educational outcomes have been achieved for the community through the garden.</p><p>That kind of initiative evolves from consensus and drive within the community and, as such, it has the greatest chance of succeeding and enduring. Consequently, it is a type of empowerment that is to be encouraged and supported. That view was highlighted by the Scottish Sports Association in its comments about the important role of volunteers in empowering communities. The publication of public asset registers is hugely important in progressing that kind of empowerment of communities, as that information is critical for communities to take community garden projects forward.</p><p>However, to put the community empowerment debate in perspective, it must be recognised that empowering legislation in itself does not necessarily achieve the desired objective. The SCVO emphasised that point in its initial response to the consultation. The question is therefore whether, in encouraging urban empty and unused property back into use, the minister has considered the lessons to be learned from the community right-to-buy legislation that already exists.</p><p>According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, although that legislation has been beneficial, the take-up of the powers has been relatively low. The major deterring factors include the complexity of the process, the resource-intensive administrative requirements and a lack of available funding. The clear message is that empowering legislation will not be effective without funding to accompany it. That is perhaps one of the tools to which the minister referred as being necessary to do the job.</p><p>The Conservative amendment highlights an issue on which Government rhetoric has not met reality. On a number of occasions, communities that are totally opposed to projects and initiatives, such as wind farms, incinerators or mobile phone masts, have had their views ignored by central Government. That has happened despite the fact that, more often than not, the local authority has refused planning permission only to have that decision overturned centrally by the Scottish Government.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.

I come late to scrutiny of the bill, but my colleague David McLetchie had the dubious pleasure of scrutinising it during its passage through the Justice Committee. I say &#8220;dubious&#8221; because part 1 of the bill deals with some extremely technical and complex issues involving punishment and sentencing. I will deal first with the less technical part 2.</p><p>Despite its general wording, part 2 of the bill was drafted with a particular instance in mind&#8212;namely, the case of al-Megrahi. Part 2 seeks to provide a framework by which the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission may disclose information about cases that it has referred to the High Court of Justiciary when the relevant appeal has been subsequently abandoned. Given the publication of the statement of reasons in the al-Megrahi case by the Sunday Herald earlier this year, part 2 has become largely redundant. However, due to technical reasons and the structure of the bill, part 2 cannot be deleted without prejudicing the whole bill. That being the case, the Scottish Government has merely made the best of a bad job. It maintains that because part 2 is drafted in general terms, it could in theory apply to future cases and that&#8212;hey presto!&#8212;it should be retained.</p><p>Part 1 seeks to address an anomaly in our sentencing law as identified in Petch and Foye. As a result of that ruling, an individual who was given an indeterminate non-mandatory life sentence became eligible for consideration for parole at an earlier stage in their sentence than they would had they been given an equivalent determinate&#8212;or fixed&#8212;sentence. In order to correct that anomaly, it has been necessary to look at the statutory rules that courts use when they calculate the punishment part of a life sentence. The punishment part refers to the part of a life sentence that a prisoner must serve in custody before they are eligible to apply for release on parole, and it includes both the retribution and deterrence aspects of the sentence.</p><p>To give an idea of the complexity of the statutory rules, I highlight comments that were made by Joanna Cherry QC, who appeared as advocate depute in the Petch and Foye case. She stated that the analysis of the current rules</p><p>&#8220;gave rise to the most difficult piece of statutory interpretation that I have had to engage in in my career&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 31 January 2012; c 865.]</p><p>The sad&#8212;but true&#8212;fact is that the new rules will add to the complexity of the arrangements for sentencing, which, as Jenny Marra correctly stated, has been described as</p><p>&#8220;a tortuous system which is barely intelligible to lawyers&#8221;.</p><p>Part 1 also raises another more fundamental point about our sentencing system. The bill&#8217;s approach involves identifying a determinate sentence that might notionally have been imposed. That is done by stripping out of the determinate sentence any element that is imposed for public protection, and significantly&#8212;this represents the nub of the problem&#8212;by applying the current rules on automatic early release. The pertinent point is that there would be no need for the bill if the SNP had acted on its 2007 and 2011 manifesto pledges to end automatic early release of prisoners.</p><p>The end of automatic early release was legislated for under the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 but, despite the SNP&#8217;s promises, it has yet to be implemented. Furthermore, as far back as 1997, first the incoming UK Labour Government and then the Labour and Liberal coalition failed to enact the legislation to end automatic early release that the previous Conservative Government had ready to implement after the 1997 general election.</p><p>Usually, at this point, a member&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669700", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Cases (Punishment and Review) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Parts 1 and 2 of the Criminal Cases (Punishment and Review) (Scotland) Bill deal with two distinct and unconnected areas of the law.

He stated:</p><p>&#8220;the Bill seeks to create a tortuous system which is barely intelligible to lawyers, let alone to the general public&#8221;.</p><p>That point is important, not because lawyers might find the bill challenging to understand&#8212;although clarity of law for the benefit of those who advise their clients is to be welcomed&#8212;but, crucially, because the public would struggle to understand it.</p><p>Despite Mark McDonald&#8217;s rather skewed view and bizarre comments, Parliament should aspire to produce legislation that is readily understandable to the public. The Scottish Government made that crystal clear in its recently published consultation on the proposed victims and witnesses bill. The consultation places great importance on the need for victims to understand how sentencing decisions are made. It states:</p><p>&#8220;The Government is considering ... what ... practical measures could be taken to try and improve public understanding of sentencing.&#8221;</p><p>That being the case, the obvious question is whether the Scottish Government gave the same consideration to the drafting of the complicated sentencing rules in the bill that is before us today.</p><p>Furthermore, the bill deals with two distinct and unconnected areas of the law, as the Justice Committee noted in its stage 1 report. Although that approach is not without precedent and can be justified on pragmatic grounds, it has the potential to create handling difficulties when legislation is considered. Perhaps more important, the combining of unconnected provisions in one bill makes finding the law on a specific matter more difficult for those who use the law. For both those reasons, the practice should not be encouraged. Just as the Parliament should aspire to the objective of producing clearly drafted legislation, it should aspire to that of ensuring that the law is not just easily understood, but easily identifiable.</p><p>In giving a custodial sentence as a disposal, the judiciary seeks to achieve public protection, retribution and deterrence. It is widely recognised and conceded that the bill will make an already complex sentencing process more complicated, which means that the desired retribution and deterrence are that much less likely to be achieved.

However, a worrying picture has emerged from the debate that indicates all too vividly that, as the motion states, the Government&#8217;s rhetoric does not marry with the reality of the decisions that it makes.</p><p>We have heard examples of the Government&#8217;s patently obvious centralising programme, especially in the planning context, where centrally decided, national priorities are being forced on local communities, riding roughshod over local priorities. The statistics speak for themselves. In 2010-11, the Scottish Government upheld 48 per cent of all appeals that were referred to it. That figure is up from 33 per cent in the previous year and is more evidence of the worrying trend emerging that the Government is wilfully disregarding decisions that have been made in consultation and agreement with the local community.</p><p>Furthermore, the SNP has presided over, and is responsible for shaping, a planning system that systematically excludes local decision making and local democracy. That can be seen in the case of major planning applications. Time and again, local communities and councils find that their fully discussed and agreed local planning decisions are being overturned by the Government. There are numerous examples, of which a growing proportion relate to renewable energy and waste management.</p><p>In North Lanarkshire, Shore Energy Ltd applied to build an energy-from-waste plant at Carnbroe. Local residents made a staggering 6,000 objections and councillors unanimously turned down the application. The overwhelming decision to reject the application was overturned on appeal, when Shore Energy took its case to the Government. Worse still, the local authority&#8212;and, by extension, taxpayers&#8212;must now fork out even more money to fund a judicial review.</p><p>In Moray, the council, the Cairngorm National Park Authority and huge swathes of the public opposed the Dorenell wind farm, only to have that local rejection overturned by the Scottish Government. In Dumfries and Galloway, a decision by planning officials and the local area committee to refuse a wind turbine development was overturned on appeal to the Government. Again, little or no account of local decision making was taken.</p><p>More generally, it is deeply worrying that a quarter of wind farm applications&#8212;which are increasing at an alarming rate, usually in the teeth of opposition from local communities&#8212;that came before the planning appeals body after being rejected by councils have had that local decision overturned at Holyrood.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Localism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Conservatives are fierce advocates of local government and local decision making.

In those circumstances, local people are entirely justified in questioning the point of councillors, community representatives and others spending great lengths of time&#8212;sometimes years&#8212;developing a local plan in consultation with developers, only to have reporters, appointed by the Government, approve applications that are contrary to the agreed local plan.</p><p>The picture is no better with regard to housing planning decisions. In the northern corridor of North Lanarkshire, which includes Stepps and the surrounding villages, an area of greenbelt land has been constantly kept out of the local plan for the good reason that it keeps distinct boundaries between different communities. Again, the reporter who was appointed by the Scottish Government to assess the developer&#8217;s objections has taken the decision to recommend that the land be developed. Now, the local community is facing the prospect of wall-to-wall urbanisation, resulting in an erosion of people&#8217;s sense of belonging and local identity, which the local plan sought to protect.</p><p>Worse still, outwith the planning context, the SNP Government has form when it comes to a centralising agenda. Tavish Scott made pertinent comments about the proposal for a single police force. A distinct example of the centralising agenda was the Government&#8217;s proposal that the powers of the police complaints commissioner for Scotland be brought under the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. In proposing that, no account was taken of the unique and legitimate state-sanctioned powers that police have to limit the rights of others and, most notably, to deprive people of their liberty, and to do so with the use of force, if that is deemed necessary. The fact that that centralisation of power was avoided was due entirely to the fact that, in a members&#8217; business debate in the Parliament, the overwhelming case for a different arrangement to be put in place for handling police complaints was recognised and, as a result, the issue is now being considered in the context of police reform.</p><p>The centralising agenda does not stop there. Another deeply concerning proposal in relation to prison visiting committees is still under consideration. The Government proposes to replace those committees with a dedicated independent prisoner advocacy service, despite the fact that prison visiting committees represent value for money, are staffed by local volunteers and provide an effective link with local communities. Once more, localism is being rejected in favour of more powers being brought closer to the centre, which in turn, and worryingly, greatly diminishes the ability to scrutinise the Scottish Prison Service and hold ministers to account.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Localism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will perhaps take an intervention later.

That report&#8217;s recommendations were debated in the chamber in 2009, but three years later, the issues that it raised and the recommendations that it made are still unresolved, as the commission&#8217;s report before us confirms.</p><p>Prisoners with mental health issues are one of three main issues that are covered in both reports. There are women in Cornton Vale with mental health issues so severe that 24/7 supervision is required to stop them self-harming, which in turn puts huge pressure on prison staff. Such prisoners are not a danger to the public, but they are a very real danger to themselves and they ought to be in hospital and not in prison. The issue was raised in the committee&#8217;s 2009 report, so why are such women still in prison?</p><p>Both reports raise the issue of remand. We know that 70 per cent of the female prisoners on remand will not serve a custodial sentence. It therefore makes sense to look at the alternatives to remand that are outlined in the commission&#8217;s report, such as electronic tagging or bail supervision.</p><p>On sentencing, both reports stress the necessity of ensuring that sentencers are in full possession of important information about the offender&#8217;s background, their medication and their health issues&#8212;including mental health issues.</p><p>The commission&#8217;s report recommends the introduction of</p><p>&#8220;a truncated Criminal Justice Social Work Report, a Rapid Report&#8221;</p><p>to be made available to criminal courts</p><p>&#8220;on the day of conviction ... or within two working days&#8221;</p><p>and containing that type of information to enable quick and appropriate sentencing. That recommendation should be adopted, coupled with the recommendation for comprehensive judicial training to ensure that judges are aware of all available custody alternatives, such as community sentence disposals&#8212;served, for example, at the 218 centre.</p><p>Significantly, if the mental health, remand and sentencing recommendations alone from the 2009 report had been taken on board&#8212;as they could quite easily have been over the past three years&#8212;that would have gone some considerable way towards addressing the overcrowding problem. That in turn would have freed up prison staff to help to deliver rehabilitation programmes for the prisoners for whom prison is quite definitely the correct sentence.</p><p>However, it takes leadership and political will to make such changes and sadly they have been absent. That is particularly disappointing in view of the fact that the Cabinet took the unusual step of discussing the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s 2009 report and, on the back of that discussion, awarded &#163;800,000 to community justice authorities.</p><p>That was in recognition of the results that were achieved by one community justice authority, which worked with Circle&#8212;the charity that does outstanding work to support offenders&#8217; families&#8212;to run a pilot scheme that cut reoffending rates dramatically. However, despite those results, it was not suggested that each of the eight community justice authorities should use the &#163;100,000 that was available to them to run similar projects, and the outcomes from how each community justice authority spent the additional funding were not measured. Consequently, an opportunity was lost to tackle the reoffending revolving-door syndrome.</p><p>I have highlighted issues in the commission&#8217;s report that could and should be acted on now, but there are recommendations with which I disagree.

For me, that provided an amazing insight into a sphere of politics that is inhabited by a rich diversity of people. At the conference, hugely important issues were discussed, including human trafficking. The discussion on that concentrated parliamentary minds on the need to improve co-operation, increase understanding and raise awareness of the issue in an effort to tackle and eradicate that vile trade. In New Delhi, I was privileged to represent the Scotland branch at the first meeting of the Commonwealth women parliamentarians.</p><p>The work of the Scotland CPA branch has grown and progressed, most notably by addressing specific issues such as HIV, which affects the life expectancy and health and wellbeing of many women and girls in the Commonwealth. At this point, I welcome to the public gallery pupils of Coatbridge high school and St Margaret&#8217;s high school in Airdrie, which are in my Central Scotland constituency. Those schools participate in the healthy lifestyle project, which promotes positive and healthy lifestyles to primary and secondary pupils, parents and residents in the area. I have seen at first hand the impressive emergency life skills aspect of the project. However, one particular strand of the healthy lifestyle project is the aiming higher in Malawi scheme, which runs in conjunction with partner schools in Malawi and the Forum for African Women Educationalists. The project has many different elements, such as the girls go for health initiative. As part of the programme, several of the young people who are in the public gallery today will travel to Malawi in June.</p><p>More generally, the healthy lifestyle project provides a forum for girls to engage in after-school activities such as debates, study groups and discussions about HIV and AIDS mitigation. In short, the partnership between the schools in Scotland and Malawi is an excellent model that I hope can be replicated in other schools. That link is representative of the relationship between Scotland and Malawi, which has developed over recent years since the signing of the Scotland-Malawi co-operation agreement in 2005.

In the Central Scotland region alone, child poverty levels are between 15 and 24 per cent, and according to last year&#8217;s Save the Children report on severe child poverty in Scotland, the rate of such poverty in the local authority areas of North and South Lanarkshire and of Falkirk is above the national average of 9 per cent. Moreover, the proportion of children in workless households has risen from 14 to 16 per cent, which is more than in any of the English regions. Clearly, child poverty in Scotland urgently needs to be addressed.</p><p>As the motion states, Save the Children and other campaigning organisations are calling for every local authority to implement the living wage for all directly and indirectly employed workers, in order to tackle child poverty. At the same time, they acknowledge that the living wage is not a panacea for child poverty in Scotland. It is important that that fact is recognised, in order to make the right choices about how best to help alleviate and, ultimately, end child poverty.</p><p>It is a great pity, therefore, that in last week&#8217;s debate on the Local Government and Regeneration Committee&#8217;s report on the living wage in Scotland&#8212;it is a balanced and fair report&#8212;many members chose to completely ignore, summarily dismiss or condemn outright the concerns that were raised. There is no point in repeating those concerns, which were also voiced by some of the witnesses who gave evidence to the committee, about the potentially adverse consequences of introducing the living wage. Suffice it to say that it would be counter-productive for the payment of the living wage to be mandatory; it must instead be voluntary. If we are to do the best for our children in poverty, the least that they deserve is for us as politicians to be open to listening to views that may differ from our own. That includes being prepared to consider analysis of information that suggests that there may be a better way in which to tackle child poverty than making payment of the living wage a priority. For example, one of the major factors in in-work poverty and, by extension, child poverty is the high cost of childcare provision, which hits household incomes and prevents women, most commonly, from realising their full earning potential. That is a pertinent point to raise on international women&#8217;s day.</p><p>On average, parents in Scotland spend &#163;101.49 per week for 25 hours of care for a child under two; however, the cost can be as high as &#163;233.75 in some areas. Fifteen hours of an after-school club cost, on average, &#163;48.55 a week, which equates to &#163;194 a month. Given that 35 hours of work at the living wage of &#163;7.20 an hour would pay only &#163;252 a week before tax, it is clear that, if local authorities chose to prioritise funding more childcare, that could make a greater difference to tackling both in-work poverty and child poverty.</p><p>As the recent joint Daycare Trust and Children in Scotland report highlighted, only a fifth of Scottish local authorities currently report that they have enough childcare for parents who work full time. It is, therefore, important to understand the full implications of calling on local authorities to prioritise the introduction of the living wage. South Lanarkshire Council, for example, has spent &#163;5.5&#160;million in total on introducing the living wage. That money could have been used to increase childcare provision or to offset the potentially damaging consequences of the &#163;6&#160;million real-terms cut in local authority criminal justice social work funding&#8212;a cut that could have worrying implications for child protection issues.</p><p>This is a timely reminder that child poverty, in its broadest terms, is not necessarily merely a monetary problem.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662943", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate John Park on securing this extremely important debate.

It is an excellent example of preventative spend in action.</p><p>However, Scottish Conservatives have a number of concerns about the Scottish Government&#8217;s funding proposals.

It is a great pity that the opportunity has been lost to introduce a scheme like the one that was suggested by Scottish Conservatives in 2009, whereby local authorities could keep 100 per cent of the surplus. Together with revised collection targets, that would offer a real incentive to local authorities.

The public health justification for this levy is completely unfounded.&#8221;</p><p>Given that the retail sector is the country&#8217;s largest private employer&#8212;it employs approximately 240,000 people&#8212;the adverse consequences of that discrimination are potentially far reaching, and they put in jeopardy the 59 per cent of part-time jobs in Scotland in the retail sector that are flexible and attract young people and women in particular. In fact, 62 per cent of the Scottish retail workforce is female, and those jobs often represent second incomes that bolster household incomes and are a source of additional spending power that benefits other local business and the local economy. That fully answers John Mason&#8217;s point.</p><p>A third of retail employees are under 25. Many young people get their first employment opportunity in the retail sector. Given that more than 100,000 16 to 24-year-olds are unemployed in Scotland, the discriminatory tax that I am discussing runs the risk of adding to the depressing figures by denying young people the opportunity to gain their first foothold on the employment ladder. Perhaps it is not surprising that the sport, tourism, hospitality, food and drink, and transport industries are all mentioned as possible sources of employment for young people in the Scottish Government&#8217;s &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Youth Employment Strategy&#8221;, but mention of the retail sector is notable by its absence.</p><p>I turn to the direct funding provision for criminal justice social work. In cash terms, the funding remains the same over the next three years but, in real terms, that represents a cut in excess of &#163;6 million. This is a vital allocation that provides core funding to ensure that adequate resources for criminal justice social work and workers are in place to enable them to deliver pre-sentence reports to courts; provide community sentences and supervise probation orders; carry out the post-release supervision of offenders on statutory licence and voluntary throughcare; and generally assess the risks and circumstances of offenders in the community. In other words, this budget investment represents a clear and compelling example of preventative spend.

First, in deciding on that course of action, the cabinet secretary dismissed the fact that a majority of respondents&#8212;98 per cent&#8212;are in favour of the retention of visiting committees. He said that that is because the majority of the respondents&#8212;55 per cent&#8212;were visiting committee members. If that approach is taken to its logical conclusion, we can confidently predict that if, in the Scottish Government&#8217;s forthcoming consultation on separation&#8212;which is more commonly referred to as the independence referendum&#8212;a majority of people decide in favour of Scotland remaining within the United Kingdom, their views will be dismissed on the basis that they are unionists. How ridiculous.</p><p>Section 259(1) of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 creates a legal requirement that</p><p>&#8220;Every person with a mental disorder shall have a right of access to independent advocacy&#8221;.</p><p>That includes prisoners with mental health issues. However, despite that requirement, the evidence that the Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance presented to the Equal Opportunities Committee when it carried out post-legislative scrutiny of the 2003 act confirmed that</p><p>&#8220;Access to independent advocacy by prisoners is generally non-existent&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 16 March 2010; c 1480.]</p><p>Independent advocacy is a legal requirement and should already be available to prisoners who have mental health issues, and to other vulnerable prisoners who have complex needs. To that extent, the new independent dedicated service is welcome. The nub of the issue is that the advocacy function&#8212;under the 2003 act, for example&#8212;is intended to provide more specialised independent support to deal with complex issues for vulnerable people who do not have the capacity to speak or advocate for themselves. That is entirely different from visiting committees&#8217; functions and role.</p><p>Rather than duplicating services that are proposed or are in place, visiting committees provide complementary services which&#8212;crucially&#8212;include truly independent and objective monitoring of prison conditions, operations and services, and the handling of prisoner complaints, through regular unannounced visits. Visiting committees provide invaluable information&#8212;often at variance with the official SPS line&#8212;for parliamentary committees that are taking evidence on prison conditions and issues that face prisoners. That might well explain why the SPS was the only consultation respondent that is in favour of abolishing visiting committees.</p><p>Given the Scottish Government&#8217;s stated commitment to open, transparent and accountable government, it is astounding that that principle is not being applied to monitoring of the SPS, which is an agency of the Government.

Electronic counting was also used for the first time, resulting in the rejection of ballot papers, which were automatically discounted without any manual authorisation. It is perhaps not surprising that, with all those factors to contend with, the process became all-important and the voter was forgotten.</p><p>The key Gould review recommendations were legislated for in the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Act 2009.

Antisocial behaviour has been ignored by every other party in the chamber, yet, as every elected member knows, it is a major problem in every constituency. Therefore, it defies belief that statistics on the use of antisocial behaviour orders and other antisocial behaviour remedies are no longer collated. That is because, in 2008, the SNP Government decided to develop a voluntary performance framework instead, with an annual report being made to Parliament on progress&#8212;or lack of it&#8212;towards the implementation of the promotion of positive outcomes. That represented a change in direction from enforcement and punishment of crimes to prevention and early intervention. The only problem is that, to date, there has been very little evidence of early intervention or prevention strategies delivering for people who are suffering from the blight of antisocial neighbours.</p><p>I will give one example, which, appallingly, is not uncommon. A constituent of mine has lived in her flat for 16 years. She works during the day and has an evening job. The past three and a half years have been, in her words, &#8220;a living hell&#8221;. Why? Because three and a half years ago, a 17-year-old girl was allocated a house in her block of flats, where the tenants had all looked after common property and had lived in harmony for many years. That individual does not work, so it has been party time, with loud music into the early hours and a constant stream of young people coming and going.</p><p>If that was not bad enough, a 17-year-old male, also unemployed, was allocated housing in the same block of flats. The result is that what was a well-kept council property has had its security doors ripped off and fights are commonplace, with walls being left smeared with blood. A constant stream of teenagers come and go late into the night and the early hours of the morning, urinate on the stairs and are usually so drunk that they shout through letterboxes completely unaware of which flat they are trying to access. That is a terrifying experience for my constituent, who lives alone. Sleep is impossible. The lady in question, who has never been ill or taken a day off work in her life, has had to visit the doctor, who has prescribed antidepressants such as Valium, which she does not want to take&#8212;and why should she have to? I do not need to go on. It is clear that that situation does not make any sense from a human or an economic perspective. There is absolutely no evidence of early intervention or preventative spend there.</p><p>What is evident is that the SNP Government, which has been in power for almost five years and which presides over local government and housing policy, has done nothing to ensure that tenancy agreements are enforced by local authorities so that, at the first sign of trouble, respectable, law-abiding tenants know that officials are on their side. The Government has also done nothing to ensure that allocation policies are proportionate and sensible and that they protect the elderly and other tenants.</p><p>The debate has exposed the extent to which the SNP Government&#8217;s warm words about early intervention and preventative spend are, in practice, a sham. More significantly, it has made clear the real priorities of the SNP, Labour and the Lib Dems, all of whose amendments seek to delete the motion&#8217;s reference to antisocial behaviour. Indeed, Lewis Macdonald and Jamie Hepburn dismissed the topic as being the wrong one to concentrate on. The clear and indisputable message to honest, hard-working tenants and families in Scotland who merely want to live in decent housing and in peace is that, if those parties are not prepared to make tackling antisocial tenants a priority, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party will do that. Quite simply, we are on their side.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654922", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps later.

Given that fact, and with the advent of free prescription charges, it is a matter of concern that, at a time when finances in the public sector are under pressure, there appears to have been no attempt to date to quantify the cost of wastage in Scotland.</p><p>My recent freedom of information request to Scottish national health service boards about prescription medicine wastage revealed that boards are largely unaware of how much that wastage costs, but NHS Lanarkshire estimated it to be a staggering &#163;2 million each year and NHS Tayside subsequently estimated the cost to be &#163;3.5 million a year. To put the figures in perspective, that is equivalent to the cost of 180 bypass operations and 137 community nurses respectively. In other words, there are substantial sums of money that could be used for the delivery of essential and front-line services and/or the provision of staff.</p><p>Prescription medicine wastage is clearly an issue that needs to be tackled. I am therefore pleased to see that, since I lodged the motion, the Scottish Government has announced that the role of pharmacists is to be reviewed. That is to be welcomed, as I believe that pharmacists are potentially key in our attempts to address the issue.</p><p>It is worth while to stress that some prescription wastage is unavoidable&#8212;for example, if a patient recovers before the prescribed course of medicine is completed, if a treatment is changed by a doctor because it is not working or has an adverse side effect, or if a patient builds up an immunity to the medicine prescribed to treat their condition.</p><p>The good news is that there are various ways that wastage can be reduced or even eliminated. For instance, NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Tayside have both taken steps to tackle wastage by raising awareness of repeat prescription usage through initiatives to encourage people to think about their repeat prescriptions, to stop ordering items on a just-in-case basis, and to make them aware of the costs, especially as most people do not realise that even if they return unused medicines to their pharmacy those medicines cannot be reused and are destroyed.</p><p>Other methods to reduce wastage include doing something as straightforward as ensuring that patients know how to take their medicines correctly and recognising that vulnerable groups may be unsure about how often to take their medicine or which medicine to take. If people are uncertain of their supply, they repeat order all of their prescription, which in turn leads to medicine going to waste or being stockpiled at home.</p><p>If pharmacists were given access to relevant parts of patients&#8217; health records, they could dispense repeat prescriptions with more accuracy and at the same time help to manage patients&#8217; care as they move between different parts of the NHS. Ultimately, there must be better communication between healthcare professionals, general practitioners, pharmacists and patients, thereby providing improved patient treatment and reducing waste.</p><p>It is evident that providing pharmacies with time-saving technology and enabling them to have access to accurate, up-to-date records will allow them to spend more time with patients, helping to address any problems with medication and ensuring that medicines are dispensed only in the quantities required and when they are needed.</p><p>To that end, the chronic medication service has not only the potential to improve significantly the care of those with long-term conditions but the ability, through its electronic sharing of information and the establishment of a relationship between the patient and a particular community pharmacist, to reduce prescription medicine wastage.</p><p>Furthermore, last year&#8217;s University of York &#8220;Evaluation of the Scale, Causes and Costs of Waste Medicines&#8221; concluded that</p><p>&#8220;enhancing hospital and primary care liaison in contexts such as improving the quality of care at around the time of hospital discharge&#8221;</p><p>was a positive opportunity for the reduction of medicines waste.</p><p>That is borne out by the experience in the new Forth Valley royal hospital, which has Scotland&#8217;s first fully robotic pharmacy, where NHS Forth Valley uses an innovative eWARD system. The system has substantially improved electronic communications between the hospital and the primary care sector and has resulted in a 20 per cent reduction in stockholding. The use of both electronic medicine records in the hospital and the innovative eWARD discharge system has already resulted in positive changes, not only in the ward but also at home.</p><p>Finally, as I said, regulations mean that returned unused medicines cannot currently be reused and are destroyed. However, I understand that some European countries, including France, have waste medicine recycling schemes, whereby unused packs of medicines, with suitable expiry dates, are collected and later supplied to populations in need in countries around the world.</p><p>Given that counterfeit medicines are being distributed to so many third world countries, I request that the minister looks at the possibility of adopting a recycling scheme, similar to the French one, to help people in Africa and other parts of the world where medicines are desperately needed and could make a massive difference.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prescription Medicine Waste"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "According to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the cost of providing medicines is rising every year.

In that regard, the Westminster Government&#8217;s announcement today on sell-by dates is welcome and should be helpful. The hierarchy goes on to cover the reuse of waste, and then emphasises recycling and recovery.</p><p>For the benefit of the layperson and anyone else who is bemused by the different types of waste management systems, recovery means extracting other value&#8212;for example, creating energy. However, the hierarchy does not mention landfill as a means of disposing of waste, which would come a poor fifth in the pecking order.</p><p>To put the issue in perspective, householders are undoubtedly trying to do their bit, but are increasingly angered and frustrated because despite their supporting the zero waste objective by conscientiously concentrating on reusing or&#8212;if that is not possible&#8212;recycling their waste, the local authorities have not put in place the necessary services to facilitate that.</p><p>The minister and the cabinet secretary may be interested in a situation that has arisen in Central Scotland. The courageous communities of Greengairs and neighbouring communities in the north Airdrie community group in North Lanarkshire currently live with the largest-capacity landfill site in Europe, as well as four other recently completed landfills. Those communities have taken the reasonable and responsible positive action of supporting&#8212;and even, in some instances, suggesting&#8212;the establishment of recycling and reuse waste technologies in North Lanarkshire in order to avoid the need for an incinerator. However, despite the communities making those suggestions and taking part in the local plans, and despite the designation as a rural investment area&#8212;which should have precluded the presence of an incinerator&#8212;the Drumshangie incinerator, which will have the capacity to burn 300,000 tonnes of waste a year, was approved in May 2009. In effect, that ignores the hierarchy of waste management and the willingness of people to support the creation of reuse and recycling facilities in their communities. North Lanarkshire will now have a huge capacity not only for landfill, but for incineration.</p><p>In addition, two more applications for incinerators are pending in North Lanarkshire, the most recent in Harthill. With that number of applications currently on the go, it is difficult not to conclude that, rather than concentrating on need, people are making widespread speculative planning applications.</p><p>If all that was not enough, there is also an issue with incinerators in South Lanarkshire and, at the other end of my region, Forth Energy has applied to build a biomass plant in Grangemouth. I am reliably informed that biomass facilities often turn into incinerators.</p><p>It is therefore clear that the waste management priorities as outlined in the hierarchy are not being implemented, and that consequently, the people of North and South Lanarkshire, Falkirk and elsewhere in Scotland are not being rewarded for their perseverance and participation. Furthermore, given the strength of feeling against the use of landfill and incinerators, the communities that are involved are, more often than not, much better versed in the issues than are politicians, yet there is a definite lack of meaningful consultation of local residents.</p><p>To take the latest example, in Harthill the developer held the consultation on a weekday afternoon when it was clear that the vast majority of local residents could not attend, so&#8212;not surprisingly&#8212;only seven did. It is particularly frustrating that in councils such as North Lanarkshire, there appear to be startling inconsistencies on how incinerator planning applications are dealt with. In those circumstances, I suggest that the following should be considered as a priority: first, the Scottish Government should consider the reasons why local authorities do not have appropriate recycling facilities and ensure that the issue is addressed.

It highlights the Cabinet Secretary for Justice&#8217;s proposal to transfer the role of the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland, a non-departmental public body currently based in Hamilton, to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. It also seeks</p><p>&#8220;a review of the functions and powers&#8221;</p><p>of the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland, including in</p><p>&#8220;the ongoing discussion on the restructuring of the Police Service in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>Support for such a review approach is shared by diverse key stakeholders, including academics, Amnesty International and police officers both serving and retired, all of whom recognise the distinct nature of the roles and responsibilities of the police and the fact that, crucially, the powers of the police set them apart from other public servants in terms of the oversight and scrutiny of complaints.</p><p>That is not to trivialise the complaints that are dealt with by the SPSO; rather, it is to acknowledge the particular nature of police complaints.</p><p>To quote Amnesty International, the nature and extent of police powers make them</p><p>&#8220;the front line of protecting the public&#8217;s human rights on a daily basis &#8211; whether protecting the right to freedom from harm&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>or the right to life&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;defending their right to property, or prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, gender, or sexual orientation ... In order to uphold the Government&#8217;s duty to protect the human rights of its citizens, police have legitimate powers to limit the rights of others, most notably in depriving people of their liberty and in the state-sanctioned use of force.&#8221;</p><p>In other words, policing is about some of the most fundamental principles of how the state treats its citizens. What society needs, and everyone wants, is policing that is accountable and based on integrity. Those principles date back almost 2,000 years, to when the Roman satirist, Juvenal, posed a question:</p><p>&#8220;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&#8221;</p><p>That means, literally, &#8220;Who guards the guards?&#8221; The question is just as relevant today, given the recognition of the uniqueness of police complaints from legal and civil liberties perspectives. It is not surprising, therefore, that widespread concern was expressed when, on December 14 last year, the cabinet secretary wrote to the PCC to advise him of the proposal to transfer the functions of his office to the SPSO and asking him, and other stakeholders, to respond by 19 January. At the same time, the cabinet secretary stated that he was looking to initiate this transfer now because of the budget reductions that are faced by the justice portfolio. Quite simply, a consultation of little more than four weeks&#8212;held over the festive season&#8212;was hopelessly inadequate, and the subsequent extension of the deadline for responses to 31 January was not much better.</p><p>In the words of the German sociologist and political economist, Max Weber:</p><p>&#8220;three pre-eminent qualities are decisive for the politician: passion, a feeling of responsibility and a sense of proportion.&#8221;</p><p>Although no one doubts the cabinet secretary's passion for justice issues, sadly, in his handling of this consultation, he was not proportionate. That is worrying, especially with the advent of Scottish National Party majority government. It is disappointing that, to date, no SNP MSP has felt able to sign the motion.</p><p>However, tonight&#8217;s debate affords the opportunity to analyse some of the facts that are not in dispute, such as the fact that the change that was consulted on is in no way a reflection of the work of the PCCS and the dedication of its staff. On the contrary, the knowledge and experience of the staff were commended by the numerous respondents to the consultation.</p><p>The police complaints commissioner is not opposed to a wholesale review of the role and remit of his office. After the four years of the post&#8217;s existence, the time may well have been right to examine the commissioner&#8217;s powers, and that is most certainly necessary now, against the background of the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation on the future structure of policing.</p><p>All four parts of the United Kingdom have independent police complaints departments. Elsewhere, South Africa, Canada, and the Netherlands all have a specialised oversight agency for police complaints, and that is the prevailing trend of police forces across Europe in recent years.</p><p>At present in Scotland, under the Lord Advocate&#8217;s guidelines, an investigating officer from another force may be appointed in cases of complaints against senior officers or following incidents involving the police use of firearms, road deaths involving vehicles driven by the police and deaths in custody. If Scotland were to move to a single police force, that would result in that force investigating itself, which would almost certainly breach the European Convention of Human Rights&#8212;some dubiety exists about even the present system&#8217;s compliance.</p><p>Finally, it is far from certain that the desired economic or practical objectives that this proposal seeks to achieve will be realised. I will quote two consultees on the matter. Fife police authority says:</p><p>&#8220;the financial and logistical case has not been sufficiently robust to support this move&#8221;</p><p>and the Dumfries and Galloway police and fire and rescue authority says that the consultation</p><p>&#8220;extends to the equivalent of an A4 page containing numerous aspirational statements with no evidence to quantify potential savings to the public purse, potential benefit to members of the public in terms of outcomes arising from the changes, and indeed any indication in practical terms as to how these changes will actually be effected in practice or any indicative cost to be offset against potential savings.&#8221;</p><p>To consider transferring the powers of the PCCS to the SPSO in isolation and before the review of the structure of Scotland&#8217;s police force was deemed to be presumptuous by many consultees, and respondents such as Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland were firmly of the opinion that a review of the PCCS and consideration of the possibility of transferring powers to the SPSO would be better measured within the context of this wider reform of policing in Scotland. I sincerely hope that the cabinet secretary will support that view this evening and I look forward to his comments.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649680", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I welcome the police complaints commissioner, Professor John McNeill, and members of the PCCS staff, who are in the gallery to hear the debate.

Although a lot of ground has been covered, that has meant that that some of the serious and compelling justice issues that require to be addressed in depth and, in the case of knife crime, as a matter of urgency, have not been discussed in the detail that they merit.</p><p>In the time that is available to me, I intend to focus on knife crime. True to form, the cabinet secretary has reminded us, with the bravado that he routinely adopts when commenting on criminal justice statistics, that knife crime is down by a third. However, behind that &#8220;good news&#8221; is the heartbreak and unimaginable misery of the families and friends of a seemingly ever-increasing number of, for the most part, young men in Lanarkshire and elsewhere in Scotland who have lost their lives in senseless and violent attacks with knives.</p><p>The cabinet secretary proffers his sympathy to the families of the latest victims of knife-crime murder, but let me spell out the full extent of the problem. In the past six months, the Lanarkshire knife murder tally alone makes grim reading. For example, in February, 19-year-old University of Glasgow student Reamonn Gormley was knifed to death in Blantyre minutes from his home, after watching a football match on television at his local pub. In April, 20-year-old P J Douglas, a trainee chef, was found with serious knife injuries in a block of flats in Greenhills in East Kilbride. He died in Hairmyres hospital shortly afterwards and his death is the third violent knife death in East Kilbride in a year. Last Saturday afternoon, 30-year-old Christopher Devlin from Airdrie was fatally wounded in a knife attack after being found bleeding to death in the street&#8212;in broad daylight&#8212;on the estate where he lived. Scotland-wide, in the past six months murders with knives are averaging three a month.</p><p>The Scottish Government insists that tough enforcement and education are key to tackling such crime. To date, it has spent &#163;500,000 on initiatives such as the no knives, better lives campaign. It has also put record levels of investment into the national violence reduction unit. So much has been done to try to educate and to help to get the message across to young people about the dangers and consequences of carrying a knife. However, the same cannot be said for the tough enforcement that the SNP Government professes to recognise as being key to tackling the knife carnage that is blighting communities throughout Scotland&#8212;carnage that has taken place on the cabinet secretary&#8217;s watch.</p><p>I quote Chief Superintendent David O&#8217;Connor, who is president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents:</p><p>&#8220;The country has now reached tipping point in knife crime with urgent political solutions needed. It is hard to see what other deterrents short of imprisonment can work. Warnings on knife crime are no longer being heeded. Those who carry knives need to be eradicated from our communities.&#8221;</p><p>I say to the cabinet secretary that it does not get much plainer than that.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s justice debate has been open ended and, as a number of members have noted, wide ranging.

The jurisdiction of the protection orders was also clarified to include the requirement from a person to refrain from taking a protected person to another part of Scotland or outside Scotland. A new section 67 ground was created under which a child who has been, or is likely to be, forced into marriage can be referred to the principal reporter.

It strikes the right balance on criminal and civil sanctions and addresses victims&#8217; concerns about criminalisation of family members by providing that only breach of an order by the perpetrators will be a criminal offence, which may result in up to two years in prison.</p><p>In addition to the primary legislation, I support the call for a public awareness and education campaign, which I consider to be essential, to be carried out in Scotland, to ensure that the issue is understood and addressed.</p><p>Forced marriage is a violation of fundamental and internationally recognised human rights.

It seems that the only point to be debated is whether there is widespread dissatisfaction among Denny residents about the plans for the town centre&#8217;s regeneration.</p><p>The project has been an aspiration for many years under local government administrations of different political persuasions, so it can only be good news that the regeneration is finally in progress&#8212;although it is, perhaps not surprisingly, likely to be a long, drawn-out process as various issues, some foreseen and some unforeseen, are resolved.</p><p>To put it into perspective, resolving those issues and gaining the necessary consents take time and can be frustrating for the local community and everyone else. Reasonable people only become dissatisfied when they are not kept advised about why there are delays&#8212;unforeseen or otherwise. The question is, therefore, whether the local community has been sufficiently consulted and kept advised. Denny residents and local businesses have been included in the regeneration plans for Denny town centre at every stage of the process, and plans have been altered to reflect the concerns of the community.</p><p>The original master plan for the regeneration was presented to retailers and the Denny community. Following feedback from the public, the plan was revised to address their concerns, particularly those about disabled access. The revised plan was put on open display to the public, who were also informed about the development via a website, a newsletter and a questionnaire. In February 2007, 93 per cent of the questionnaire respondents considered the plan to be satisfactory or better.</p><p>During the following few months, a working group&#8212;including members of the community council, retailer associations and council officials&#8212;agreed to resolve the traffic-management issues. There was also communication with the archdiocese after an access concern was raised. That issue was resolved.</p><p>Because of the economic downturn, the plan had to be revised and further consultations were undertaken. Meetings were held with the Denny community and local retailers, displays were erected in public buildings and plans were published online. The feedback from that consultation was positive, with 76 per cent of those who completed the online survey favouring the proposals. Of those who attended the library display, 100 per cent favoured the plans. In addition to that, feedback was also presented at a public meeting in January 2008. Further amendments to the revised plan were presented to the community through drop-in centres that were held over two days in August 2010. Of the 160 people who attended those sessions, 90 per cent found that the proposals were a positive step for Denny.</p><p>I could go on, but it is self-evident that there has clearly been extensive consultation of the local community every step of the way.

The Calman commission was convened not to respond to public clamour for change, to make Holyrood more accountable or even to mark the watershed of 10 years of devolved government; rather, as the December 2007 approval date indicates, the commission was the unionist parties&#8217; reaction to the advent of a minority SNP Government in May 2007.</p><p>In the first instance, the commission&#8217;s remit was to recommend changes to the constitutional arrangements to enable the Scottish Parliament to serve the people better. In other words, Holyrood politicians decided on constitutional navel-gazing when, in the real world, it was widely recognised that the elephant in the room was the desperate need to reform how business in the Parliament is carried out.

I acknowledge the work that Wendy Alexander has done in her time as an MSP and I wish her well for the future.</p><p>The unionist members who favour the fiscal powers that the Scotland Bill Committee recommended argue that they will strengthen the union. However, political commentator Iain Macwhirter firmly believes the opposite. His comments on Radio Scotland&#8217;s &#8220;Newsweek Scotland&#8221; last Saturday morning must surely ring alarm bells among all who care about and want to maintain the union with the rest of the UK. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Since the Calman report was first published two years ago, I mean, I&#8217;ve had to pinch myself, because I still can&#8217;t quite believe that even as the SNP appears to be losing political momentum the pace of home rule has been stepped up.&#8221;</p><p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland has raised legitimate points about the unintended consequences that could result from confusion about who precisely is a Scottish taxpayer. The cost of creating a register of Scottish taxpayers has been estimated at between &#163;45 million and &#163;150 million&#8212;that depends on how the term is defined. At a time of austerity and threats to front-line services, the public deserve the right to decide whether such money would be well spent. It has also been argued that another unintended consequence would be the adverse effect on the Scottish economy as businesses desert Scotland in fear of higher taxes.</p><p>So, let us put all this in perspective. Regardless of how convinced any one of us may be that our view is correct, no one&#8212;not me nor any other elected parliamentarian&#8212;has all the answers. In the words of Dr Nicola McEwen, the co-director of the institute of governance and a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Edinburgh:</p><p>&#8220;this has been an elite-based debate almost academic in some ways ...

Here we are again, at another important milestone: namely, the 250th anniversary of the founding of the co-operative. Who could have imagined when the 16 weavers and apprentices signed the founding charter in Fenwick parish church on 14 March 1761 that that would herald the beginning of a journey that 250 years later has seen the establishment of a worldwide co-operative movement that today has over 1 billion members and has resulted in the provision of over 100 million jobs?</p><p>As a result of the signing of the charter in Fenwick, those weavers were able to control the trade within the area and hence protect themselves and their families from the unpredictable and often challenging economic times. Over the next decade the co-operative grew to include the bulk buying of food to be sold to members of the co-operative and other Fenwick villagers. In addition, there is evidence of a co-operative savings scheme&#8212;the 18th century equivalent of a credit union.</p><p>Further, the charter set out the principles of the society, which were honesty, faithfulness to one another, fair pricing, majority decisions, regular contributions to the poor fund and an admission charge of 2/6 to be used for the good of the society and the people it aimed to help.</p><p>Those remain good principles for us all to follow today.

Our wide-ranging inquiry covered issues of both reserved and devolved responsibility, and it involved taking evidence from the Scottish Government, Scottish agencies and United Kingdom departments. As convener of the committee, I thank the committee members and clerks for their hard work, and I pay tribute to all those witnesses who made such a valuable contribution to the inquiry, especially the 25 migrants with whom the committee met informally in Glasgow last June. Hearing first hand about their experiences was tremendously helpful in gaining an understanding of the issues that are faced by migrants who have settled in Scotland.</p><p>Concern was expressed about the confusion between UK departments and the UK Border Agency regarding the extent of devolved responsibilities. In his evidence, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice was critical of negative attitudes at the highest level within the UKBA. The committee considers that the Scottish Government has a responsibility to do all that it can to overcome any intransigence at a UK level, to build a working relationship and to ensure that Scotland has a voice in developing migration and trafficking policies.</p><p>As in other inquiries, the lack of data was an issue for the committee: the availability of migration and trafficking data relating to Scotland was poor. The response from the Minister of State for Immigration confirms that the UKBA does not hold or collect migration statistics on a UK basis. The committee recommended that a protocol be established to make data sharing at a UK level more formal and transparent because the more accurate the data, the more that trends in migration and trafficking can inform the development of policies and the delivery of services to local communities. The issue is complex, but the committee stands by its recommendation, as data must be collected and shared.</p><p>Public perceptions in Scotland about migrants tended to be negative and were based, for the most part, on misinformation. Terminology has played a part in perpetuating negative stereotypes. The terms &#8220;migrant&#8221; and &#8220;asylum seeker&#8221; have often been used as interchangeable generic terms.</p><p>There was a lack of awareness, and even total ignorance, about migrants from outwith the European Union, who include economic migrants, asylum seekers, failed asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and refugees.</p><p>There was also a lack of awareness about migrants from within the EU, who fall into three distinct groups: EU nationals from countries that joined the EU prior to 2004, who have the same rights as UK citizens; accession 8 nationals, who are from the eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 and are allowed to work in the UK if they register with the Government&#8217;s worker registration scheme; and A2 nationals, who are from countries that joined the EU in January 2007 and have restricted rights in relation to work and access to benefits and housing and homelessness assistance.</p><p>In fact, most migrants come here legitimately, bringing skills and experience that are needed to help the economy. They tend to live in private rented accommodation rather than in social or local authority housing.</p><p>Witnesses blamed negative perceptions of migration issues on media reporting. The committee thought that the criticism was justified. We were therefore encouraged to hear from the National Union of Journalists about the steps that are being taken to improve journalists&#8217; knowledge and understanding of the issues. It is hoped that the improvements will extend to the reporting of today&#8217;s debate. If our inquiry results only in more analytical reporting of migration issues, it will have been worth while.</p><p>Another worrying issue that emerged in our inquiry is the extent to which migrants lack an understanding of their rights and responsibilities. A number of migrants in Glasgow revealed that they are paying high rents for the privilege of living in substandard, overcrowded, squalid conditions. Some people had been lured here by unscrupulous landlords who had placed advertisements in publications abroad, offering accommodation and jobs that failed to materialise. The committee therefore welcomes the measures in the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill, which will strengthen regulation of the sector. We also welcome the current review of the landlord registration scheme.</p><p>Trafficking is commonly referred to as sexual exploitation, but there are many forms of human trafficking, including forced labour, domestic servitude and child trafficking. The committee was appalled to learn that child trafficking, which is an activity that we associate more with third-world countries, is very much an issue in towns and cities in Scotland.</p><p>Glasgow City Council is to be commended for taking the lead in the pilot of a national trafficking toolkit. The committee called on the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to improve awareness of child trafficking among all Scotland&#8217;s local authorities, and recommended that best practice from Glasgow be shared and widely disseminated. We welcomed the scoping exercise that Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People is undertaking, in which the extent and nature of child trafficking into and within Scotland are being considered. The report will be published on 14 March.</p><p>Trafficking is a narrative journey. An individual might be trafficked into forced labour and then moved into prostitution. The committee acknowledged the tremendous work of the trafficking awareness raising alliance project and other agencies in supporting victims, whose specific needs can be difficult to assess.</p><p>It is an offence to act as an unlicensed gangmaster. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority has responsibility for tackling and regulating the supply of workers in agriculture, forestry, horticulture, shellfish gathering, food processing and packaging. The GLA&#8217;s power of arrest does not cover Scotland. The committee considered that the power of arrest should be extended to Scotland and welcomed the Secretary of State for Scotland&#8217;s commitment to encourage dialogue with the Scottish Government, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the GLA on the issue.</p><p>The extension of the provisions of the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 to the construction industry is welcome, but the committee thought that the extension of provisions to other industries, including care homes and the hospitality sector, should be considered.</p><p>I have provided a flavour of some of the key findings of the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s report.

The Equal Opportunities Committee having been designated as the lead committee on the bill, committee members were pleased to have the opportunity to consider it. My comments today are made as the committee&#8217;s convener.</p><p>During the committee&#8217;s scrutiny of the bill, a number of written submissions were received and members heard oral evidence from a range of witnesses, including representatives of Scottish women&#8217;s aid organisations that deal directly with the victims. I thank all those who gave evidence and made a valuable contribution to the committee&#8217;s consideration of the bill. My thanks also go to committee members and to the EOC clerks for their work in compiling the stage 1 report.</p><p>Similar legislation has been in place in other parts of the United Kingdom since 2007. That means that Scotland is lagging behind and, having heard the harrowing evidence that was provided by those who work with the victims, the committee was in no doubt that the legislation is necessary to protect the victims of forced marriage and to help rid Scotland of an abhorrent practice that has no place in a civilised society.</p><p>As the minister mentioned, there is a lack of data available on forced marriages in Scotland. Although the evidence that the committee received suggests that the number of such marriages is quite low, it was nonetheless clear that the adverse impact on the victim or victims is huge, which confirms the need for the legislation.</p><p>The bill introduces forced marriage protection orders. Witnesses welcomed the provision for making an order that they regarded as more straightforward than the complicated civil remedies that are currently in place. Scotland will become the only part of the UK in which the breach of an order will be a criminal offence that can result in up to two years in prison. Members consider that that approach strikes the correct balance, providing a strong deterrent to the perpetrators of forced marriage while helping the victims, who are frequently subjected to emotional blackmail from relatives, to overcome their concerns about criminalising family members.</p><p>The committee calls on the Government to provide greater clarity on the reporting and notification procedure for acting on the breach of a protection order and on who will have the authority to report a breach. The committee supported the view put forward by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and others that, to be consistent with other legislation, the bill should place the power of arrest for the breach of an order in the bill itself, and it recommends that the Government considers lodging an amendment to that effect.</p><p>On the jurisdiction, members agree that protection orders should relate to conduct outwith Scotland, given that many forced marriages have an international dimension. The committee recognises, however, that the orders will have no jurisdiction abroad and for the orders to be successfully implemented there will need to be either an extradition treaty or good working relationships between the countries.</p><p>Members recommend that the Government considers tightening the provisions that relate to moving a protected person to another part of Scotland or outwith Scotland, and the committee invites the minister to respond to the recommendation. The committee also recommends that the Government considers an amendment to permit, in certain circumstances, the naming of the person who poses the risk to a protected person.</p><p>The bill reinforces a victim-centred approach that allows third parties to make protection order applications on behalf of victims. That is good, but members consider that greater clarity is required about the role that local authorities will play as third parties. The committee invites the Government to provide further information on the on-going responsibilities of third parties to monitor and implement aftercare services. Some specialist support agencies expressed a desire to be listed as relevant third parties, and the committee therefore welcomes the provision in the bill that allows the Scottish ministers to add to the list if required.</p><p>Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid, ACPOS and other witnesses called for the definition of &#8220;forced&#8221; in the bill to be more explicit to include the physical aspect of coercion and abuse. The committee agrees that including that aspect in the bill would reinforce the message that physical violence will not be tolerated. Furthermore, the definition of &#8220;forced marriage&#8221; as used by the Scottish Government states that &#8220;duress is involved&#8221; in forced marriage. Duress may often be involved, but it is not necessarily always involved. The committee therefore invites the Government to reconsider its use of that definition.</p><p>Concern was expressed that a decree of divorce or a declaratory of nullity granted by a Scottish civil court cannot end a marriage according to the provisions of certain religious practices. The committee believes that it is important that the Scottish Government continues to engage with the religious authorities on the issue of nullification of forced marriage and to raise awareness of the bill among all religious communities. The minister&#8217;s reassurance on that point this afternoon is welcome.</p><p>Guidance on implementing and using the legislation will be critical to ensuring that the legislation works effectively. Members therefore welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to lodge an amendment to confirm that it will, rather than may, issue guidance.</p><p>In conclusion, the committee welcomes the bill and recommends that its general principles be agreed to.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643655", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Bill is important legislation.

If anyone doubts the veracity of that statement, they should consider the fact that at least one in three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime. That statistic becomes all the more frightening when we consider that the perpetrator is usually someone who is known to the victim. Violence against women encompasses but is not limited to physical, sexual and psychological violence, including domestic abuse, rape, incest and child sexual abuse, occurring in the family, the general community or in institutions; sexual harassment and intimidation at work and in the public sphere; commercial sexual exploitation, including prostitution, pornography and trafficking; dowry-related violence; female genital mutilation; forced and child marriages; and honour crimes.</p><p>The issue is complicated, so in the limited time that is available I will focus on two specific aspects. The first is the launch of a five-week campaign against domestic abuse by Strathclyde Police, as part of the force's on-going break the circle of violence campaign, which runs throughout the year and has four phases. The domestic abuse phase has proved to be a successful tool in tackling violence against women in Lanarkshire. The campaign involves a proactive approach to organised crime, antisocial behaviour and&#8212;significantly&#8212;domestic abuse. A contributory factor to its success is that the campaign has great local support, particularly from the <em>Airdrie &amp; Coatbridge Advertiser</em>, but also from Asda, North Lanarkshire Council, Scottish Women's Aid and Citizens Advice Scotland, as well as from local politicians of all parties and now the Scottish Prison Service.</p><p>One of the most successful aspects of the campaign is its focus on repeat offenders, who can be tracked using a Scottish database and national intelligence. That allows Strathclyde Police not only to identify the usual suspects, but to take steps to ensure that those repeat offenders know that they are being monitored. In turn, that allows the police to target repeat offenders at <place-holder colnum=\"31938\"/> recognised volatile or trigger times, such as Christmas and new year and before old firm matches, when incidents of domestic violence are known to increase.</p><p>Officers contact the most serious offenders to let them know that the police are aware of their past behaviour and, crucially, that the police are monitoring them. That assertive approach has a marked effect that leads to a significant reduction in the numbers of domestic abuse incidents after, for example, old firm games, because the perpetrators know that the police are watching. In areas such as Monklands, which has the highest number of reported domestic abuse incidents in North Lanarkshire, that proactive approach, coupled with the knowledge that the police are determined to tackle the abuse, can serve only to give victims hope. The unpalatable truth is that as we approach the season of goodwill and look forward to spending time with our families, for all too many domestic abuse victims this is not a time of celebration but a time to dread.</p><p>The second aspect on which I will touch briefly, for the reasons that Hugh O'Donnell stated, was highlighted during the Equal Opportunities Committee scrutiny of stage 1 of the Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Bill. Scottish Women's Aid stated that it is often when women come to it to seek assistance in relation to domestic abuse that the issue of forced marriage comes to light. It is a simple and abhorrent fact that forced marriage is a form of violence against women. That violence is not merely physical, but can involve verbal abuse and coercion, which are in themselves forms of brutality. One of the most appalling instances of coercion involves the threats and emotional blackmail that are sometimes used when a member of the family&#8212;often the victim's mother&#8212;threatens to commit suicide if the woman does not enter into the marriage. Self-evidently, that kind of coercion is deeply distressing and is a dramatic example of the type of intimidation that is exerted. It is not surprising, therefore, that many victims of forced marriage and, by extension, domestic abuse suffer from depression and mental health problems.</p><p>I hope that today's debate will contribute to raising greater awareness of this vexing and all too prevalent issue.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21157102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Violence against women and girls is a problem of pandemic proportions.

I also record my thanks to my fellow committee members and to the committee clerks for compiling the report.</p><p>As we hurtle towards the end of the third session of the Scottish Parliament, this is an opportune time to remind ourselves that, as well as scrutinising current legislation, committees play a vital role in scrutinising legislation that has already been enacted by the Parliament, examining how effectively it has been implemented and assessing whether its aims have in fact been achieved. To date, however, examples of committees undertaking post-legislative scrutiny are fairly thin on the ground. Where committees have carried it out, it has consisted largely of one-off evidence sessions and correspondence with ministers; there are few instances of committees undertaking it in depth.</p><p>However, where problems are highlighted to committees and questions emerge over the effectiveness of legislation that is in force, it makes sense to investigate them through post-legislative scrutiny of the act in question. To put today's debate in context, I point out that the decision to scrutinise the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 was taken after the Equal Opportunities Committee identified as a key issue in its inquiry into female offenders in the criminal justice system the prevalence of mental health disorders in offenders. That inquiry revealed some startling statistics, including the fact that at least 1 to 2 per cent of the 80 per cent of women in Cornton Vale who have mental health problems ought to have been hospitalised instead of being sent to prison, and that a further 8 to 10 per cent would, in recognition of the fact that their mental <place-holder colnum=\"31832\"/> health problem was more prominent than their offending, be satisfactorily dealt with in the community, highly supported by the national health service and other agencies.</p><p>Although prison staff do their best to cope with prisoners with mental health problems, they are neither qualified nor sufficiently resourced to address the issues. To be blunt, I believe that if some women&#8212;and inevitably some male offenders&#8212;are being incarcerated when they should be hospitalised, we are witnessing in 21st century Scotland scenarios that are more in keeping with Dickensian Britain.</p><p>As a result, the committee decided that scrutiny of the 2003 act would help to establish how that appalling state of affairs&#8212;which itself raises legitimate equalities issues&#8212;had come to pass. For the avoidance of doubt, I make it clear that this post-legislative scrutiny was not a comprehensive review of the whole act but a focused study of the equalities principles and duties in the legislation.</p><p>The act's provisions were intended to enshrine a set of 10 principles proposed by the Millan committee, including three equality-related provisions of non-discrimination, equality and respect for diversity. Significantly, a duty to encourage and observe equal opportunity requirements when discharging the act's functions applies to public bodies, such as the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, local authorities and health boards, as well as to Scottish ministers and to individuals who deliver front-line services, including mental health officers, medical practitioners and nurses.</p><p>The committee heard that, despite the statement in section 259 of the 2003 act that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every person with a mental disorder shall have a right of access to independent advocacy\",</p><p>advocacy provision was poor for specific groups and was in effect non-existent for prisoners with mental health issues. It is worth pointing out, however, that members felt that bringing forward the transfer of responsibilities for prisoners' health care to NHS health boards would help to address the lack of advocacy for those offenders. We would welcome further details from the minister about the timetable for that transfer and the steps that the Scottish Government is taking to ensure that it is achieved by its deadline of autumn 2011. The committee has stated that, overall, the Scottish Government must develop approaches to tackle the difficulties that groups are facing in accessing their entitlement to advocacy services. Quite simply, advocacy provision should be available to all groups, not just to those who present as crisis cases.</p><p>Sections 25 to 31 of the 2003 act cover a number of provisions related to the duty on <place-holder colnum=\"31833\"/> Scotland's local authorities to provide care and support for and to promote the wellbeing of people with mental health problems. Those sections are vital, but there was evidence from some witnesses, including the Scottish Association for Mental Health, that their implementation has been patchy across the country and that, worryingly, cuts are being made to lower-level and preventive services that promote wellbeing, social development and employability. That led to questions being raised in evidence about the monitoring of services that are provided under those sections. Consequently, the committee seeks clarification from the minister on how those sections are being monitored, especially as the committee understands that some changes are being made to the Mental Welfare Commission's functions under the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010.</p><p>The committee considered other issues, including children and young people, and the need to ensure that they are placed in accommodation that is appropriate to their mental health needs as opposed to being admitted to adult wards.</p><p>In conclusion, the Mental Welfare Commission collects qualitative and quantitative monitoring data on people who are subject to the 2003 act. One of the main issues to emerge from our post-legislative scrutiny was the existence of gaps in those monitoring data, particularly in ethnicity statistics. It is disappointing that the on-going problem of baseline equalities data was perceived to be a problem in scrutinising the act.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Equal Opportunities Committee's 4th Report 2010 (Session 3): <em>Report on post-legislative scrutiny: the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003</em> (SP Paper 468).</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21156574", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Time for Reflection: \"Report on post-legislative scrutiny: the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open the debate on behalf of the Equal Opportunities Committee and to put on record at the outset my thanks to all those who provided written submissions and gave oral evidence to the committee at the round-table evidence sessions on post-legislative scrutiny of the equalities principles and duties in the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.

The list now includes a supporter, an advocate, a legal representative and possibly also a safeguarder. Also included in that not inconsiderable list is each \"relevant person\", who can, in turn, be accompanied by their own supporter. With that expanding list of potential attendees, there is a real and justified concern that the child's voice could be diminished&#8212;ironically&#8212;by those who have been granted legislative power to come to their aid.</p><p>The process is now to be increasingly legislative and complex. Consequently, it is shifting away from the child-centred approach that has, over the 41 years of its existence, been one of the strongest features of Scotland's unique children's hearings system. It seems that the need to maintain that child-centred approach as paramount has been overtaken by the primary consideration of ensuring that the bill's provisions anticipate every potential ECHR challenge. That can only be a retrograde step.</p><p>The children's hearings system has always functioned at a local level, and that is one of its strengths. It follows that a balance must be found between the new position of the national convener, area support teams, local authorities and panel members, to ensure that the system does not become overly centralised. Elizabeth Smith's amendments have gone some way towards addressing that issue.</p><p>Worryingly, however, there remains a distinct absence of clarity about how the component parts of the system will interact with one another and work together. It is essential to strike an appropriate balance between the influence of the national convener and the role of local authorities on area support teams. How area support teams will interact with local authorities has been and remains an issue. At a time when local authorities must think carefully about their budgets, when <place-holder colnum=\"30972\"/> resources are scarce and criminal justice social workers continue to be underfunded and stressed, there is a question mark over how they will support and complement area support teams. Neither is it apparent how the teams will fit into the current local authority structures. All of those questions remain unanswered.</p><p>I hope that the role of the national convener will help to address the issue of the variation in the support and training that is given to panel members, which was identified as a weakness in the current system.</p><p>As I said in the stage 1 debate in June, children's panel members play a vital role in the system. Those volunteers give willingly of their time in an effort to provide support, assistance and guidance to children from their local communities. They deserve recognition and our gratitude for the work that they undertake.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21104274", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill has had a difficult passage through the Parliament.

By way of confirming that that is the case, I ask the cabinet secretary to respond to concerns that have been highlighted by Des McNulty, Margaret Smith and other members and, more important, expressed by teachers at the chalkface&#8212;or, as Robin Harper called it, the white board.</p><p>There is a general feeling that implementation has been a case of too much, too soon and that it would have been better to phase in curriculum for excellence gradually. Problems arise when primary pupils move from one system&#8212;the five-to-14 curriculum&#8212;to the other. How, for example, does level C fit into the new curriculum assessment? Moreover, the experiences and outcomes are considered to be too vague; indeed, as my colleague Liz Smith and the RSE have pointed out, it is almost impossible to work with such very vague assessment criteria.</p><p>Secondary schools are unsure about when the national qualifications will be changed and that is unsettling for parents, pupils and teachers. Although the national assessment resource is intended to address assessment issues, the bank of material is not yet large enough to allow that work to be carried out. The fact that secondary teachers do not know what will replace standard grades makes it very difficult for them to teach to an outcome. Although the skills-based approach is welcome, worries have been expressed&#8212;by, among others, the universities&#8212;that children will become too skills orientated without having the necessary balance of knowledge and content.</p><p>Those very real concerns and anxieties of members of the teaching profession are coupled with the reservation expressed by the EIS, other professionals and members in the chamber that, if the implementation is to be the success that the motion refers to and that we all want it to be, there must be a guarantee that the necessary funding and resources will be in place. At a time when local authorities are under funding pressure, it is far from certain that those resources will be forthcoming.</p><p>It is probably fair to say that any change, whether it be in the national health service or in education, will attract criticism. Nevertheless, if Scotland is to regain the reputation that it once enjoyed for high standards of education that are recognised throughout the world and which have resulted in Scots being at the forefront of major global companies and industries, we must continue to re-evaluate teaching methods and curriculum content. That has certainly happened <place-holder colnum=\"30340\"/> with curriculum for excellence, which, as the cabinet secretary pointed out, was formulated as a response to the need for change highlighted in the national debate on education.</p><p>The principles and ethos behind the curriculum for excellence are good and it has huge potential to deliver the knowledge and the skills that children in Scotland will need as they grow up and enter the world of work. However, I must sound a note of caution. Parents, children and future employers must continue to be given more information about the curriculum and teachers must be given more time and information to be able to implement it successfully.</p><p>In that regard, the General Teaching Council for Scotland's advice should be taken on board. It has said that if teachers are to work with their colleagues on common course elements or discipline areas there must be time for CPD, the joint development of teaching materials and discussion of teaching principles and practice, as well as joint teaching, assessment and evaluation. It is significant that, where teachers have been coerced into teaching outside their subject area without appropriate support, the course delivery has lacked quality, which has had a negative effect on learning.</p><p>The GTCS also stresses that although there is still a commitment to a broad general education to the end of fourth year, there is nothing paradoxical in also having a commitment to progression. Such a move will make subjects more challenging and increase their depth for pupils approaching the senior phase, but that kind of subject teaching can come from only appropriately qualified and registered subject teachers.

The report explores the experience of children and young people who have a family member sent to prison. In doing so, the report also serves to raise awareness about a serious issue.</p><p>Of course, the impact of having a parent in prison is different on each child, depending on the child's age and stage of development and on whether the child lived with the parent prior to the imprisonment, but the report tells us that the experience is akin to bereavement. In effect, the children of offenders are grieving.</p><p>Furthermore, a child with a parent in prison is at risk of developing a post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly if the child lived with the parent prior to imprisonment. That should come as no great surprise, given that the imprisonment of a parent can affect a child's housing, care arrangements <place-holder colnum=\"28029\"/> and schooling and can lead to victimisation, substance abuse and an increased risk of future offending by the child. In the time available to me, I want to develop that aspect, which is highlighted in the motion and in the report. The recent EOC report \"Female offenders in the criminal justice system\", to which Elaine Smith referred, revealed the alarming statistic that around half the children of female prisoners will also end up in prison. It is important to ensure, as the motion highlights, that those children's rights are not overlooked or dismissed.</p><p>Innocent children must not become the unintended victims of crime merely because they have a parent or parents in prison. That point is picked up by the SCCYP's report and the EOC's inquiry report, both of which comment on the visiting arrangements for children and young people who have a parent in prison. From the evidence that the Equal Opportunities Committee heard, it is clear that drug taking by prisoners has a wider relevance because it can impact on the offender's family. For example, women who take drugs in Cornton Vale may be punished by not being allowed to see their children on future visits. Clearly, that is unacceptable. The rights of the child must be paramount. Given that both reports clearly favour the proposal that such visits should be conducted in as child-friendly a way as possible, l commend the example of Hydebank Wood prison, which has put in place a facility that provides the best possible visiting arrangements for the child.</p><p>Finally, I want to mention the work of the charity Circle, which has identified the need for more structured throughcare for female offenders. After negotiation with Cornton Vale prison, in August 2008 Circle began to deliver a throughcare service for women who are released from prison in Edinburgh, West Lothian, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire. Although it is early days, the charity is providing intensive support to those women, and their families, upon their release from Cornton Vale. That is encouraging.</p><p>I have much pleasure in supporting the motion's call for cross-party support as the best way of ensuring that the rights of offenders' children, who are often the innocent and forgotten victims of crime, are respected by the legal system.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20874988", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Decision Time: \"Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I too congratulate Aileen Campbell on securing this important debate in the Parliament this evening.

It is a registered charity that aims to fill a gap in the provision of services for victims of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse. I am delighted that some SAVI members are in the public gallery to hear the debate this evening.</p><p>I first met SAVI volunteers in March this year when I attended the East Kilbride crime prevention panel award ceremony, at which they were nominated for the <em>East Kilbride News</em> rose bowl. That is an award given to a group or individual who has benefited the community through their work for a charity or other good cause. Thereafter, I arranged to visit the volunteers in their new base in East Kilbride to find out more about the work that their charity does.</p><p>From that meeting, I learned that SAVI helps victims by providing a 24-hour helpline&#8212;this means that volunteers are there to help victims at any hour of the day or night&#8212;and by offering one-to-one support to victims and, crucially, their families. It is often forgotten that it is not just the victim who is affected by their experience of sexual abuse and that this horrendous crime has a huge impact on the rest of the family, too.<place-holder colnum=\"27366\"/></p><p>SAVI acts as an information point on any legal, medical and psychological issue that may arise for the young victims and their families, and it offers access to relaxation and coping techniques and other appropriate therapies for recovery. Furthermore, the charity has identified key issues that it seeks to address. For instance, it is a sobering thought that a child in this country is more likely to be sexually assaulted than to break a leg. However, the child who suffers a broken leg can go straight to accident and emergency and get all the help and treatment required, while the child who is sexually assaulted has only a 25 per cent chance of accessing an appropriate service. Clearly, the service delivery for children and young people is inadequate.</p><p>There is also a basic requirement to establish best practice for service delivery. Without that, there is the danger that the recovery process will be unnecessarily prolonged. Despite the efforts of the Crown Office to reduce the time between the reporting of an incident and the trial, the legal process is still too long. That is where the SAVI volunteers come in: they are trained and well placed to help victims and families, starting from the initial report through to the trial process and beyond, and they work in a way that will not contaminate any testimonial or evidence relevant to a forthcoming trial.</p><p>In addition, SAVI provides information about other relevant support that may be required. The charity receives no funding from the Government; it relies solely on donations as well as on the eight volunteers who raise funds to pay for its 24-hour helpline and the costs of running the organisation, and who raise awareness of the charity.</p><p>SAVI's there for them campaign encourages volunteers and members of the local community to get involved in fundraising projects from coffee mornings to sponsored events. As the motion states, the efforts of one of SAVI's volunteers, Dougie, are to be commended and deserve a mention. Three times a week, come rain or shine, Dougie runs through East Kilbride with the there for them flag. By the end of the year, he will have run a staggering 1,287 miles for the charity.</p><p>In general, awareness of the needs of victims of abuse and their families must be improved. Specifically, awareness of the impact of abuse needs to be addressed&#8212;especially the impact on a child's education, which is all too often snatched away by their experiences, causing major issues for victims in both the short term and the long term.</p><p>Sadly, despite supposedly greater awareness all round, most people are still in the dark about how best to react when a child discloses abuse. Few organisations train their members in the facts and even fewer train them in how to react appropriately <place-holder colnum=\"27367\"/> to a child either at disclosure or afterwards. That is why, since the establishment of SAVI, the charity has been contacted by a number of social workers from throughout Scotland, most of whom have wanted information about the services in their area or to ask a few basic questions about what a victim of rape, sexual assault or abuse might need.</p><p>Given all that, there can be no doubt about the invaluable nature of the work and service that SAVI and its volunteers provide for victims and their families. I wish them well for the future and hope that tonight's debate will help them to continue to perform their vital work. I very much look forward to the minister's response.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20850644", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Assault Victims Initiative East Kilbride"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "SAVI&#8212;the Sexual Assault Victims Initiative&#8212;was founded by Annmarie Campbell, a forensic psychologist and registered hypnotherapist who specialises in work with children and young people.

Those men and women are all volunteers who have given willingly of their time in an effort to provide support, assistance and guidance to the children from their local communities who have been referred to the panel hearings. They deserve recognition and our gratitude for the work that they have undertaken. There is a danger that, as we debate the general principles and the detail of the bill to reform the system, it will appear to the casual observer that panel members bear the brunt of the criticism that has emerged over the <place-holder colnum=\"27349\"/> years about the system's failings and shortcomings.</p><p>The bill creates a new non-departmental public body called children's hearings Scotland, which will replace the 32 local authority panels and will be headed by a national convener. One major concern is that although, at present, all panel members are required to be from the relevant local authority area, the bill introduces flexibility into that by requiring only that a children's hearing</p><p class=\"indent\">\"so far as practicable, consists only of members of the Children's Panel who live or work in the area\".</p><p>In an effort to address one of the flaws identified in the system by requiring uniformity in the support and training of panel members, localism is replaced by centralisation and, in the process, the vital connection to the community that was stressed as so important in the Kilbrandon report is lost. That point was well illustrated by both Margaret Smith and David Whitton.</p><p>As Barnardo's Scotland and other contributors to the debate have highlighted, there is a lack of detail in the bill about how the new unitary body and its convener will liaise, co-operate and work with voluntary organisations, other agencies and, crucially, local authorities and their social work departments.</p><p>Although the focus of the debate is the proposed legislation to improve the system, a vital issue that needs to be addressed is the strain and pressure under which criminal justice social workers currently operate, due to their vast and increasing workloads.</p><p>When I visited a panel hearing, I saw for myself that, perhaps because they are covering for a colleague or perhaps because of their volume of work, social workers often arrive at hearings having only just had the opportunity to take a cursory look at the child's case notes for the first time. That is a problem that legislation will not solve but which directly affects the way in which the system operates and results in a situation that is totally unsatisfactory for all concerned but primarily for the child whose case is being discussed. I would very much welcome the minister's comments on that point.</p><p>As my colleague Liz Smith pointed out, there is a lack of detail and clarity about key provisions in the bill. She made that point effectively with reference to some of the terminology and the role of the national convener.</p><p>In addition, the Law Society of Scotland's family law sub-group has recommended that the role of safeguarders be clarified in order to provide details about training, standards and complaints. It is simply unacceptable to leave such crucial detail to secondary legislation.<place-holder colnum=\"27350\"/></p><p>Under the current system, concerns have been expressed about inconsistencies in implementing national guidelines to assess the risk factor.

That is an entirely laudable objective, which is why the ESA focuses on the patient's abilities: that is, on what they can do, rather than on what they cannot. However, now that the allowance has been in force for approximately 18 months, it is apparent, as the Citizens Advice Scotland report makes abundantly clear, that there are huge problems and failings, which the new coalition Government is now endeavouring to rectify, starting with a reassessment of all current claimants of the ESA, as well as of those who are currently claiming incapacity benefit and who will transfer across to ESA soon. The reassessment is intended to ensure that claimants who are genuinely in need can access support without encountering problems.</p><p>The CAS report has identified three main problem areas with the ESA system: the administration of ESA, the work-capability assessment and the experiences of claimants after the work-capability assessment is complete. In the time that is available to me, I will focus on the administration of ESA and the application process. The CAS report reveals that claimants have received inaccurate advice from some Jobcentre Plus staff and that that has resulted in the wrong benefit being claimed. The claim is then rejected, which adds to the problems that are experienced by the claimant and puts them in an even more vulnerable position financially. Difficulties have also been experienced with filling in the application forms and, worse still, documents have been lost by the DWP, which has caused further anxiety for claimants and has delayed their payments.</p><p>On top of all that, the processing of the claims has not been efficient, which has led to further claims having to be made from the social fund, or to claimants having to look to relatives or friends for financial support.</p><p>Furthermore, as a BBC freedom of information request revealed, under the Labour Government 8,000 ESA appeals were being heard every <place-holder colnum=\"26789\"/> month. To put that figure in context, it is double the number of appeals that are made in relation to disability living allowance, which is the second most appealed benefit and which has seven times more claimants than ESA. By any standards, it is a bureaucratic nightmare that is taking up valuable resources and adding to stress for all the vulnerable people who are affected.</p><p>All of that has prompted a statement from the DWP&#8212;barely two weeks into the new coalition Government's tenure&#8212;recognising that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"People need much more support to manage their conditions and get help to find work and moving them to ESA is the best way to do that.\"</p><p>In addition, the Queen's speech confirmed that the coalition Government will introduce a welfare reform bill, the purpose of which will be to remove the confusing complexity of the benefits system, which too often leaves people afraid to make changes to their circumstances and can be a barrier to moving from benefits to work. Its purpose will also be to make people see gain when they enter work, through simplifying the benefits system; to reduce the scope for fraud and error by making the benefits system simpler; and to reduce unnecessary administration of benefits.</p><p>In conclusion, now that Iain Duncan Smith is the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, vulnerable people can be assured that he will work tirelessly to sort out the problems that he has inherited that are associated with ESA, in an effort to improve the quality of life for the worst-off people in society, starting with a root-and-branch change to the welfare system, which will get tough with those who, by seeking to abuse the benefits system, put vital support for vulnerable people at risk.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20811812", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employment and Support Allowance"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Hugh O'Donnell on bringing this important debate to the chamber.

Ensuring that patients have access to such services within that timeframe not only makes a huge difference to their lives but prevents the condition developing into a more serious problem that ultimately claims more extensive NHS resources. For example, according to one of my constituents who suffers from lymphoedema, if she is stung or her skin is cut, there is a 90 per cent chance that it will result in septicaemia.</p><p>That same constituent's experience provides a clear insight into how lymphoedema sufferers in Lanarkshire are being badly let down by the NHS.

Thereafter, the earliest appointment for the multilayer bandaging that she required was some eight months later in November 2008. Even then, the treatment that she required was not available at the Lanarkshire clinic, so a referral letter had to be sent to the Haven centre for manual lymphatic drainage to be carried out by a therapist, which I believe was done at the patient's own cost.</p><p>Unfortunately, when bandaging commenced, the swelling volume had increased to 30 per cent, and therefore two weeks of daily bandaging had to be undertaken to reduce her swelling to 23 per cent. By 15 May 2009, her limb swelling volume had reduced to 17.8 per cent, but she was told that she did not come into the category to access services at the Glasgow lymphoedema clinic, with which NHS Lanarkshire has a contract. The upshot was that although the swelling had reduced to 17.8 per cent by May 2009, her next appointment was in January 2010&#8212;almost eight months later.</p><p>In response to my taking up the issue, NHS Lanarkshire told me that there would be an audit <place-holder colnum=\"26370\"/> of services and that I would be kept fully informed.

I had a tour of the new building and heard at first hand about the ethos of the college and the courses that are on offer.</p><p>The Aurora house provides a practical example of that ethos in action.

The Aurora house achieves the highest possible energy performance rating: it has an A rating, in comparison with the D rating that is given to older houses and the C rating that newer homes achieve. Potential savings could be as high as &#163;1,800 per year, which makes the design ideal for the social housing market and helps to address fuel poverty.</p><p>Furthermore, as Linda Fabiani said, the fact that the four-bedroom Aurora is scalable means that it can be adapted for smaller and larger properties and for different house styles. That, coupled with its zero carbon status, which puts it far in advance of the 2013 to 2016 target under which all new houses will require to be net zero carbon, makes the Aurora highly marketable.</p><p>Students at South Lanarkshire College are being given the opportunity to learn about the innovative techniques and technologies through the medium of a unique training experience, whereby they are able to see the Aurora's insulation materials and construction approaches, which are made visible through cutaway sections.

The Equal Opportunities Committee's starting point was not to go over well-rehearsed and stale arguments, but to consider the experience of women in prison and whether prison provides effective treatment and rehabilitation programmes to female offenders, including women with mental health problems. Part of the committee's remit was to look at the backgrounds of female offenders, the services that are available to them in prison, the support that they are provided with when they are released and the role that that plays in preventing them from reoffending.</p><p>At a time when the committee system and committees are under the microscope and sometimes attract criticism for being partisan in the decision-making process, I thank past and present members of the committee for concentrating exclusively on the compelling issues that emerged during the inquiry. My thanks, too, go to the committee's clerks, who have done a superb job in putting the report together. The committee is further indebted to all those who provided written and oral evidence for its inquiry, especially the people who facilitated our visits to Cornton Vale prison, to the 218 centre in Glasgow and to Hydebank Wood prison in Belfast.</p><p>Rather than looking in detail at complex legal matters, the committee's inquiry focused on equal opportunities issues and areas in which the committee considered that practical improvements could be made. For the avoidance of doubt, I say that although the inquiry focused on female offenders, that does not mean that the committee considered that female offenders should be treated more favourably or that it was not interested in male offenders.</p><p>A number of witnesses confirmed that female offenders in Cornton Vale tend to have specific problems, such as chaotic lifestyles, significant mental health problems and alcohol and drug addictions. Many are also victims of physical or sexual abuse, have suffered mental cruelty in childhood or have been involved in prostitution. It <place-holder colnum=\"23821\"/> was pointed out that because women are much more likely to have responsibility for the care of their children and are more likely to hold the tenancy of their homes, imprisonment may have a greater impact on them than it does on men. Those complex issues, coupled with the increase in the number of women in Scotland who come into contact with the criminal justice system, meant that the committee's inquiry was timely.</p><p>The committee noted that the Scottish Government is committed to reducing the number of custodial sentences of six months or less, but it considers that more could and should be done to rehabilitate women who are currently in prison, particularly those who are serving short-term sentences and those who are on remand. The fact that that is not happening was confirmed to the committee by a former prisoner, who was told that she was not allowed to take part in education classes in Cornton Vale because she was not in prison for long enough&#8212;her sentence was seven months. The committee is firmly of the view that more support needs to be offered to short-term offenders, not just in prison, but when they leave it, as support is currently offered only on a voluntary basis.</p><p>A key area of consideration in the committee's inquiry was prisoners with mental health problems. One of the more serious criticisms made during evidence to the committee was that some women should not have been in prison because their mental illnesses were so severe. The director of health and care at the Scottish Prison Service, Dr Andrew Fraser, told the committee that, of the 80 per cent of women in Cornton Vale who may have mental health problems, 1 to 2 per cent should be in hospital rather than in prison. I hope that, in his response, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice will consider the worrying fact that there might not be sufficient alternative capacity outwith Cornton Vale to support those women.</p><p>In evidence, Dr Andrew McLellan&#8212;a former chief inspector of prisons&#8212;referred to a previous report of his that said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"twice as many female prisoners as male prisoners pro rata suffer severe and enduring illness\".</p><p>Despite that, the chief executive of the SPS has said that Cornton Vale's interventions</p><p class=\"indent\">\"do not deal radically with people's underlying problems.\"</p><p>Furthermore, there needs to be a re-examination of the information that is available to courts when women with mental health problems are sentenced. Criminal justice social work departments are often understaffed and under pressure, and there is real concern that they are not properly equipped to carry out that function. Courts too often rely on the defence lawyer to <place-holder colnum=\"23822\"/> provide that information. That is clearly totally unsatisfactory.</p><p>Families Outside identified a gap in provision in respect of the courts not having community-based options to which to refer women, pending the preparation of medical reports. In turn, that leads to women being remanded in custody, often for their safety. That issue's being addressed could help to minimise the number of such women who are imprisoned, and could result in the availability of more resources for rehabilitation in prison. Consequently, the committee considers that improvements must be made to the support that is provided to female offenders with mental health problems, both in prison and in the community.</p><p>The committee is concerned about the prevalence of illegal substances in Cornton Vale. The Scottish Prison Service may aim for women to be free of drugs, or for drug use to be stabilised in prison, but it is evident that, to date, that has been no more than an aspiration. Surveys of prisoners in Cornton Vale reveal that 38 per cent have substances in their system on leaving prison. The committee recognised the complex challenge of eradicating drug taking, but pointed out that institutions that are comparable to Cornton Vale have significantly reduced drug use using non-intrusive methods, and considered that the SPS should learn from that best practice.</p><p>The committee also learned that drug taking in prison has wider consequences. Women who take drugs in Cornton Vale are punished by not being allowed to see their children on visits. The committee considers that the rights and interests of the child are paramount and that children should not be denied visiting rights, other than when a visit may place them at risk.</p><p>During its visit to Hydebank Wood prison in Belfast, the committee was impressed by a recently installed facility that allows children to visit their mothers in a more natural setting. The committee is concerned about the poor quality of the existing facilities for visiting at Cornton Vale, and seeks to establish what specific action will be taken to upgrade them.</p><p>The committee was also alarmed to learn that about half the children of female prisoners end up in prison. Efforts need to be concentrated on preventing the passing on of offending behaviour from one generation of a family to the next. The Government should consider carefully the merit of implementing family addiction programmes for female offenders, and how better support can be provided to the children of female offenders.</p><p>The inquiry identified a gap in provision of speech and language therapy at Cornton Vale. Statistics from the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists show that 44 per cent of <place-holder colnum=\"23823\"/> women in the criminal justice system have communication difficulties. Good communication is vital; therefore, the committee believes that a pilot speech and language therapy programme needs to be made available at Cornton Vale.</p><p>During the inquiry, some women were transferred to Greenock prison, and the committee learned that the proposed new Grampian prison will hold female prisoners. The committee is aware of legal challenges on equal opportunities grounds in other jurisdictions after women had initially been centralised in one prison but were then dispersed and it was no longer possible to provide specialist support. The committee seeks an assurance from the Scottish Government that that issue is being addressed in finalising the plans for the Grampian prison. An equality impact assessment should always be undertaken by the Government when decisions about prison build are being made, in order to ensure that the provision of women's services in Grampian and elsewhere are never merely an add-on to male provision.</p><p>Despite the increase in the female prison population, a woman who offends is far more likely to receive a community penalty than to receive a prison sentence. The committee received a lot of written evidence that was critical of community penalties as having been developed primarily for male offenders and, therefore, not always appropriate for female offenders. That makes it more likely that women offenders will breach penalties and end up in prison by default. The committee notes that the community payback order&#8212;the proposed replacement for existing community penalties&#8212;appears to take account of gender differences between men and women.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20565788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Female Offenders in the Criminal Justice System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The treatment of female offenders in the criminal justice system is a subject that attracts diverse opinions.

That is to be done in tandem with specific partner agencies who will work together to prevent domestic abuse and help the victims.</p><p>In conclusion, it is to be hoped that the new campaign, which was launched in October under the title working together, will make the perpetrators of domestic abuse and violence against women think again.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20429456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Domestic violence against women is unacceptable and a violation of human rights.

Some of these issues, which relate to gender and are intrinsically about fairness, have been tackled by the Parliament's Equal Opportunities Committee. Malcolm Chisholm has already referred to equal pay and, in the past two years, the committee has considered in its budget scrutiny the issue of equal pay in local government and the national health service, which primarily affects female workers. The committee's report highlighted the extremely high cost of resolving the local government equal pay dispute, and members found it gratifying that the Local Government and Communities Committee decided to carry out further work on the issue.</p><p>The committee's recently completed report on women offenders in the criminal justice system highlights some disturbing evidence on, for example, harsher sentencing; the disproportionate effect that prison has on women rather than men with regard to loss of tenancy; and the adverse impact on children when a mother has to serve her sentence in a location not easily accessible for family visits. It is to be hoped that, when the report is debated in the new year, progress can be made to address those issues.</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, 100 years is a comparatively short period of time.

Their attendance is doubly appreciated as I know just how difficult it can be for them to organise a journey such as their journey to the Scottish Parliament today, or indeed for them to embark on any of the journeys that the rest of us manage with comparative ease and rarely think twice about. For deafblind people, there is no such luxury. Instead, every step of a journey on public transport can be fraught with difficulty.</p><p>That point was graphically brought home to me recently when I attended Deafblind Scotland's 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations in Lenzie union church. During my visit, some of the deafblind members performed two five-minute drama skits that effectively illustrated the nature of the difficulties that they face daily in attempting to negotiate travel on public transport. Those difficulties can start, for example, with communication difficulties during an initial taxi journey, and continue when the person goes on to attempt to find their way around a bus or train station or an airport and tries to purchase a ticket, or merely book in.</p><p>I know that some of my MSP colleagues, despite having to juggle voting on stage 3 amendments, managed to go and see the dramas that were being performed this afternoon. I am grateful to them for doing that, and I am grateful to all members who have stayed behind to register their support for Deafblind Scotland's plea for co-operation among all relevant bodies to ensure that deafblind citizens can enjoy full access to public transport.<place-holder colnum=\"21455\"/></p><p>In particular, I hope that the debate will concentrate minds on the barriers to free access to all public transport that deafblind people experience as a consequence of the varying restrictions that local authorities place on concessionary train travel for the guide/communicators who provide such necessary and invaluable assistance through professional communication and guiding support. Put simply, bus travel is free for the deafblind and their guide companions, but free train travel is available only to the deafblind. At best, that seriously curtails their ability to access train travel and at worst, it renders it impossible for some deafblind people to use train travel at all.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that I attended Deafblind Scotland's 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations, as part of which there was an exhibition of video and photographs that charted the tremendous work and activities in which Deafblind Scotland has been involved over the years. Although it was in general immensely encouraging, I have to say that I felt a real sense of despondency when I saw the photos and video coverage of members of Deafblind Scotland attending the other debate that I sponsored in the Scottish Parliament almost five years ago to seek recognition of deafblindness as a distinct disability. At that time, it was emphasised how vital it is to ensure that deafblind people are identified in each local authority area as soon as possible, and before their hearing or sight deteriorates too far, in order to try to preserve the best possible quality of life. In other words, what was sought then was a similar provision to what exists in England and Wales, which has become known there as section 7 guidance.</p><p>Despite my 2005 debate and the warm words that were offered at the time, evidence shows&#8212;I refer to the Scottish Government's statistics in \"Registered Blind and Partially Sighted Persons, Scotland 2008\"&#8212;that there are 2,863 people in Scotland who are registered as having dual sensory loss. However, Deafblind Scotland believes that the total is grossly underestimated and is much more likely to be nearer 5,000. Unfortunately, that leads me to the conclusion that, if it is merely recommended to local authorities, rather than its being required of them, that they identify people with dual sensory problems early, little or no progress will be made.</p><p>Meanwhile, for deafblind people, problems persist with communication and access to information as people strive to live independently with little support and with difficulties that are little known or unnoticed. If deafblind people are to be included in society, we need to ensure that the necessary special arrangements to ensure their inclusion are in place. As the world of sensory impairment moves on apace, the risk is that deafblind people will become further marginalised.<place-holder colnum=\"21456\"/></p><p>Deafblind Scotland has 650 members, of which 160 are under 60 years of age. If, rather than just providing platitudes&#8212;as was the case following a meeting on the same subject involving ScotRail, deafblind representatives and myself several years ago&#8212;we can genuinely aid the co-operation that the motion seeks to achieve by ensuring that today's debate results in deafblind guide/communicators being given access to concessionary fares, we will have taken a small but crucial step towards removing at least one of the barriers that are faced by this very small number of people, who are an inspiration to the rest of us and who deserve our support.</p><p>I look forward to the minister's comments on what assistance he can offer to deafblind people.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20389856", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Deafblind Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by extending a warm welcome to the deafblind people and their supporters who are in the public gallery this evening.

Those firefighters were clearly demoralised about the problems and grievances that they have experienced in recent years. Their passion for the job was evident, but it was equally evident that every member of the team felt disillusioned about decisions and changes that they considered affected their ability to carry out their core firefighting role properly. Those decisions and changes were the result of legislation, initiatives or recommendations, including some from the community fire safety study.</p><p>The firefighters' grievances included not having the proper equipment to do the job. It is not practical or safe for individual firefighters to be asked to share a radio. Torches are provided for tunics but not for helmets, where they are required to ensure that light can be used flexibly. The team complained that it had taken 10 years for the road traffic accident unit to acquire a saw, which is essential for cutting vehicles that are involved in road accidents.<place-holder colnum=\"21208\"/></p><p>The firefighters trial equipment and report their findings but they complained bitterly that their reports are ignored or receive no response. In fact, lack of communication was a general feature. Questionnaires were completed and returned but no feedback or response was received.</p><p>Although a number of the team's members emphasised that they had joined the service to be firefighters, they recognised the need for a prevention role and for them to undertake prevention activities. However, it was clear that the team considered that the current balance between ensuring that firefighters have the necessary equipment, training and skills that they need for operational duties and the preventive work that they undertake was too heavily weighted in favour of the latter. They stressed that team training was essential but said that it is being downgraded in favour of individual personal development training on computer, which quite simply cannot address the job's practical aspects. Furthermore, they considered that rope training once a month was not enough.</p><p>On the prevention side, the firefighters maintained that the households targeted for fire safety work were not the most vulnerable and were not in need of it, and that better co-operation and information sharing is required with agencies that can direct fire safety activity to the most at-risk households.</p><p>The firefighters emphasised that job satisfaction was absolutely zero. For example, the team had arranged to visit a primary school to speak about fire prevention, but they had to go suddenly, leaving the children disappointed, because they were called out to an emergency. A little thought could have ensured that that scenario was avoided and the situation better managed.</p><p>The impact of part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and health and safety regulations means that firefighters often face a moral dilemma: when they are at an emergency situation that might involve the loss of life, do they stand aside and wait for the appropriate equipment or person who is specifically trained to arrive, or do they act? They indicated that they would almost certainly act. However, in doing so, they would leave themselves completely vulnerable, with no insurance cover and possibly facing disciplinary action and loss of pension. Furthermore, in non-life-threatening situations, regulations have resulted in firefighters being targeted for abuse, with some onlookers criticising their lack of activity while they are forced to wait for the appropriately trained person or appropriate equipment to arrive.</p><p>Clearly, a number of issues must be addressed to achieve the objective of reducing the number of fires and fire deaths in Scotland.

However, with a little research, I soon uncovered a couple of interesting facts. Warren MacLeod, the stone's sculptor, was inspired by two things. First, as the motion states, the stone's design and shape were inspired by strangely shaped ancient orbs with intricate carvings that were sculpted by neolithic people in the north-east of Scotland. The second inspiration was Mr MacLeod's desire to do something special for his wife, Kari. In that respect, he decided that the stone should embody her daily acts of kindness for her family.</p><p>The orb, which has now become known as the Sconestone from Scone palace and its associated history, was presented to Kari MacLeod. However, it was not meant to be kept; instead, it was to be passed to its first keeper, the Rev Neil Galbraith. The stone was then to continue its never-ending journey around the world with each new keeper pledging to do an act of kindness before passing it on to a new keeper.</p><p>The stone's spirit and ethos were enthusiastically embraced by the pupils of Hunter primary school in East Kilbride who, on 4 September 2009, created a kindness tree to commemorate the day that the stone came to their school before it began its epic journey and adventure around the world. If the school's innovative and thoughtful response to the Sconestone is replicated as it continues its journey from keeper to keeper, the orb's worldwide progress will indeed make fascinating reading.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20370892", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Sconestone"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Linda Fabiani on securing a debate that is particularly appropriate in world kindness week.

For example, one of the report's key recommendations is that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"all the relevant parties should be brought together to come to an agreement on how to deal with those cases in the system which are considered to be strong and that these discussions should be facilitated by the Scottish Government.\"</p><p>Although that sounds, and is, eminently sensible, it has not yet happened, 10 years after the 1999 agreement on single status.</p><p>Why is that? I believe that the answer lies in the evidence that was collected by the Equal Opportunities Committee when it focused on equal pay in local government during its scrutiny of last year's budget. The committee's subsequent report to the Finance Committee highlighted not only the extent of the equal pay problem, which has been described as the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"greatest destabilising force in the history of local government finance\",</p><p>but the complexities and significant costs that are associated with managing unequal pay. Sadly, it appears to be the case that all the efforts of the key players, including Audit Scotland, COSLA, the local authorities and even the Scottish Government, have gone into managing unequal pay, at a huge cost to the public purse.</p><p>I will explore that issue further by looking at the role of each player in turn, beginning with the local authorities, which, according to the Scottish Trades Union Congress, have spent at least &#163;1.6 million of taxpayers' money on opposing thousands of equal pay cases against them. They have used council tax payers' money to fund substantial legal bills in order to block equal pay claims in the tribunal system. According to an employment lawyer from one firm of solicitors, that has resulted in the excessive costs that are associated with prolonged litigation. The litigation is predicted to continue for at least the next decade, so the legal costs alone for councils will continue to be colossal.</p><p>In those circumstances, surely Audit Scotland, which audits local authorities and public bodies, and the remit of which includes auditing them on whether finances are being managed to the highest possible standards and, crucially, on <place-holder colnum=\"20166\"/> whether they are achieving the best possible value for public money, would have something to say about such blatant squandering of public funds. Not so&#8212;instead, Audit Scotland appears to be interested only in verifying that the figures in the financial statement are correct and in highlighting the fact that it has done a risk assessment by identifying the number of cases and appeals that are likely to succeed in tribunal. After that, it is content to record that as a contingent liability and, having stated the blindingly obvious, it appears to consider that it has fulfilled its scrutiny obligations.</p><p>To date, best value and the practice that some local authorities adopt of prolonging cases and spending vast sums of taxpayers' money on legal advice to do so do not appear to have concerned Scotland's auditor of public bodies in the slightest. Frankly, the complacency evidenced by Audit Scotland's approach is truly breathtaking.</p><p>Meanwhile, at a time of council tax freezes and tight local government settlements, rather than actively encourage mediation, COSLA, the representative voice of Scottish local government which acts as the employers association on behalf of all the Scottish councils, has made no attempt to intervene. Instead, it has preferred to sit back and watch council tax payers' money be diverted from front-line services to fund legal challenges to legitimate claims.</p><p>I turn to the final key player: the Scottish Government. As the Equality and Human Rights Commission pointed out,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scottish ministers are obliged to report on progress and to propose action to address any gaps. The pay gap is ... of great concern in relation to the implementation of the equality duty, so it is of direct relevance to the Government in looking at overall progress towards equality.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Equal Opportunities Committee</em>, 30 September 2008; c 606.]</p><p>In his reply, which would do Pontius Pilate credit, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth told the Equal Opportunities Committee that, despite the fact that costs could escalate if the equal pay issues were not resolved immediately, he rejected any suggestion that the Scottish Government should enter into negotiations with the relevant agencies to reach a permanent solution. He stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It would be completely inappropriate ... to 'take responsibility for' this issue ... because it is within the exclusive competence of individual local authorities as self-governing organisations.\"</p><p>Nor is the cabinet secretary inclined to use any of the special powers that he has</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to intervene in certain circumstances in which local authority finances are not being operated effectively.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Equal Opportunities Committee</em>, 7 October 2008; c 647, 645.]<place-holder colnum=\"20167\"/></p><p>The approach that has been adopted by each of the key players to the vexing issue of local government equal pay is profoundly depressing. There are significant issues of fairness operating on a number of levels, from the claims of individuals&#8212;who are predominantly, but not exclusively, women&#8212;that could and should have been settled to the diversion of precious council tax money from essential front-line services. There is therefore a desperate need to ensure that the budget, local government pay and the continuing implementation of single status agreements are, to use the jargon, equality proofed. It is to be hoped that mechanisms are put in place to address the issue and the costs that it has for the public purse, which, by extension, adversely impact on the wider Scottish economy.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200694", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Official Report 1 October 2009: \"Equal Pay in Local Government\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It seems that, like death and taxes, the issue of equal pay is always with us, so the recommendations in the Local Government and Communities Committee's report on equal pay in local government, which represent an attempt to rectify the present state of affairs, are most certainly to be welcomed.

It is therefore not surprising that the closure announcement came as a hammer blow to the workers, support businesses and the community as a whole.</p><p>The empathy that is felt in the town and beyond for those who are affected by the announcement was graphically illustrated by the public rally on 26 July, which I was pleased to join, and in which 20,000 people took to the streets in an effort to raise awareness of the issue and to keep Johnnie Walker in Kilmarnock. After the rally, everyone collectively held their breath and hoped against hope that the task force's alternative proposal, which the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth put to the company, would include a new aspect that Diageo had not covered and which might result in a reversal of the decision. Sadly, that was not the case and the closure decision was confirmed. The news has been received almost with a sense of inevitability and quiet resignation by the workforce, which recognises that although historic links are important, so are hard economic facts.</p><p>Diageo has set out the facts clearly. First, the restructuring proposal that involves the closure of both the Kilmarnock and Port Dundas sites is being implemented to secure the long-term sustainability of the company and to underpin the success of its operation in Scotland and the jobs of 4,000 Diageo workers here. Secondly, the company has 38 packaging lines and needs only 28, which can be manned on two sites. Thirdly, the alternative proposal of the task force and the Scottish Government merely embedded the inefficiencies in packaging.</p><p>Significantly, during discussions that I had with at least one rival drinks company, it was confirmed that the Diageo bottling and packaging costs, and therefore that aspect of its operation in Scotland, are not competitive. As a result, Diageo made it crystal clear that it could remain in Scotland with a successful operation only if it had a cost-effective manufacturing base, through the proposal to create new jobs at the Leven plant and to close Kilmarnock and Port Dundas.</p><p>It is worth taking stock at this point. Clearly, shock at the announcement of the closures and disappointment at the realisation that the Kilmarnock and Port Dundas jobs could not be saved have triggered some raw emotion. That is entirely understandable in the circumstances, but some of the language and comments from politicians and others about Diageo have been <place-holder colnum=\"19698\"/> intemperate, ill advised and, ultimately, counterproductive. There has been much talk and not a little political muscle flexing, with various parties&#8212;including, I am sorry to say, the First Minister&#8212;stating that Diageo would not be allowed to walk away from Kilmarnock. In fairness to the company, I understand that it was acutely aware before its decision was taken of the horrific impact that its decision would have on the local economy. For that reason, its focus was on doing everything in its power to support efforts to mitigate the economic impact of the losses.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Diageo"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In 1820, using the proceeds of the sale of his family farm, Johnnie Walker&#8212;recently orphaned and aged 14&#8212;sets up a shop dealing in groceries, wines and spirits in Sandbed Street near Kilmarnock Cross.

Despite that, in Scotland today not only are incidents of indiscipline on the increase, they are becoming more serious and violent in nature. Ronnie Smith of the EIS summed up well the full extent of the problem when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Ask any teacher across Scotland about the most challenging part of their job, and you will receive near unanimity on the answer&#8212;the daily grind of maintaining effective discipline in the classroom.\"</p><p>Let us be absolutely clear: it is unacceptable that persistently disruptive pupils are allowed to remain in mainstream classes causing havoc for the well-behaved majority, hindering their ability to learn and making teachers' lives a misery. What is the solution? There is no quick fix, but there is a need to send out a distinct and unambiguous message that persistent and serious incidents of disruptive behaviour, which worryingly increasingly involve a weapon, will simply not be tolerated in Scotland's schools.</p><p>That message must be backed by decisive action. In the first instance, it is crucial that the data identifying the number and type of exclusions are published. How on earth can the Scottish Government hope to begin to tackle the issue if it has no idea of the precise nature and extent of the problem?</p><p>At a time when the lack of parenting and parental co-operation with schools is sadly all too <place-holder colnum=\"17160\"/> evident, it has to be acknowledged that part of the problem&#8212;and therefore the solution&#8212;lies with a minority of parents themselves. Many of those parents had a bad experience of school as pupils and now find themselves with a little bit of power that they are determined to use to undermine teachers and the discipline that schools impose. More work has to be done to address that problem and promote positive parenting.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that with the increase in single parent families the presence of community police in secondary school campuses is having a number of positive effects that I can see in the area that I represent in Lanarkshire. Community police provide a male role model, which more often than not is absent from the families of many disruptive pupils; they help to establish a relationship with pupils to deter bad behaviour in and out of school; and they detect community crime early, as evidenced in Coatbridge, where an outbreak of graffiti was quickly recognised by the campus police officer as being the handiwork of a pupil, as identified from artwork and the doodlings on his jotters.</p><p>In the time available it is not possible for me to go into more detail about the necessity to remove persistently disruptive pupils from the school environment. As my colleague Liz Smith pointed out, the setting up of second chance units is certainly worth exploring.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary will take that on board. If we achieve nothing else from this debate, I sincerely hope that the Scottish Government will ditch its preoccupation with reducing class sizes, which in itself will do absolutely nothing to tackle the disruptive behaviour in Scottish schools that is depriving far too many children of the opportunity to reach their full potential. The situation cannot be allowed to continue.

This evening's topic for discussion is a good-news story that provides us with the opportunity to recognise the superb work that volunteers who are members of Project Linus are doing throughout Scotland. Project Linus is a not-for-profit organisation that aims to provide a sense of security and comfort to children and others who are seriously ill, traumatised or otherwise in need through the gift of soft, comforting and attractive handmade quilts and blankets.</p><p>The idea originated in America following the publication of a magazine article on Christmas eve 1995 that featured a small child who was undergoing chemotherapy and who said that her security blanket helped her through her treatments. The article inspired Karen Loucks to make homemade security blankets and provide them to Denver's Rocky Mountain children's cancer centre, and Project Linus was born. The project was named after Charlie Brown's best friend in \"Peanuts\", the security-blanket carrying Linus van Pelt.</p><p>Project Linus was established in the UK in 2000. All the quilts that are donated to the project remain <place-holder colnum=\"16649\"/> in Britain and are, as far as possible, distributed in the area in which they are donated.</p><p>The quilts are made in various sizes to cater for all ages, from neo-natal babies to young children and teenagers up to the age of 18. The Project Linus label is sewn into every blanket and quilt before project co-ordinators deliver them to staff in various organisations and hospitals to distribute to the children for them to keep.</p><p>Since the project's establishment in March 2004, in excess of a staggering total of 100,000 quilts have been distributed in the United Kingdom. Sixteen co-ordinators cover Scotland, from Shetland to the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway. Last year, the Scottish group delivered more than 4,000 quilts&#8212;a quarter of the UK total.</p><p>Since its establishment in 2004, the Lanarkshire group has delivered more than 2,500 quilts to organisations such as Wishaw hospital, Motherwell Women's Aid and the Haven, a children's bereavement group. Quilts are also provided to hospices and neurological wards. In addition, children and young people with, for example, cerebral palsy or leukaemia or who are undergoing chemotherapy treatment can make a request to receive a quilt. As the numerous thank-you letters to volunteers testify, the project decidedly achieves its aim to deliver a huge hug through the medium of the quilt. Through the gift of a quilt, the recipient knows that someone out there cares for them.</p><p>Earlier this afternoon, a number of parliamentary colleagues called into committee room 3 to meet and chat with co-ordinators and volunteers. They were also able to see for themselves the huge variety of beautiful handmade quilts, all of which are unique and many of which are designed on a requested and specific theme.</p><p>Clearly, there is a huge demand for the quilts, which bring comfort to children in difficult times and provide a tangible and personal bond for parents and others who lose a loved one. Demand is increasing on a daily basis. It is my sincere hope that, by raising awareness of this hugely worthwhile project, more people will be encouraged to think about becoming volunteers, to donate the materials that project volunteers always desperately require, and to spread the news to other organisations or groups that work with children who are very ill or who are experiencing a difficult time in their lives and who would benefit from such a wonderful gift.</p><p>I look forward to the minister's comments, together with any suggestions that he may have for promoting the project.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14931875", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Project Linus UK"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I extend a warm welcome to the Project Linus UK co-ordinators and volunteers from Scotland who are in the public gallery, and the members who have stayed behind to listen to the debate.

Furthermore, it has enabled large amounts of private investment to improve people's homes to be made at a faster rate than would have been the case if they had remained in the public sector. The new investment has enabled house owners to make significant improvements to their homes, including the installation of double glazing and central heating to improve home energy efficiency and warmth.</p><p>Given all that and the fact that home ownership remains a clear aspiration for the vast majority of Scots, right to buy has an important part to play. With or without the right to buy, the main problem that the Government has to face is the shortage of affordable and appropriate housing for all, and it is a great pity that the motion does not highlight that point. These are difficult economic times and, in the wake of the credit crunch, a variety of different housing tenures is desperately required to address this very real and pressing problem.</p><p>The issue was tackled under the previous Tory Government when, as part of the community ownership programme, the Treasury agreed to write off existing capital housing debt if a council decided to transfer its stock to a housing association. Through stock transfer, housing associations have been able to lever in private finance in addition to the Scottish Government's housing association grant to fund improvements <place-holder colnum=\"15842\"/> and build new stock.

Who could doubt the validity of that statement, given the incidence of trafficking, which has been described as the new slave trade? Trafficking involves predominantly women, but also children, in what has become a growth industry both globally and on an intrastate basis. The last point is worth emphasising and was effectively brought home to me when I attended the recent Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference on trafficking in London. There is a common misconception that trafficking takes place exclusively between states, but in reality it is also a thriving domestic trade. If today's debate succeeds in making people in general more conscious of and vigilant about the abuses that are being perpetrated on their doorstep, it will have been worth while for that reason alone.</p><p>Violence against women is a key welfare issue. In that area, at least, there is some small glimmer of optimism, as the subject is at last receiving the attention that it merits, through domestic violence awareness-raising campaigns such as the highly successful breaking the circle of violence campaign that was launched just before Christmas in the <em>Airdrie &amp; Coatbridge Advertiser</em>, in conjunction with Strathclyde Police, North Lanarkshire Council, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and Scottish Women's Aid. The campaign, which ended recently, has had remarkable results in encouraging the reporting of abuse and educating the public about the insidious, complex and manipulative nature of domestic violence, which has such a devastating impact on both the victims and the children involved.</p><p>Also to be welcomed are the provisions of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill, which is being considered by the Justice Committee and will reform the law on rape. The bill's provisions bring clarity to the concept of reasonable belief of consent, for example. It is to be hoped that, in doing so, they will help to prevent some of the travesties that take place in courtrooms, where the victim often feels that she, not the perpetrator, is on trial.<place-holder colnum=\"15595\"/></p><p>I turn to the other aspects of the motion. The first is the gender pay gap, which&#8212;like death and taxes&#8212;seems always to be with us.

Oral evidence that was taken recently from Audit Scotland and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has been relayed to the Local Government and Communities Committee, which is to pursue the issue.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Equal Opportunities Committee has produced guidelines to help committees mainstream equal opportunities in their work across the equality strands, including gender. Among other things, the guidance suggests ways in which committees could scrutinise the Scottish Government's approach to equality impact assessment and its responsibility under the public sector equalities duties. The guidance was discussed recently by the Conveners Group, which brings it another step closer to adoption.</p><p>Finally, it is hoped that the Conveners Group's agreement to the Equal Opportunities Committee's request to commission research into sexualised goods aimed at children will result in useful material and evidence to help us get to grips with the root causes of low esteem in girls.</p><p>As the motion indicates, many aspects of women's rights are still to be addressed.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Ivan's family today.</p><p>Unpaid carers are affected by issues that are definitely to do with fairness. They are therefore affected by equal opportunities issues that cut across most, if not all, of the equality groups. This debate marks a departure from the norm, in that it is not about a committee inquiry report or a stage 1 report on a bill; rather, it results from two round-table discussions on unpaid carers that the Equal Opportunities held. Quite simply, having heard the evidence that was given, the committee wanted to bring the issues that were raised by various groups and organisations that represent unpaid carers and providers of services to those carers directly to the chamber and the Scottish Government.</p><p>To put the evidence in context, it is important to note that it is estimated that there are currently 660,000 unpaid carers in Scotland. It is a sobering thought that anyone can find themselves becoming a carer at any time. That fact was graphically brought to the public's attention only last week with a moving revelation from the Independent Television News presenter John Suchet. He described the full impact of his new role as carer to his wife Bonnie, who now suffers from dementia.</p><p>An unpaid carer has been defined as someone who looks after</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a partner, child, relative or friend who cannot manage without help because they are physically or mentally ill, frail or disabled. The carer may or may not live with the person they are caring for.\"</p><p>It is not difficult to begin to understand that the issue affects a huge number of people who live in our constituencies and communities. By carrying out the taxing and invaluable work of caring, such carers save the Scottish economy a staggering &#163;7.6 billion every year. The costs to carers&#8212;not <place-holder colnum=\"15122\"/> only financially, but emotionally and socially&#8212;are less easy to quantify, as they often involve carers sacrificing their career, education and personal development to improve the lives of others.</p><p>That was confirmed in the committee's two round-table discussions. In the first evidence session, the committee sought the views of organisations that represent unpaid carers on the barriers to and the challenges and the impact of becoming a carer; the gaps in services; and accessibility to those services. It is encouraging that good practice was highlighted. Cases in point were the support strategy for carers and the opportunities for flexible working that the Scottish Court Service has implemented. However, I will focus on areas in which there is still room for improvement.</p><p>Although carers have a statutory right to an assessment, they have no right to services after they have been assessed. There should be a duty on local authorities to fulfil those assessments.</p><p>Respite care is crucial to enable unpaid carers to perform their roles. Despite that, there is no uniform standard of respite care among, or even within, local authorities&#8212;hence the suggestion that the Parliament should recommend a minimum standard.</p><p>Much of the evidence that was given focused on local authorities. However, it was suggested that carers should have an annual health MOT and that general practitioner practice nurses should take their blood pressure and do blood tests on them on the basis that it is better to prevent carers from becoming ill than to wait until a crisis point is reached at which there will be two casualties: the person who is cared for and the carer.</p><p>The impact that caring responsibilities can have on young carers was highlighted. Young carers can sometimes irritate teachers because their minds are always elsewhere and they lack concentration, for example. One simple solution that was proposed was that the child could be given a card that they could discreetly pass to the teacher, with no questions asked, to allow them to leave the classroom for five minutes to phone home.</p><p>One of the witnesses who spoke about young carers pointed out that the 2011 census will not include young carers at all. I promised to raise that matter with the Scottish Government, and I would appreciate the minister clarifying the situation in her speech.</p><p>It was observed that the largest number of complaints come from older carers who care for another older person, as they often have the most difficulty in accessing the full package of services that is required. Such difficulties often result in the <place-holder colnum=\"15123\"/> person for whom they care having to go into a residential home.</p><p>The committee was made aware that caring is often hidden within communities. People from ethnic groups, or those who care for people with alcohol or drug dependency or the children of individuals in prison, do not come forward, either because they do not understand the system or because they fear the stigma that is associated with their caring role. Equally, in some communities, there are high expectations, particularly of women, that the caring role will be kept within the family. The second evidence session, too, highlighted groups of carers who do not always get the support that they need, namely carers of people with mental health difficulties, including dementia; carers of children with disabilities; and carers in rural areas, who can find access to centralised services far too costly.</p><p>Four further compelling points were raised. First, despite the age profile of carers, there is little specific support for older carers, who have changing and different needs. Secondly, a culture of risk aversion has arisen around handling and moving disabled children, which means that parents have to undertake those tasks because professionals are being advised not to do so. Thirdly, in England, there is a commitment to establish a national helpline for carers, and carers organisations in Scotland would like a helpline here. Finally, in broader terms, the take-up of carer assessments has been very low and carers do not routinely have their needs assessed.</p><p>I realise that the origin of the debate is unusual, but I hope that the approach will inspire similar committee debates in the future, so that when a committee hears important evidence that is relatively non-contentious, it can bring that directly and quickly to the Scottish Government's attention, thus helping to influence policy without having to undertake a full committee inquiry. I very much hope that the content of this Equal Opportunities Committee debate will help to inform the development of the forthcoming carers strategy from the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I look forward to the minister's comments and to an update on progress on the strategy.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes evidence gathered by the Equal Opportunities Committee on unpaid carers at its meetings on 25 March and 7 October 2008, which highlighted that there were around 660,000 unpaid carers in Scotland, a figure that represented one in eight of the population; recognises the valuable contribution that unpaid carers make in saving the Scottish economy &#163;7.6 billion a year; further notes that around 40% of unpaid carers surveyed reported that their access to services was poor or that available services did not meet their needs, and calls on the Scottish Government to take into consideration the <place-holder colnum=\"15124\"/> evidence gathered when developing the forthcoming Scottish Government/COSLA carers strategy.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14734043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Unpaid Carers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sure that members will wish to join me as I express on behalf of the Scottish Conservative party our sorrow and condolences to David and Samantha Cameron, who have tragically lost their son Ivan.

Part 2 contains the definition of consent as \"free agreement\", which brings a clarity to the law that is absent at present under common law, despite the fact that the absence of consent is a core element of the actus reus and mens rea of rape. Under current common law, rape involves penile penetration of a woman's vagina without consent, so it is a huge improvement that the bill extends that to include other forms of penile penetration, bringing it in line with legislation in England and Wales. The cabinet secretary's announcement that provision will be made at stages 2 and 3 to go further and include penetration with an object in the list of forms of penetration that the bill covers is also welcome. Cathie Craigie made a particularly powerful contribution on why that should be included as rape. The introduction of rape as a sexual offence that is no longer gender specific is long overdue and rectifies the injustice that, under common law, rape is recognised as a criminal offence only when it involves male sexual intercourse with a female without consent.</p><p>Parts 4 and 5 have provisions to deal with protective offences that are, sadly, very much evident in today's society, as a number of speakers pointed out. I am therefore pleased to see the protection that the bill will afford the vulnerable through the introduction of new protective offences that will criminalise sexual activity with someone whose capacity to consent to sexual activity is either entirely absent or not fully formed because of their age or a medical disorder. With Paul Martin and Robert Brown, I particularly welcome the introduction of the offence of sexual abuse of trust in section 31, which seeks to address that heinous betrayal, abuse and manipulation by providing that it is an offence for anyone over 18 to engage intentionally in sexual activity with someone under 18 in <place-holder colnum=\"15073\"/> respect of whom the older person is in a position of trust.</p><p>Section 32 sets out five conditions, any of which satisfies the definition of being in a position of trust. It is to be hoped that that will give more protection to children and young people and those with mental disorders who are institutionalised or vulnerable through a family relationship. I also welcome the provision that gives Scottish ministers the power to make an order under the negative resolution procedure to specify, as they materialise, other conditions that constitute a position of trust, especially in view of the fact that the submission by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland highlighted that young people in accommodation provided by a local authority who are at least 18 but not yet 21 would not be covered. That group of young people is potentially vulnerable, so I hope that the ACPOS submission will be given further consideration.</p><p>Although trafficking is not covered in the bill, section 10 provides, as one of the circumstances in which conduct takes place without free consent, that there is no consent if the only expression or indication of the victim's consent to sexual activity is from someone other than the victim. That is precisely the situation in which many trafficked women and, indeed, children find themselves.</p><p>Part 4 contains provisions that would lower the age of consent for oral sex. As several members have pointed out, that is the issue that has generated most controversy&#8212;and rightly so. Although it is true that young people are maturing earlier, there can be no case for permitting sex involving persons of 15 years or less. The Scottish Conservatives are very supportive of the committee's stance on that issue.</p><p>In that context, I read with interest the BMA's arguments in favour of decriminalising such activity in light of concerns that older children might otherwise be reluctant to come forward with any sexual health problems. I understand the well-intentioned reasoning behind that position, but I believe that lowering the age of consent would have the opposite effect by giving rise to a potentially far greater number of sexual health problems among young persons. With Nigel Don, I believe that education has an important role to play in that.</p><p>Finally, the prosecution of rape and of other serious offences has traditionally been dogged by myths and prejudices, which often surface in the courtroom during the giving of evidence and invariably involve the victim's character. I sincerely hope that the statutory definition of consent as \"free agreement\"&#8212;together with the provision covering reasonable belief and coupled with the reasonable person test that is to be applied&#8212;will help to correct those prejudices. However, as Bill <place-holder colnum=\"15074\"/> Aitken and John Lamont emphasised, any such correction must not be at the expense of an attempt to water down the presumption of innocence or the requirement for corroboration, given that the accused may be facing a high-tariff sentence for what are, without doubt, some of the most serious crimes in Scots law.</p><p>With those comments, I believe that the bill strikes the right balance.

While it is frequently linked with criminal activity, especially smuggling, the drugs trade and sexual exploitation, it is also prevalent in the form of economic exploitation. It would therefore be a mistake to think of it as just a criminal justice issue. If it is to be tackled effectively, an holistic approach must be adopted, with interministerial involvement and third sector voluntary input to give prosecution services valuable information about what is happening on the ground.</p><p>When trafficking was discussed at the 53<sup>rd</sup> Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in India in 2007, it was described as a growth industry. That is no less true in these difficult economic times&#8212;the victims who are targeted by the traffickers are vulnerable and easily exploited; they often live in extreme poverty and desperately seek a better life.</p><p>Speakers at the CPA conference and at the one on migration and trafficking that is currently being held in London&#8212;to which Murdo Fraser referred&#8212;have emphasised that no country can deal adequately with this global problem in isolation and that it will require international co-operation. Crucially, that must include a concerted effort to identify the victims by ensuring that the correct data about the extent of trafficking activity are collected in the country of origin, the transit country and the receiving state. Traffickers move their victims to ensure that they are kept isolated, vulnerable and without any of the support that could come from forming relationships.</p><p>Although the motion calls for appropriate strategies to be developed to combat the evil practice of trafficking people into Scotland, it would be folly to assume that trafficking is purely an immigration issue that can be fixed by passing legislation. Proof of that comes from the startling statistic that Lithuania, which is now part of the European Union, is the second largest country of origin for trafficked women into the United Kingdom&#8212;and they are not illegal immigrants; the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will not prosecute those who are genuinely trafficked.</p><p>I said at the outset that this is a complicated issue, but at the heart of any strategy to combat it must be the protection of victims. I therefore welcome Amnesty International's excellent briefing <place-holder colnum=\"14714\"/> paper from on the subject, which highlights the UK Government's ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. I hope that, through the convention and the access to services and rights that it bestows on trafficked people, coupled with better identification of the victims and the adoption of a holistic approach to the issue, an effective strategy can be found to end this evil practice.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14671249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Trafficking"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Murdo Fraser on securing a debate on this extremely important subject and, in so doing, on helping to raise awareness about trafficking.

It is a befriending project that is based in Motherwell. The project offers a service to 30 young people who are aged between eight and 18. It is a partnership between CSV and North Lanarkshire Council's social work department. It recruits local adults to befriend the young people, who are referred by social workers on the basis of their difficult home circumstances.</p><p>Through the volunteers, the young people&#8212;often for the first time in their lives&#8212;have someone who takes an interest in them. The young people have the opportunity to discuss, in an informal environment, any difficulties or problems that they might be experiencing.

When there is a dispute and acrimony, <place-holder colnum=\"10827\"/> the effect on the children is harrowing and potentially deeply damaging. That is especially true when, as all too frequently happens, children become mere pawns in the dispute and one or both parents are intent on point scoring and being as awkward as possible.</p><p>The motion highlights some of the problems that arise. In some cases, one parent wilfully withholds contact with the children by the non-resident parent. In extreme cases, a parent unilaterally moves a child to another jurisdiction. I am pleased that the question of jurisdiction was moved forward yesterday by the judgment in the Court of Session involving the case of Mr B from Aberdeen, who had no contact with his daughter for seven years after she was taken to live in England when she was only three years of age. The ruling of the three law lords clarified the principle of jurisdiction in the question of which court can make a judgment when a child is unlawfully taken to live in a different part of the United Kingdom, thus depriving the other parent of contact.</p><p>The logistical problems of trying to maintain parental contact when large distances are involved might remain, but the judgment is a positive step forward that will be widely welcomed by all those who have experienced such trauma.</p><p>How best to deal with family disputes is a hugely complex question to which there are no quick fixes. One solution definitely does not fit all. A good starting place is the points of agreement: that the current situation could be improved; that any arrangements to manage and resolve such disputes should be child centred; and that, as the Scottish Women's Aid briefing for tonight's debate states, it is important that children have meaningful and supportive relationships with both parents.</p><p>The welfare of the children when a relationship breaks up is at the heart of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006. During the scrutiny of the bill, various measures were considered in an effort to ensure that parents, despite any differences that they might have, are united in and focused on the child's upbringing and future. Parenting orders were encouraged as a means of achieving that objective, along with the ideas of co-parenting and quality parenting time. How that is managed and achieved will depend on individual circumstances, but one hopes that it involves co-operation and getting the parents to think about the needs of the child, including the need to maintain a formal relationship with both parents.</p><p>There is certainly a place for collaborative dispute resolution, but when there is a history of domestic abuse any arrangement that is aimed at resolving the dispute must take that into account and ensure that the safety of neither the abused parent nor the child is compromised. In such <place-holder colnum=\"10828\"/> situations, there is a definite place for parental contact being maintained through supervised contact centres. I pay tribute to Mary Mulligan's work in that regard.</p><p>The limited time available for tonight's debate does not permit the in-depth discussion that the motion merits, but I will conclude by stating that although I do not necessarily agree with all the assertions in the motion, I recognise and applaud the positive approach to family disputes that it seeks to promote.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13979328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Family Law Disputes"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Nigel Don on bringing his important motion to the Parliament for debate this evening.

If Willie Coffey was interested to note this, I was downright alarmed to read that original records that are now in the National Library of Scotland show short-term loans at a flat rate of 5 per cent and that a certain Margaret Mitchel borrowed the princely sum of one shilling in 1764. Although I assure members that she was not a relative, nonetheless I hope that the loan was repaid, as the interest that would have accrued in the intervening 240 plus years would be, to say the least, prohibitive. I suppose that a loan from Northern Rock is totally out of the question.</p><p>Those record books provide documentary evidence that, through their money-lending activities to the needy, the Fenwick weavers were responsible for setting up the earliest credit union. Today, thanks to Andrew Faulds, a descendant of one of the original weavers who gifted the books to the National Library of Scotland, which made them available to view, it has been possible to establish that the society's founding charter was signed by 15 weavers on 14 March 1761. The charter set out the principles of the society, which were honesty, faithfulness to one another, fair pricing, majority decisions, regular contributions to the poor fund and an admission charge of two shillings and sixpence to be used for the good of the society and the people whom it aimed to help. As Cathy Jamieson said, it is significant that those values and principles are just as relevant in the modern co-operative movement as they were then.</p><p>When the society closed in 1873, following the success of an immigration society that it had set up in response to the decline of the weaving trade some 34 years earlier, only 500 of Fenwick village's original 2,000 villagers remained. The others had all settled abroad, in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United States. It is through their descendants, and because of the society's unique history, that the proposed weavers heritage centre will flourish.

Today, the police must spend more time carrying out greatly expanded duties pertaining to the increased incidence of drug and alcohol-related crime, the implementation of European convention on human rights legislation, the Macpherson report on racism, policing the night economy, and terrorism incidents and their prevention.

As John Lamont explained in detail, and notwithstanding Angela Constance's comments, because of Scottish Conservative representation, the number of additional new police officers that the Scottish Government is committed to providing has increased from the SNP pledge of 500 to 1,000, and they are to be in place by the end of this third parliamentary session.

While providing new and additional police officers is the preferred solution, limited resources mean that other ways must be found to cope with increased demands, including redeployment, more civilianisation and retention.

In the same period, there were 76 reappointments. Reviewing the process, the commissioner pointed out that the Government appears to believe that reappointment is based on performance to date. She has been at pains to point out to and to <place-holder colnum=\"6778\"/> persuade the Government that although performance to date is important, it is not the only criterion. Hence, she firmly believes that, on each occasion, there should be a review of what the minister expects the body to deliver and of the person specification.</p><p>The committee also noted that there is a perception among many people that public appointments are not for them and that there is a general distrust of the appointments process. That led the commissioner to ask whether we really mean what we say about encouraging diversity in applications. Furthermore, even if the distrust is overcome, the lack of confidence prevails.</p><p>The commissioner was in no doubt that only persistence will deliver the necessary changes in attitude and that if we give up people will merely believe that it was all about political correctness. She also stated that she has an aspirational target for applications from, for example, disabled people, who are quite hard to reach. She also said that research made it clear that women are less confident than men and less likely to apply, even if they are overqualified.</p><p>The Equal Opportunities Committee agrees that the public appointments process should be accessible to everyone and hopes that the public will have greater trust in the system that is proposed in the strategy.

At a time when charities such as Rathbone, which works with young people who are not in education, employment or training, are striving to encourage a work ethic and to assure young people&#8212;some of whom come from families who have been unemployed for not just one but two generations&#8212;that it is okay to work, it is essential that young people who have found employment are not deterred by their first experience of work.</p><p>In that context, the unions into schools project comes into its own. Through school visits and presentations, the project's organisers seek to promote understanding of and awareness about how to achieve a good working environment. That helps young people to gain the experience and skills that they need and to access full-time employment.</p><p>Modern apprenticeships, which were introduced by the last Conservative Government and developed in 1994 by employer-led partnerships between national training organisations and local enterprise companies, and which are supported by the TUC, the Confederation of British Industry, and a wide range of employers, provide an excellent <place-holder colnum=\"5117\"/> example of how the TUC works with employers to ensure that young people and others gain necessary skills. However, although UK-wide modern apprenticeship take-up rates have increased, the number of apprenticeships in Scotland has remained relatively static during the past year or so. The new Scottish Government has given no guarantee of how many extra apprenticeships it will make available. Perhaps the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning will say that in her closing speech.</p><p>Apprenticeships are important, as is illustrated by the Grangemouth experience, in which trade unions worked with the sector skills council for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, nuclear, oil, petroleum and polymers&#8212;Cogent SSC Limited&#8212;and succeeded not only in providing access to apprenticeships for a wide range of people, including applicants from non-traditional backgrounds, but in securing guaranteed employment for apprenticeships on completion of training.</p><p>I welcome the debate, which highlights crucial employment issues for young people.

I am grateful to the Scottish Government for setting aside parliamentary time to discuss the many, varied, complex and extremely important issues that relate to raising awareness of rights and equal opportunities and to promoting the <place-holder colnum=\"3817\"/> benefits that embracing diversity can bring to key stakeholders in European societies, such as the voluntary sector, local authorities, private companies, communities and individuals.</p><p>The first-ever European equality summit was held in Berlin in January 2007. Last week, as convener of the Scottish Parliament's Equal Opportunities Committee, I attended the year's closing conference in Lisbon, where the varied activities that had taken place in different member states to mark the year were highlighted. Those included the issuing of commemorative stamps and coins, organised road shows on the subject, debates similar to this one, awards for best practice and the use of humour to get the message across and help to raise awareness. In Portugal, that was done through cartoons. In the Scottish Parliament, as part of equality and diversity week, we are holding a room 101 event to raise awareness about the issue in a light-hearted way. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Aneela McKenna and her staff for all the excellent events that they have staged for the Scottish Parliament's equality and diversity week.</p><p>The use of humour is worth exploring given the fact that, over the years, there has been a tendency to take equal opportunities to extremes so that, in the public perception, it has become primarily associated with negativity. For example, it is perceived to be about political correctness and what one cannot do. That has meant that, all too often, when equal opportunities is raised, the inevitable reaction is to groan or switch off completely. Yet, the fundamental issue of fairness that equal opportunities seeks to address is one that affects everybody. If not directly about ourselves, it is about our son, daughter, wider family, friend, neighbour, colleague or acquaintance. Equal opportunities is about everyone and involves celebrating diversity, breaking down stereotyping and challenging cultural prejudice.</p><p>That message was powerfully brought home to me by one speaker at the Lisbon conference who pointed out that, although climate change has dominated political thought in recent years by posing the question, \"Can we live without the planet?\" a more pressing question&#8212;given the international conflict that is almost a permanent feature in the world arena&#8212;is perhaps, \"Can we live without each other?\" Clearly, we cannot. That makes it all the more pertinent to raise awareness of and establish our understanding of diversity and difference as positive rather than negative attributes.</p><p>There is encouraging evidence that private companies and multinationals such as L'Or&#233;al are already recognising and promoting diversity as good for competitiveness and for their public <place-holder colnum=\"3818\"/> image. Their philosophy is that diversity is the mirror of the world and breeds creativity. L'Or&#233;al therefore not only has diversity as a core value, but has established a diversity laboratory to exchange and promote best practice among other countries. It is interesting to note that more than 50 per cent of the company's managers are women. There is, therefore, a growing recognition in both the public and private sectors that the workplace is a key channel for the promotion of diversity and intercultural dialogue and that there are economic benefits to be reaped from that. There are lessons there to be learned for Scotland.</p><p>I will briefly mention some of the valid points that were raised at yesterday's round-table discussion on barriers to mainstreaming equal opportunities in Scotland, which the Equal Opportunities Committee held to celebrate the European year of equal opportunities. At the debate, it was pointed out that mainstreaming is not always clearly understood, and concern was expressed about the lack of sufficient scrutiny and analysis of spending commitments dedicated to tackling barriers to equal opportunities and to promoting diversity.</p><p>Very pertinent points were also raised about access to justice being denied in relation to the tribunal system, which militates against individuals' taking up complaints on their own. They find it too expensive to do so, they may lack expertise and such actions can often be a death knell for their career prospects.

As other members have pointed out, the idea is based on the Italian co-planning model, which has indeed proved very effective in helping social enterprises to win public sector contracts. The concept is being introduced into the United Kingdom in two pilot partnerships&#8212;one in North Lanarkshire, the other in Renfrewshire&#8212;under the European Equal initiative. North Lanarkshire Council's pilot, which is led by the Community Recycling Network for Scotland, focuses on services related to furniture storage, including emergency storage and furniture packs for homeless people.</p><p>Public-social partnerships aim to meet service users' needs by providing a people-centred service that achieves added community and/or environmental benefits. The North Lanarkshire pilot seeks to attain both kinds of benefit. Through co-planning, PSPs bring service users, local authorities, social enterprises and other agencies together to design the service, and the pilot allows time for the existing delivery service to be monitored closely before any relevant information or comments are incorporated into the tender. One key element is the provision of an intermediary who is brought in to manage the process up until the tender is lodged.</p><p>Ideally, the whole process begins at least a year&#8212;preferably 18 months&#8212;before the contract goes out to tender. At the beginning, the local authority provides information about the services that it requires and the social enterprises that it wants to involve.</p><p>Another key element of PSPs is the formation of a consortium. As Michael McMahon has pointed out, in the North Lanarkshire pilot, three social enterprise projects&#8212;RECAP, Beulah Scotland and St Patrick's Furniture Project&#8212;have come together to form the outreach consortium. It is important to note that, in forming that consortium, those enterprises, which, because of their size, would have been totally unable to bid in their own right, will now be able to lodge a tender.</p><p>As Alex Neil suggested in his reference to the McClelland report, one of the business community's main grievances is that small to medium-sized enterprises and social enterprises find it very difficult to tender for public contracts, not least because of the lengthy, bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming administrative process, which acts as a powerful disincentive. PSPs address that very problem and are very much to be welcomed as a mechanism for breaking down <place-holder colnum=\"2821\"/> the barriers to local authority procurement of services for social enterprises. Moreover, through ensuring that contracts include community and/or environment clauses, PSPs can reflect the added benefits that organisations can bring to the running of services.</p><p>Although the pilot is not yet complete, I very much look forward to hearing the minister's comments on this exciting new initiative.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390383", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public-Social Partnership Pilot (North Lanarkshire)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Michael McMahon on bringing the debate to the Scottish Parliament this evening, not least because once I had negotiated and deciphered the component parts and all the jargon   in the motion, it was evident that public-social partnerships are most certainly worth supporting.

I warmly welcome them to the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Monday 18 June marked the beginning of motor neurone disease awareness week, so it is apt that we are debating my motion today and raising awareness of this devastating illness and the problems surrounding the funding of the care of those who have the disease.</p><p>Every day, three people in the United Kingdom are diagnosed with motor neurone disease and three die from it. In Scotland, more than 120 people are diagnosed with the disease every year and 120 people die from it. It is a fatal disease for which there is no cure and of which the cause is not known. It is a progressive disorder of the nervous system for which there is no definitive diagnosis. It affects different individuals in different ways, depending on the nerve cells involved, but it is always progressive, resulting in paralysis, loss of speech and impairment of the throat muscles&#8212;which means that sufferers are unable to eat or drink. Limbs and the diaphragm cease to function. Life expectancy after diagnosis averages 14 months.<place-holder colnum=\"931\"/></p><p>Motor neurone disease has been described as one of nature's cruellest diseases, because while there is progressive degeneration and paralysis of the limbs and diaphragm, which results in respiratory problems, the mind remains intact. On rare occasions, it affects children, but it mostly affects people over 40&#8212;although a significant number of people are diagnosed in their 20s.</p><p>Motor neurone disease is no respecter of persons. Recently, the chamber was shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the death of Mark Canavan, the son of former Falkirk West MSP Dennis Canavan, at the age of only 41. In 2006, it claimed a number of football personalities, including Jock Wallace, the former Rangers manager, who was 61; Jimmy Johnstone, the former Celtic player and Lisbon lion, who was 61; and Don McVicar, formerly of Partick Thistle and St Johnstone, who was only 44. From the world of broadcasting and entertainment, in 1982, the disease claimed Ian Trethowan, the former director-general of the BBC, and, a year later, the actor, David Niven, who was 73.</p><p>The Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association is the only charity in the country that cares for sufferers. It provides support, education and information to patients, carers&#8212;both voluntary and statutory&#8212;and families, and offers a multidisciplinary health team service at the time of diagnosis, during progression of the disease and beyond.</p><p>The association aims to raise awareness of motor neurone disease, to promote research and to ensure that the right help, care and support are given at the right time, to allow sufferers to live as well as possible for as long as possible. It focuses on ensuring that generic service systems of health and care are able to meet the needs of people who live with MND&#8212;in particular, their need for a rapid response to changing requirements. In effect, it ensures that fast-tracked requests for services are responded to.</p><p>The motor neurone disease Scotland care team of six people, which comprises three full-time and three part-time health professionals who are employed by the national health service, is stretched to breaking point. It exists only because funding is provided by the association. Last year, health boards contributed a derisory &#163;9,415 to a &#163;300,000 service.</p><p>I believe that the service that the care team provides is an example of world best practice. Furthermore, the model of care that it has implemented puts into practice the main principles of the Kerr report, \"Building a Health Service Fit for the Future\"&#8212;integration between health and social services, the delivery of services as locally as possible and the provision of prompt access to specialised services when necessary. The irony is <place-holder colnum=\"932\"/> that the care team has been doing that since 1982.</p><p>I have three questions for the minister. When such a vital service fits so neatly into current policy, why does it have to rely for funding on the good will of the public through their donations to the association? Why does the association have to bear the responsibility of funding the care team when its members work alongside NHS-funded clinical specialists for other neurological conditions who work in the same offices and do similar jobs? Finally, what can she do to rectify that injustice and to help with research into such a humbling disease?</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385431", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Motor Neurone Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the public gallery, we have with us members of the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association, sufferers and their carers, family and friends.

Under section 83 of the 2003 act, someone who is subject to the notification requirements&#8212;commonly referred to as the sexual offenders register&#8212;must register certain details with the police. Those details are then added to their record on the criminal history system&#8212;a computerised database that is maintained by the Scottish Criminal Record Office on behalf of the Scottish police forces. Failure to register such information&#8212;including date of birth, national insurance number, name, address, passports held and travel details&#8212;and any changes to the information within three days is a criminal offence.</p><p>Despite the stringent registration requirements, offenders slip through the net, as has sadly been evidenced by recent high-profile cases. So, the question how can the monitoring and supervision of adult sex offenders be improved remains.</p><p>It is clear that there is no single, failsafe measure that will magically address the problem. Rather, there are a number of measures that, together, should help to prevent sex offenders disappearing and going on to reoffend. One such measure, which I will focus on, is the proposal that, if a sex offender breaches the notification requirements or any other conditions of their release, they will be deemed to forfeit the right to <place-holder colnum=\"569\"/> anonymity. That carrot-and-stick approach and the threat of their identity being revealed will be powerful deterrents to sex offenders who might otherwise contemplate reoffending, especially when they are coupled with other measures such as global positioning systems tracking and the introduction of polygraph testing. Evidence from pilot studies has been encouraging.</p><p>In the first four months of this year alone, 100 paedophiles listed on the UK sex offenders register travelled to Portugal. I would therefore be interested to hear the cabinet secretary's view on how European Union member states can ensure that the information that they hold on sex offenders is effectively shared with other member states so that we have sufficient information to prevent offenders going underground abroad.</p><p>I will comment briefly on the spirit in which the debate has been conducted and the minority Government's willingness to take commonsense policy suggestions on board. They have not only been good for democracy and devolution, they have transformed debates in the Parliament.

Suffice it to say that the stage 3 amendments that were lodged then were numerous and varied, and were the subject of robust debate.</p><p>Today the situation is very different, as the summary of evidence that was received by the Justice 1 Committee and the Scottish Executive testifies. Interest groups such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos and Asbestos Action (Tayside), West Dunbartonshire Council, Stirling Council, North Lanarkshire Council, Perth and Kinross Council, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, insurers and consumers, as well as various legal and academic respondents, were all in agreement that the existing law is problematic for mesothelioma sufferers and their relatives.</p><p>Although 12 of the 15 respondents stated that they were in favour of disapplying section 1(2) of the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976&#8212;the provision whereby the relatives' claim is extinguished if the sufferer settles their claim before death&#8212;as a means of remedying the problem, others, notably the Association of British Insurers and the Forum of Scottish Claims Managers, initially argued that the problem could be solved</p><p class=\"indent\">\"by encouraging claimants to initiate their claim, make an application for interim damages, and then sist the claim until after death.\"</p><p>Some respondents, including the STUC, considered that there was justification for including other medical conditions in the bill. Others recognised that, perversely, improvements to court timetables and the more streamlined claims procedure following the Coulsfield report had the unintentional effect of adding to the anguish of sufferers, who, once diagnosed, have an average life expectancy of 14 months.</p><p>Despite the initial difference of opinion about how best to solve the problem, there have been none of the entrenched standpoints that are usually adopted when we debate the detail of a bill, once the general principles have been agreed. Instead, all the parties involved have been willing to compromise, in recognition of the uniqueness of the features that relate to mesothelioma: namely, that it is almost invariably caused by exposure to a particular substance&#8212;asbestos; that, as medical science currently stands, there is no cure; that life expectancy is short at, on average, 14 months; and that, under the Fairchild exception, sufferers do not need to meet the normal test of causation in civil actions. For those reasons, the bill that is before us today is mesothelioma specific. It is designed to remove the dilemma that sufferers face in relation to relatives' compensation claims, which in approximately 80 per cent of cases has <place-holder colnum=\"33372\"/> resulted in the sufferer forgoing their claim to ensure that their relatives are not disadvantaged.</p><p>No other class of personal injury shares the characteristics of mesothelioma, which means that our passing the bill does not compromise the general principle that relatives' rights are extinguished if the deceased settles their claim in full prior to death.</p><p>This is a bill of which the Scottish Parliament can be proud. It represents devolution as it was intended to work. As the minister confirmed, there is no doubt that the Parliament would not be in a position to pass the bill today were it not for the campaigners, for Thompsons Solicitors, who acted on behalf of the sufferers, and for Des McNulty. It is to be hoped that, when the Parliament convenes in the new session, it will give careful consideration to alternative ways of tackling the problems of the day, rather than rushing to legislate, so that precious legislative time can be given over to prioritising bills such as this, which can and, I hope sincerely, will make a difference to mesothelioma sufferers and their relatives.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13382345", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to speak in support of this short and unusual bill.

Including mortgage debt, total consumer debt in the UK is more than &#163;1.2 trillion, an amount that is larger than the UK's annual gross domestic product. Britain's personal debt increases by approximately &#163;1 million every four minutes. To put that in context, the average UK consumer owes over 200 per cent more than the average western European.</p><p>There is little doubt that the easy access to credit offered by major credit card companies contributes to the level of personal debt. Such offers are invariably unsolicited and irresponsible. As a result, there are 31.6 million credit card holders in the UK today, with every person having an average of 2.4 cards, which in turn means that there are more credit cards than people. The average interest rate on credit card lending is currently 15.72 per cent&#8212;a staggering 11 per cent, approximately, above the base rate.</p><p>As more people attempt to manage existing debt by accessing new credit, it is not difficult to see how their debt spirals out of control. Hence, insolvencies are up by 55 per cent in the current quarter, in comparison with the same period in 2005, and they are estimated to top 100,000 for the entire year. Furthermore, the average age of a bankrupt has fallen from 43 to 41 in the past four years and the proportion of young bankrupts, aged between 18 and 29, has more than doubled.</p><p>Given those sobering statistics and the fact that, according to a recent Financial Services Authority survey, 62 per cent of young people admitted that if they had money problems or debt they would not be able to name any advice or support service to which they could turn, it is clear that here is fertile ground for loan sharks.</p><p>Illegal moneylenders operate without a credit licence. According to recent research commissioned by the DTI, their victims fall into two main categories. The first category contains the credit impaired and represents about a third of the victims&#8212;people who have chaotic lifestyles associated with drug or alcohol abuse, who might work occasionally, but who have systematically slipped down the credit ladder.</p><p>The second category is that of the credit excluded, which contains about two thirds of the victims. These are people who are unable to access mainstream credit for a number of reasons. They are usually on benefits and are among the most vulnerable people in society.</p><p>The DTI has responded to the problem positively and effectively by setting up an illegal lending enforcement pilot project, which has been allocated &#163;2.6 million over two and a half years, <place-holder colnum=\"32618\"/> with a further &#163;1.2 million secured from the financial inclusion fund. The project funds regional teams, including one in Glasgow, to investigate the impact of enforcement against illegal money lenders. The teams have achieved a number of notable successes since the pilot was established in September 2004 and appear to be on target to recoup &#163;2 million, which is roughly equivalent to the original budget for the pilot. The Glasgow team has reported 12 cases to the procurator fiscal and three loan sharks have been sentenced. Five hundred people have benefited as a result of Scottish loan sharks being prosecuted, with savings of almost &#163;250,000 that would otherwise have been demanded from some of the poorest people in Scotland. The team has seized or frozen &#163;500,000 of loan sharks' assets and recovered &#163;5,000-worth of counterfeit goods.</p><p>The subsequent DTI evaluation highlights areas of policy for which the Liberal-Labour pact must assume responsibility and in which it must play its part. This is the aspect of illegal lending that my amendment covers. The evaluation emphasises that effective relationships with key partners must be in place and stresses that the police have a pivotal role. It is therefore crucial that adequate police capacity and powers are available to ensure proper enforcement. As the minister said, the removal of loan sharks involves significant police resources and manpower, so there are major resource implications. However, the pact's commitment to ensuring that that resource is in place will always be in doubt as long as it continues to dedicate precious funds to employing community wardens rather than full-time police officers, as wardens do not have sufficient powers to deal with loan sharks or to give the public the confidence to report illegal moneylending without fear of reprisals. It is also essential to ensure that credit unions have sufficient capacity to offer instant loans and to manage high-risk borrowers.</p><p>Tackling personal debt and financial exclusion is an issue of social responsibility&#8212;we are all in it together. Government must ensure that we have fair and proportionate regulation; that consumer protection is in place; and that financial education and financial inclusion are promoted. If supervised attendance orders were available as a first disposal in the justice of the peace courts, that would go some way towards ensuring that potential victims of loan sharks could access money management services as soon as possible. Individuals must act responsibly and take into consideration the consequences of borrowing and spending. Civic society, charities and non-governmental organisations should be encouraged to devise innovative local solutions that address local issues in a way that centralised services cannot. Crucially, business must provide important financial advice and training that illustrates how <place-holder colnum=\"32619\"/> success goes hand in hand with lending responsibly and acting with integrity.</p><p>Government, civic society and business must therefore all work in partnership and play their part in tackling personal debt and financial exclusion.

As a result of the Coulsfield recommendations implemented in April 2003, personal injury claims in the Court of Session are now being concluded within a shortened period of 12 to 13 months. Because mesothelioma sufferers survive an average of 14 months, they by and large live long enough to settle their claims. In such cases, section 1(2) of the 1976 act comes into force.</p><p>In practical terms, what this all means is that mesothelioma sufferers have opted to forgo their claim so that they safeguard their relatives' ability and right to claim for loss of society and guidance and the grief, sorrow and distress sustained as a result of their death. It is clear that the current legislation puts all parties in an invidious position and has merely served to worsen an already distressing and harrowing situation.<place-holder colnum=\"31758\"/></p><p>I have frequently and, I believe, justifiably criticised the Executive for legislating to solve a problem when it is unnecessary and often counterproductive to do so, either because a remedy already exists under common law or because the problem can be solved by approaching it in another way&#8212;the Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill and the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Bill are cases in point&#8212;but I have no doubt that the bill that we are considering today is not only the best, but the only way of resolving a dilemma that, frankly, no family should have to face.</p><p>The bill addresses the effect of the current law through provisions that will ensure that the sufferer will no longer have to decide whether to forfeit the claim to which they are entitled, in recognition of their asbestos-related condition, in order to protect their family's financial security. The committee is particularly grateful to Phyllis Craig of Clydeside Action on Asbestos for her poignant and comprehensive explanation of the full extent of the dilemma that sufferers face.</p><p>It was decided not to extend the bill's provisions to other conditions, but to confine them to sufferers of mesothelioma, which is a unique condition. The argument for that was advanced convincingly by Frank Maguire, whose firm of solicitors handles 500 mesothelioma cases. He explained that asbestos-related lung cancer is not an analogous condition because it is not possible to say that it has inevitably been caused by asbestos&#8212;there are competing causes such as smoking, as well as various very possibly unknown factors, which defenders would seek to blame.</p><p>In mesothelioma cases, it is clear from the symptoms that the illness is caused by exposure to asbestos. Defenders accept that a causal link has been established. In those circumstances, the committee was persuaded that it is appropriate to confine the bill's provisions to mesothelioma sufferers alone, although it welcomes the Executive's decision to ask the Scottish Law Commission to review the law of damages in general.</p><p>The committee went on to consider the possibility of making the provisions retrospective, so that they cover cases that are settled before the bill is enacted&#8212;which will be the seventh day after it receives royal assent&#8212;to address the deferral of hearings until after the bill's implementation to ensure that mesothelioma sufferers' families benefit from its provisions.</p><p>Representatives of the insurance industry pointed out that although, in general, retrospection is problematic, they were not unduly concerned by what the bill proposed. They volunteered that, after the Barker v Corus case, they had agreed <place-holder colnum=\"31759\"/> with the Department for Work and Pensions that all claims that followed that judgment but which preceded the passing of the Compensation Act 2006 would be treated under the act. A precedent already existed and the certainty that the insurers sought to achieve had not been compromised. The committee therefore welcomed the Deputy Minister for Justice's statement that the Executive intended to amend the bill at stage 2 to allow it to apply to cases raised on or after 20 December 2006.</p><p>The bill is good. It is only fit and proper that I pay tribute to the minister, previous justice committees, the campaigners from Clydeside Action on Asbestos, Frank Maguire and, above all, Des McNulty, without whose work the Scottish Parliament would not be in a position to approve the bill's general principles.

However, I caution the Executive to remember that being radical is not necessarily a virtue in itself. I remain concerned about the provisions for trial in absence, which have been passed with the best of intentions but which will, I fear, affect disproportionately some of the most vulnerable people in our society; I refer to those with chaotic lifestyles that are due, more often than not, to their dependence on drugs or alcohol.</p><p>On a more positive note, I welcome the provisions relating to bail and remand, which will tighten bail provisions and make the reasons for granting or refusing bail much more transparent. I hope that they will also negate the unintended consequences resulting from the incorporation of the European convention on human rights directly into Scots law and lead to a much stricter regime for granting bail that puts public safety firmly first. I acknowledge and commend the excellent work that was done on that by the committee chaired by Sheriff Principal McInnes and the Sentencing Commission.</p><p>More generally, although many of the procedural provisions are to be welcomed in principle, the devil, as always, is in the detail. It would have been preferable for the Lord Advocate's guidance to be published in advance of the passing of the bill to allow proper scrutiny of proposals, for example in relation to liberation on undertaking.

Direct deduction of income support can be achieved under section 24 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. My central point is that the creation of fines enforcement officers in itself will not ensure that more wilful fine defaulters will be dealt with in the way the bill envisages or that they will not be imprisoned, which is clearly not in anyone's best interest.

Those recommendations come against a background of the Scottish Executive's objectives to reform the system of automatic unconditional early release and, crucially, to achieve greater clarity in sentencing.</p><p>The question is: does the bill do what it says on the tin and provide clarity? The answer is a resounding no. As my colleague Bill Aitken pointed out, it certainly does not end automatic early release. As the Subordinate Legislation Committee states, the provisions&#8212;in particular section 6(10)&#8212;that give ministers the power to vary the proportion of the custody part of sentences are ambiguous and risk being reinterpreted in future.</p><p>The Justice 2 Committee questions whether the measures in the bill achieve the stated objectives and seeks a clearer explanation of why the 15-day cut-off has been chosen as the point at which the combined custody and community sentence kicks in. In other words, the clarity that the ministers sought to achieve is non-existent. Instead, more confusion and uncertainty is created.</p><p>The Justice 2 Committee highlights the point. It states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Clarity is required about the circumstances in which reference is being made to the risk of re-offending, risk of harm or the risk of serious harm.\"</p><p>It adds that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"more information is required about precisely what kind of risk assessment processes are anticipated, about who will carry them out and about exactly how they are expected to contribute to reducing re-offending.\"</p><p>On breach and recall, the committee wants clarification and further detail on the notification process</p><p class=\"indent\">\"for the police in terms of those coming out of prison on licence and in terms of notifying Scottish Ministers of those who have committed an offence while on licence.\"</p><p>Similarly, the committee welcomed the minister's confirmation that the home detention curfew is not intended to be used in the initial period of the bill's implementation, but was nonetheless concerned that its continued existence as an option was likely to lead, yet again, to a lack of clarity and transparency.</p><p>I turn to the provisions in part 3 of the bill, covering weapons. Part 3 introduces a licensing scheme for non-domestic knives, as part of the overall objective of reducing knife crime in Scotland, and has been widely welcomed as a positive measure. However, the criminal law committee of the Law Society of Scotland remains<place-holder colnum=\"31055\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"concerned that the licensing of non-domestic knives may well, however, result in those involved in violence simply changing their weapon of choice to a domestic knife\"</p><p>and is, therefore, strongly of the view that other, non-legislative measures</p><p class=\"indent\">\"must be adopted.\"</p><p>In view of the absence of clarity in the bill, coupled with the legitimate concern that the Justice 2 Committee expressed about the totally inadequate timescale within which it was required to issue its call for evidence, consider the evidence that was received, set out and conduct the necessary oral evidence-taking sessions, and draft and consider its report on the bill, it is difficult not to come to the conclusion that the issues that the bill seeks to address, especially regarding clarity, would have been simply and effectively addressed if any one of the amendments to end automatic early release that Bill Aitken lodged in the Parliament on four separate occasions had not been voted down by all the other parties. Those amendments would have ended automatic early release and restored honesty in sentencing. More to the point, they would have established the clarity in sentencing that the bill so spectacularly lacks.</p><p>I end by saying that the Scottish Executive's rush to legislate by pushing through the bill reflects badly on the Scottish Parliament.

As a result of the company's ceasing to trade, hundreds of families and individuals throughout Scotland&#8212;not only in Dumfries, but in central Scotland and East Dunbartonshire, in Coatbridge, Airdrie, Hamilton, East Kilbride, Motherwell, Wishaw, Shotts, Falkirk and Kilmarnock&#8212;discovered that their savings had been lost and that they faced a bleak Christmas. The victims had one thing in common&#8212;rather than choosing to borrow and enter a spiral of debt, they had acted responsibly by planning ahead and making provision for the financial demands of the festive season.<place-holder colnum=\"29576\"/></p><p>Farepak, which was established in 1969, had a well-tested track record. Many self-employed agents, who encouraged friends and families to save, had been with the company for more than 20 years and were savers themselves. Some people&#8212;including employees in private firms and local authorities&#8212;saved with agents through work connections. There was no reason to doubt the company's viability.</p><p>However, there was a very different story behind the scenes. Farepak's parent company, European Home Retail, which is a listed company, took decisions that meant that its liabilities exceeded its assets for more than two years. A time bomb was waiting to explode; it finally exploded when Farepak and EHR called in the administrators, which left the victims&#8212;among them some of the poorest and most vulnerable families in Scotland&#8212;devastated.</p><p>As Elaine Murray pointed out, some people have been quick to point the finger at HBOS following the collapse of Farepak. However, doing so is unjust. The bankers tried to support the struggling company for as long as they could, but they could not support it indefinitely. Like Elaine Murray, I have absolutely no doubts about who the real culprits are. The blame lies firmly on EHR's directors, managers and family shareholders, who tried to trade their way out of trouble rather than consolidate before things got totally out of control.</p><p>The setting up of the Department of Trade and Industry fund to help victims is welcome. Any contributions must be voluntary, and people should not be too prescriptive. As Elaine Murray said, numerous companies and individuals have already contributed to it, and I hope that others will be encouraged to do so. I would certainly welcome Scotland's local authorities being encouraged to spread some Christmas cheer by donating the revenues that they receive from a week's parking fines. If they did so, they might even make people feel good for once about getting one of the dreaded parking tickets that local councils and the blue meanies diligently deliver.</p>", "hdate": "2006-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13372048", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Farepak Response Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to discuss the fund for Farepak victims and congratulate Elaine Murray on securing a debate on such an important issue.

I firmly believe that giving the new function to the SPSO would have been a much more effective way of ensuring that the function was carried out, as the SPSO, by virtue of her current role in dealing with complaints, is already well aware of where there is a need to promote and raise awareness of human rights in public authorities and bodies. In addition, value for money would have been achieved and the savings that would have been made from the commission's proposed &#163;1 million budget could have been ploughed into the voluntary sector to allow organisations with expertise and experience in promoting and fighting for the human rights of the various vulnerable people whom they represent to take up individual cases, which the commission will have no power to do.</p><p>The Executive has tinkered at the edges by making suggestions that it estimates will reduce the costs of establishing the commission&#8212;suggestions about advertising for new members, pensions, social security provision, allowances and salaries&#8212;but the fact remains that the &#163;1 million could have been far better used to promote and protect human rights.</p><p>I will touch on two amendments that were agreed to at stage 2. The first is the amendment that removed the requirement to give notice before inspecting a detention centre. That was clearly sensible. Conversely, the other amendment, to which the minister referred, created a provision that would in effect prioritise the promotion of some human rights. Any promotion should take place case by case and on its merits, as it is to be hoped that the human rights of every group in society are equally important. Instead, the amendment sends the unacceptable message that all human rights are equal, but that some are more equal than others.

We also look forward to hearing more details of the extent to which the Public Defence Solicitors Office will be involved.</p><p>We support the provision to allow the Scottish Legal Aid Board to fund specialist advisers who are not lawyers. I am pleased that the minister recognised the clear and distinct administration and resource problems that would have been created by the provision of case-by-case funding and confirmed that it will be addressed at stage 2 with an amendment to add block grant funding and thus safeguard agencies' ability to concentrate on providing advice.</p><p>On the provisions to improve the handling of complaints against the legal profession, I share people's unease at the proposal to give the Law Society the dual role of being responsible both for promoting and for policing the profession. Criticism of such self-regulation has led to a move to co-regulation with a multilayered regulatory framework involving ordinary courts and various professional bodies. Despite that, the current system is still seen as being heavily weighted in favour of the practitioner.</p><p>As a result, the bill proposes the creation of a new independent statutory body, the Scottish legal complaints commission, which will have a non-lawyer majority and which will take over the Scottish legal services ombudsman's role in overseeing service complaints. I acknowledge that such a measure is intended to promote consumers' interests&#8212;indeed, that aim is at the heart of the bill. However, despite the minister's announcement of the amendments that he intends to lodge at stage 2, we still need clarity about the considerable powers that the bill will confer on the Scottish ministers.</p><p>Under the bill, a minister has the power to appoint or dismiss commission board members; approve the appointment of the chief executive; direct the commission on the appointment of employees and their terms and conditions, including their salary; change the commission's duties and powers&#8212;which, in itself, is a huge power; and direct the commission in the exercise of its functions.<place-holder colnum=\"27347\"/></p><p>The minister has said that he wants to establish a commission that provides a dispute resolution service independent of the legal profession. However, we still need clarity over the crucial question whether the commission will be independent of the Scottish Executive. The powers that the current bill seeks to give the Scottish ministers will compromise the commission's necessary independence and, in fact, strike at the very heart of our democracy. That said, I am very pleased that the minister has partly acknowledged that point in the amendments that he intends to lodge, especially in the proposal to involve the Lord President of the Court of Session in appointments to the commission. Without its independence, the commission will not fulfil its intended role. Worse still, it will become almost a branch of the Scottish Executive.</p><p>Other amendments must be lodged at stage 2 to address legitimate concerns about provisions to deal with complaints about inadequate professional service. At the moment, the Scottish courts determine issues of fact and law in negligence. As other members have pointed out, the commission would take over that responsibility and would be able to order payment of compensation up to &#163;20,000. Serious concerns have been expressed about whether such a provision complies with the ECHR, given that, despite the minister's assurances, it is unclear whether, even under the terms of his proposed amendment, the commission would be independent and impartial. Moreover, there is no external right of appeal if the commission upholds a service complaint. A more worrying prospect is that many firms that currently act for charitable organisations either free of charge or at reduced fees might decline such work for fear of being subject to Court of Session litigation from every member of those organisations.</p><p>The bill is well intentioned. However, despite the amendments that have been outlined today, I believe that huge question marks still hang over the commission's independence from the Scottish Executive and the limits on the access to free independent advice that the bill is intended to promote.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366367", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I confirm that the Scottish Conservatives welcome and support the general principles of the bill: namely to improve the handling of complaints against legal practitioners in Scotland and to try to ensure better co-ordination of the delivery of publicly funded legal aid.

That is the <place-holder colnum=\"25598\"/> main message of the \"Hidden Harm\" report and it is one to be welcomed.</p><p>However, although the focus on a child's well-being and safety is clearly good, the issue is far from being straightforward. Children 1<sup>st</sup> points out that making decisions about the best interests and the future well-being of a child is complex. In other words, it is far from being a black-and-white issue. Some children of substance-abusing parents have strong support and are protected and cared for; sadly, others are not. That being the case, there must be better identification of the children who are at risk and their needs. As the Barnardo's report says, there have to be sustainable ways of supporting children in their families, if that is a safe option.</p><p>The importance of family to children cannot be overestimated, yet many of the children of parents who are addicted to drugs or alcohol do not enjoy a normal childhood, and they often assume the role of carers for their parents and younger siblings. That was a point poignantly brought home to me and some fellow MSPs who undertook a heartstart UK course recently, during which the instructors from the British Heart Foundation said that some children as young as five, six or seven are already expert at ensuring that an unconscious person is put into the recovery position pending the arrival of medical help because they frequently have to do that when their drug or alcohol-dependent parent has passed out.</p><p>How, then, to best deal with this problem? Certainly, each case must be judged on its merits and, where possible, rather than removing children from their family, the role that the wider family&#8212;aunts, uncles, grandparents, other relatives and close family friends&#8212;could play in supporting the child should be considered. I am pleased that the motion recognises that.</p><p>The approach makes sense, particularly given the shortage of foster carers and the well-documented shortcomings and frequent adverse outcomes of institutional care, including low educational attainment, increased risk of drug use, mental illness, homelessness, offending behaviour and a lack of self esteem.</p><p>Without doubt, however, the best way in which to ensure the safety of children and to improve their lives is to ensure that help and treatment for their substance-misusing parents are available, especially at the point at which those addicts are ready to face up to and tackle their addiction. That is when rehabilitation programmes have the greatest chance of being successful. As Rosemary Byrne said, and as the Children 1<sup>st</sup> report confirms, that help is not always readily available. That situation must be rectified by making drug testing and treatment orders available not only as <place-holder colnum=\"25599\"/> a high-tariff disposal for offenders with a series of offences but as an early intervention measure for those addicts who have committed one or two minor offences. Further, a sufficient number of rehab places must be available and a directory must be established that would provide information on where those places are, how many of them there are and when they can be accessed.</p><p>Without that vital support, I fear that the Executive's proposals for substance-misusing parents to complete the social work and related services' care plans and other extremely worthwhile measures are unlikely to be effective or to achieve the desired end result.</p><p>With that in mind, I hope that the Executive will support the amendment in the name of Annabel Goldie.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361751", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs and Hidden Harm"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The \"Hidden Harm\" report estimates that approximately 50,000 children are affected by substance misuse in Scotland.

Rosemary Byrne is here for the start of the debate but must leave early.</p><p>Strathaven academy action group and the community strongly support South Lanarkshire Council's decision to replace the aging Strathaven academy with a new-build school. However, the current proposal is not the one that the council first mooted and consulted on and the location of the new school was never discussed, which is crucial. Early in 2003, the council stated in its consultative document that it proposed to refurbish and part rebuild the school on the existing site and issued a questionnaire on the proposal to pupils' parents, associate primary schools, church representatives and other stakeholders.</p><p>However, in February 2005 the council decided that Strathaven academy should be completely rebuilt on the existing site and appointed InspirED as the preferred bidder for the project. No opportunity was given to pupils' parents and the community to consider an alternative site or to <place-holder colnum=\"25375\"/> consult on the new proposal. Instead, in March 2005 the council merely held a road show at which parents could comment on plans for the new Strathaven academy, which were made available in the local library. In response to questions, some information was given about the transport arrangements that would be needed because the pupils would have to be decanted to the Ballerup high school site at the Crosshouse campus in East Kilbride. Although the council had no statutory duty formally to consult on the decision to undertake a completely new build of the school, because construction would take place on the existing site, it was high handed and arrogant of the council not to give parents and others the opportunity properly to consider the merits of the decision.</p><p>In August 2005 a planning application for the new Strathaven academy was approved by the council's planning committee, which ignored the fact that the action group had identified an alternative site for the new school. The action group regarded the alternative site as a better option in terms of cost, design and accommodation for staff and pupils. Moreover, sports facilities could be created at the site that would ensure that the Executive's target of two hours of physical education per pupil per week could be met, which the proposal that was approved in August 2005 would not do. Had the alternative site been approved, there would be no need to decant the children, who could continue their education at the existing site until the new school was built and ready for occupation.</p><p>As a result of the council's refusal to consider the alternative site and halt the decision to press ahead with plans to build on the existing site, which were approved before the statutory process of consultation on decant arrangements had been properly carried out, the council is in breach of the Education (Publication and Consultation Etc) (Scotland) Regulations 1981 (SI 1981/1558), which say that parents and other key stakeholders must be consulted about decant arrangements and that consultation</p><p class=\"indent\">\"shall take the form of a notification being issued by an education authority to every parent being a notification in which the authority shall include a statement outlining the proposal\"&#8212;</p><p>or part of the proposal. The regulations go on to say that the authority should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"state an address to which representations ... may be submitted to the authority within ... a period of not less than 28 days from the date upon which the notification is ... deemed to have been received by a parent\".</p><p>From the letter of 27 March 2006 to me from South Lanarkshire Council's chief executive, it is clear that no such consultation took place. I doubt whether the Executive realised that when it <place-holder colnum=\"25376\"/> approved the council's application and I invite the minister to comment on that and to say what can now be done to ensure that the council revisits its decision to approve the new build on the existing site.</p><p>That is no mere technical detail. The disruption that the decant will cause to the education of pupils at the academy and to the excellent after-school activities that are in place, as outlined in the motion, together with the legitimate concerns about transport arrangements and the state of Crosshouse campus, on which asbestos has been found, are germane and crucial to the standard of education that the authority can provide to pupils in Strathaven.</p><p>As such, I ask the minister to take the opportunity to direct South Lanarkshire Council to think again and to go back to the drawing board to ensure that proper consideration is taken of the proposal to build Strathaven academy on an alternative site.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361108", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strathaven Academy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome to the Scottish Parliament members of Strathaven academy action group, who are watching the debate on the monitors.

Even before the ECHR was incorporated into Scots law and before the Scotland Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998 were enacted, Scottish courts had an excellent record on human rights issues. Evidence of that is borne out in the lack of challenges to court decisions on human rights.

The Justice 1 Committee has continued to ask one central question while it has considered the Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill: what, if any, added value will there be in creating the post of a commissioner, with up to two deputes, at the staggering cost of &#163;1 million a year? Having taken evidence from a host of witnesses, the committee is firmly of the opinion that any gap in provision is a narrow one in relation to awareness raising.</p><p>Having identified that gap, the committee deliberated at length on how it could best be resolved. Opinions varied. For my part, I remain firmly of the opinion that the gap would best be met by extending the role of the Scottish public services ombudsman&#8212;a pre-existing statutory body that already deals with alleged breaches of human rights in the delivery of public services. Legislation should be introduced to extend the role of that office holder, who would build on existing experience and take on a promotional role.</p><p>Giving additional powers to a pre-existing body would be more cost-efficient than establishing posts for new office holders and would mean that more funds could be spent on the promotional role and&#8212;more important&#8212;on supporting non-governmental organisations and the voluntary sector, so that they can take up individual cases <place-holder colnum=\"25153\"/> using the expertise and experience that they have gained over a number of years. That is something that the proposed Scottish commission or commissioners for human rights will have no power to do.</p><p>When considering human rights issues, there is frequently no right or wrong answer; in effect, a decision is based on a value judgment. In such instances, elected politicians should make the decision. They can be held accountable by the public; an Executive appointee cannot.</p><p>I want to clarify a point that the minister made, because the same argument applies to the creation of a commission for human rights to provide guidance on the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into Scots law. The idea was first mooted in 1998 and, at the time, enjoyed all-party support. However, we have moved on considerably since then. Seven years later there is no such need. A plethora of commissioners with watching briefs on human rights in their remits has been created; the ECHR has been incorporated directly into Scots law; and a UK commission is now being set up.</p><p>The creation of a commission with up to five commissioners, or a commissioner with up to two deputes, would be a total waste of &#163;1 million a year.

We support both the motion and the amendment because they recognise the importance of having an effective and efficient civil justice system as one of the basic foundations of a peaceful and prosperous society.</p><p>The report by Lord Coulsfield and his advisory group, which was published by the Scottish Consumer Council in response to complaints that the civil justice system was too slow, expensive and complex, noted that a lack of detailed information about how the system operates, costs, who uses the system, disputes relating to the money involved and the duration and outcome of cases makes it difficult to assess the system. Nonetheless, the group identified six main areas, to which the minister referred, that should be reviewed. In particular, it focused on access and on the fact that crippling legal expenses incur disproportionate costs, which makes it totally impractical for individuals to use civil justice to seek redress in cases of relatively low financial value. As the group pointed out, that is because the current civil justice system is based on the time-consuming and costly traditional court-based approach to resolving disputes.</p><p>That being the case, the Scottish Conservatives support the view&#8212;which the minister expressed&#8212;that the courts should be a last resort and that alternative dispute resolution and mediation should be encouraged to attempt to resolve disputes at the earliest possible stage. Where such an approach is not successful or possible, the court procedures must be considered in an effort to ensure that an efficient court system is in place. Such an approach would cut the time that is taken and hence the costs that are involved in resolving disputes. It would also help to address access issues and ensure that the consumer benefits from the review.</p><p>My colleagues will cover in more detail other important aspects of the report and the Executive's response, such as the proposals for <place-holder colnum=\"24861\"/> changes to civil, publicly funded legal assistance and the call to raise the current financial level of small claims, which we certainly support.</p><p>In the time that I have left, I want to mention another aspect of the Scottish civil justice system that the minister mentioned briefly&#8212;domestic arbitration. As the background that I will give suggests, that, too, is in pressing need of reform. From about 1986, a committee was set up by the then Lord Advocate to consider the reform of arbitration in Scotland. The committee recommended adoption of the model for international arbitration, which became part of the law of Scotland by virtue of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990, to which reference has been made. The committee continued to work on the provisions of a modern law on domestic arbitration and, after wide consultation, produced a draft arbitration bill in 1996. Due to the advent of devolution, that bill was not enacted, and no progress has been made since.</p><p>In the meantime, however, many other countries, including England, the Republic of Ireland and major European and Commonwealth countries, have been reforming and restoring their arbitration laws, both international and domestic, to bring them up to date and make them accessible and user friendly. That not only puts Scotland at a disadvantage in comparison with other countries; worse still, it means that Scotland is seen as a legal backwater in that respect. Parties doing business in Scotland are arranging to have their disputes arbitrated elsewhere and under different legal systems.</p><p>Conscious of the difficulty of securing legislative time, the Scottish Council for International Arbitration and the Scottish branch of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators developed a Scottish arbitration code, which was published in 1999. That sought to set out clearly the general framework of arbitration and the rules under which arbitration in Scotland should be conducted. Although the code has been widely welcomed and has been recommended by major institutions for use in arbitration, it is only voluntary and all parties must agree to its adoption. The code cannot deal adequately with many matters that can be dealt with only by statute, and it was regarded by its framers as only a stopgap measure pending the introduction of legislation.</p><p>A committee for those two organisations has continued to work on arbitration, drawing heavily on the work of the previous committee and having regard to legislative changes in many other countries&#8212;in particular, to the Arbitration Act 1996 in England. The result is that a draft bill is now available that seeks to put virtually the whole of Scottish arbitration law into a single statute. The <place-holder colnum=\"24862\"/> draft bill contains all the existing statutory provisions relative to arbitration and restates and improves the existing law, both common and statutory. As part of the review of the civil justice system, I earnestly request that the Executive makes the necessary legislative time available to enact that draft bill so that, for the first time in Scotland, the businessman will have easy access to the whole law relating to arbitration, thus bringing Scotland into line with the rest of western Europe and major commercial countries throughout the rest of the world.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13359878", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Civil Justice Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate.

I am a list MSP for Central Scotland and although I have never been notified of or invited to one of the campaign meetings, I am supportive of the campaign's objective to include in the consultation the option of retaining three A and E departments. I congratulate Carolyn Leckie on securing the debate, the subject of which is immensely important to everyone who lives in Lanarkshire and neighbouring areas and who currently uses the A and E departments at Monklands hospital and Hairmyres hospital.</p><p>As soon as the consultation document, \"A Picture of Health\" was mooted, there was a distinct and unambiguous message from residents of the catchment area for Lanarkshire's three general hospitals: Wishaw general hospital, Monklands hospital and Hairmyres hospital. No one wanted to deprive anyone in the area of full A and E coverage. Therefore, it was expected that the option to retain the A and E departments at all three hospitals would be included in the consultation. Indeed, at a pre-launch briefing on the consultation for list MSPs, which Carolyn Leckie and I attended, that option was still firmly on the table, albeit that the chief executive and other members of Lanarkshire NHS Board said that they did not support the option and favoured <place-holder colnum=\"24276\"/> the retention of A and E departments at two hospitals and a focus on elective care at the third hospital. Their view was predicated on three assertions: first, that it would not be financially viable to retain three A and E departments; secondly, that it would not be possible to staff three A and E departments with the appropriate clinicians; and thirdly, that if only two A and E departments were retained, the board would be able to deliver a better standard of care throughout Lanarkshire.</p><p>I disagreed with those assertions at the time and my view has not changed since then, for the following reasons. First, on finance, Wishaw general hospital has apparently passed the test because maternity services are located at the hospital. Therefore, the hospital is not under threat, which is good. It has been accepted that Hairmyres hospital could attract patients from greater Glasgow, especially now that the M77 extension has opened, which would make that hospital financially viable. Monklands hospital could also attract patients from greater Glasgow if it was refurbished and brought up to standard, so I do not accept that the board members' argument about financial viability has been won in relation to Monklands hospital. Therefore, the argument that it would not be financially viable to retain all three departments does not stack up.</p><p>Secondly, there is plenty of time to plan for the increased number of clinicians that would be needed and to train more medical students. When they finished their training, those people would be attracted to work in improved services.</p><p>The third assertion was that the approach that the board favoured would deliver a better standard of care. I do not accept that. As long as it remains uncertain&#8212;as it does&#8212;how long it will take for a blue-light service to negotiate traffic congestion at peak travel times, either at the Shawhead flyover or on the East Kilbride expressway, if either of the Hairmyres or Monklands A and E units closes and becomes an elective unit, that most decidedly cannot be sold as an option that would deliver a better standard of care.</p><p>Even at this late stage, I call on the minister to add his voice to those of the people of Lanarkshire who want the option of retaining three A and E departments to be included in the consultation and to be fully discussed.

I do so not because I believe that there is anything contentious in the motion or that there is likely to be disagreement on the Justice 1 Committee's findings, but simply because, having visited Brussels with the Justice 1 Committee and having talked to EU officials on a number of occasions, one thing has become abundantly clear: the Scottish Parliament has to be at the very beginning of the decision-making <place-holder colnum=\"24144\"/> process at EU level. Members of the Scottish Parliament need to become involved in the process as soon as a proposal comes forward in Brussels, which is often the first time an item appears on an agenda. I say with some confidence that that is what the Justice 1 Committee did in this case. If we fail to do that, the consequences could be far-reaching. Certainly, a watching brief needs to be kept on the seemingly endless number of proposals that emanate from Brussels. At first, they seem to be for the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, but they go on to become proposals for creeping harmonisation.</p><p>The two green papers that are before us contain proposals to harmonise the laws that apply to divorce and succession and wills. Having taken evidence from the Law Society of Scotland, stakeholders and academics, the Justice 1 Committee was unanimous in its rejection of the terms of the green papers. We rejected the Commission's assertion that there is a demand or need to harmonise the applicable law in those areas. The Commission failed to provide statistical evidence to back up its assertion.</p><p>We believe that existing Scots law is working very well in applying the principle of lex fori, which is that our law is equivalent to the law of other jurisdictions. Harmonisation of the conflict-of-law rules could lead to a number of different possibilities. First, it could lead to other principles being introduced into our courts, the adverse consequence of which would be uncertainty about the law that is to be applied. At the moment, there is no such uncertainty. It could also lead to additional complexity which, in turn, would add to delays and increase costs. Harmonisation would almost certainly move international divorce hearings from the sheriff court to the Court of Session. If that were to happen, it would be contrary to both Scottish and EU efforts to provide wider access to justice.</p><p>The committee had similar reservations about the provisions in the green paper on succession and wills. Under Scots law, the courts apply the law of the deceased's ultimate domicile for moveable property, and the lex situs principle for immoveable property. All the witnesses told us that our present system works extremely well. As Kenny MacAskill said, this area of the law is a growth area, given that Scots and other EU citizens are now buying property abroad and living abroad. However, the rules that we have put in place and the principles that we have adopted are working well. In those circumstances, there is no need for change.</p><p>The green paper proposes a compulsory registration of wills to replace the informal registration that Scots law uses at present, which is not only cost effective but encourages people to <place-holder colnum=\"24145\"/> make a will. I believe that the proposal would have the opposite effect to that which the Commission envisages: it would create a disincentive to people to make a will and would create a situation in which an informal but valid will could be struck down in favour of a registered will that had been made earlier, even though the registered will did not reflect the wishes of the deceased.</p><p>For all the reasons that I have given, the current system is more than adequate, so acceptance of the green papers would be a retrograde step. The Justice 1 Committee nicely summed up the situation when it said in its response to the green papers:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee is opposed in principle to the development of any further Community instruments in the area of family law.

The committee will not be a forum to provide the answers that are desperately required about the past. Until those questions are answered, as Annabel Goldie, Nicola Sturgeon, Colin Fox and just about everyone else has said, the issue will simply not go away. It is too fundamental, and the <place-holder colnum=\"23699\"/> questions that have been raised are too monumental.</p><p>When Jim Wallace first apologised to Shirley McKie in the Parliament in 2000, following the Taylor report, I doubt very much that he realised the full implications of what that meant for both the SCRO and the criminal justice system. An admission of an honest mistake having been made was made by the Lord Advocate on behalf of the Scottish ministers. In the light of that, the McKie family and the SCRO want a public inquiry. Why? With hundreds and hundreds of fingerprints being looked at every day, why was there that one mistake? Even the most casual observer must seek answers to that question. SCRO fingerprint experts maintain that their original verification stands. They want to give evidence on the record in public. To date, there has been no opportunity for them to do so.</p><p>On 9 February, the First Minister said in the Parliament:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"All sides have accepted ... a settlement that I believe is fair and right\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2006-02-09.23255.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 9 February 2006; c 23255.]</citation></p><p>That is not the case. SCRO fingerprint experts had not even been notified of the settlement, nor of the final admission, until after the event. They categorically dispute the First Minister's statement about that.</p><p>The only trial that those fingerprint experts have had to date has been trial by media, as Des McNulty and Ken Macintosh have pointed out. The Minister for Justice has been clear that she does not want a public inquiry. She has been clear about what a public inquiry would not achieve. It could not rule on anyone's civil or criminal liability. It could not rule on whether Shirley McKie's claim against the Scottish ministers would have been successful had she not agreed to settle out of court without an admission of liability. The minister has mentioned other things that a public inquiry could not do, all of which are true.</p><p>What the minister omitted to say, however, was that a public inquiry would establish the facts in an open, transparent and public forum. Crucially, it would provide the SCRO fingerprint experts with the opportunity, for the first time in nine years&#8212;while a huge cloud hangs over their heads and, by extension, over the Scottish criminal justice system&#8212;to put their case, which has never deviated from their original position. A public inquiry would also ensure that evidence could be heard from Peter Swann, who was hired by the McKies, and who was subsequently sacked by them after positively identifying Shirley McKie's fingerprint in the Ross household.</p><p>All that stands in the way of a public inquiry is the Labour-Liberal coalition. A Liberal minister, Jim Wallace, decided that a mistake had been made. <place-holder colnum=\"23700\"/></p><p>Subsequently, the Lord Advocate spoke on behalf of Government ministers in accepting that an honest mistake was made. A Labour Minister for Justice is now denying us a public inquiry. That is totally unsatisfactory. It is damaging to the reputation of both the SCRO fingerprint bureau and the Scottish criminal justice system that the full facts have not been aired in public.

As other members have pointed out, in the limited time that is available for this stage 1 debate, it is only possible to consider the bill's provisions in the broadest terms. The bill's major focus is to increase police effectiveness and to improve community safety. I will highlight a number of welcome provisions.</p><p>Part 1, on the police, includes a duty to be conferred on the new Scottish police services authority to develop and provide a national <place-holder colnum=\"23080\"/> forensic science service. There is no doubt that the pooling of the frequently overstretched regional forensic resources into one forensic science service that will operate at national level will go some considerable way towards eliminating the delays in court proceedings that have been a direct consequence of the necessary forensic evidence not being available on time, when it is required. It is that pooling of resources, together with the desire for a more effective and efficient use of common police services, that is behind the proposal to create the SPSA.</p><p>Also to be welcomed is the provision in part 1 to establish a police complaints commissioner to oversee non-criminal complaints against the police. The Conservatives have advocated having such a post for some time. That should bring the necessary transparency to the complaints procedure. I look forward, first, to the Executive's response on the need to ensure that the police complaints commissioner has sufficient powers and, secondly, to getting details about the complaints commissioner's interaction with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, which will continue to investigate criminal allegations against the police.</p><p>Part 2 is on public order. Measures that should go some way towards improving community safety and police effectiveness include the introduction of football banning orders; the powers of search and arrest in relation to some offences involving fireworks, whose misuse blights communities; and the processions provisions, which seek to strike a balance between the right of a community to be free of disruption and the rights of those who wish to march.</p><p>Part 3 is on criminal justice. The provisions on offensive weapons and the doubling of the maximum sentence length for possession of a knife are very much needed, given the vicious and escalating incidence of knife crime, which Kenneth Macintosh illustrated poignantly. Given that the sentencing provision will not apply to summary charges&#8212;notwithstanding the amendment that Stewart Maxwell proposes&#8212;and given that the proportion of knife crime charges that are proceeded with on indictment is small, it is to be hoped that the minister will take on board the committee's recommendation and the plea from Bill Butler that current practices should be reviewed to encourage more cases to be taken on indictment.</p><p>The provisions in part 3 to provide the police with powers to require a suspect to divulge their date and place of birth will aid identification on the criminal record system and are sensible, as are the provisions on mandatory drug testing and assessment, which will give the police powers to direct some accused persons to early treatment.<place-holder colnum=\"23081\"/></p><p>Although the proposal to give police the power to take advantage of the new technology that allows fingerprints to be taken outwith a police station is welcome, the concerns that have been expressed about retention timescales will require to be addressed at stage 2, to ensure clarity about when those fingerprints will be deleted.</p><p>The success of many of the provisions will depend on their being properly funded and resourced. The Finance Committee's observation, to which Alasdair Morgan referred, that a number of the costs that are associated with policing will not be specifically funded, but will be expected to be met from existing police resources or to be offset against assumed time savings, requires to be scrutinised more fully at stage 2. The funding issue is a crucial part of the bill.</p><p>As Annabel Goldie and Jeremy Purvis said, other technical issues relate to the provision of statutory incentives for supplying evidence for use against others and the impact on the number of pleas in bar of trial that can be taken under Scots law. How the proposals in the bill interact with the common-law pleas in bar should be clarified at stage 2.</p><p>On that basis, the Conservatives are happy to support the bill's general principles. Like other members, I look forward to seeing the management of sex offenders measures and the better inshore fishing regulations that will be produced at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13355547", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill is diverse and wide ranging.

Its provisions have the potential to affect almost everyone in Scotland because it covers such a wide range of relationships. It addresses a huge number of complex issues. I pay tribute to the convener of the Justice 1 Committee, Pauline McNeill; to the committee's adviser, Professor Norrie; to the committee clerks; and to the Scottish Parliament information centre advisers. They have all done an outstanding job in supporting the committee in its deliberations.</p><p>I had better take this opportunity to set the record straight in relation to Christine Grahame's contribution this morning. I assure the chamber that I was not divorced when I woke up this morning and, despite the Parliament having reduced the separation times for divorce, I will not be divorced when I go home this evening&#8212;a fact that will, no doubt, elicit mixed emotions from my husband.</p><p>On a more serious note, I am disappointed that the compromise separation times of 18 months and three years were not agreed to. In the absence of any hard, empirical evidence, I hoped that members would agree that those times were a reasonable compromise. I now seek an assurance that the Executive will take steps to record statistics on the effects of both the current separation times and the new separation times. That information was not available to the committee when it scrutinised the bill, but I hope that it will be available when the Parliament reviews the bill.</p><p>I do not have enough time to cover all the provisions in the bill but I will make some comments on marriage. I support the various comments that were made during the day on the need to recognise the special status of marriage. Marriage has a special status in society because it is a legal and public lifelong commitment by a man and a woman to spend a shared life together to the exclusion of all others&#8212;to quote the Christian definition. As such, it is the most stable relationship and it provides the best framework within which children can be brought up.</p><p>Having said that, I fully take on board Susan Deacon's comments. I recognise that, for some cohabiting couples, the commitment will be a lifelong one, but the fact is that cohabitation remains an open-ended relationship. That is why marriage automatically attracts rights that are not available to cohabitants. It is regrettable that Patrick Harvie, who I am sure considers himself always to be fair minded, has doggedly refused to accept that fact.<place-holder colnum=\"21946\"/></p><p>Without doubt, some provisions in the bill will not only clarify the law but&#8212;importantly&#8212;address gaps or unintended consequences left by previous legislation.

It is worrying and frankly unacceptable that it was only after the act was passed that it was discovered that special measures involving a commissioner taking evidence from certain witnesses might not be covered by the special protections that are provided for under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.

The 16 days of activism campaign that is referred to in the motion has been used as an organising strategy by individuals and groups around the world to call for the elimination of violence against women. The campaign runs from <place-holder colnum=\"21489\"/> 25 November to 10 December, which is human rights day. Among other things, it seeks to establish a clear link between local and international work to end violence against women and it provides a forum in which organisers can develop and share new and effective strategies.</p><p>Disturbingly, despite all efforts to raise awareness about violence against women, statistics clearly indicate an increasing trend in incidents of repeat domestic abuse victimisation. Data from January to December 2004 revealed 43,678 incidents of domestic abuse, of which a staggering 52 per cent involved repeat victims who were trapped in abusive circumstances. It appears that, despite best efforts, domestic abuse and violence against women is not only always with us but, more alarming, it is a growth industry. The issue is hugely complex and takes up vast amounts of police time. It is a problem that thrives on fear and secrecy, which is why the raising of awareness and strategies involving multi-agency work are so important in providing a framework to attempt to eliminate violence against women.</p><p>I wish to concentrate my remarks on a particular aspect of violence against women, namely domestic abuse and children. The report of the child protection audit and review, \"It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright\", highlighted the fact that the general public trust voluntary organisations, which are in turn able to act as a bridge to families and statutory organisations. Crucially, the report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Agencies and professionals need to ... recognise that protecting the mother may be the best way to protect the children\"</p><p>and that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Providing for the needs of children living in households with domestic abuse should be a priority for inter-agency planning\".</p><p>The voluntary sector has a pivotal role to play in the attempt to eliminate violence against women. It has the advantage of being removed from and unconnected to statutory agencies, including local authorities, which for various reasons the public may be reluctant to approach. Too often, women and children who are subjected to domestic abuse find themselves with no option other than to flee the family home to escape violence. That brings me to the Conservatives' amendment, which seeks to emphasise that research confirms that the best outcome for women and children who are victims of domestic violence is when they can remain safely within their own home and community, with the continuity of support from family and friends.</p><p>The Executive has done much to ensure that that objective is achieved, but I turn the minister's attention to considering the enforcement of <place-holder colnum=\"21490\"/> tenancy agreements to ensure that they are not being breached by an abusive partner being allowed to move in or to come and go when he has no right to do so. Better regulation and enforcement of the terms of tenancy agreements could provide many victims and children with more protection and allow them to stay in the family home.</p><p>Finally, I earnestly request that the Executive reconsider its policy on automatic early release, which serves merely to shorten an unacceptable time for respite that victims have from jailed and violent partners, and which leaves those victims unnecessarily vulnerable. The Conservatives will support the motion and the SNP amendment.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-3670.1, to insert after \"Rape Crisis Specific Fund;\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recognises the expertise and contribution the voluntary sector can provide in dealing with domestic abuse; acknowledges that usually the best outcome for women and children is one where they can remain in the family home;\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13351496", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "An issue such as violence against women not only transcends party politics but unites individuals and groups around the world in a common purpose, namely the elimination of all forms of violence against women.

As the old BBC test card used to say, this was due to circumstances beyond her control.</p><p>I add my congratulations to the clerks and members of the Justice 2 Committee for undertaking such an important inquiry into, and subsequently producing its report on, youth justice. I also commend the Executive for setting aside time this morning for a proper debate on the committee's findings.</p><p>When youth justice is discussed, a common theme runs through members' contributions&#8212;namely that early intervention is the key both to reducing reoffending and to the delivery of an effective youth justice system.</p><p>The Justice 2 Committee's report highlights the considerable challenges to be overcome in delivering those objectives. They include filling the gaps in service provision and the requirement for a clear understanding of what partnership working and best practice entail. In particular, the committee expressed reservations about whether the concept of corporate responsibility exists in local authorities. I am sad to say that the problem is not a new one. For too long, Scottish local authorities have been signed up to the theory of corporate responsibility without delivering in practice. Such a prerequisite is fundamental to ensuring that youth justice services are delivered in the best and most efficient way.</p><p>The report also emphasises not just the importance but the necessity of ensuring that each youth justice strategy group recognises the contribution that the voluntary sector can make <place-holder colnum=\"19604\"/> and that, where appropriate, the groups actively seek to involve the sector in the delivery of youth justice services. In that respect, the committee expressed profound concerns about the stability and continuity of funding. There is little doubt that the voluntary sector has the experience, expertise, flexibility and innovative thinking that will help to deliver the multi-agency approach to which Susan Deacon alluded and which is so necessary to the delivery of youth justice services. Indeed, projects set up by voluntary services and organisations such as the Barnardo's project in Falkirk, which is aimed at reducing youth reoffending, have been a huge success and speak for themselves. I urge the minister to bear those points in mind in making funding decisions and to ensure that the voluntary sector is properly provided for. Funds should not be simply allocated automatically to local authorities in preference to voluntary sector organisations.</p><p>The report highlights gaps in the provision of addiction services at a time when the problems of binge drinking dominate press and media coverage. Such an omission is worrying. The committee was also concerned about the variation in the provision of services for young people with substance misuse problems and about gaps in the provision of services for young people with learning difficulties and/or behavioural disorders.</p><p>Various worthwhile suggestions have been made about the best way of addressing such concerns. I add to that list by suggesting to the minister that he extend supervised attendance orders so that the modules, which include alcohol and substance abuse counselling and literacy and numeracy testing, are available not only to fine defaulters but as a disposal of first instance for young offenders appearing at court or at a children's hearing. Such a simple early-intervention measure would have a significant impact on youth offending and on the delivery of a more effective and efficient youth justice system.</p><p>I echo Kenny MacAskill's plea for an increase in the number of secure places for young offenders and, again, make the case that drug and testing treatment orders should be available to the district courts and the children's hearings system.</p><p>I also press the minister to revisit the issue of youth courts and ensure that 14 and 15-year-old persistent offenders who are currently languishing in the children's hearing system are referred to them.

As deputy convener of the cross-party group on survivors of childhood sexual abuse, I know how much hard work Marilyn and the members of the group have put into addressing the enormity of the challenge of trying <place-holder colnum=\"19492\"/> to meet the needs of survivors.</p><p>The motion gives a clear indication of just how much has been achieved since the short-life working group on care needs for survivors of CSA was set up in 2003 by the then Minister for Health and Community Care, Malcolm Chisholm. Those achievements include: the Scottish Executive's future strategic action plan; the creation of a reference group, which includes survivors and cross-party members; the establishment of the &#163;2 million survivors fund to pump-prime activity; the commissioning of NHS Education for Scotland to undertake self-help training and public awareness training; and, crucially, the appointment of a legal professional to assist in implementation of the strategy following the short-life working group's report.</p><p>I pay particular tribute to the Minister for Health and Community Care, Andy Kerr, who, following the moving debate on child abuse last December, met adult survivors of CSA at the cross-party group to listen to concerns and to discuss a possible way forward.</p><p>Three key issues were discussed at that meeting. First, it was made clear that adult survivors of CSA were, sadly, not a new population that once identified will impact on health and other social care services. They are already in the system, but for the most part they are not recognised as survivors. Instead, they are to be found among other specific groups including substance abusers, homeless people and psychiatric patients. Secondly, it was recognised that there was no clear mechanism or responsibility for identifying and supporting adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse, either in the health service or in other public services. Thirdly, it was recognised that the voluntary sector has considerable expertise in helping adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse and in substantial data collection.</p><p>In response to those points, and in recognition of the fact that it is a cross-cutting issue, it is greatly to the minister's credit that he was prepared to appoint a lead professional to co-ordinate and maintain meaningful dialogue with the various departments and personnel&#8212;health, education, social services and so on&#8212;who have a part to play in delivering the Executive's strategy. Without that action from the minister, there is little doubt that the considerable achievements that are listed in the motion would not have been possible.</p><p>For too long, we have been treating the symptoms of childhood sexual abuse&#8212;attempted suicide, self-harm and drug abuse&#8212;rather than addressing the cause. I am confident that the strategy that has been outlined, with its emphasis on training professionals, early identification of survivors and promotion of greater awareness of <place-holder colnum=\"19493\"/> the prevalence of CSA, will make a positive and significant difference to all those who are involved with this complex and vexing issue.</p><p>There is one final plea that I would make to the minister; namely, that in determining bids to be met from the survivors fund for the demonstration projects, the voluntary sector, with all its expertise and experience in dealing with survivors of childhood sexual abuse is not sidelined. There is little doubt that, as non-statutory bodies, voluntary sector organisations attract and encourage people of all ages and from all walks of life to take the first tentative steps towards confronting their past experience, secure in the knowledge that there will be no official record of what is discussed. When determining bids and when allocating funding generally, I urge the minister to keep that in mind.</p><p>Finally, Presiding Officer, I have been asked by the convener of the cross-party group to remind members that we will be meeting after the debate in committee room 3.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13346232", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to support and speak to Marilyn Livingstone's motion and I congratulate her on securing the debate.

Despite the fact that the decision could have been avoided had the Scottish Executive not left itself wide open to a claim by incorporating the convention directly into Scots law without sufficient regard for the consequences and by diverting to other projects funds that were set aside for the express purpose of dealing with slopping out, it is nonetheless the case that, as a result of its application in this case, the ECHR has changed from being a mechanism to protect individual rights from being abused into a compensation scheme for crooks and criminals.

The six years are significant, as they reflect the enormous complexities that surround family law, which has the potential to affect virtually everyone in Scotland. The bill covers a wide range of relationships&#8212;marriage, cohabitation, separation and divorce&#8212;and all the complicated issues that flow from them, which in turn have the potential to impact on different aspects of Scots law. The bill also confers parental responsibilities and rights on unmarried fathers on joint registration of a birth. That gives some insight into the enormity of the issues that are contained in the provisions of the bill. I put on record my thanks to the Justice 1 Committee's family law adviser, Professor Norrie, for his expert advice, thoroughness and infinite patience in analysing and explaining the potential consequences of what were often oversights and in some cases instances of misinformation in the draft proposals.</p><p>Relationships are rarely straightforward, a fact that was spelled out in triplicate during the committee's consideration of the provisions of the bill at stage 1. Quite simply, that process generated more questions than answers. That brings me to a fundamental point which, if the minister and the Executive take nothing else from today's debate, I hope that they will at least reflect on and take to heart for consideration of the bill at stages 2 and 3. I am talking about the totally inadequate timetable that was set for taking evidence from a host of interested parties and subsequently compiling the stage 1 report. As Stewart Stevenson confirmed, the inflexibility and rigidity of the time allocated to the bill have put the convener, committee clerks and committee members under huge and unjustifiable pressure, and have resulted in, for example, vital decisions being taken in a few brief minutes snatched from an already overcommitted lunch time. We may be a young Parliament, with much to learn, but surely the Scottish Executive and the business managers must realise that that is no way for Scotland's legislators to do business. Common sense dictates that the overwhelming priority must be to get legislation right rather than to ensure that rigid and arbitrary timetables are strictly adhered to.</p><p>On the policy intent and content of the bill, there are three key principles on which the reforms in the bill are founded: safeguarding the best interests of children; promoting and supporting stable families; and updating the law to reflect the reality of family life in Scotland. It is encouraging to see those principles reflected in the non-legislative proposals for the parenting agreement and the charter for grandchildren&#8212;documents that advocate a realistic and flexible child-focused approach, which seeks to encourage parents to <place-holder colnum=\"19122\"/> co-operate to try to ensure that children of divorced or separated couples experience quality contact time with both parents and with the wider family.</p><p>Equally, however, there are proposals for which little or no evidence is available from the Executive to support the assertion that the reforms will safeguard the interests of children and support stable families. Specifically, those include the proposal to reform the forbidden degrees of marriage, to remove the barrier to marriage between individuals and their former in-laws; the proposal to reduce the period of separation prior to divorce from two years to one year for non-contested cases and from five years to two years for contested cases; and the proposal to provide new legal safeguards for cohabiting couples and their children, which the minister has confirmed affects the law of succession and could have an adverse effect on the legal rights of children in the event of a claim on the estate by a surviving cohabitant when a partner dies intestate.</p><p>Furthermore, while the committee has been clear that the reforms in the bill must not undermine the status of marriage, there is real concern that the proposals are heavily weighted in favour of mediation and hence seem to accept the inevitability of separation leading to divorce rather than to promote couple counselling and reconciliation in an effort to save the marriage.</p><p>Despite the Executive having the summer months to respond to the very real concerns that were expressed in the Justice 1 Committee's stage 1 report, fundamental questions remain unanswered. For all the reasons that I have just outlined, not least the totally inadequate time that was allocated to consideration of the bill, the Conservative group will abstain in the vote to approve the Family Law (Scotland) Bill at stage 1.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13345311", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Family Law (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to the chamber for not being here at the beginning of the minister's speech.

That point is starkly highlighted by the incidence of knife crime, which has reached epidemic proportions in Central Scotland alone. The following headlines represent a flavour of what has been going on in the real world while the Scottish Parliament has been in recess. In July, we read: \"Late night taxi driver robbed by gang of knife thugs\". Another headline was: \"Girl, 13, watches in horror as dad is knifed by thugs\". In August, there was the following report: \"Knife victim fighting for life after brutal attack\". The victim had been stabbed repeatedly in an incident that took place near his home. In September, the headline appeared: \"Police renew appeal: Who saw this vicious knife attack on boy?\" The boy had been left for dead in a pool of blood, with a 6in wound to his neck. Last week, a teenager appeared in court after a knife attack that left a 16-year-old boy with serious lacerations to his face and neck.</p><p>Although I commend the Executive for recognising and singling out knife crime as an issue that must be tackled, the proposed penalty for possession is woefully inadequate and will do little to end the spiral of vicious and brutal attacks, the number of which is continuing to increase. With automatic early release, a sentence of four years becomes one of two years. There is also the option of further time off under the home detention scheme. I call on the minister to think again and either to end automatic early release for possession or to impose a sentence that ensures that there is a realistic prospect of anyone who is found in possession of a knife serving four years in prison. There is no doubt that those who commit such crimes are deterred from doing so by the fear of being caught, coupled with the certainty thereafter of a stiff and prohibitive sentence. This morning, the First Minister stated that he wanted to re-establish respect and confidence in the law. Tackling knife crime by ensuring that four years means four years would be a promising start.</p><p>I call on the minister to consider introducing another measure that has not been mentioned today. We should ensure that the Scottish intelligence database, to which every police force in Scotland has been signed up since February, is linked to the violent and sex offenders register as soon as possible. It is essential that, in attempting to detect and deter sexual offences, the police have every possible resource at their disposal. I believe that linking SID and VISOR would provide an answer to much of the debate about an interim sex offenders register. Such a register would not be necessary if that simple and easily taken measure were put in place.

That point was well made by John Swinney. Legal advice can come from advice agencies or public bodies such as local authorities or voluntary sector organisations on the basis that the majority of those organisations receive some public funding.</p><p>I am pleased that the Executive recognises that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"funding arrangements for voluntary sector provision are often described by service providers as insecure, thus threatening continuity and development of services\"</p><p>That view was echoed by Kenny Macintosh and Donald Gorrie. It is certainly my experience in Central Scotland and the experience of others throughout Scotland that voluntary organisations often have to compete with local authority projects in a potential conflict of interest.

In both those cases, the ground was gifted to local communities for the common good. How would the proposed arrangements ensure a level playing field in legal representation to redress the injustice whereby the local authorities have used taxpayers' money to employ Queen's counsel to represent them in the Court of Session, where they applied for the waiving of the provision against the granting of planning permission in those parks?</p><p>Those important points&#8212;like a number of those that were mentioned by Patrick Harvie&#8212;require to be considered, given what the minister said about accessibility being a fundamental issue in the consultation. Indeed, fairness is one of the main criteria that are mentioned in the consultation, which seeks to ensure that any strategy that is decided on is fair to the vulnerable, to hard-working people and to communities.</p><p>I regret that I do not have time to consider other aspects of the consultation in more detail, but I urge the minister to consider extending the pilot project to which both Jackie Baillie and Donald Gorrie referred, which was started in 2002. The project is delivered by CAS, but it involves the Scottish Legal Aid Board providing the funding for an Inverness-based solicitor to work with citizens advice bureaux in 13 locations in the Highlands and Islands. According to the Deputy Minister for Justice, the project has worked well, so I believe that it could be rolled out throughout Scotland without the need for further consultation.</p><p>In conclusion, on the second part of the consultation, I welcome any measures that strive to deliver increased consistency and transparency in the funding arrangements for criminal PFLA. As Annabel Goldie indicated, we will not support the SNP amendment. I fully recognise that the amendment is well intentioned, but it would not be in the interests of justice, as setting up a commission to consider PFLA generally would lead merely to an unacceptable delay in the introduction of the necessary reforms. Those <place-holder colnum=\"18354\"/> reforms must be put in place as soon as possible to increase access and to ensure that the system of legal aid and advice is fair to all.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13343492", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Aid Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I am aware that the consultation is divided into two parts, I intend to concentrate on civil matters.

All the legislation that the Executive is introducing is useless without proper enforcement. Taking up Donald Gorrie's point about good practice, I think that the Executive has the remedy in its own hands. It need look no further than the Broomhouse experience in Edinburgh, to which Annabel Goldie referred. The police had an almost constant presence, working shifts and changing duty several times over a six-month period. That meant that troublemakers knew that the police would not be disappearing for long periods of time, and the results were impressive. Car crime fell by 80 per cent. Complaints against youths dropped by 62 per cent. In all that time there were no arrests. The presence of police on the beat provided an immediate and effective response to the problem of crime and antisocial behaviour. What is more, by the police acting as a deterrent rather than responding to an incident after the event, the quality of life in that local community was dramatically altered for the better, and the cost of expensive court cases, prison and probation was saved.</p><p>That is why I whole-heartedly support the amendment in Annabel Goldie's name and challenge the minister to tell us why he is not putting more money into providing more police officers, together with more police time, on streets throughout Scotland, when that is evidently the most effective and cost-effective way to address antisocial behaviour.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341191", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Antisocial Behaviour"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Not at the moment.

It came up with the crucial recognition that rehabilitation is a process, not an event. Today's debate is too short to cover all the important points that are raised in the report, but the following are those that I believe to be the most important.</p><p>Significantly, the report challenges and disputes the commonly held view that nothing can be done with short-term offenders. In fact, the opposite was found to be true. We need to concentrate more on short-term prisoners. In the first instance, we need to sort out the definition of \"short term\", which can range from six weeks to four years. The committee's recommendation that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"consideration should be given to defining new categories of prisoner in terms of length of sentence\"<place-holder colnum=\"16725\"/></p><p>is, therefore, sensible. Unfortunately, the Scottish Prison Service is still vague in its response to that proposal.</p><p>Even in a short-term prison sentence of six weeks to three months, core issues such as basic literacy and numeracy levels can be examined. The statistics on literacy and numeracy among prisoners are alarming, and the committee rightly expressed its concern about the impact that illiteracy and innumeracy are having on rehabilitation. I very much welcome the Scottish Prison Service's commitment to screening all prisoners at induction, but there is still a lack of clarity regarding what is proposed thereafter.</p><p>Another key issue is continuity, which is essential to successful rehabilitation. When a prisoner reoffends, information concerning their previous prison experience and any community rehabilitation programmes that they were involved in should be recorded and accessible. It should not be the case that they must start all over again. Flowing from the continuity issue is the issue of resources. Too often, rehabilitation programmes and real work experience are denied to prisoners because of staff shortages: that is not good enough. If the Executive is serious about tackling reoffending, it must ensure that there are sufficient resources to ensure that prisons are adequately staffed and that contingency plans are in place to cover the inevitable staff absences. Real work experience is essential to the rehabilitation process, especially as many prisoners have never worked. The opportunity to learn real skills and to experience the discipline of work could greatly improve their chances of successful reintegration into society.</p><p>Finally, I welcome the recognition in the report that the support of families&#8212;or, where that is not appropriate, the support of a meaningful person&#8212;can make a significant contribution to sentence management within prisons and successful reintegration thereafter.</p><p>It must be stressed that working towards successful rehabilitation of prisoners will require adequate resources, especially in terms of prison staff numbers, and a radical rethink of what can be achieved in so-called short-term sentences. Those could lead to huge benefits both for the prisoners and, as a consequence, for the public in terms of reoffending rates.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13339579", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation in Prisons"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although we have only a short time, I welcome this opportunity for members to debate this important issue.

Rather, we have to focus on the fact that a large proportion of the female prison population should not be there. More worrying still, a Scottish Executive report of last year in which bail and custody trends were analysed suggested that male offenders were more likely to be jailed for crimes of violence and dishonesty, whereas female offenders were more often remanded on lesser charges such as shoplifting and other thefts. If this debate does nothing else but highlight and redress that injustice, it will have achieved some positive effect.</p><p>I hope that we can also put the spotlight on the number of women who are sentenced for defaulting on fines. We should encourage the use of civil diligence to recover those fines directly from the salaries and benefits of wilful fine defaulters&#8212;such as Carolyn Leckie&#8212;who can pay but won't pay and who abuse the criminal justice system at taxpayers' expense merely to grandstand and attract publicity.</p><p>For the other categories of fine defaulters who have financial difficulties, resources must be put in place to help them with money management.

Her response was that the information was available and that she declined to act. She missed the point. Our amendment is intended to highlight the fact that early intervention is crucial. In the same way, it is absolutely essential that adults and their families know how and where to access such information quickly and at short notice, so that they can seize the moment.</p><p>My challenge to the minister is to ensure that this debate is not just about warm words and good intentions.

I warmly welcome the principles of the bill, which is divided into three distinct elements.</p><p>Section 1 creates a new offence of meeting or travelling to meet a child with the intention of committing a criminal offence. Its introduction fills a crucial gap in Scots law, in that it covers the act of grooming with the intention to meet a child for an illegal sexual purpose that is not covered by either lewd, indecent and libidinous practice or fraud. I have argued for that measure for a long time and therefore very much welcome the fact that the Executive has changed its position and taken the decision to introduce the measures in section 1, despite having earlier deemed them unnecessary. I consider that to be a sign not of weakness, but of strength; it is indicative of a legislature that is growing in maturity, which can only be good for devolution.</p><p>However, although section 1 will raise awareness of the disturbing problem of sexual grooming as well as sending out a strong message that that kind of behaviour will not be tolerated&#8212;the value of those actions should not be underestimated&#8212;the section does not criminalise grooming per se, so it may not result in the prosecution of many of those who present a serious threat to our children. The prevalence of the threat is not in doubt, as the evidence of <place-holder colnum=\"15549\"/> Rachel O'Connell and the national hi-tech crime unit all too alarmingly testified. In order that our children have every possible protection, I urge the minister to consider again the committee's recommendation that an offence of breach of the peace be included in the schedule. That would allow charges to be brought against a person who grooms a child via the internet when the communication is clearly of a sexual and inappropriate nature. Crucially, it would eliminate the necessity to prove that the person was travelling with intent to meet their victim.</p><p>I urge the minister to revisit other issues. First, on the requirement to have communicated on at least two occasions, evidence from the Law Society of Scotland, ACPOS and others points out that grooming could occur during one session. Secondly, on the onus of proof in respect of reasonable belief, I ask the minister to clarify whether she favours the onus of proof lying with the Crown or, as the committee favours, with the accused.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the minister has indicated that she will re-examine the issue of the offender's age. The majority of those who gave evidence favoured 16 as the minimum age for the offender. That was the position in my proposal for a member's bill, but, having listened to the evidence and arguments in favour of not specifying an age limit, I have been persuaded that that would be preferable, as it would cover the situation in which, for example, a 15-year-old groomed a 10 or 12-year-old.</p><p>Section 2 will introduce risk of sexual harm orders, the implementation of which will involve complex legal issues. The minister has addressed some of those issues, but I invite her to reconsider the following points. First, the standard of proof that will be required for an RSHO is the civil standard&#8212;that is, the balance of probabilities&#8212;as opposed to the higher criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. The rationale that lies behind that measure is, I believe, that the higher standard is used only with criminal offences, or when the accused might directly lose their liberty. However, that does not take into account the fact that a breach of the RSHO will lead to a loss of liberty as part of the process. In the light of the Constanda case, I urge the minister to reconsider that issue.</p><p>Secondly, I ask the minister to consider the test for interim RSHOs, which, given the potential consequences of such an order's imposition, should be the same as the test for full orders&#8212;an interim order should be given on the basis of necessity and not on the basis of the lesser test of its being just so to do. Thirdly, I would welcome clarification of exactly when and where RSHOs would be used. For example, I seek confirmation that they might be used following a not guilty or <place-holder colnum=\"15550\"/> not proven verdict, as was suggested in evidence to the committee. Last, I would like more information about how the orders will be monitored.</p><p>There is limited time available, which is regrettable; as a result, it is not possible for me to cover the many issues that I would have liked to highlight, including those surrounding disclosure, admissibility of evidence and stigma. I will say merely that the bill has many worthwhile aspects, which have the potential to make a difference to the protection of children.

I am only too well aware that it was not an easy journey for them to get here. It is an indication of the strength of their feeling that deafblindness be recognised as a distinct disability that they were prepared to use part of their precious allocation of guide-communicator time to come and listen to the debate. I am indebted to the Scottish Parliament's visitor and outreach services and corporate policy unit for their assistance with the interpreters, the seating arrangements and looking after the guide dogs. I am also extremely grateful to the 59 MSP colleagues from all parties who signed the motion.</p><p>Last year, the European Parliament issued a declaration that recognised deafblindness as a distinct disability and called on the institutions of the European Union and its member states to recognise and implement the rights of people who are deafblind, including the right to receive one-to-one support, where that is appropriate. In England and Wales, the European Parliament was preaching to the converted; guidance that was designed to address the needs of deafblind people was issued there four years ago in 2001, under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970.</p><p>That guidance contains important provisions. One crucial measure is that every local authority must identify the deafblind people in its area, which is important because many people are already deaf or blind and their hearing or sight is deteriorating. Early identification is vital and can <place-holder colnum=\"15158\"/> make a huge difference to the quality of life that they can expect in the future. The guidance also requires local authorities to keep a record of all deafblind people, who will then be properly assessed and given access to skilled and trained communicators. That is the provision that we seek for deafblind people in Scotland.</p><p>However, I understand that despite lobbying for deafblindness to be recognised as a distinct disability from as far back as 1988, and despite the work of organisations such as the Royal National Institute of the Blind, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, Deafblind UK and Sense International, the Executive has not implemented the equivalent of section 7 guidance and such guidance would be implemented only if the Scottish Executive's action plan for all people who have a sensory impairment was fully in place and could be seen not to work for deafblind people.</p><p>The point is that deafblindness is not just another sensory impairment; it is a distinct disability that requires specialised services. For example, guide dogs for the deafblind are being given specific training as hearing dogs and dogs for the blind. Furthermore, delays mean that the action plan is not expected to take effect until 2006; it will thereafter be several years at least before it can be evaluated. That simply is not good enough. Action is required now to ensure that deafblind people in Scotland have access to the same level of service as those elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Without that level of service, the sense of isolation that a deafblind person experiences and the obstacles to everyday communication and access to services that they face will persist.</p><p>That was brought home to me by Drena O'Malley of Deafblind Scotland. I pay tribute to the work that she has done persistently for the deafblind over many years. She has worked tirelessly for deafblindness to be recognised as a disability in its own right and, more recently, for similar provisions to those under section 7 of the 1970 act to be implemented in Scotland. She told me of one elderly deafblind lady who was terminally ill in hospital and whose isolation can only be imagined. Neither her family nor the hospital staff could communicate with her, nor could she communicate with them, so she had no way of knowing why she was in hospital or what was wrong with her. With the assistance of Deafblind Scotland, a trained guide-communicator was able to communicate with her, which made an enormous difference to the final days of her life. If provisions similar to section 7 of the 1970 act were implemented, that gap in provision would not exist.</p><p>I put it to the minister that it is impossible to quantify at any level the value of an experience like that. To put it simply, here and now&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"15159\"/> coincidentally, on the fourth anniversary of the introduction of the section 7 guidance south of the border&#8212;the minister has the power to make a difference to the lives of not only those deafblind people who are listening to the debate, but the thousands of others throughout Scotland, many of whom are as yet unidentified.

On one side of the justice scales, police campaigns and enforcement initiatives have a direct impact on the workload of the service. On the other side, the increase in violent and serious crime since 1997 has reverberated through the service like a shock wave, causing strain in a service that was already under pressure.</p><p>It is therefore not surprising that during the past four years the COPFS has come under the microscope and has been the subject of, or an integral part of, a number of inquiries and reviews that have been aimed at improving the delivery of justice in Scotland. The reviews do not make happy reading. In early 2002, the Pryce-Dyer review of planning, allocation and management of resources in the COPFS stated that the service had poor internal and external communications and was seriously under-resourced. The COPFS revealed that, according to an internal audit:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The pressures on the Department have ... had a serious impact on the morale of staff and left them feeling 'stressed and undervalued'.\"</p><p>Kenny MacAskill, Marilyn Livingstone and others raised that issue.</p><p>In January 2003, the Justice 2 Committee of the first session of Parliament published a report on its inquiry into the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, which referred to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"unmanageable caseloads for both procurators fiscal and advocate deputes, with inadequate preparation time and routine late evening or weekend working\".</p><p>In response, the Lord Advocate acknowledged to the committee that the service had been \"chronically underfunded\" for years. We must ask <place-holder colnum=\"14483\"/> whether anything has changed. Much has been made of increased funding and although I welcome the new funding arrangements for the three years from 2003-04, I note that the Justice 2 Committee's report said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We acknowledge the significant resource increases now being made but note that neither the Committee, nor the Department, have the necessary information to say whether these increases are enough ... We remain concerned about the real impact of the staff increases being made and how these translate into staff resource for frontline duties ... We would be particularly concerned if too much of the additional resource went on additional managers and management systems\".</p><p>In other words, there is concern that the response to the Pryce-Dyer review has resulted in what my colleague Bill Aitken has described as top-heavy management structures and systems, at the expense of the targeting of additional resources at increasing the number of procurators fiscal as a priority. Those concerns were fuelled by the evidence of the Faculty of Advocates to the Justice 1 Committee last year during scrutiny of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, when the picture that emerged was of a COPFS in chaos. The committee was told that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"on numerous occasions when the defence approaches the Crown Office to speak to an advocate depute about a trial that is coming up, they are told, 'I only just got the papers today and I have not read them.' ...They might be sent the papers for 10 trials that are scheduled for a sitting and they cannot read them\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice 1 Committee</em>, 7 January 2004; c 395.]</p><p>Therefore, as Colin Fox said, it does not look as if much has changed since the Pryce-Dyer review or the previous Justice 2 Committee's inquiry report.</p><p>As Stewart Maxwell and Annabel Goldie pointed out, there is as yet no real evidence that the reforms in the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004 have resulted in improvements. If the COPFS is to be improved and is to provide the best possible service, those and other issues must be addressed. For example, continuity must be achieved in as many cases as possible and we must tackle the delays that arise when forensic reports that the Crown has commissioned are not available in time. Those issues are not technical, but are simply a matter of resources.</p><p>Quite simply, we need more procurators fiscal as well as weekend and evening court sittings to tackle the backlog of cases and to reduce the pressure on the COPFS in order that we can keep to an absolute minimum the consequent delays in trials and the number of cases that are marked \"no proceedings\". Those outcomes seriously undermine confidence in our criminal justice system.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13333679", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I acknowledge the sincerity of the Lord Advocate's comments and I welcome his announcements about cases that are marked \"no proceedings\" and in which charges are reduced.

More generally, we have grave reservations about the adequacy of funding in the COPFS. As a result, it is far from clear that the main thrust of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004&#8212;to prevent delays and ensure that trials proceed earlier&#8212;will be achieved. There does not appear to be any prospect of significant progress in that respect as long as the police and fiscal services remain under-resourced. The minister must realise that nothing undermines victims' and witnesses' confidence more than being told that their case will not proceed. Colin Fox, Duncan McNeil and Mike Pringle share our concern about the lack of adequate information for witnesses when their trial is delayed.</p><p>Delays are particularly distressing for children. A day can be a long time for an adult, but it is a lifetime for a child. I join Patrick Harvie and Donald Gorrie in calling on the minister to consider the introduction of intermediaries in an attempt to ensure that children have every opportunity to give their best evidence and to help them to cope with their experience in court. Research has indicated that that measure would give children and their families greater faith in the criminal justice system and that it would tackle the under-reporting of crimes against children.</p><p>There is little doubt that all victims and witnesses want crimes to be resolved without undue delay. To that end, there is no substitute for ensuring a visible police presence on the street to deter and detect crime.

However, in addition to funding, there are various ways in which police resources could be released. In that context, I hope that the Executive will seriously consider introducing in Scotland the violent offender and sex offender register software system, which would help police forces in Scotland to manage programmes and information about sex offenders. The system is already in place in England and Wales. After the initial cost of implementation, there have been subsequent savings from, for example, the sharing of information and avoiding the duplication of work. There is also the potential for a reduction in recidivism, which would certainly help to increase confidence in the justice system.</p><p>Why should the public be encouraged to report crime when the alleged perpetrator is charged and then released back on to the street, free to threaten, intimidate and continue offending, simply because bail is too readily available? As Bill Aitken pointed out, a radical new approach to the bail system is required.</p><p>A point that seems to have totally escaped Kenny MacAskill of the SNP is just how soul-destroying the effect of early release can be on victims and witnesses.

The work that the CDSU has carried out over 13 years represents a model of best practice in the voluntary sector.</p><p>The unit evolved from the work of a support action group that was set up in Craigneuk to tackle poverty issues. As a result of that group's work, the need to address long-term unemployment in the Craigneuk area was recognised and the unit was established in 1991. Since then, the organisation has had an excellent track record in providing education, training and opportunities for the long-term unemployed. Moreover, the quality of the service that it provides has been recognised by organisations such as Motherwell College and Scottish Enterprise Lanarkshire, both of which have entered into training contracts with the unit. Therefore, the unit has to an extent been self-financing, providing even more value for money.</p><p>North Lanarkshire Council has attempted to mitigate its withdrawal of support for an organisation with a tried and proven track record by stating that some of the full-time staff employed by the CDSU will be working for the successor organisation, Routes to Work. In other words, it has implied that it is business as usual, but nothing could be further from the truth. Many of the clients with whom the CDSU has dealt on a recurring basis will simply not approach organisations such as Routes to Work, which is seen as having close links with the local authority. That point is confirmed by those who work in the citizens advice bureau, who state that people will come to them to talk freely and seek advice about issues such as debt, rent or council tax arrears, because the bureau is seen to be independent of the local authority.</p><p>Furthermore, it is difficult to see how the new organisation can provide the same value for money as the CDSU did, given the absence of voluntary input.

However, it quickly became clear that the bill had not been thought through. The Executive's aims were muddled and the Justice 1 Committee did not know whether the bill was aimed at protecting emergency workers at all times or whether the focus was on the consequences of obstructing or hindering them. The so-called blue-light services&#8212;the police, the fire service and ambulance crews&#8212;are clearly emergency workers whose work is almost always carried out in emergency circumstances. However, when the committee took evidence, it became clear that those whom the bill is intended to protect had real difficulties with and concerns about it. For example, a witness from the fire service expressed reservations about the service's inclusion in the bill, which, he feared, could result in the loss of the fire service's neutrality by aligning it with the police and hence increasing the risk of attacks.</p><p>Other witnesses wanted to extend the bill to include more public service workers, but it was evident that if we had started that process, the list of those who could be included might be endless. The minister has chosen to extend the category to include a limited number of public service workers who are not blue-light service workers. In doing so, he has created a two-tier public service workers bill, although he was honest enough to admit that in evidence. I would have preferred him <place-holder colnum=\"13210\"/> to go further and acknowledge that, despite everyone's good intentions, the bill is simply not necessary, it creates more problems than solutions and extra legislative time has been allocated and wasted on a face-saving exercise for the Executive.</p><p>The common law can already deal with such situations and has the flexibility to take account of individual circumstances. The situation has been enhanced by the Lord Advocate's guidance to procurators fiscal, which emphasises that an attack on any worker who is delivering a public service is an aggravated offence. That goes a long way towards achieving the bill's objectives, without the need for new legislation. Two more elements are needed. First, we need a high-profile campaign that stigmatises attacks on public service workers in emergency circumstances in much the same way as the drink-driving campaign stigmatised that behaviour. Secondly, we must ensure that the increased sentencing powers that are proposed in the bill are available to sheriffs under the summary procedure.</p><p>We have heard many references to the impressive chamber and the importance of ensuring that the quality of our work matches the quality of our surroundings.

As Marilyn Livingstone and others have stressed, if we are to make progress on addressing any form of abuse, priority must be given not just to dealing with the harrowing effects of such abuse but to ensuring that all necessary action is taken to prevent vulnerable children from being abused in the first place.</p><p>Sadly, as today's debate all too clearly illustrates, the sexual abuse of children is not a new phenomenon. I find it even more worrying that new means of communicating such as texting, e-mail and chat rooms allow abusers to become ever more innovative in finding ways to contact children and gain their confidence and trust. In other words, they are finding new ways of carrying out the grooming process, which is the necessary first stage of conduct that leads to abuse.</p><p>As a result, I welcome the Scottish Executive's recognition that, with the advent of new technology, incidents of sexual grooming are becoming more not less frequent and its commitment to introducing legislation to make <place-holder colnum=\"12433\"/> such grooming an offence. Such a move is welcomed by survivors of sexual abuse, who confirm that grooming is an integral part of the abuse process. This courageous group can bring its knowledge to bear on and make an immense input to finding ways of tackling this complex issue.</p><p>That contribution is fully recognised in the recommendations of the report by the short-life working group on the care needs of people who are survivors of childhood sexual abuse. As Michael McMahon has explained, the group was set up in 2003 by the then Minister for Health and Community Care, Malcolm Chisholm, in response to concerns raised by the cross-party group on survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Among other things, the report highlights the fact that there is no clear responsibility for identifying and supporting adult survivors of such abuse.</p><p>To date, such abuse has not been widely recognised as a major contributing factor to a range of disabling behaviours such as self-harm and drug and alcohol addiction. Therefore, emphasis has been placed on treating symptoms and minimising harm instead of on treating the root cause by supporting service users in exploring aspects of their sexual abuse history that remain problematic for them and in developing strategies that allow them to cope positively with daily life. The success of such an approach will require professionals and others who are likely to deal with survivors of childhood sexual abuse to have training, which must start with the need to be informed and aware of child sexual abuse trauma.</p><p>I welcome the minister's comments on that matter. Such training would help to raise awareness to ensure that the subject, which has all too often tended to be swept under the carpet, will now be dealt with openly. There is no doubt that being reluctant to talk about the issue is, perversely, almost akin to colluding with the abusers. Recognising that is a vital step forward in combating the sexual abuse of children.</p><p>One of our cross-party members, Anne MacDonald, summed up the matter perfectly when she said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Each generation has an opportunity to change historical inequality and human rights abuses&#8212;such as Apartheid. This, I believe, is ours. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, to have such knowledge, know what the position is and not to do something about it is akin to colluding with ... abusers.\"</p><p>That</p><p class=\"indent\">\"sounds dramatic&#8212;but I really mean this in the sense that we cannot continue to be informed bystanders and do nothing.\"</p><p>I heartily congratulate the Public Petitions Committee on bringing this debate to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2004-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13328378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Institutional Child Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the First Minister's statement and his apology, which is hugely important in providing the survivors of child abuse with support and is crucial in helping to end the stigma and the reluctance to talk about sexual abuse.

I am delighted that only yesterday the Scottish Executive announced that it will fund the project to the tune of &#163;2,500, which is certainly welcome.</p><p>Already 10 of 26 North Lanarkshire schools have signed up to the programme.

The issues that were raised included the effect of domestic abuse on children&#8212;the secondary victims&#8212;whose anxiety can sometimes surface in the form of bed-wetting and the child's subsequent agitation, embarrassment and shame; fear from the victims that the child will let something slip to another member of the family, such as the mother of the abuser; and attempts to cover up incidents in the almost sure and certain knowledge that if the abuser were to be challenged, payback time would inevitably follow.</p><p>Drink is referred to almost as an excuse for violent behaviour. Victims attempt to play down injuries to reassure children and panic at the prospect of a child innocently revealing an incident in the news book the next day at school. The play also covered the lengths to which victims go to ensure that information is concealed from authority figures such as teachers or community policemen who visit schools, by giving the clear instruction, \"Never mind what these people say&#8212;we don't want the family to be split up.\" Another issue was the heartfelt desire of victims who are trapped in abusive relationships to escape. Victims may assume the blame, pathetically hoping that things will be different in the future and that in the meantime they will have to try not to make the abuser angry.

That is already being done in some local authority areas, such as Perth and Kinross and North Lanarkshire, where voluntary carers organisations work with guidance staff in some secondary schools. That initiative should be expanded to include briefing staff in primary schools to look for the tell-tale signs, such as a pupil who continually arrives late for school, is constantly tired, gets behind with work, or has a high level of absences as a direct result of the pressures of their role at home. Occasionally, as a release from the pressures at home, some children can be disruptive or indulge in antisocial behaviour.

It is understandable that prisoners do not want to be watched or listened to during a visit, but if prisoners use those visits to access drugs, their right to have open visits should be withdrawn immediately. They must earn the right to have such visits reinstated by showing that they can be trusted and that they are fully signed up to the rehab programme. However, that is only half the problem. Thereafter, measures must be put in place to ensure a prison environment in which prisoners who are clean are not tempted back to drug taking.</p><p>That brings me to the broad issue of limiting access, which presents a huge problem. On access to drugs in prison, the public would be appalled to learn that prisoners have access to mobile phones. It is impossible to be serious about controlling drugs in prison while that practice continues. The Scottish Executive must take decisive action to ensure that mobile phones are not available to prisoners.</p><p>Another important matter that must be tackled as a priority is the recently highlighted problem of some security firms acting as a front for organised crime, drug dealing, extortion and money laundering. Tom Buchan, who is the president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, should be supported in his bid to persuade the Executive to subject those private firms to the same strict licensing regime as exists elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Instead, the Executive is doing what it does best&#8212;dithering. The minister is too often content to tinker at the edges by announcing initiatives such as a first-aid policy for drug users and their families.</p><p>If the minister wishes to tackle the access problem seriously, she should make introducing legislation a priority. She should make time available for that by abandoning the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Bill and setting aside the time that will be wasted on that unnecessary bill to legislate to deal with the licensing problem.<place-holder colnum=\"11178\"/></p><p>I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment in Annabel Goldie's name.</p>", "hdate": "2004-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13325246", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I could spend the next five minutes doing that.

The Executive then introduced a bill, the purpose of which was to address the problem of attacks on emergency workers and those assisting them in responding to emergencies. Like everyone else at the time, I signed up to that general principle in good faith&#8212;who would not? However, having looked closely at the detail of the bill and having examined and heard evidence from a variety of witnesses, I have been obliged to take a different view for the following reasons.</p><p>In the first place, the bill's policy intent, which at first glance appears simple, shows itself on closer examination to be confused in that it is not clear whether the main thrust is to prevent attacks on emergency workers or to prevent the consequences of such attacks, which could, at worst, mean a loss of life. It is little wonder that the committee criticised the policy memorandum to the bill for being</p><p class=\"indent\">\"generally lacking in detail and seriously deficient with regard to clearly establishing the policy intentions behind the Bill.\"</p><p>As a result the committee has had to spend valuable legislative time working out the general principles of the bill.</p><p>The Executive claims that it wants to do more for emergency workers by extending to them the kind of protection that is currently afforded to the police, but it has failed to consider the differences between the police and other workers. The police are always clearly identifiable as upholders of the law and, therefore, questions of proof that an accused person knew that someone was a policeman or policewoman do not arise. That is not the case with, for example, doctors or nurses out in the community.</p><p>The Police (Scotland) Act 1967 applies to anything that the police do while they are on duty, without differentiating the circumstances. The bill, on the other hand, seeks to cover only emergency circumstances, and defining those has proved <place-holder colnum=\"10844\"/> extremely difficult. The Law Society of Scotland, among others, has also rightly expressed concerns at the possible effect on prosecutions of legislation that tries to limit the law to workers responding only to such circumstances. That is the crux of the matter.</p><p>The Scottish Executive has set itself and, by extension, the committee an impossible task in trying to second-guess every conceivable circumstance that the bill could cover. Common law has the flexibility to ensure that assaults on emergency workers and the consequences of such assaults are treated with the appropriate gravity according to the individual circumstances of each case. The Executive itself has stated in its policy memorandum that that flexibility provides</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the best protection for public service workers as a whole, as it is reinforced by the Lord Advocate's guidelines to procurators fiscal emphasising that an attack on any worker delivering a public service is an aggravated offence.\"</p><p>There is more confused thinking from the Scottish Executive. Despite stating that the bill would raise awareness of the problem and act as a deterrent, the Executive says in its policy memorandum:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is unlikely that the Bill will lead to a significant increase in the number of prosecutions for attacks on emergency workers.\"</p><p>The deterrence and raising of awareness that the Executive seeks to achieve by introducing the bill can be attained through better application of existing law and higher penalties, together with a range of supporting measures, including a carefully targeted campaign to raise awareness of emergency workers' work and of the consequences of preventing them from doing it.</p><p>Furthermore, having conducted a consultation, the Executive failed to publish a detailed analysis of the responses. Had it done so, it might have realised that respondents to the consultation also raised important issues, including the Royal College of Nursing's concern, which others share, that the bill will create a two-tier system.</p><p>No reasonable person would sign up to the deeply flawed and confused principles in the bill. I therefore believe that this fledgling Parliament has reached a defining moment at which it can show that it has the maturity to reject a bill that I concede is well-intentioned, but is also seriously deficient and unnecessary. In so doing, the Parliament would take the first steps to becoming the responsible institution that Scotland craves.</p><p>The Justice 1 Committee has made a valiant attempt to carry out the Executive's will. The committee has been critical, but I urge members of that committee and other MSPs to go further in the pursuit of good government and to take no part in conducting what is clearly a face-saving exercise <place-holder colnum=\"10845\"/> for the Executive.

Despite the Scottish Executive's efforts to attract and retain social workers through the fast-track social work qualification and the provision of additional money to improve training, the shortage of social workers remains a problem that affects service delivery in community care and the criminal justice system, and service delivery for children and young people.</p><p>The increase in social work involvement in the criminal justice system was highlighted by the report of the chief social work inspector that was published in 2004, which recorded an increase of 15 per cent in the demand for social inquiry reports in nearly all Scotland's local authorities, together with increases in demand for probation orders and community service orders. Those increases are likely to continue, given the Executive's aim of promoting alternatives to custody. Such disposals will involve more input from social workers and the social work service.</p><p>The partnership agreement contains a pledge on a single correction agency to deliver custodial and non-custodial sentences in Scotland, the aim of which is to reduce reoffending rates. That would result in criminal justice and social work being taken away from local authorities. To date, the Executive has remained silent on that pledge and I believe that the uncertainty is damaging morale. Perhaps the minister could confirm whether the Executive intends to introduce a single correction agency.</p><p>I will now deal with the pressure on social work services for children and young people. It is a sad fact that one of the growth areas in that field is child protection. Adequate numbers of experienced, qualified social workers are needed to manage the challenging work load and to deal with the huge rise in the number of children of <place-holder colnum=\"9751\"/> drug-using parents who are suffering from neglect. Although the Executive's statistics suggest that the number of social workers in post has grown, the Association of Directors of Social Work says that those posts are mainly in new initiatives, such as community schools and youth justice and intervention projects, and that they come at the expense of child protection services.</p><p>The number of children on the child protection register has risen and there are more referrals from reporters to children's panels. The lack of social work resources has resulted in situations in which a social worker attends a hearing merely to state that they have no knowledge of the case under discussion as they are just filling in. That results in the hearing having to be rescheduled. Such delays are deeply damaging to the children who are the subject of those hearings and they are a waste of panel members' valuable time.</p><p>Against that background, we desperately require action, which the ADSW acknowledged in its submission to the Education Committee's inquiry into child protection. Although the ADSW welcomed the recommendations in the November 2002 report, \"It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright\", it expressed frustration at the lack of progress in implementing key recommendations, such as that on the establishment of clear guidelines for standards rather than just a framework. It also sought the progression of the proposals on a framework for multidisciplinary inspection processes.</p><p>On the final day of debate in the Parliament's temporary home, it would have been good to end on a positive note, but I regret that that is not possible. I am saddened that the minister's main announcement has been about the creation of an independent group to consider the future of social work and social workers, rather than about a range of concrete proposals to implement the recommendations of the November 2002 report. In effect, the minister has announced a review. It is sad that this Executive's tenure has been characterised by dithering and delay. Scotland's children and its social work services deserve more. I hope that things will be very different when we move to the new Holyrood building but, given the Executive's record, it would perhaps not be wise for me to hold my breath.</p>", "hdate": "2004-07-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13321750", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In a debate about social work in the 21 st century, recruitment, retention and resource issues are fundamental.

The number of broadcasters has grown since then to far more than 250. Restrictions on the ownership of national terrestrial broadcasting licences were outdated; broadcasting has now been opened up to new ideas and sources of investment. In that context, I very much welcome the launch of Thistle Television, which is an operating division of CiSTM.</p><p>This new local television station&#8212;which, as the motion highlights, is the only one of its kind in Scotland&#8212;will operate under a restricted service licence in the west of Scotland, particularly in Lanarkshire. It will broadcast from the Blackhill transmitter on terrestrial TV and has the potential to broadcast to more than 2 per cent of the UK population. As a result, Thistle Television has the opportunity to become the provider of local television services in other parts of the UK and to give local businesses, salespeople and advertisers a platform to promote their services and products.</p><p>In that respect, it would be appropriate to draw a comparison with local newspapers. As far as advertising and editorial comment are concerned, local newspapers need to be close to their customers in order to survive. The same is true of local television. Evidence from different researchers and sponsors of local news, events, sports and so on shows that there is a demand for local advertising. Indeed, the level of advertising in local newspapers throughout Scotland confirms <place-holder colnum=\"8731\"/> that there is a demand for geographically targeted marketing and advertising.</p><p>That said, the key to the success of Thistle Television and other local TV broadcasters will lie in the content and quality of their programmes. Content should be driven by consumer demand and not be overly prescriptive. Thistle Television has paid due regard to that crucial marketing prerequisite with its recognition of the popularity of, and hence the need to provide programmes with, a strong local and regional news content as well as programmes that cater for wider sporting and entertainment interests.</p><p>The success of this initiative could have huge benefits, not least to the local economy with the provision of employment and skilled jobs in the high-tech sector. The training opportunities that will be available will enable students to gain some workplace experience and to take their first steps on the media career ladder. There will be opportunities to promote local culture and to showcase local events, performers and artists as well as a chance to strengthen local democracy and encourage local involvement and participation in local issues.</p><p>I again thank Linda Fabiani for raising awareness of the existence of this new local TV station and the potential benefits and opportunities that it offers to Lanarkshire and the wider community.

The system is designed to uphold the welfare and rights of those children, while addressing their behaviour. As part of the current review, the possibility of holding family hearings has been mooted, but that is not a move that I favour. I remain convinced that the focus must be on the needs of the individual child rather than on those of the parents or the siblings.</p><p>However, I do believe that there is a place for considering parenting orders as a disposal open to the hearings system, in order to address parental behaviour and responsibility. That would retain the unique child-centred and family-centred approach that is based firmly on the needs of the individual child. It is important to put the children's hearings system for the 21<sup>st</sup> century into perspective and to recognise that a child today is very different, by and large, from a child 30 years ago. A child today is much more mature.</p><p>In order to put the problem in context, it would be useful to look at some of the key facts. The Scottish Children's Reporter Administration's annual reports for 2001-02 and for 2002-03 confirmed that the total number of children referred to children's hearings represents approximately 4 per cent of all Scottish children. The vast majority of those referrals were made on non-offence grounds. However, there remains a relatively small hard core of persistent young offenders who are wreaking havoc in communities throughout Scotland. Local press and newspapers catalogue that offending every week. Examples include a six-year-old Kilmarnock girl and her eight-year-old brother who are now the subject of a police report and of a referral to a children's panel hearing after they terrorised American tourists visiting Dundonald Castle by attacking them with stones and forcing them to seek refuge in the castle for their safety. A Shotts couple were <place-holder colnum=\"8324\"/> forced to leave their home after their property was repeatedly vandalised and abused in a series of break-ins. Drunken youths have been making the lives of local people living close to playing fields in Bothwell, Uddingston an absolute misery by congregating there to drink, smash bottles and set fire to grass. The catalogue goes on.</p><p>If persistent offending is to be tackled effectively, that kind of behaviour must be addressed at the earliest possible opportunity. I therefore welcome the pilot fast-track children's hearings that are operating in East Lothian, Dundee and Ayrshire. They are aimed at dealing quickly and appropriately with persistent offenders who have committed five or more offences within a six-month period. However, if the children's hearings system is to realise its full potential and serve the needs of vulnerable children as well as the needs of those who offend, it must be fully resourced. That view is shared by NCH Scotland in its 2004 report \"Where's Kilbrandon Now?\" There are two further areas that I urge the minister to address, which are certainly causing concern in the present system. The first involves the assessment of supervision requirements, which are currently hampered by a social worker or ancillary staff failing to adequately facilitate good-quality, regular contact between parents and children. That in turn leads to it being much more difficult to rehabilitate those children. The 2003 Audit Scotland report highlights that problem. Its findings stated that between 300 and 500 children on supervision were estimated not to be getting the service that the children's hearings had prescribed.</p><p>The second area of concern revolves around inconsistencies in implementing national guidelines to assess the risk factor. That has resulted in a virtual postcode lottery, due to a failure to adopt a standardised approach, so that a relatively minor incident of domestic abuse could result in children being removed from a family in one area, while a much more severe incident in another area results in the children remaining with the family. That dual standard is not acceptable and I hope that the minister will address the issue.</p><p>This is an extremely important debate, so I deeply regret the fact that, once again, the minister has chosen to stage it at a time when the Parliament is not debating with the benefit of the full facts, which will be apparent only when stage 1 of the review into the principles and objectives is completed in July. That represents another missed opportunity by the Scottish Executive, and although I do not doubt the minister's genuine commitment to improving the children's hearings system, by denying the Parliament the right to a fully informed debate, he is quite simply selling Scotland and Scotland's children short.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318195", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Kilbrandon report's recommendations established the children's hearings system in 1971 as a single system to consider the needs of young offenders and vulnerable children.

By far the best way of reducing reoffending is to prevent an offence from being committed in the first place. Evidence from the Scottish Consortium on Crime and Criminal Justice shows that most adult offenders start committing offences as young people. Therefore, effective prevention involves identifying young children at risk as soon as possible, before a pattern of offending becomes established.</p><p>The consortium identifies a range of preventive intervention strategies for children at risk, which includes ensuring that they have quality pre-school education and that their parents are involved with, and receive a visit from, health professionals. Further, the parents should receive education in parenting skills. It seems that a multi-agency approach is much more effective than a criminal correction agency would be. I support the SNP's amendment in that regard.</p><p>Measures such as those to which I have referred, coupled with a greater police presence on our streets, help to prevent low-level offences, such as vandalism, from escalating into something more serious. However, for those who offend and reoffend, the appropriateness of alternative sanctions to custody should be considered, with prison remaining the ultimate sanction if all else fails. In the case of fine defaulters who have wilfully refused to pay, recovery should be made by deducting the fine from benefits or salaries, as the McInnes report recommended and the Conservatives have long advocated.</p><p>For other offences that might otherwise attract a short-term prison sentence, the appropriateness of imposing a custodial sentence or an alternative to custody is determined, in theory, by looking at the offence or pattern of offending and deciding whether there is a public safety issue. In practice, as Safeguarding Communities-Reducing Offending points out, court decisions are often based on what is available rather than on what is most effective. In other words, there is a resource problem because the alternative to custody is often not available. As Annabel Goldie pointed out, if a drug-related offence has been committed, it may be appropriate to consider a drug treatment and testing order, which requires an offender, if they consent, to undergo treatment for drug misuse. However, such orders are available only through the sheriff courts and are not an option in <place-holder colnum=\"7975\"/> Scottish district courts, which deal with the minor offences that tend to involve a concentration of young people. As a result of the lack of resource, the opportunity is lost for early intervention to impose the sanction that is the most appropriate to address the offending behaviour.</p><p>Alternatives to custody must be properly resourced if they are to work. That is especially the case in relation to community service orders and supervised attendance orders, both of which require intense input from social workers. Given the current shortage of social workers in Scotland, we must question how effectively such orders are being implemented. The minister said that additional resources are not always the answer. I agree with that, but the resource problem that I have outlined is real and affects our ability to deliver the sanction that can most appropriately address the offending behaviour. I call on the minister to take note of that and to act accordingly.</p><p>I do not know whether there has been a survey of the number of consultations that have taken place since 1999, but members might be interested to know that there have been more than 700. I call on the minister to consult a little less and to act a little more, especially by putting resources into alternatives to custody.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13317361", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reducing Reoffending"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate on how best to reduce reoffending and to rehabilitate and reform offenders is an important one that has the potential to impact radically on the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system.

The report outlines a set of guiding principles, against which the committee proposals were tested&#8212;fairness to victims, witnesses and the accused; effectiveness in terms of deterrence and the provision of a system that is simple and consistent; and efficiency in the use of time and resources. Moreover, the committee recognised the need for quick delivery in the justice system. Crucially, its clear view was that the summary justice system of the future should be user centred rather than service driven.</p><p>The committee tackled the structure first, with the recommendation to unify the summary court system under the central administration of the Scottish Court Service, funded by the Scottish Executive. That creates the opportunity to plan for and invest in infrastructure, information technology and training on a consistent basis throughout Scotland. That is sensible in terms of providing a quality service to court users that is simple and effective, with sufficient flexibility to permit responsiveness to change when required.</p><p>The proposal for the creation of coterminous boundaries is equally sensible. At present, Scotland's commission areas&#8212;the local authority areas in which district courts are run and managed&#8212;differ markedly because of the local authorities' different interpretations of their statutory duty to provide sensible and sufficient premises and facilities for the district court. The alignment of boundaries should ensure that existing sheriffdoms and commission areas will be coterminous with police and procurator fiscal operating areas and with local authority boundaries. That is to be welcomed.</p><p>The benefits of the proposals on judges in summary courts are less obvious. I preface my comments with a declaration of interests, as I am a justice of the peace in the south Lanarkshire commission area. The report recommends a move to a system that employs only professional, qualified judges, to be known as summary sheriffs. There is a distinct absence of concrete evidence to substantiate the assumption that replacing lay justices with a professional judiciary will improve the delivery of justice. However, other proposals that relate to procedures involving the courts, police and prosecution will go a considerable way towards achieving that aim.<place-holder colnum=\"7138\"/></p><p>The recommendation to appoint a single agency to collect court fines will save court time, as will the recommendation to vary court hours to allow courts to sit in the evenings and at weekends. Both that and the recommendation that fine defaulters should have their fines deducted from benefits or have their wages arrested are measures that the Conservatives have consistently advocated to ensure that justice is delivered more speedily and to prevent delays.</p><p>The creation of a single agency for fine collection will save police time, as will the recommendations for the greater use of non-reporting options and fixed-penalty notices for non-traffic offences. Those proposals, together with the recommendation that the police have the option to submit abbreviated court reports where that is appropriate, are important and will undoubtedly reduce the amount of time that the police spend on administrative duties. The proposals will free up resources for on-the-beat policing.</p><p>Finally, the recommendation that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"alternatives to prosecution should be made more widely available ... to enable the courts to focus on\"</p><p>speeding up the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"handling of serious crimes ... while giving police and procurators fiscal ... powers ... to respond quickly and appropriately to minor offences\"</p><p>is generally welcomed. The proposal to lead CCTV evidence or other recorded evidence without the requirement for a witness to speak to it is sensible, as is the recommendation to pilot the co-location of police officers in Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service offices.</p><p>Particularly welcome is the recommendation to remove the mandatory requirement to obtain a new social inquiry report prior to sentence if the report has been produced in the past three months or if the court is satisfied, having regard to the sentence that is likely to be imposed, that a new report would serve no useful purpose.

Therefore, the general principles of the bill, which represent an attempt to address this vexing issue, are to be welcomed. That said, I genuinely believe that the Executive has missed an opportunity to get to grips with the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour. Instead, it has concentrated on the symptoms by producing measures that, while attracting the attention of the media, are for the most part unnecessary and superfluous, as existing statute law and common law can already address antisocial behaviour.</p><p>Much has been said about young people who offend, but it is young people and their parents who have been most let down by the content of the bill.</p><p>I fully acknowledge that the Scottish Executive has attempted to address the problem of parents struggling to cope with disruptive youngsters through the introduction of parenting orders. Those orders require the parent to comply with their terms, which are normally that the parent must attend counselling or guidance for a maximum of three months. That is good.</p><p>Breaches of the requirements that are specified in the orders can be a criminal offence. In so far as the measure requires the parent to take their parental responsibilities seriously, it is to be welcomed. However, the orders would not be fair or acceptable, and the legislation would not be effective, if the requirements that are specified sought to extend the principle of vicarious liability in criminal law so that responsibility for the acts and omissions of the child was transferred to the parent, even in circumstances in which a reasonable parent could not have done anything further to prevent an incident of antisocial behaviour.</p><p>Parents are the key to addressing antisocial behaviour in young people, but the success of any policy that attempts to promote parenting skills depends on active parental co-operation. In other words, success involves working in partnership with parents to curb a pattern of disruptive or antisocial behaviour as early as possible. For the most part, that co-operation is forthcoming. However, occasionally, as the minister acknowledged, it is not. That is particularly the <place-holder colnum=\"6458\"/> case if the parent's lifestyle is chaotic as a result of drink or drug abuse or other factors. In those circumstances, the school environment is all too often the most stable thing that children have in their lives. That is why it is important that when a child begins school, the head teacher should take the time and trouble to visit the reception class regularly. In that way, they will establish a relationship with new primary 1 pupils that will continue as the children progress through the school. That, in turn, will help discipline in the school and will minimise incidents of disruptive behaviour.</p><p>Unfortunately, in too many schools, the head teacher moves on to another post somewhere else before the relationship that they have built up with the primary 1 children has had a chance to influence the children's progress. Furthermore, head teachers are all too frequently called to meetings outwith the school, as a consequence of which they are often not present to deal with a particularly disruptive or violent incident when it arises. As a result, incident is not dealt with on the spot as effectively as it could be, which can lead to an escalation of disruptive behaviour that translates into antisocial behaviour outside the school gates.</p><p>In conclusion, although the Executive recognises the principle of early intervention, it has not fully grasped the opportunity to provide measures in the bill to establish good practice for parents and others who struggle to cope with antisocial behaviour in children.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13312935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The term \"antisocial behaviour\" covers a wide range of behaviour and manifests itself in a variety of ways.

At the heart of the measures is the requirement to develop a more managed system that promotes better communication between the prosecution and the defence and earlier preparation by both parties. We welcome the general principles of the bill and congratulate the Scottish Executive on recognising and prioritising the need for the legislation.</p><p>Lack of preparation by the prosecution or the defence and late submission of evidence&#8212;mostly by the Crown&#8212;are the two main reasons for delays in business in the High Court. To address those delays, there must be improved communication between the Crown and the defence at the earliest possible stage. In other words, there must be early disclosure of evidence to provide the opportunity for the exchange of information to assist with the early preparation of cases and to identify cases that are ready to go to trial.</p><p>The Procurators Fiscal Society has confirmed that, at present, disclosure does not happen in a consistent manner. There must be a fundamental change of attitude on the part of both the Crown and the defence so that a culture of early disclosure is embraced. The monumental shift in thinking that that will require should not be underestimated. Although I am encouraged that the Crown Office representatives state that they are already embracing the early-disclosure culture for complex cases, I am deeply concerned that there is still a tendency for cases that, on the surface, appear to be straightforward not to be subject to the same early-disclosure culture.<place-holder colnum=\"5962\"/></p><p>By far the best way of resolving issues in the early-disclosure process and of assisting in the preparation of a case for trial is for a meeting&#8212;referred to in the Bonomy report as a \"managed meeting\"&#8212;to take place between the prosecution and the defence. The prosecution and the defence would be required to meet prior to the preliminary hearing to establish which issues required to be resolved if the case was to be disposed of or to allow it to go to trial at the earliest opportunity. I believe that for the meeting to have maximum effect, it should be held face to face. Videoconferencing equipment that is to be introduced for vulnerable witnesses could be introduced in courts throughout Scotland to allow face-to-face meetings to take place.</p><p>With an early-disclosure culture and a managed meeting having taken place, the aim should be for the mandatory preliminary hearing to become merely a ticking and bumping exercise, confirming that the parties are prepared for trial and allowing the judge to set a trial date. Early disclosure and the managed meeting are the real key to ensuring that the system works. The Justice 1 Committee recognises that and is concerned that the bill does not include proposals for early disclosure of evidence and does not mention or specify arrangements for the managed meeting. I hope that the Scottish Executive will rectify that omission.</p><p>Other areas on which the committee disagrees with the Scottish Executive include the proposals relating to trial in the absence of the accused, reluctant witnesses, bail conditions&#8212;including the appropriateness of remote monitoring as a condition of bail&#8212;and timescales for the shift of business to the sheriff court. Underlying the committee's comments on those proposals and suggestions for change is the recognition of the absolute necessity of ensuring that the measures that are proposed in the bill are adequately resourced.</p><p>I share the committee's concerns and agree with its recommendations. I pay particular tribute to the Justice 1 Committee convener, Pauline McNeill, and the committee clerks and advisers for the work that they have done. If the issues that have been highlighted and the committee's recommendations are taken on board, the efficiency and effectiveness of the bill will be improved greatly.</p><p>The one issue on which I differed from my colleagues on the committee was the proposal to extend the 110-day rule for those who are remanded in custody. The principle that an accused person is innocent until proven guilty is enshrined in the Scottish legal system. It is therefore unacceptable for an accused person to be denied their liberty for any longer than is <place-holder colnum=\"5963\"/> absolutely necessary. Quite simply, justice delayed is justice denied. With early disclosure and managed meetings, there is no reason that indictments in the majority of cases&#8212;apart from the most complex cases&#8212;should not be served well before the 80<sup>th</sup> day, with the subsequent mandatory preliminary hearing being set at a time that would enable the trial date to fall within the 110 days. In complex cases, that may not always be possible and there may be a delay. At present, that happens in only 25 per cent of cases. The new early disclosure and managed meetings should ensure that that percentage is reduced.</p><p>In these circumstances, the exception should not dictate the rule. In effect, that is what is proposed by the extension to 140 days of the time that an accused person can be held in custody. Implementing the extension of the 140-day rule provision could result in the accused being held in custody for up to 12 months if bail is refused. That is unacceptable.</p><p>The Conservatives support the Justice 1 Committee's recommendations, with the exception of the proposal to extend the 110-day rule, which would delay justice unnecessarily. We are firmly of the opinion that the case has not been made for ditching the rule, which has existed for centuries and has become, and should remain, the cornerstone of the Scottish criminal justice system.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13311800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill is extremely important as it seeks to introduce greater certainty into the proceedings of the High Court of Justiciary by introducing measures that, for the most part, were recommended in Lord Bonomy's report \"Improving Practice\".

At the outset, it is only right and proper for us to pay tribute to the men and women throughout Scotland who on a daily basis are employed in front-line duties as part of the emergency services.</p><p>It is a core principle of any civilised society that emergency workers should have the confidence and assurance that in the course of carrying out their frequently dangerous duties they will be protected by the full force of the law. The fact that with increasing frequency so many of those dedicated public sector workers are finding themselves under threat of abuse and attack is a reflection of the state of lawlessness in Scotland today.</p><p>A Unison survey from 2002 highlighted the extent of the problem when it revealed that an extremely worrying 40 per cent of nurses and NHS staff were subject to physical and verbal abuse. Contained in that figure are incidents of attacks on hospital staff and other claims of unacceptable behaviour, such as the incident reported last year at Wishaw general hospital to which reference has been made. In that incident, nursing staff complained that they had been threatened, subjected to verbal abuse and obstructed from carrying out their duties by two men in accident and emergency. In Coatbridge and other parts of Lanarkshire and central Scotland, hoax calls to and attacks on fire brigade workers provide a further example of the kind of reprehensible behaviour to which emergency workers are subjected. Clearly, this situation must not be allowed to continue and must be addressed. The question is how best that can be done.</p><p>In the first instance, the Scottish Conservatives support extending to other emergency workers, as well as to those persons who are assisting an emergency worker in an emergency situation, the statutory protection that is at present given to the police. We would make it a crime to obstruct those workers from carrying out their duties, which involve attempting to provide the public with protection.</p><p>It is recommended that the new statutory offence of attacking a public sector worker should carry a maximum penalty of nine months' imprisonment and a fine of up to &#163;5,000. We are concerned that the full effect of that new measure will be diluted by the consequence of automatic release whereby, even if the maximum sentence were to be imposed, the offender would serve only about four and a half months. Therefore, we again call on the Executive to use the power available to it to end automatic sentence discounting.<place-holder colnum=\"4913\"/></p><p>We agree with the consultation's definition of emergency workers, which includes mountain rescue teams such as the Trossachs search and rescue team which, as part of its duties, is on standby to tackle terrorism. We also share the Executive's view that the new statutory protection should not be extended to all public service workers. Under common law, all Scots are protected from assault. The flexibility of common law means that there is no maximum penalty and that individual circumstances can be taken into account by the court. The system works well and is able to evolve over time. However, when it comes to dealing with violent patients or pupils, the Scottish Conservatives believe that additional protective measures should be put in place.</p><p>We have publicly backed Unison's idea of red and yellow cards for those who abuse NHS staff. That could lead to the banning of individuals from NHS premises. Executive statistics reveal that there is an attack on a school worker every 15 minutes. We therefore believe that teachers should have the right to refuse to teach any pupil who has a proven record of violence in school.</p><p>New technology, such as that currently being pioneered to transform mobile phones into personal alarms and location devices, should also be explored, in order to give teachers, psychiatric nurses and other public sector workers who are potentially at risk a degree of protection in situations where they are vulnerable and isolated.</p><p>Today's debate is without doubt well intentioned. Although, on the whole, we welcome the measures proposed, they should not be allowed to obscure the fact that attacks are on the increase&#8212;not just against public sector workers but against the public at large. The only way to combat that effectively is to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to crime, with more visible policing on our streets.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13309103", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Emergency Workers (Protection)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate on the protection of emergency service workers is important.

It was here that the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001 was passed. The act made history as the first committee-initiated legislation to come before the Parliament. I pay particular tribute to Maureen Macmillan for her contribution to that.</p><p>Today's debate continues that excellent work, not least because it serves to highlight and increase awareness of what is by any measure a complex issue. The lyrics of the 1973 Charlie Rich song, \"Behind Closed Doors\", sums up the nature of the problem:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"No one knows what goes on behind closed doors.\"</p><p>The song came out 30 years ago, but the problem is still with us today. To acknowledge that domestic violence takes many forms is not to undermine the issue. The most visible, tangible manifestation is violent behaviour resulting in physical abuse. However, other equally repugnant forms exist, including verbal abuse and financial or emotional manipulation and control.</p><p>The problem is no respecter of persons and cuts <place-holder colnum=\"3722\"/> across social divides of age, class, background and gender. Some 10 per cent of victims in 2002 were male&#8212;that point was well made by Murdo Fraser and Mike Rumbles. However, one common factor exists: fear. At its most extreme form, that translates into a fear for life and limb, which can cause victims to feel powerless and trapped in abusive situations where their self-esteem has been eroded over the years and from which the fear of consequences prevents them from escaping. Frances Curran highlighted the repeat incidents of domestic abuse that that can give rise to and Annabel Goldie called for tougher sanctions to deal with the matter. Nicola Sturgeon and Mary Scanlon highlighted the fact that fear can also translate into under-reporting.</p><p>In 1999, a community safety initiative became the vehicle to launch a female and child domestic violence unit pilot in the North Lanarkshire Council area. The unit, which was aimed at creating a new confidence among abused women, was staffed by two women police constables, who provided support and&#8212;crucially&#8212;accurate information. The victims were assured that, if they summoned up the courage to report the abuse to the police, they would not put at risk either the right to look after their children or the roof over their heads. The unit has gone a considerable way towards raising awareness of the problem and has now developed into a family protection unit. It works and functions not simply as a policing initiative; it depends on a multi-agency approach and involves representatives from health, education and social services, as well as the Procurator Fiscal Service and the police, working together to address the problem.</p><p>As a result, reports of domestic abuse are on the increase. On average, eight such incidents have been reported every day this year. The fact that many of those reports concern repeat incidents provides further evidence of women being trapped in abusive situations. Official statistics suggest that 40 per cent of cases are drink related, but that is definitely an underestimate&#8212;the actual proportion is thought to be nearer 70 per cent. Donald Gorrie highlighted that point.</p><p>Legislation will help to combat domestic abuse to an extent, but to tackle the issue properly there must be a fundamental culture shift in how domestic violence is perceived. Raising awareness through radio, television, newspaper and poster campaigns that list helpline numbers is key to that process. I very much welcome the minister's announcement about the extension of the helpline to provide 24-hour coverage; that is particularly good news as we approach the festive season. Her announcements about the refuge development programme and research into refuge provision, such as cluster provision of flats, are also welcome.

Notwithstanding Stewart Maxwell's concerns, I particularly welcome the provision that everyone under 16 will automatically be classed as a vulnerable witness and entitled to special measures. It represents an important and encouraging step forward in attempting to ensure that the justice system enables children to participate fully.</p><p>The same is true of adults who fall into the discretionary category of vulnerable witness status, namely those who suffer from mental disorder and those who are deemed to be in such fear and distress that it risks their ability to give evidence. It is essential that vulnerable people are adequately supported in the justice system and that the measures to achieve that aim are accurately costed.</p><p>That said, those measures must be viewed as only part&#8212;albeit an important part&#8212;of the bigger picture of measures and resources that are necessary to restore confidence in our system of justice. Such confidence will in turn encourage witnesses to give evidence. It is little wonder that the system is being undermined, what with delays in cases coming to court; alleged offenders being released on bail and going on to reoffend; and offenders serving only a fraction of their sentence as a consequence of automatic early release. Those fundamental issues impact on witnesses' willingness to give evidence and must be tackled.</p><p>As a justice of the peace with more than 10 years' experience on the bench in the district court, I am fully aware of the stress, nervous tension and&#8212;at times&#8212;distress that some witnesses feel when they are called on to give evidence in cases that within the scheme of things are relatively minor compared with cases that are tried in the sheriff court or the High Court.</p><p>As the gravity of the offence increases for those witnesses, so does the trauma of being required to give evidence. That trauma is exacerbated by delays in the system as the result of cases being rescheduled. That fact is recognised by Children 1<sup>st</sup>, which states that a culture of urgency is an essential part of measures to improve the situation for child witnesses. Children 1<sup>st</sup> points out:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A delay of a year or more in bringing a case to court, can be difficult enough for an adult witness but is often intolerable for a child witness&#8212;particularly if the child giving evidence is a victim of crime.\"</p><p>Such delays have a particular impact on child witnesses because they take up a disproportionate amount of children's lives, which adds hugely to the trauma that they experience. In addition, it <place-holder colnum=\"3374\"/> undermines the quality of evidence that children are able to give.</p><p>If those delays are to be properly addressed, more resources must be ploughed into the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&#8212;which is currently straining at the seams&#8212;in order to increase the number of fiscals available to tackle the huge work load.</p><p>Furthermore, the Scottish Executive has in its gift the ability to end automatic early release, which undermines the criminal justice system and the public's confidence in it. By restoring honesty in sentencing so that 10 years means 10 years and any remission is strictly limited to that earned by good behaviour and participation in rehabilitation programmes, the Scottish Executive would give the public and witnesses the necessary reassurances that they require and deserve in order to encourage witnesses to be active participants in the fight against crime.</p><p>If the Scottish Executive continues to sidestep dealing with those important issues, then, sadly, the excellent measures in the bill run the risk of becoming mere window-dressing, masking the Executive's stubborn refusal to do what is required to improve our justice system in order fully to support vulnerable witnesses and the general public.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13305174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the bill's proposed measures, which are intended to improve protection of and assistance for vulnerable witnesses.

At that time, it was not uncommon for a child to turn up at school after an absence with a note of apology that explained that the absence was due to the child having no shoes. Despite the poverty, I had no doubt that parents&#8212;many of whom were single&#8212;had as their top priority the welfare of their children.<place-holder colnum=\"3235\"/></p><p>Over the years, the balance has shifted markedly. Today, children all too often feature at number 4 or 5 in the list of parental priorities&#8212;lower than parents' social lives and dependencies. Worse, in recent months I have been appalled at the conditions in which some children live, which are reminiscent of Victorian times. As a result of drug or alcohol dependency, some parents are incapable of looking after themselves, let alone their children. Such parents can be capable of getting their act together sufficiently and are articulate enough to pass the formal interview at which their ability to continue looking after their children is assessed. The shortage of social workers means that the on-going assessment and checks that should back up the interview with follow-up visits do not take place. The chaos&#8212;and often the squalor&#8212;of the child's home life is not detected and not addressed. In such circumstances, there is a clear need for interagency co-operation. The merging of social work and health would greatly aid that and lead to a better service.</p><p>I want to highlight the potential threat that the internet poses to child safety. There is a disaster waiting to happen: it is just a matter of time before a serious incident of child abuse results from contact made through the net. In the United Kingdom, an estimated 4.8 million children go online, of whom more than 1 million are under 14. Some 65 per cent of 16 to 17-year-olds in the UK have used the web and are frequent users of e-mail. Of those young people, 62 per cent use the internet at home. In most cases, children's knowledge of the internet far outstrips that of their parents, who are, by and large, unaware of the potential danger from the online activity of paedophiles.</p><p>In June 2000, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, in the United States, published a survey into the victimisation of children over the net.

In so far as it ensures the protection of the public&#8212;the number 1 priority for our criminal justice system&#8212;it works. It has already been stated that, in May 2002, the Scottish prison population was at an all-time high and exceeded the total available accommodation. That is worrying; however, the best way in which to stop overcrowding in prisons is to cut crime through having a greater police presence on our streets to deter and detect crime.</p><p>Nevertheless, within the prison population there is a significant number of people for whom an alternative to a custodial disposal is the most <place-holder colnum=\"3165\"/> appropriate way in which to address their offending behaviour. Those people fall into two main categories: those who are held on remand and those who default on their fines. As Christine Grahame pointed out, remand prisoners account for a staggering 49 per cent of all receptions into Scottish prisons. All have been charged with a crime but have not been convicted. Many of the crimes are alcohol related&#8212;a fact that is starkly illustrated by the latest crime statistics from Lanarkshire. In Lanarkshire, 40 per cent of all violent crime, 78 per cent of assaults, 88 per cent of incidents of criminal damage and 40 per cent of recorded domestic crimes are alcohol related. In addition, 19 per cent of police call-outs&#8212;one in five&#8212;are to pubs and clubs.</p><p>Clearly, there is a need to address the problem through putting more resources into rehab centres to tackle alcohol abuse and provide an alternative to custodial remand. The rehab centres will have more success because referrals will be made at the time of arrest, when people have to face up to the full consequences of their drinking problem. Furthermore, the provision of alcohol rehab centres fits neatly with the Justice 1 Committee's recommendation that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Executive should ensure that there is sufficient investment in bail schemes to address the number of people on remand ... where bail would be appropriate\".</p><p>Equally, for the many people who are on remand, a possible alternative to custody is the use of restriction of liberty orders&#8212;more commonly referred to as tagging&#8212;to monitor the movement of those who are, for example, deemed likely to abscond while they await trial. However, in considering bail schemes, there is a crucial caveat. No one who represents a danger or a potential danger to the public should slip through the bail net. There must be rigid and stringent monitoring of those who are granted bail. That will ensure that cases such as the recent high-profile case involving George Everson&#8212;a paedophile who reoffended while he was on bail in June, after appearing before Arbroath sheriff court charged with the possession of thousands of pornographic photographs&#8212;are a thing of the past.</p><p>The second category of people who are suitable for alternative to custody disposals are fine defaulters. There are two types of fine defaulter&#8212;those who have the means to pay and can pay but wilfully choose not to pay, and those who genuinely cannot pay for one reason or another. For wilful defaulters, courts should make greater use of section 221 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which provides that, in any case in which a court considers it expedient, the court may issue a warrant to order a fine to be recovered by civil diligence. In addition, section 24 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provides that, where any fine has been imposed on an offender, <place-holder colnum=\"3166\"/> the court may apply for the fine to be recovered by means of deductions from income support benefit.</p><p>Supervised attendance orders have an important part to play for those who genuinely cannot pay. A recent pilot scheme in Hamilton has proved successful in using such orders to help to address problems that led to fine defaults in the first place. I urge the minister to go further and make supervised attendance orders a disposal of first instance rather than, as at present, a disposal that can be imposed only when, for example, an 18-year-old is brought before a court, fined and then defaults on the fine. Such orders would be much more effective in curbing youth crime and would be in line with the Executive's commitment to early intervention.</p><p>In conclusion, the success of alternatives to custody will depend to a large extent on the willingness to comply of those on whom they are imposed. Any breaches must be cracked down on with custodial sentences in order to safeguard the public&#8212;that view is endorsed by Mark Hodgkinson of the Association of Directors of Social Work. Equally, if alternatives to custody are to be successful, it is vital that they are not a soft option and are not perceived as being so. They must be adequately monitored, enforced and evaluated.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13304740", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alternatives to Custody"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Prison is the ultimate deterrent.

The use of private escorting during movement of abnormal loads would impact on and have consequences&#8212;all positive&#8212;for police resources, the efficiency of the haulage industry and the performance of the Scottish economy.</p><p>At present, police escorts are the norm in Scotland, whereas in England and other parts of the United Kingdom private escorts are used. The use of the police as the only means of escorting abnormal loads is not efficient, for either the police or the hauliers. It can result in drivers and crew being on duty and waiting around for hours on end without knowing exactly when they can set off. Of the hours on duty, only a relatively small percentage will involve actual driving time, because drivers have to wait until the police have dealt with the pressures of rush-hour traffic, or dealt with commitments as a result of having to implement some national campaign&#8212;such as a campaign on wearing seatbelts, or a campaign of spot checks on drink driving&#8212;or dealt with delays because of some incident such as a major road accident. That means that the hauliers have to cover the cost of having a crew on standby, waiting until the police are free to escort them.</p><p>It is clear that that cost&#8212;combined with the rise in fuel prices and the cost of the imminent introduction of the working time directive&#8212;cannot be sustained indefinitely by the industry without its <place-holder colnum=\"2393\"/> either passing the cost on to the consumer by means of an increased price for goods or, in the worst-case scenario, going to the wall.</p><p>Scottish manufacturers, who are already reeling from economic pressures, are particularly concerned about the high cost of transportation undermining their ability to compete in Europe, the rest of the world and even in the home market. Furthermore, the Government's programme on renewable energy is in danger of being knocked off track if huge wind turbines&#8212;a source of alternative energy&#8212;cannot be escorted and delivered on time. It costs approximately &#163;6,000 a day to hire the plant to erect wind turbines and an additional &#163;4,000 a day to pay for the construction team. That works out at a staggering &#163;10,000 a day that could be lost if there is any delay in delivery of the turbines. It is therefore not difficult to see that the issue of police escorts versus private escorts has major implications for the Scottish economy.</p><p>By contrast, private escorts will ensure that loads will be delivered to the marketplace more quickly and that the industry will be spared the additional problems and costs that are associated with the delays in the provision of police escorting services.</p><p>Crucially, the use of private escorts frees up police and releases experienced officers for normal police duties. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland acknowledged that in relation to the contracting out of court services to private escorts, which has resulted in the release of 300 police officers. At a time when policing levels dominate the law and order debate and the need for increased police numbers is widely recognised as a potentially major factor in restoring confidence in the criminal justice system, the chairman of ACPOS has made the valid point that the use of private escorting in court services&#8212;transport of prisoners and so on&#8212;releases fully trained and experienced officers. That contrasts favourably with increasing policing by recruiting new individuals, who have to be trained before they can assume their responsibilities, which entails delay in the provision of police officers and has cost implications. Therefore, it is encouraging that ACPOS is to set up a working party to look into the whole issue; members of the Road Haulage Association will form part of the group.</p><p>If private escorting is to be established in Scotland, the working party will need to determine a national policy that involves not just the police, but local authorities and other organisations. A national policy would include practical guidelines that cover the operation of the escort process. It would address escort vehicle positioning, taking into account load speed and size, and would specify the maximum size or weight of a load that <place-holder colnum=\"2394\"/> could qualify for private escort.</p><p>Of course, safety would remain paramount. The haulage industry assumes that the police would retain responsibility for escorting very large, heavy and slow-moving vehicles. The industry has a good record of safety throughout the United Kingdom; a recent example of its ability to cope responsibly with private escorting was when, because of a shortage of police, Ken Livingstone, as mayor of London, withdrew all police officers from escorting abnormal loads and diverted them to crime prevention. The hauliers were instructed to arrange their own private escorts. That shocked the industry, which was concerned about the safety implications with regard to traffic congestion in London. However, those fears have proved to be unfounded and the introduction of private escorting has proved to be a success.</p><p>In conclusion, private escorting operates successfully in America and throughout Europe. The creation of a working party by ACPOS is a welcome and necessary first step on the road&#8212;please forgive the pun&#8212;to the introduction of a policy for private escorting of abnormal loads in Scotland. I look forward to reading the report on the recommendations, which is due to be published in November.</p><p>I hope that today's debate will clarify the issues and crystallise the case in favour of introducing a private escorting policy, which will have tremendous benefits for the Scottish economy, the haulage industry and&#8212;by no means least&#8212;the police, by ensuring that more officers are available for operational duty to combat crime.</p>", "hdate": "2003-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302839", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Escorting of Abnormal Loads"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful that this time slot for members' business gives me the opportunity to raise this important issue.

To be frank, there is little point in catching criminals if the courts are not capable of dealing with them. On that point, I agree with <place-holder colnum=\"2078\"/> Michael Matheson; too many cases are being shelved. A startling example of that is the staggering 17,000 criminal cases that were dropped last year, which represents as many as 72 cases a day not making it to court. Furthermore, it is taking longer to bring the accused to trial&#8212;on average, three weeks longer than it did in 1998-99. The solution is to speed up the court system by properly resourcing the Procurator Fiscal Service with more procurators fiscal and by introducing weekend and evening courts to reduce the backlog.</p><p>Secondly, we must ensure that effective alternatives to custody are in place, with adequate sanctions for when breaches occur. Enforcement of existing alternatives to custody has given rise to concern because of the lack of proper supervision of community service orders, and because of cynicism and disillusion that so many fines go unpaid. Last year, 7,074 fine defaulters were sent to prison, which works out at a daily average of 61. Although they do not make a huge contribution to overcrowding in prisons because they stay for only short periods, fine defaulters are an unnecessary drain on the public purse. According to the Scottish Prison Service's annual report for 2001-02, the average cost of a prison place is &#163;30,177 per annum, which works out at &#163;82.66 a day. That money could be used to ensure that alternatives to custody, such as community service orders and supervised attendance orders, are properly resourced.</p><p>There are two categories of fine defaulters: those who genuinely cannot pay and those who are wilful fine defaulters. Those who genuinely cannot pay have the opportunity to opt for supervised attendance orders. That has worked well in Hamilton district court, where a social worker meets the fine defaulter prior to their appearance at the means court and helps them to fill out a form that accurately lists their income and necessary spending commitments. That exercise helps the defaulter to make a realistic evaluation of what, if anything, can be offered to the court to clear the debt. If it becomes apparent that the defaulter simply cannot pay, the social worker explains that a supervised attendance order is an alternative that is geared to sorting out the problem that led to the person's being unable to pay the fine and, if possible, to addressing the underlying causes of the behaviour, such as drink or drug abuse, that led to the imposition of the fine in the first place.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302016", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My colleague Annabel Goldie has highlighted two measures&#8212;ending automatic remission and putting more police on the street&#8212;that would play an important part in restoring confidence in the criminal justice system.

The issue is vital and&#8212;crucially&#8212;it is one over which the Parliament has the power to do something.

I have had almost 20 years' experience of&#8212;as the public see it&#8212;a real job at the chalkface and there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that discipline is the most important issue to be tackled if we are to improve standards in Scottish schools.</p><p>No one measure will of itself solve the problems that teachers face in coping with disruptive pupils, but a number of key areas must be addressed in order to tackle those problems seriously. We should start by recognising that discipline begins at home. For proof of that, if anyone needed it, we need look no further than primary 1 classes Scotland-wide, where it is, sadly, not uncommon to have a five-year-old child totally out of control.</p><p>Intervening early to curb that pattern of behaviour, which is learned at home, can be done only by working in partnership with parents. That is a potential problem in itself. The stereotype of a parent is of someone who is interested in their children's work and supportive of school. Although the vast majority of parents conform to that stereotype, a growing number of parents did not have a good learning experience and are now anti-school and anti-teacher. More needs to be done, therefore, to promote parenting skills and to break down the barriers that lead to a continuation, or even an escalation, of disruptive behaviour. North Lanarkshire Council is to be commended for promoting two booklets, published by the Family Caring Trust, that outline a commonsense approach to parenting.</p><p>The Scottish Executive, the SNP and the SSP all seem to favour a reduction in class sizes. That is a worthwhile aim if no discipline problems exist. In response to Alex Neil, I can confirm that our stance is a point of principle, but it is not about numbers. The principle is that there must be the flexibility and the mechanism for removing disruptive pupils from the class; if that mechanism does not exist, the benefits that people hope will accrue from smaller class sizes will not materialise. That must be the Scottish Executive's first priority.</p><p>In primary schools, an overcrowded curriculum puts pressure on teachers to cover too many subjects, many of which are activity based. That in turn provides more opportunity for potentially <place-holder colnum=\"1986\"/> disruptive pupils to play up. More emphasis on core subjects would aid learning and help to improve education standards and discipline. East Ayrshire Council's framework for intervention provides a systematic approach to dealing with low-level disruptive behaviour in the classroom and is worthy of further examination as a model for a comprehensive strategy to tackle discipline problems.</p><p>If the minister is serious about promoting better behaviour, he must realise that there are limitations to the Executive's mainstreaming policy. For some children currently attending special schools, mainstream education is simply not appropriate. Alana Ross, president of the EIS, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Sometimes including one child can be to the detriment of others.\"</p><p>There must still be alternative education provision for some young people who need it.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13301744", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Better Behaviour, Better Learning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the minister on choosing the subject of the debate.

That statement is no less true today than it was when Gladstone made it more than 100 years ago. As such, it underpins any debate on modernising justice. Criminal <place-holder colnum=\"1090\"/> prosecutions are initiated by the Crown in the public interest. It therefore follows that any delay in the processing and disposal of prosecutions is not in the public interest and is in effect justice denied.</p><p>In his report \"Improving Practice: the 2002 Review of the Practice and Procedure of the High Court of Justiciary\", Lord Bonomy highlights the problems that have led to delays. Those include a dramatic increase in the volume of cases referred to the court in recent years, accompanied by an increase in the number of indictments and adjournments. Given that background, the Conservative amendment has sought to focus on the proposals in the Bonomy report and the court reform bill white paper that aim to address those issues.</p><p>The white paper proposals to clarify the existing statutory provision, which are designed to enable the sentence to be discounted for an early plea of guilty, and the proposal to increase sentencing powers in sheriff and jury cases from three to five years, together with Lord Bonomy's suggestion that the greater use of closed-circuit television be considered for videoconferencing to cut down on unnecessary travel between prison and court and to provide victims and their families with a live link to the court, allowing them to see and hear what is happening, are to be welcomed as they attempt to make more efficient the processing and disposal of criminal cases.</p><p>However, as my colleague Annabel Goldie pointed out, the proposed extension of the 110-day rule is cause for concern. In essence it is a measure that seeks to treat the symptom of the problem rather than address the underlying cause, which Nicola Sturgeon and Stewart Maxwell detailed comprehensively. No matter how well intentioned the proposal, it must be a retrograde step. In effect, it delays justice for victim and accused alike. In that regard I agree&#8212;probably to both our surprise&#8212;with Colin Fox.</p><p>The minister has attempted to play down the importance of resource, but if inadequacy of resource is preventing the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from delivering&#8212;the alarming increase from the 1997 figure of 3,081 cases marked \"no proceedings\" to a staggering 17,094 cases in 2002 suggests that it is&#8212;the answer is patently to increase the resource.</p><p>Margaret Smith pledged to give the justice system back to the people, but I note that she made no commitment to provide the resource necessary for that to happen.</p><p>It is pointless arresting criminals if they are never brought to trial. Therefore, there is a desperate requirement for more resource at all levels of the justice system to, for example, <place-holder colnum=\"1091\"/> increase the number of fiscals and establish weekend and evening sittings of the court.</p><p>Unlike many Scottish Executive-inspired debates&#8212;based on vague motions and devised primarily to deflect criticism from the Executive and its policies&#8212;this debate has been worth while.

They have not been short of suggestions for what I should say&#8212;some serious, some absurd. My favourite suggestion&#8212;made, perhaps, with the Holyrood project in mind&#8212;was that I should tell everyone that I know a cracking wee painter called Malki. I am happy to confirm that I do.</p><p>It is not only a privilege, but an onerous responsibility for any individual to be elected to serve the people as their representative, be it in local government or at parliamentary level. I entered politics because politics is all about people, and the ultimate honour that a person can have is to be given the opportunity&#8212;which, as elected members, we all have&#8212;to make a difference and attempt to improve the quality of life for people in Scotland. That said, I am conscious that the title MSP is not, for a growing number of people, a badge of honour. When they comment with feeling that the Parliament has exceeded their expectations, it is safe to assume that they are not being complimentary.

However, is it any wonder that people are disillusioned with the Parliament when the Minister for Education and Young People lodges a motion in which the Executive promises to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"work in partnership with young people to help meet their aspirations\",</p><p>but then doggedly insists that head teachers should comply with a policy that makes it virtually impossible for them to exclude disruptive pupils, thereby preventing the majority of well behaved, hard-working pupils who are keen and eager to learn from getting on with their education?</p><p>Peter Peacock and Fiona Hyslop both highlighted proposals to introduce smaller class sizes but there is, to be frank, no sense in reducing class sizes if disruptive pupils are to remain in the classroom. Head teachers should be given the flexibility to set their own discipline policies, because they are best placed to decide on the policy that will drive up standards and attainment levels in their individual schools.</p><p>Linda Fabiani mentioned Earnock High School, in Hamilton, which is a centre of excellence that is under threat of closure. She will be pleased to know that a decision about its closure has been deferred and that a further period of consultation on its future is to follow.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the coalition's paternalistic one-size-fits-all approach merely stifles the excellence and achievement that Labour and the Liberal Democrats state they are committed to promoting. Worse still, the Scottish Executive's failure to tackle discipline in schools is having a knock-on effect in that it is the same small minority of youths who cause disruption in the classroom who go on to cause havoc and chaos in their local communities.</p><p>Our amendment to the motion recognises the central role played by parents and families in enabling young people to become responsible adults. That is certainly the case in addressing youth crime&#8212;parents and children must all face up to their respective responsibilities, about which Susan Deacon spoke effectively during the debate.</p><p>There must, in order to tackle the vexing problem of youths who become repeat offenders, be early intervention. We must identify early the parents who might be struggling to cope with children who are most at risk of becoming involved in crime.
