The first item of business this afternoon is time for reflection. Our time for reflection leader today is Trishna Singh, who is director of the Sikh Sanjog and the Punjabi Junction social enterprise project in Leith.</p><p>Trishna Singh (Sikh Sanjog and Punjabi Junction Social Enterprise Project): Presiding Officer, I thank you for inviting me to address Parliament.</p><p>Today I am representing the Scottish Sikh community in my capacity as founder and director of Sikh Sanjog, which is Scotland&#8217;s only organisation that works with Sikh women and their families. Since 1989, we have been empowering and inspiring women of all ages and races to rise above the internal and external discrimination that hinders their progress.</p><p>We have developed and established a range of methods of connecting with women, and of encouraging them in their learning and creating practical opportunities for them to develop their skills and knowledge. Our aim is to close the equalities gap, especially in terms of disadvantage and exclusion relating to education, skills, training and employment.</p><p>Our ethos is based on the teachings of Sikhism. Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, taught us that there is, in addition to the spiritual dimension, an important social dimension to the Sikh religion that focuses on social equality, rejection of caste discrimination and centrality of community service. The most revolutionary declaration of Sikhism in the 15th century was equality asserted to women. Essentially, Guru Nanak created an equal seat for everyone at the table and an opportunity for dialogue where none had existed. Guru Nanak embraced the entire human race. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Recognise the divine light of god in each individual, treat all equally without prejudice of race, caste, religion, gender or social position.&#8221;</p><p>As Sikh Sanjog goes forward to celebrate its 25th anniversary this year, we continue to improve communication between professions and political parties on the needs of the Sikh and other black and minority ethnic women. The needs of Sikh women have changed over the past 25 years but, sadly, they have not gone away and, as within many disadvantaged groups, the women are further marginalised. Today, the voices of women from within BME communities are still unheard. There is still discrimination in terms of opportunity, and barriers still hold them back from making an effective contribution to Scottish society.</p><p>As Guru Nanak inspires every Sikh to respect every individual, I see that reflected in the Scottish Parliament. Social justice is a natural consequence of civic responsibility and reminds us that we cannot be insular.</p><p>Many Sikhs, including my parents, made this their home over 70 years ago and have added to the rich cultural heritage of this country. We are proud to be known as Scottish Sikhs. What happens in Scotland matters to all of us, irrespective of where we have come from.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838902", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Time for Reflection"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Good afternoon.

The first item of business is time for reflection. Our time for reflection leader today is Pastor John Leitch of the Glenboig Christian Fellowship.</p><p>Pastor John Leitch (Glenboig Christian Fellowship): Presiding Officer and members of the Scottish Parliament, Luke chapter 4, verse 4 says:</p><p>&#8220;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.&#8221;</p><p>You are all no doubt familiar with the statement, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this by the book.&#8221; It generally comes up in situations in which people want to ensure that everything is perfect or there is no comeback, but I would like to reflect this afternoon on doing it by the Book. As a Christian, I refer of course to the Bible, which I believe to be the word of God. Even if you do not share my convictions, though, there is no reason why you cannot benefit from the wisdom, guidance and direction that it offers.</p><p>Our land was once known as the &#8220;land of the Book&#8221; or &#8220;Bible-loving Scotland&#8221;. We have a tremendous heritage and history, built on the principles of scripture. Much of our judicial system was based on the premises of scripture, such as the necessity of two witnesses to confirm a matter.</p><p>Many of our public buildings have scripture inscribed in stone. On the lintel of our libraries we read:</p><p>&#8220;The entrance to his word gives light&#8221;.</p><p>The original motto of my home city, Glasgow, was:</p><p>&#8220;Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of his name.&#8221;</p><p>Likewise, Edinburgh had the motto:</p><p>&#8220;Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman wakes in vain.&#8221;</p><p>Even Westminster bowed to the wisdom, with the motto:</p><p>&#8220;Guard the city O Lord.&#8221;</p><p>If we turn to our halls of learning, the same respect and deference is given to the word. The University of Aberdeen&#8217;s motto is,</p><p>&#8220;Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&#8221;,</p><p>and the University of Glasgow&#8217;s is:</p><p>&#8220;The way, the truth, the life.&#8221;</p><p>So we have good precedent for &#8220;going by the Book.&#8221; It still contains excellent policies for any society, covering social behaviour, justice, welfare, commerce and the uplifting of the poor. Its wisdom is classless, non-racial and is available to whosoever will. It has value for the individual:</p><p>&#8220;Your word is a light to my feet and a lamp to my path.&#8221;</p><p>It has value for the nation:</p><p>&#8220;Sin is a reproach but righteousness exalts a nation&#8221;.</p><p>It has value for the world:</p><p>&#8220;God so loved the world he gave us Jesus who came not to condemn but to save.&#8221;</p><p>We could well benefit the nation if we would simply &#8220;do it by the Book.&#8221; Thank you for allowing me to share these reflections with you.

Our time for reflection leader today is the Rev Helen Cook, from Kingussie parish church.</p><p>The Rev Helen Cook (Kingussie Parish Church): Presiding Officer, thank you for the invitation. It is a privilege to share thought for the day.</p><p>Good afternoon. In my work as a chaplain at the local hospital, I have come across a rather astonishing book. It is called &#8220;Reflections of Life: Words of Comfort and Encouragement&#8221;. It is beautifully illustrated by a Lewis girl&#8212;a beautiful artist&#8212;and was produced by NHS Education for Scotland. It is the result of a collaboration between 13 different belief groups, some who have faith in God and others whose belief is in humanity or nature.</p><p>Why do I call this an astonishing book and consider it worthy of your attention? There are two reasons. First, it is based on the belief that we are all spiritual and that when we face times of stress and difficulty for reasons of illness, loss and bereavement, we need spiritual care. The book will be held in hospitals and other places to comfort and encourage people who are in difficult times&#8212;not replacing but adding to the work of their own belief communities. The book is based on the premise that we are all spiritual beings.</p><p>Secondly, the book is the result of a unique collaboration between 13 belief groups, which was facilitated by a former surgeon from the Belford hospital. Everything that is written in the book was agreed to by all 13 belief groups before it went in, which is an amazing achievement.</p><p>Like those for whom the book was written, we all have times of stress and anxiety when we are very vulnerable and need words of comfort and encouragement. So I will share with you three brief excerpts from the book. Maybe one of them will speak to you. I will not tell you which group donated the words.</p><p>On anxiety:</p><p>&#8220;We become very weak and unsettled when something unexpected happens, but we must be strong and accept God&#8217;s way.&#8221;</p><p>On peace:</p><p>&#8220;May quietness descend upon my limbs,</p><p>my speech, my breath, my eyes, my ears;</p><p>may all my senses wax clear and strong</p><p>as I hear your voice</p><p>within that void</p><p>of your loving presence and peace.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, on hope:</p><p>&#8220;What is true of the individual will be tomorrow true of the whole nation if individuals will but refuse to lose heart and hope.&#8221;</p><p>May we all find comfort and encouragement for our spirits.

I do not have enough time to go through all the recommendations, but I emphasise that the whole committee agreed that in the next session of the Scottish Parliament we should consider a further legislative consent motion following the final deliberations on and amendments to the bill at Westminster.</p><p>The final say on whether we approve the bill will, therefore, come in the next session of Parliament. It is right and proper that this Parliament has an opportunity to consider and examine whether the recommendations that the Scotland Bill Committee worked so hard to produce have been heeded. That will be the real test of the Westminster Government and of whether it has listened to what the committee has said.</p><p>I welcome the proposals for further powers for the Scottish Parliament. In particular, I support the devolution of airgun legislation, on which, as Brian Adam said, we in the SNP have campaigned for many years. Although I believe that all firearms legislation should be a matter for this Parliament, devolving airgun legislation is a step forward.</p><p>It is important to say that Brian Adam and I were very clear&#8212;and made it clear from the beginning&#8212;that we would work with the committee to do what we could to improve the bill and to ensure that the committee&#8217;s report was as robust as it could be. Despite some comments to the contrary, I think that few would dispute that Brian Adam and I made such a contribution.</p><p>In particular, the committee recommended that the capital and revenue borrowing limits should be increased. It is fair to say that the original figures were plucked out of thin air by the Treasury and the Scotland Office. They could give no reason for choosing their figures for capital funding in the bill; there were assertions that it was perhaps to do with the cost of the Forth bridge. However, I think that the committee&#8217;s recommendations on increased limits for capital and revenue borrowing will assist the Scottish Government in the future. The committee was unanimous in the view that those limits should be increased.</p><p>The committee also recommended that powers to set corporation tax should be extended to Scotland, or that that should at least be considered if such powers were given to any other part of the United Kingdom, particularly Northern Ireland, where the situation is currently being examined. Although I have argued and will always argue that Scotland needs the right to set corporation tax, it is very welcome that the other members of the committee have come some way towards the idea that if other parts of the United Kingdom are allowed to set corporation tax, Scotland should be too.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646515", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I express my thanks to Stephen Imrie and the clerking team to the Scotland Bill Committee: they were outstanding in the support that they gave to every committee member, and they are a credit to the Parliament.

From the time of Calman, right through the time of the Scotland Bill Committee, it has been asserted that this Parliament will be responsible for raising 35 per cent of what it spends, but that is simply not true. The figure of 35 per cent from Calman has been considered, and SPICe&#8212;at my instigation, I have to say, not the committee&#8217;s instigation&#8212;asserted that the figure was nearer 30 per cent. However, that figure of 30 per cent included council tax, which is not the responsibility of this Parliament. If we strip out the council tax, the true figure is nearer 25 per cent.

HM Treasury and the Secretary of State for Scotland claimed that the estimate for setting up a Scottish taxpayer base would be &#163;45 million&#8212;a cost that the Scottish Parliament will have to bear. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said that the cost could actually go up to &#163;150 million. The Liberal Democrat secretary of state defended the figure of &#163;45 million, but refused my invitation to agree to cap the figure if he was so confident about it.

The community had had grant application after grant application to the Coalfields Regeneration Trust turned down over the years, and the purpose of the meeting was to find out why Glenrothes was not a coalfield area. The explanation was that the 1999 map of coalfield areas that was drawn up by the UK Government was based on a research study that highlighted areas where, in 1981, more than 10 per cent of the population were miners. That was then overlaid with areas of multiple deprivation. Those of us present were astonished to find out that Glenrothes&#8212;which was created as a new town in 1948 to service the ill-fated Glenrothes pit&#8212;had never been on the original map. So, year after year, the money that has been made available to other communities has not been made available to Glenrothes.</p><p>By any definition, Glenrothes or at least part of it&#8212;especially the older areas of Woodside and Auchmuty&#8212;must be a coalfield community; yet, since 1999, it has not received a penny because it has never been designated as a coalfield community. The name of the venue for that meeting&#8212;the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation&#8212;gives a clue as to the importance of coal mining to Glenrothes. It is beyond belief that, since 1999, the UK Government has not regarded Glenrothes as a coalfield community. I would be grateful if the minister would give an undertaking that he will work with the UK Government to ensure that there is a fairer acknowledgement of what a coalfield community is and that part of Glenrothes will be included in that.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644826", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Given that my grandfather was killed in the pits and my father was invalided out of the pits after an accident, it is no surprise that I will concentrate my remarks on the coalfield communities in Fife.

That is true. I have some respect for John Park, but not when he uses people in the coalfield communities that he represents as an excuse for making political points. My respect for him is further diminished by his utter failure, which is shared by every Labour MSP in the chamber, to condemn the shameful treatment by the Labour Government of our ex-miners and their families. Some 2,000 miners in Scotland died while they were waiting for compensation that they were entitled to, while the Labour Government went to court to try to stop the payments. More than 8,000 miners in the UK waited more than 10 years for a settlement. Helen Eadie says that she is proud of that record, but it is a record that no person could be proud of.

If the bridge had to close completely or for remedial work to be carried out, as Alan Russell of Fife Chamber of Commerce said, it would cost the Scottish economy &#163;1.5 billion a year.</p><p>The effect of closure on Fife would be devastating. Businesses would seek to relocate south of the Forth, and members of the public would not be able to get to work in Edinburgh and the Lothians. Congestion on other routes to the west over the Kincardine bridge would bring chaos to the towns and villages along those routes.</p><p>It is interesting that the people who have campaigned for years against a new crossing now argue that we should wait and see whether dehumidification works. We cannot wait and see. Even if dehumidification&#8212;that is the last time that I will attempt to say the word&#8212;works, the bridge has already lost more than 10 per cent of its strength. That strength cannot be replaced unless the cables themselves are replaced. Replacing the <place-holder colnum=\"31592\"/> cables would mean closing the bridge to allow the work to be done, which is simply not an option.</p><p>Today the talking is over. Today is the day that the uncertainty ends. There will be a new bridge and work on it will start next year. That is great news for Fife businesses and the people of Fife, and it brings the debate to an end. Now the work needs to begin.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21142749", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Crossing Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to welcome my friend Keith Brown to his new post and to acknowledge the work that Stewart Stevenson has done.

That represents a considerable investment. Through the skills strategy, there is an opportunity for the Scottish funding council and Skills Development Scotland to ensure not only that we are investing in the right kind of skills but that the investment is targeted to <place-holder colnum=\"29494\"/> where those skills are needed most, such as in the renewable energy industry, and in the areas that would benefit most.</p><p>Christina McKelvie made particularly good points about the need to identify the skill sets of the future. Our problem is that in identifying those skill sets, we need also to recognise that there are skill sets that are needed here and now to enable us to attract investment in, for example, the Fife energy park and to enable people to work on the new Forth bridge and the aircraft carriers. While we must consider which skill sets will be needed in the future, there is a much greater immediate need to ensure that Fife in particular is skilled up to be able to take advantage of the exciting new developments.</p><p>In my area of central Fife, which covers Glenrothes and Levenmouth, many jobs are coming in the renewable energy sector. If we lose the opportunity to ensure that local people&#8212;particularly those from Levenmouth and Methil, which is one of the areas of greatest deprivation&#8212;have the skill sets to enable them to take advantage of those jobs, we, as a Parliament and a Government, will have failed.</p><p>The Scottish funding council and Skills Development Scotland are sometimes behind the curve with regard to the skill sets that are needed. We must ensure that the bureaucracy that surrounds the partnerships does not get in the way of efficient delivery.</p><p>That brings me on to the work that is done by Adam Smith College in my constituency. On Monday, I visited the Leven campus and saw the work that Sandra Paterson and others undertake in supporting people who are improving their computer skills or learning them for the first time. I met many of the students, some of whom are now going into employment having learned the skills and confidence that are needed in the employment market.</p><p>I had the pleasure last month of visiting the future skills centre on the Adam Smith Glenrothes campus. The new centre brings together the engineering, construction, renewables and science facilities under one roof. David Whitton, Christopher Harvie and I had a very good dinner last Friday night with the senior staff of Adam Smith College to discuss all of these issues.</p><p>The new centre is designed to meet the needs of the Fife economy now and in the future. Its close proximity to Methil energy park is a positive plus in attracting companies to the park, and it is essential for the economic development of Glenrothes and Levenmouth. It has added nearly 10,000ft2 to the existing campus and contains 31 specialist workshops with three purpose-built laboratories. There is a renewable energy suite for <place-holder colnum=\"29495\"/> wind, hydro and solar studies, and the centre has the best non-destructive testing centre in any location from the east coast of Scotland down to Hartlepool in England.</p><p>The future skills centre will work across the disciplines to produce multidisciplinary graduates, and I have no doubt that it is one of the best such centres in Scotland, if not the United Kingdom.

I am happy to acknowledge that the Conservative Government built more houses in 1995 than Labour did in its term of office in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP Government has kick-started council house building, introduced the home owners support fund and invested in shared equity schemes.</p><p>Housing has changed completely since the 1970s. In the 1970s, the vast majority of people lived in rented council homes. Very few people in Scotland owned their homes. By the 1990s, the percentage of people living in council houses had declined rapidly, partly as a result of right to buy, but also because of the drive of the banks and building societies to increase the number of mortgages for first-time house buyers.</p><p>I welcome the work that the Government is doing because it is important that we have a fundamental think about housing for the future. We also need to have a fundamental agreement about what a house is for. Other members have referred to that. Is a house somewhere in which we live, and perhaps bring up a family, or is a house more than that? Is a house a way of making profit once it is sold? Should the economy continue to be driven by house prices? As we have seen, when the housing bubble burst, housing prices fell, and they do not look like recovering any time soon. The economy cannot be driven by ever-rising house prices.</p><p>Why do we measure prosperity by the price of a home? We need to ask why an extremely successful country such as Switzerland has one of the highest rates of rented housing and one of the lowest rates of house ownership anywhere in the world. If rented housing is okay for the likes of Switzerland, why is it not okay for the likes of Scotland? I have never been fixated by housing tenure. Regardless of whether we are talking about community housing, housing in the private rented sector or housing that people own, what is important is that the house that people live in is affordable, safe and warm. It is our responsibility as members of the Parliament to ensure that we keep that in mind as we go forward.</p><p>As the minister said, new households are being formed at an increasing rate because of the growing number of single people and family break-<place-holder colnum=\"28612\"/> ups. Recently, I was reminiscing with someone about 1975, when my husband and I got married. We got a house from Glenrothes Development Corporation four weeks before we got married and, after we had got married, we had to produce our wedding certificate so that the corporation could ensure that we were genuinely married&#8212;there was no living in sin in Glenrothes in 1975. That is the not the situation now. We have far better legislation, which ensures that people can make their own choices about whether to get married. People's choice of lifestyle does not militate against their getting rented accommodation.</p><p>Factors such as family break-ups and people's aspiration to have their own home mean that the number of households that are being formed is increasing, and we need to ensure that we address that as we go forward. There is a great need for us all to work together to ensure that we provide the right kind of housing&#8212;which must be safe and affordable&#8212;in the right places, where people want it. We must put party politics aside and work together to ensure that that happens.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997167", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What I said was that the SNP Government has built more houses than have been built at any time since 1982.

As a self-confessed geek about electoral systems, I thank the Green party for providing me with a timely fix.<place-holder colnum=\"25853\"/></p><p>It is important for us to understand why we are debating PR today. It is because the Labour Government, in its death throes, is desperately trying to find a lifeline for when it is thrown out of office next Thursday. Labour members have watched the return of the Tories in the Scottish Parliament through PR, and they realise that the Labour Party might need PR for itself at Westminster in the future.</p><p>I agree with the Greens that STV PR is necessary for Westminster. There is no point in trying to renew that discredited institution by bringing in more new members of Parliament than at any time for about 100 years if we do not also renew the electoral system that encouraged some of the excesses. Channel 4 did an analysis that showed that those who were most at fault&#8212;those who made the most claims&#8212;were those who were in seats that had the biggest majorities.</p><p>STV PR puts the voter in charge and gives every voter a voice. Perhaps after yesterday's events in Rochdale, the Labour Party does not really want voters to have that voice. STV PR takes the power out of the hands of political parties. It allows the voter to choose between parties and between candidates in each of those parties. If women wish to vote for only women candidates, they can do so. If they want to vote for only male candidates, they can do that, too; STV PR allows them to do so. If people wish to vote only for their preferred political party and for no other, there is nothing to stop them.</p><p>STV PR will stop forever the obscenity of the only people who have an impact in a UK general election being a handful of voters in a handful of marginal seats that change from one election to the next. That is what determines the UK Government. STV PR will give everyone an equal vote, regardless of where they live in the UK. Everyone's vote is not equal while marginal seats and the support of people at the polls in those seats are, frankly, courted and bought by political parties.</p><p>At the moment, Scotland has four different voting systems&#8212;local government, Westminster, Europe and the Scottish Parliament&#8212;and that is unsustainable. I worked hard to ensure STV PR for local government, and I believe that it should be introduced for elections to the Scottish Parliament. It is imperative that the Westminster Parliament also introduces STV PR.</p><p>I want to pick up on a couple of points that were made earlier in the debate. I found Murdo Fraser's amendment and speech to be quite shameful. Although it is true that BNP members were elected to Europe under a proportional representation system, the fact is that people voted for them, and they did so because the Labour Party and the Tories have all but abandoned constituencies to <place-holder colnum=\"25854\"/> the BNP. It is worth reminding ourselves that BNP members have been elected in council elections all over England under the first-past-the-post system. It is not the electoral system that is at fault for letting in the BNP; frankly, it is down to the other political parties.</p><p>I want to pick up very gently on the Greens&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764404", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Democratic Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Green party for bringing us the debate on STV PR.

There were times during the summer when I felt that I was in a parallel universe. Companies were telling me about the unreasonable conditions placed on them by the banks while Lord Mandelson and the Treasury were telling me that HM Government was supporting companies and instructing the banks to support them.</p><p>Qualtronic, which had been in Glenrothes for 25 years and employed 35 people, was experiencing cash-flow problems because of a delay in placing orders by its major customers. Everybody recognised that it was only a delay and that the orders were never going to be cancelled because they were working for the aerospace industry&#8212;the blue-chip companies. Qualtronic approached its bank because it had been advised that it was eligible for the UK Government's loan guarantee scheme.

Decision-making on individual loans is fully delegated to participating lenders and is done on commercial grounds. ... Where there is public sector investment in financial institutions these stakes are managed at arm's length and on an independent basis.\"</p><p>So much for the UK Government's support for businesses. Despite the fact that the public have bailed out the banks to the extent that our grandchildren will still be paying off that debt, the banks are thumbing their noses at the UK Government and forcing companies such as Qualtronic out of business. Qualtronic went into liquidation and 35 workers were paid off. It was a successful business that was forced to the wall by the banks.

Not only was the Polish officer class practically wiped out at Katyn, many intellectuals and others also perished.

I am using the word \"represented\" very loosely; I will come back to that in a moment. By the time the women came to see me, withdrawing from the agreement with Stefan Cross Solicitors would have cost them more than &#163;3,000.

Those events, along with member-sponsored exhibitions, offer groups of all kinds an opportunity to engage with the Parliament by presenting their work to members.</p><p>The SPCB is committed to an annual programme of major events, ranging from committee-sponsored events such as business in the parliament to events that examine key issues for Scotland, such as Scotland's Futures Forum seminars. We know from feedback that hosting high-profile exhibitions such as the World Press Photo exhibition and programmes such as our groundbreaking festival of politics can play an important role in drawing in new audiences and encouraging them to learn more about the Parliament. The moving stories exhibition is a new method of community outreach, which is touring venues across Scotland this year. Various engagement events have been held at exhibition venues, including receptions for local groups and twilight training sessions for teachers.</p><p>In late November, the SPCB will pilot a new engagement event aimed specifically at grass-roots community groups and organisations that have not yet engaged.

To be hosted by the Presiding Officer, and with several members already on board as speakers, the conference will focus on the practical aspects of engagement.</p><p>We have established the education and community partnerships team to focus on reaching communities beyond the central belt and those sections of society that are traditionally underrepresented in engagement programmes.</p><p>A new pilot, the community partnership project, is now running, with groups from three audiences that research has shown are underrepresented in public engagement. Those groups are young people, especially difficult-to-reach 16 to 24-year-olds, people with disabilities, and people from <place-holder colnum=\"19854\"/> black and ethnic minority backgrounds. The real strength of the project lies in the fact that it encourages local people to use their issues and enthusiasm to engage with the Parliament. For example, one of the project partners has already submitted an e-petition on national health service translation and interpreting services.</p><p>The SPCB is backing a further pilot project on committee outreach, which will result in an incremental increase in the scale of community engagement support accompanying each outward committee meeting. That is being carried out initially with the Public Petitions Committee, but it might be possible to consider similar support for other committees in the future.</p><p>Educating young people and supporting teaching about the Parliament has been a key service since 1999. Over the past year, the SPCB has increased capacity for both the inward and outreach educational programmes. The inward service has almost doubled uptake from young people to 11,300, with about 35 per cent of them coming from schools that had not previously taken part in the education programme. The outreach programme has held sessions in schools in 88 per cent of constituencies in Scotland, supporting engagement with 110 members.</p><p>I am pleased to note&#8212;I am sure that all members are, too&#8212;that this week the SPCB has introduced free guided tours, thereby making all aspects of visiting and engaging with the Parliament free to the public.</p><p>The SPCB will continue to work with the Public Petitions Committee and all the other parliamentary committees to ensure that the work that is being carried out across the Parliament supports our aspirations to engage comprehensively with all the people of Scotland, regardless of where they live and whatever their personal circumstances are.</p><p>As we move into the second decade of our re-established Parliament, we note the many successes and the many challenges, but we all recognise that the work does not stand still, and that more needs to be done.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20195663", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Petitions Process Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Public Petitions Committee has done the Parliament a great service by holding its thorough inquiry into the workings of the committee and the petitions system.

I am aware that a statutory consultation is on-going between the company and the unions, which has yet to run its course It is ironic that the one area that will benefit from the news of the closure of the Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock is my constituency of Central Fife, because it is the one area that understands the devastating blow of the closure of that plant. In the village of Markinch, where I live, we understand only too well what it means to lose an iconic brand. In 1983, when the Distillers Company Ltd closed the Haig bottling plant in <place-holder colnum=\"19688\"/> Markinch, 340 people were made redundant and 220 workers were transferred to Leven.</p><p>Last year, many members travelled by train to Markinch for the Glenrothes by-election. They cannot have failed to notice the red brick buildings beside the station, which used to house Haig's. Indeed, the Liberals and the Conservatives had their campaign headquarters in the old Haig's building.</p><p>Markinch is a village of fewer than 3,000 people. Haig's had been on the site in Markinch for more than 100 years. Nearly every household in the village had at least one person who worked there. When the Haig brand moved from its home in Markinch, we, too, knew the real effects&#8212;economic and emotional&#8212;of an iconic brand being moved from its home.</p><p>Around the same time that Distillers closed Haig's, it also removed 11 of its malt whisky distilleries in Scotland. The MP for the area, Willie Hamilton, and Harry Ewing MP, who spent most of his life in Leven&#8212;and who sadly died last year&#8212;managed to secure an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on 4 March 1983. I urge members to read the <em>Hansard</em> report of that debate, because, like me, they will be amazed to see that the arguments that were used against Distillers are identical to those that have been used in the Kilmarnock campaign against Diageo today. Those arguments are about the lack of consultation and social responsibility and the company walking away from an iconic brand.</p><p>The rationalisation of the whisky industry in Scotland did not begin with Diageo; it has been going on for a long time. I know that the task force and the local MSP Willie Coffey and Des Browne have worked hard and will continue to do so to ensure that a climate is created that will attract new employment to Kilmarnock. I recognise the huge challenge that that presents, but I am sure that those involved will not stint in their efforts to overcome this blow to the communities.</p><p>I welcomed the original decision and the final decision by Diageo to invest &#163;100 million in Leven. As has been said, Levenmouth is an area of high and long-term unemployment; it has never recovered from the pits being shut down. However, I have great hopes for the energy park in Methil. Diageo is undoubtedly Levenmouth's largest employer. It has already invested heavily over the years in Leven and Cameronbridge. The whole of the UK white spirit industry, including Gordon's gin, as well as grain whisky is produced at Cameronbridge.</p><p>Haig's took over the Cameronbridge distillery in 1822, but there had been a distillery on the site for a number of years. Cameronbridge was the first distillery in the world to produce grain whisky.<place-holder colnum=\"19689\"/></p><p>I was delighted when Diageo announced that it intended to build a &#163;65 million bioenergy park at the distillery. It is a matter of pride to me that the oldest grain distillery in the world is now at the forefront of renewable technology. The new bioenergy plant will generate nearly all the steam and electricity needed to operate Cameronbridge. It will result in 56,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> being removed from the air, which is the equivalent of removing 44,000 cars from the streets of Scotland. More important, it will result in a huge saving in energy costs. That investment has enabled Leven and Cameronbridge to compete world wide.</p><p>I know that I did not make myself popular when I argued that the investment that Diageo had earmarked for Leven had to continue. It was my view then, and it is my view now, that if the investment does not go into Leven, the long-term future of Leven will be put at risk. I do not regret what I did.</p><p>It is imperative that Future Skills Scotland and others work with the people of Kilmarnock to provide training and reskilling. However, it is a fact that the new jobs in Leven present a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the area. As others have said, it is an area of high unemployment, with people living on benefits, and has the third lowest average wage of any constituency in Scotland.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary, once it is clear&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Diageo"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by expressing my sympathy for the workforce at Kilmarnock, who now face the possibility of redundancy or transferring to Leven.

However, as the constituency MSP for the Diageo plants in Leven and Cameron Bridge, I have a duty no less than Willie Coffey's to ensure that those plants have a long-term and sustainable future and I know that he understands that.</p><p>No one wants to see any jobs lost anywhere in Scotland, but my first priority is my constituency. I was grateful for the cabinet secretary's assurances this afternoon about the future of the Leven and Cameron Bridge facilities. However, there is real concern about the long-term future in Leven if all the promised investment is to be switched from Leven to Kilmarnock, as the task force is reported to propose. Diageo in Leven employs 500 people and is the largest employer in the area. Cameron Bridge has been producing whisky on the same site for almost 200 years. It is <place-holder colnum=\"19182\"/> not some fly-by-night operation that has just come in from nowhere&#8212;it has been there for 200 years. Cameron Bridge is close to Windygates and at one point it employed practically the whole of Windygates. My friend Councillor David Alexander from Windygates is the first person in his family for almost 150 years who has not worked at Cameron Bridge. We therefore have a whisky heritage, too, and it is important that that is recognised.</p><p>Diageo in Leven and Cameron Bridge also has a loyal workforce. Leven houses 17 production lines, five of which are dedicated to whisky. As Ted Brocklebank said, the base product of Johnnie Walker whisky is old Cameron Brig, which is almost impossible to buy anywhere round about the constituency. The remainder of the lines in Leven&#8212;this is very important&#8212;are dedicated to bottling white spirit, including Gordon's gin, Smirnoff vodka, Captain Morgan rum and Tanqueray, and another 135 Diageo product lines. I understand the desire to keep jobs in Kilmarnock, which is the home of Johnnie Walker, the leading brand of Scottish whisky. However, it is essential that Diageo continues to invest in the Leven plant.</p><p>I support the desire to bottle all whisky in Scotland, but I also support the workers in Leven. Some of the arguments that are being used in the campaign leave Leven in a very vulnerable position, given the range of other national drinks that are bottled there. Leven won those products against internal competition from other Diageo companies around the word; it won because the productivity is high there and, more important, investment has been put into the plant. In addition, the workforce is first class. Diageo must continue to put in investment to secure and improve the existing lines, or we run the risk in the long term that the lines and jobs in Leven could be lost not just to somewhere else in Scotland but overseas.</p><p>I appreciate the cabinet secretary's comments today, but I urge him to be careful with the task force proposals in case Leven is disadvantaged by them. Like Kilmarnock, Levenmouth is an area of high unemployment. We know what it is like to lose jobs and what it was like when the mines shut down and the shipyard shut down. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in Scotland. We have three generations of people who have never worked. We need to ensure a long-term, sustainable future for Diageo in Leven and Cameron Bridge. My constituency of Central Fife has the third-lowest average wage of any constituency in Scotland. It is imperative that we keep and sustain jobs. The long-term sustainability of Leven is imperative, and I am happy to work with the cabinet secretary or anybody else to assure it.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173834", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Diageo (Campaign against Closures)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my good friend Willie Coffey on securing the debate tonight and on the commitment and leadership that he has shown to his constituents in his determination to secure the Johnnie Walker jobs in Kilmarnock.

I have struggled to understand why our friends in the United States are angry and hurt that our Cabinet Secretary for Justice agreed compassionate release for Mr al-Megrahi.

In life, Martin Luther King was not the icon that he became in death. He opposed the Vietnam war at a time when it was not popular in the United States to do that, and was vilified for doing so. A few days <place-holder colnum=\"19060\"/> before his assassination, in reflecting on the choices that he had made, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Cowardice asks the question, 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question, 'Is it politic?' Vanity asks the question, 'Is it popular?' But conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' There comes a time when we must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular, but because our conscience tells us that it is right.\"</p><p>Expressions of humanity and justice towards our fellow human beings do not always make easy and popular decisions. Where an individual or group has wronged us, it is often easy to deny their humanity instead of conceding that they are&#8212;as we are&#8212;human and mortal. Mercy is in the hands of those who give it. It is an expression of our values and humanity, regardless of the actions of those who receive it. Compassion is about being better people and not about the goodness or wickedness of the person who is on the receiving end of the mercy.</p><p>There is nothing that any of us can do to ease the pain of those who mourn those who died at Lockerbie. Mr al-Megrahi's death, whether in a prison in Scotland or at home in Tripoli, will not lessen the pain, which will endure always. Our legal system demands justice, not vengeance. If Mr al-Megrahi were to die in a Scottish prison, that would be vengeance, not justice.</p><p>Some have claimed that the release means that Mr al-Megrahi served only 11 days for every person who was murdered at Lockerbie. However, even if he had served the remainder of his life in Greenock prison, only a quarter of a day would have been added for every person who died. Mr al-Megrahi is dying. His body is ravaged by cancer. He will die, and he will die soon.</p><p>Kenny MacAskill freed Mr al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds, despite the grave crime for which Mr al-Megrahi was convicted. That was done not to minimise the suffering of victims' families, here and in other countries. The decision to release a dying man had at its heart justice and mercy&#8212;two intertwined principles that are woven into the fabric of the Scottish legal system. Those principles are the foundation of our society, and those who would scoff and sneer at those values do all of us in Scotland a disservice.</p><p>Without the option of mercy and compassion, there can be no true justice. It is vital that the distinction between justice and mercy is uppermost in our minds, because vengeance is rarely just, it is never merciful and it breeds only further resentment and hate.</p><p>When the Cabinet Secretary for Justice took the decision to release Mr al-Megrahi to die at home, it was not cowardice that asked the question. It was not expediency that asked the question. It was not vanity that asked the question. It was conscience <place-holder colnum=\"19061\"/> that asked the question, and the answer was that it was right.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173555", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi (Decision)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start with the premise that Mr al-Megrahi is guilty.

After all, when the bill is passed at 5 o'clock, Scottish Parliament and local government elections will be separated.</p><p>Indeed, as someone who since 1999 has spoken in every chamber debate on this subject, I am particularly pleased to speak in this stage 3 debate. I will be more generous than David McLetchie and acknowledge that the Conservatives have contributed as much as the SNP to the debate on separating local government and Scottish Parliament elections. I am delighted that the SNP Government has adopted a commonsense approach and done the right thing by the voters and local government.</p><p>In the stage 1 debate, I mentioned the support for the move from McIntosh, Kerley, Arbuthnott and now Gould. As for Andy Kerr's comment that the decision taken in 2001 to combine both sets of elections was the right one, I have to tell him that it was not and that it was certainly not supported by anyone who examined it before or after 2001.</p><p>I regret the wasted years during which Labour and the Liberal Democrats opposed the decoupling of the elections. I bitterly regret those parties' failure to decouple the 2007 elections, when a new voting system was introduced for local government, despite the warnings about the chaos that would ensue. That was precisely why, when the motion to pass the bill that introduced proportional representation through the single transferable vote was debated, I lodged a reasoned amendment saying that the two sets of elections should be decoupled. It is regrettable that the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats <place-holder colnum=\"18465\"/> did not take the opportunity then to separate the two sets of elections, but it gives me no pleasure to say, \"I told you so.\" I welcome the belated support from Labour and the Liberal Democrats for the separation, but I must say that Mike Rumbles gave every impression of being dragged kicking and screaming to support the bill. It is clear that, even now, after all that has happened in the ensuing years, Mike Rumbles personally does not believe that the two sets of elections should be separated. Every single word that he said confirmed that.</p><p>Why is it important to hold the local government elections in a different year from the Scottish Parliament elections? Scottish local government is a separate tier of government. It is not subservient to the Scottish Parliament; it has powers of its own and responsibilities for housing, education, social work, planning and other issues that affect the daily lives of millions of people in Scotland. Indeed, I venture to say that there is no power of local government that does not affect the lives of ordinary people in Scotland. It has statutory powers. Councillors and councils deserve to have their record decided on by the electorate, but no one could examine the elections of 1999, 2003 or 2007 and say honestly that local government issues featured in the campaigns.</p><p>The SNP Government has respect for local government. That led to the signing of the concordat between the SNP Government and Scottish local authorities. The SNP believes in the parity of esteem between the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament and local government.</p><p>Councils must have their own democratic mandate. The challenge for politicians of all political parties and none is to engage with voters and increase turnout. We will do that only if people believe that their participation will make a difference. PRSTV will help to ensure that we have a fair voting system and that every vote counts. I look forward to a proper information campaign before the next local government elections because, frankly, such a campaign was missing in 2007. Members might say that there was an information campaign, but few people out there understood it, so the message did not get across.</p><p>I congratulate the minister and the Local Government and Communities Committee on ensuring that the bill has received a smooth passage.

Cashback for communities was launched by our Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, in January 2008 and has to date provided substantial money to youth projects the length and breadth of Scotland. It is Kenny MacAskill's drive and commitment that have made the scheme the reality that it is. To date, more than &#163;12 million of criminal cash has been ploughed back into our communities through partners such as YouthLink Scotland, the SFA, the SRU, basketballscotland, sportscotland and Scottish Screen.<place-holder colnum=\"18012\"/></p><p>The cashback scheme provides for diversionary projects for young people. I know that the impact on our communities of the injection of these funds is considerable. As others have said, the scheme takes money from criminals&#8212;drug dealers in particular&#8212;who want to destroy our communities, and invests it to try to build those communities up again.</p><p>Something that Bill Aitken said struck a chord with me: we need a new look at the scheme. The scheme depends on organisations and others coming forward with projects, but many of our communities have been destroyed by the drug dealers and in some areas there are no local organisations. We need to build capacity within our communities, including the capacity for people to volunteer and to be involved in bringing forward projects. If we do not have people to run the organisations and volunteer for projects and help to bring them forward, then some of the worst-affected communities will never benefit from the scheme. I ask the cabinet secretary to look at the possibility of allocating some of the money for capacity building in our communities, to try to bring forward projects and encourage people to volunteer. It is from the volunteers in those communities that we will get the projects of the future.</p><p>I remind the cabinet secretary that another reason for the lack of volunteers is the criminal vetting process. I know that the cost of vetting a volunteer falls on local organisations, and I wonder whether funding the vetting process might be a worth while investment. That would take the cost away from the poorest communities and get more people to come through the volunteering route, which would also help to build capacity. It would also support those who wish to be vetted so that they can work with young people.</p><p>That said, many projects for young people in Central Fife have been supported by cashback for communities, and I have worked very hard to try to encourage existing organisations to take advantage of the money that is available to them. Glenrothes YMCA and YWCA received money to fund a Friday night music project and a film making project; Levenmouth YMCA got &#163;26,000 to develop its street live project, which I know that Kenny MacAskill has visited; Levenmouth youth initiative got money for summer programmes for young people; and Barnardo's Levenmouth links project got money to fund a summer programme. Glenrothes YMCA also received additional funds.</p><p>I add my thanks to that of Councillor David Alexander, our councillor for Kennoway, who has worked so hard with partners to bring forward the Kennoway sports association application, which has received &#163;100,000 to develop a new sports pavilion at Cotlands park in Kennoway. I cannot <place-holder colnum=\"18013\"/> begin to tell the cabinet secretary how much it means to that particular community that they have something to support the many youth football teams and other teams that are springing up in Kennoway. That is happening because there is hope, and because there are facilities for the young people who live there to be able to take part in sports.</p><p>I am particularly pleased about the Fife cashback media project, which is working with young people in Glenrothes and elsewhere in Fife; the Glenrothes project deals with generational discrimination. Those local projects are all important. I acknowledge that another &#163;70,000 for Fife has been announced today, and I will do my best to ensure that a lot of that money comes to my constituency of Central Fife.</p><p>It is essential that money is invested in diversionary measures in our communities, particularly in the Levenmouth area, which has been devastated by the closure of the pits, the lack of hope and aspiration in the community and the criminal activity that goes on there.</p><p>I am delighted that the cashback for communities money has been complemented by the work of the Scottish National Party-led Fife Council&#8212;and in particular the work of Dave Alexander, who is the chair of the area committee in Levenmouth. The council is investing in the Levenmouth area, because the SNP believes in communities and in young people. After decades of neglect by Labour councils, the area is experiencing investment at last.

I am sorry to hear that Ted Brocklebank has never been fortunate enough to be part of a Scottish Parliament delegation, but I am sure that his speech today will serve as a job application to his party to be part of the delegation for Scotland week next year.</p><p>I was fortunate to be part of the Scottish Parliament delegation for Scotland week this April, together with the Presiding Officer, Sarah Boyack, Murdo Fraser and Tavish Scott. All of us who were part of the delegation would echo the view of the minister, Michael Russell, that the warmth of the welcome for Scotland in New York, Quebec and North Carolina will stay with us for some time to come.</p><p>In New York, the Scotland week march down 6<sup>th</sup> Avenue was well supported by the diaspora, to say nothing of the thousands of ordinary New Yorkers who turned out to give the marchers support. It was good to see that the homecoming Scotland team had been working well&#8212;as we walked, we saw many saltires that I am sure had been given out just before the march. The team had given out so many of them that by the time we came to the end of the march, they had run out. That probably shows the great demand for saltire hats and the like.</p><p>In Quebec, the delegation met committees to discuss joint concerns and opportunities around renewable energy issues, relationships with federal Governments and other opportunities for us all. It was clear that interest in Scotland was genuine and tangible. As a measure of that, the delegation was present as a motion to commemorate tartan day was introduced in the Parliament. It was interesting that the representatives of the federal Government, who were introduced to the Parliament just before the Scottish delegation, had nothing like the welcome from the Parliament that the Scottish delegation had.</p><p>Since I came back, I have referred in the chamber to the fact that our Presiding Officer was quite taken with being referred to as the President of Scotland. I know not what Mr Salmond, our beloved First Minister, would make of that, but the delegation rather enjoyed it.</p><p>I was also delighted to hear a good Fife accent when we visited St Andrew's church in Quebec. It turned out that the curator of the kirk came from Lochgelly, 2 miles away from where I was born and brought up, and her good Fife accent was undiluted after 30 years in Quebec.</p><p>The Scottish delegation met the governor of North Carolina and both houses of the General <place-holder colnum=\"17529\"/> Assembly, and the Presiding Officer made a presentation to them. Murdo Fraser and I had in-depth discussions about the federal Government's stimulus programme, to which I have referred in previous debates. The Scottish Parliament and the minister co-hosted a reception for the Scottish community and both houses of the Assembly. I was surprised to find out that North Carolina had the highest percentage of citizens claiming Scots ancestry in the United States.</p><p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has yet to discuss what our future relationship with the US and Canada will be. We need an evaluation of the most recent Scotland week. However, I am clear that the Parliament and its MSPs have opened up great links with the state legislatures in the US and the provincial Governments in Canada. We have much to learn from their powers and their relationships with other Governments and by exchanging views on matters of joint interest.</p><p>It is clear that the Parliament has a role in making links with other legislatures, but the Scottish Government's Scotland week programme did not make full use of the parliamentary delegation. Many more joint events could have taken place. For example, the reception for the Scottish community in Raleigh, North Carolina&#8212;at which Murdo Fraser and I worked the room in our own inimitable way&#8212;was co-hosted by the minister and the Presiding Officer. It is clear to me from that event and others that the Scottish Government should in future work far more closely with the Scottish Parliament to ensure that we get as many bangs for our buck as possible from the Scottish Parliament's and the Scottish community's representation and to ensure that Scotland is showcased in the best possible way. I would like some commitment from ministers that, in future years, they will try to ensure that they and the Scottish Parliament work together far more closely than happened during the most recent Scotland week.</p><p>There is great interest in Scotland at every level&#8212;from the political to the personal, and from the industrial to the cultural&#8212;from people who share a heritage and a vision for our world.

As David McLetchie has said, for eight long years the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats set their faces against reason and democracy in refusing to decouple the elections. However, today we have heard no apology or admission that they were wrong, nor an admission that the coincidence of the elections contributed to the debacle of the elections in 2007.</p><p>The decoupling of the two sets of elections is a long-standing commitment of the Conservatives as <place-holder colnum=\"17454\"/> well as the Scottish National Party&#8212;I freely acknowledge that. However, it has taken an SNP Government to produce the bill, just as it took an SNP Government to abolish the tolls on the Forth and Tay bridges, to provide free school meals and to provide free prescriptions by 2011. Those are all measures that were proposed by the SNP in opposition and opposed by the previous Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive.</p><p>I never understood the stubborn refusal of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to decouple the two sets of elections. There seemed no logic to that refusal, which flew in the face of all the evidence. In 2001, I spoke in the debate when Labour and the Liberal Democrats brought to Parliament the bill to combine the two sets of elections. I said then:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Executive believes that the bill will increase the turnout at local elections. That is no doubt true, as parliamentary elections currently attract larger turnouts. However, such turnouts will not confer any additional democratic legitimacy on local government. ... The serious flaw in the Executive's argument is its naive suggestion that an artificially inflated turnout provides an increased mandate for local government. It is quite clear that the reverse is true, and that will have a cost in the form of a democratic loss for the very local authorities for whom the bill is intended. The local agenda will be overshadowed and overtaken by the coverage of national elections. No member of this chamber could seriously argue that local authority issues will even surface, far less be given a decent hearing, in the press m&#234;le&#233; of the parliamentary election campaign. Councillors will not be able to make their case for election or re-election as they will be completely displaced from the agenda by MSPs seeking to make their case.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2001-12-20.5031.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 20 December 2001; c 5031.]</citation></p><p>That was the argument for not having coincident elections, but it was rejected.</p><p>Had it only been the Opposition parties that opposed coincident elections, I might have understood the refusal of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to decouple the elections, but that was not the case. In 1999, the report of the McIntosh commission recommended that the two sets of elections should be separated and that local government elections should be held at the mid-point of the parliamentary session. The report of the renewing local democracy working group that was set up by Wendy Alexander and chaired by Richard Kerley recommended in 2000 that the two elections should be separated. In the face of all that evidence, the Executive announced that it would legislate to bring the two elections together.</p><p>In 2006, the Arbuthnott commission recommended decoupling&#8212;I was going to use a quote from the commission's report about the potential for confusion, but David McLetchie has already put it on the record.</p><p>During the passage of the Executive's Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, which <place-holder colnum=\"17455\"/> introduced single transferable vote proportional representation, my reasoned stage 3 amendment to decouple the elections was defeated. David Mundell's proposed local government elections (Scotland) bill, which sought to decouple the elections, found support among the Scottish National Party but went no further.</p><p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats ensured that, in 2003 and 2007, the local government elections and the Scottish Parliament elections were held on the same day. The debacle of the 2007 election was, in part, caused by the insistence of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to introduce a new form of voting for the local government elections even though those elections were to be held on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections. Everyone told them that there would be difficulties in introducing a new form of local government elections in that manner, as little information about the changes would get through to the voters, which would lead to confusion. As David McLetchie so eloquently said, they were telt.</p><p>As the Gould report made clear, separating the two elections will minimise the potential for voter confusion. We are convinced that combined elections are a disservice not only to local councils and candidates but to the electorate.

We unanimously recommend that, from a strong field of candidates, Mr Allan be appointed. He will bring to the post significant experience of investigating complaints about standards. He is the chief investigating officer and is responsible for investigating and reporting to the Standards Commission for Scotland when councillors or members of devolved public bodies might have contravened the relevant codes of conduct.</p><p>The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner is a part-time appointment of between five and 10 days a month.

In 2004, he was reappointed for a second term and, in 2007, he was reappointed for a third term. He will demit office in January 2010.</p><p>The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner is an independent investigator of complaints that we as members might have breached the code of conduct for members of the Scottish Parliament, which gives guidance on how we perform our parliamentary duties. Following an investigation, the commissioner prepares a report to the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee that sets out the details of the complaint and the investigation, the facts that the commissioner found and his conclusion.

The communities in which I grew up and the communities that I have the honour of representing in the Parliament are still suffering from the effects of a Tory Government that created a scorched earth policy. When Labour came to power in 1997, it promised to end child poverty, and to reduce it by 2010. The Labour Party was in power in this Parliament for eight years, yet the levels of poverty in Levenmouth, Kennoway and parts of Glenrothes are among the highest in the country.</p><p>Gordon Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer for much of that time, and now he is Prime Minister, striding across the world stage like the bit player he is. The man who promised to halve child poverty by next year is failing even to make a dent. The recent report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation states that on current estimates, the UK Government will fail to meet its target by 2010, and that to meet that target, the UK</p><p class=\"indent\">\"would have to invest an estimated &#163;4.2 billion a year\".</p><p>We have a Prime Minister who fiddled the books, and a Labour Government that could never find the money to tackle poverty, but which bailed out the banks to stop them failing. The same Labour Government has failed the one in four children in Scotland who is still living in poverty. <place-holder colnum=\"15457\"/></p><p>Scotland's children are twice as likely to be poor as those who live in Scandinavian countries.</p><p>The SNP Government has met 50 per cent of its manifesto commitments after two years. I am proud of a Government that has delivered the removal of the tolls from the Forth and Tay bridges, which was opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in office; that has frozen council tax for the past two years, in comparison with a 60 per cent increase under the Labour and Liberal Democrat Administration; and which has introduced free school meals for all primary 1 to primary 3 children in Scotland, which the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats also opposed in office.</p><p>I am proud of an SNP Government that is reducing prescription charges and will abolish them, which should be compared with the increase that the UK Government announced today for charges in England; that has put the highest number of police on the streets, in comparison with the abandonment of our communities to the criminals by the Labour and Liberal Democrats; and which has abolished the graduate endowment, which Labour and the Liberal Democrats introduced.</p><p>I turn to the Liberals, who want the Government to concentrate on the economy rather than on the constitution. That is from a party that voted against an SNP Government, and then voted for it when the First Minister wrote to the Calman commission. That is hardly putting the economy first. Harriet Harman spoke recently about the court of public opinion, but in the Scottish Parliament, the unionist parties want to deny the court of public opinion&#8212;the people of Scotland&#8212;the chance to vote in a referendum on their own future.</p><p>The people voted for an SNP Government because we offered vision and hope&#8212;and we have delivered&#8212;rather than the negativity of the Labour Party.

I am delighted to add my support to the motion and to speak in the debate.</p><p>Mary Mulligan said that Shelter might not want to celebrate its anniversary. Perhaps \"commemorate\" is better. Most people in Shelter recognise that, when the charity started, it was not expected to be around in 40 years' time, but the challenges are such that&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;Shelter will be with us for a long time; it is unfortunate not because Shelter does not do a wonderful job, because it does, but because of what that says about housing conditions.</p><p>I was privileged to work for Shelter Scotland between 1992 and 1999. I always knew that one job I would do was work for Shelter, because \"Cathy Come Home\" made a great impression on me. I am well aware that Shelter was established before that fantastic play, which was written and directed by Ken Loach, was shown on BBC television as \"The Wednesday Play\".</p><p>Watching \"Cathy Come Home\" was a searing experience for many people in Britain, as they had never before seen such housing conditions. The impact was even greater on me because my mother, who rarely cried, was in tears. That made a huge impression on me. Since that first viewing, I have seen \"Cathy Come Home\" many times. Unfortunately, there are parents&#8212;mothers&#8212;who still live in such housing conditions, although Shelter's work has stopped families being separated simply because they are homeless. That is one of its greatest achievements.</p><p>My admiration for those who have worked, and who continue to work, for Shelter has no bounds. I am thinking in particular of those who work in its housing aid centres, who give direct help and advice to those who are homeless and face huge challenges in so doing. From its inception, Shelter Scotland has retained its independence&#8212;its independence from Government. That makes it not only a unique Scottish charity but one of the foremost charities of Scotland. Over the years, although Shelter has contributed to the homelessness task force and other Government programmes, it has retained its independence. It can do that because its core services are funded by donors.<place-holder colnum=\"14233\"/></p><p>It is appropriate and right that Shelter has an independent voice; its independence enables it to speak genuinely on behalf of those who are homeless or in housing need. Shelter must never lose that independence. It needs to be free to speak out and up for homeless people, regardless of which Government is in power. I encourage it to do that whenever it feels the need to do so. Its criticism can hit home, but that should make us all redouble our efforts. We can always do more than we are doing.</p><p>I am pleased to speak in the debate. Other members will have many different things to say. I hope that Shelter is not around for the next 40 years, although I suspect that it will be around for a good number of years. Commemorating Shelter's 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary and the publication of the booklet helps us to focus our minds on the challenges that face us all&#8212;not only the Government but local authorities. In our surgeries, many MSPs see people in acute housing need.

We believe that the costs should be met by public procurement, and we have sought Treasury permission to spread them over 20 years. The alternatives are either PFI or tolls: tolls on the existing bridge to pay for the new bridge, tolls on the new bridge, or tolls on both. The Treasury agrees that PPP is no longer an option, given that its use would not solve the budgeting problems were the scheme to be classed as a public spending scheme. Labour is now saying no tolls. Frankly, that leaves only the SNP Government's preferred method of funding. It is beyond time that the Labour Party, both north and south of the border, stopped playing its stupid, childish games with the bridge and the east of Scotland economy and gave its support to spreading the costs.</p><p>We have it from Gordon Brown himself that methods other than public procurement are unacceptable. In 1985, the future Prime Minister said that he would bring forward a private member's bill to abolish tolls on the Forth road bridge&#8212;he did not do so, although he said that he would. At the time, he called the funding mechanism for the present Forth bridge</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an unfortunate experiment in privatisation\".</p><p>He also said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"motorists crossing have to pay for the bridge four times over\",</p><p>and asked:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"What explanation can the government now give for their refusal even to consider the finances of the bridge, which is clearly an essential element of our road system?\"</p><p>The Treasury's refusal to allow the SNP Government to spread the costs over 20 years is bizarre. Unlike local government and the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government is not allowed to borrow. No one would argue that the whole &#163;2 billion cost should be found out of one budget, because that would have a devastating effect on the overall budget and on other capital projects.<place-holder colnum=\"14102\"/></p><p>The Treasury's claim that the Scottish Government cannot meet the capital costs from budgets that have not yet been allocated is simply not credible, because that is precisely the method that is used to repay the costs of PFI and PPP projects that have been completed since 1999. I am grateful to the Scottish Parliament information centre for providing me with the sums that the Scottish Government&#8212;and future Scottish Governments&#8212;must find to meet the costs that have already been committed to PFI projects. In 1999-2000, &#163;51 million had to be found to meet the costs of PFI. In 2008-09, &#163;608 million has had to be found. The cost of meeting PFI-PPP payments will rise steadily until 2016-17&#8212;and beyond&#8212;with a staggering cost of &#163;914 million in that year's budget.</p><p>Budgets that have not yet been allocated are already committed to meeting the PFI costs to which the Labour and Liberal Administration committed itself between 1999 and 2007. Given that future budgets are committed, perhaps the Labour Party and the Treasury can explain why the SNP Government cannot spread the capital costs of the new bridge over 20 years.</p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to providing the replacement Forth crossing by traditional procurement methods and to delivering it on time, on budget and, most important, toll free to the people of Scotland.

We also received evidence about the low uptake of school meals generally.</p><p>I tried in vain at stages 2 and 3 of that bill to convince the Lab-Lib Executive to support a pilot project for free school meals in Scotland. That is why I was delighted that the SNP Government decided to pilot free school meals. I was doubly delighted that the whole of Fife was chosen for the pilot&#8212;and what a success it has been. Throughout the trial period, the uptake of school meals rose from 50 to 77 per cent.

Why has the pilot been such a success in Fife? Parents whose children were previously entitled to free school meals did not take them up because of the stigma that was attached to doing so, but they took up free school meals when they were free for all children.

I, too, pay tribute to John MacDougall, whom I knew for a very long time. He was a good man, who is missed by a great many people in the Glenrothes constituency.</p><p>I would respond to Ted Brocklebank by saying that the Leven to Thornton rail link has of course been one of my highest priorities for a long time. I point out to both Claire Baker and Ted Brocklebank that the Leven to Thornton link, which is the number 1 transport priority of Fife Council, has the support of all the other parties that are represented on the council: the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives and the Labour Party. Fife Council's number 1 transport priority is not the A92, the Preston roundabout or the Redhouse roundabout; it is indeed the Leven to Thornton railway line. That is the decision of the council.</p><p>When I came to Glenrothes in 1975, it was clear that we needed the section of the A92 there to be dualled. As Ted Brocklebank has pointed out, the Conservative Government promised in 1995 that the A92 would be dualled from the Preston roundabout to Balfarg. Claire Baker is also right: it was clear from the press coverage at the time that, although the Conservative party was promising the dualling of the road, the minister of state, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, was making it clear that there was no money available at the time and that the dualling would not take place until such time as it became available.</p><p>To jump forward a couple of years, Henry McLeish was elected in 1997 and became the Scottish roads minister. He was promising action at the notorious A92 junction in April 1998. In 1999, Sarah Boyack, under the strategic roads review, dumped the project completely, and mine was the only voice in opposition to Ms Boyack. I said in the chamber at the time:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The minister has ditched the long-promised improvements to the Preston roundabout in Glenrothes on the A92 to Balfarg. She claims that there are more <place-holder colnum=\"10429\"/> appropriate alternative measures. Has she spoken to Tullis Russell and Company Ltd, the town's largest employer, whose factory gates open out on to the A92? Has she spoken to ... Henry McLeish, or to anyone in Glenrothes? Will she outline the appropriate alternatives and the time scale for their implementation?\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/1999-11-04.364.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 4 November 1999; Vol 3, c 364.]</citation></p><p>When it was under Labour Party control&#8212;interestingly, Christine May was the administration's leader at the time&#8212;Fife Council refused to back me in my call for dualling that stretch of road, insisting that minor improvements would suffice. I am indeed grateful to my dear friend Michael Woods, who was the councillor for Pitteuchar from 1992 to 2007, for his commitment to keeping the scheme alive when the Labour Party in Glenrothes did not want to know.</p><p>Over the past year, a campaign for dualling was started again by the Glenrothes area futures group. I have been happy to give it my support. I have made it clear to the group, however, that I believe that a lot of work and campaigning needs to be done to get the project back up the agenda. New approaches, appraisals and costings are needed. In 1995, the cost was &#163;21 million, but it will have risen since then.</p><p>As Ted Brocklebank mentioned, a great deal of feeling was expressed at a public meeting that dualling was the preferred option and should go ahead. Other voices said that improvements could be made to the Balfarg junction in the meantime. Anybody using the A92 at the Balfarg junction knows that it is one of the most unsafe parts of the road. People take their lives in their hands every time they use it.</p><p>I urge the minister to reconsider the case for dualling the A92, and to consider reviewing the Balfarg junction and the stretch of the A92 as it enters Glenrothes at the Cadham junction. Despite the improvements that have been made over the years, exiting from those junctions does not fill anyone with confidence. I wonder whether the minister, in reconsidering those issues, could report back to the members who are most interested in them&#8212;and of course to the Glenrothes area futures group&#8212;about what he plans to do for the A92 in the immediate and longer term.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948413", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: A92 (Upgrading)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Many thanks, Presiding Officer&#8212;I am now able to resume.

She knows full well that I both support the reopening of the Leven to Thornton rail link and think that work to improve the Redhouse link is essential. I have no hesitation in supporting that project. However, the two issues need not be taken together.</p><p>The proposal to reopen the Leven to Thornton junction branch line to passengers would allow a link to the Fife circle at Kirkcaldy. I welcome people from the Levenmouth area who have joined us in the public gallery to hear tonight's debate. In all my years as an MSP, I have never encountered such a spontaneous response to an issue. I hope that the minister will take note.<place-holder colnum=\"8020\"/></p><p>For too long, we in Levenmouth have campaigned against things&#8212;against pit closures, against job losses and against ship-to-ship oil transfers. By contrast, the campaign to reopen the Leven to Thornton link is a campaign for something.</p><p>I am indebted to Jim Corstorphine, who has kindly given me a copy of his book \"East of Thornton Junction\", which has helped to fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge of the line's history. The line from Leven to Thornton junction was part of the Fife coast line, which stretched around the Fife coast from Thornton to Leuchars. The Thornton to Leven railway was opened in 1854 and was closed to passengers as part of the Beeching cuts, after a long campaign that included a public inquiry at Scoonie hall in Leven. That campaign was in vain, and on 4 October 1969 the line was finally closed.</p><p>However, although the rest of the Fife coast line was ripped up and built over, the Leven to Thornton track remained. Until a few years ago, it was used regularly for freight, mostly from the now defunct Methil power station. Importantly, the line has never been decommissioned by Network Rail.</p><p>Levenmouth is the largest urban conurbation in Scotland without access to a railway station. It also has poor connections to the road network. The main road through Fife bypasses the area completely, and access to Kirkcaldy is by way of the A915&#8212;Standingstane Road&#8212;which is notoriously ill-equipped to cope.</p><p>Levenmouth was devastated by pit closures, the rundown of Methil docks and the loss of Kvaerner, all of which contributed to its economic depression. The tragedy is that, until fairly recently, no steps were taken to address that economic disadvantage. The results of that long neglect are clear: 41 per cent of the area's population is economically inactive, compared with a Fife average of 34 per cent and a Scottish average of 35 per cent.</p><p>The opening of the Leven to Thornton line to passengers would enable people to get to jobs elsewhere in Fife, in Edinburgh and in Dundee, and would attract new businesses into the area. It would also enable people in the east neuk of Fife, in Iain Smith's constituency, to access a train from Leven. Reopening the line is essential for the regeneration of the Levenmouth area.</p><p>We also need the line to be upgraded for freight transport. We have long argued that we need to get freight off the roads and on to rail. Diageo, which has a plant at Cameron Bridge, is negotiating with Network Rail on a development that will allow Diageo's products to travel by rail again. However, the negotiations have been <place-holder colnum=\"8021\"/> protracted. I urge Network Rail to find an acceptable solution.</p><p>In addition to Diageo, we have Fife energy park in Methil, which is one of the Government's top strategic priorities for Scotland. It is essential that, as well as upskilling the workforce in Levenmouth, we attract people with the necessary skills to Methil. To do that, we need transport links. It is self-evident that I also expect the line to be used for freight to and from the energy park.</p><p>There have been many campaigns to reopen the line. In 1999, Scott Wilson carried out a feasibility study for Fife Council, which concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It would be feasible to introduce a passenger train service over this existing single track branch line with a new station constructed at Leven.\"</p><p>The cost at the time would have been between &#163;1.7 million and &#163;3.3 million. The tragedy is that the then Labour-controlled Fife Council refused to support the reopening, and since then Levenmouth has declined even further economically.</p><p>What has changed? The Scottish National Party and Liberal-controlled Fife Council has made reopening the line one of its top priorities. The south east of Scotland transport partnership is carrying out a feasibility study. Fife energy park is creating new jobs and Diageo is expanding its operation. The threat remains that the Forth road bridge could be closed to freight before the new bridge is built. In any case, freight needs to find another way in and out of Fife. Most important, the community wants the project to go ahead.</p><p>I understand that to make the line fit for passengers it needs to be rerailed, signalling needs to be installed and drainage and telecom issues need to be addressed&#8212;that is all. There is no need for the compulsory purchase of land and no need for legislation, unlike with many other rail projects in Scotland since 1999. However, we need the will for the project to happen.</p><p>I do not expect a decision from the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change today&#8212;SEStran is still carrying out its survey&#8212;but I would like him to confirm that this financially modest scheme, which would help the whole of Levenmouth and the east neuk, will be given a fair wind by his department.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403222", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Leven to Thornton Rail Link"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Marilyn Livingstone for her intervention and support.

In that debate, I said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Although I accept that the Executive has made progress, I think that it is disingenuous to suggest that the reduction in the number of fuel-poor families is ... down to Executive and Government action.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2003-11-20.3522.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 20 November 2003; c3522.]</citation></p><p>Most independent commentators at the time acknowledged that the reason why there was a drop in fuel poverty up to 2002 was that price rises had been limited&#8212;there had been very few. I warned then that what comes down will go up and that when fuel prices started to rise, we would see a consequent increase in fuel poverty, which has proved to be the case. In 2002, 580,000 people in Scotland were in fuel poverty, and by 2005-06, the figure had risen to 959,000. Most of that increase was down to rises in fuel costs.</p><p>I take issue with what Frank McAveety said and contrast the record of this Government on the central heating programme with the record of his Executive. In Glasgow in October, November and December 2007&#8212;the three worst months of the year&#8212;under this SNP Government, there were 648 installations.

There were problems in 1999, regardless of what Cathie Craigie said. I recall that, when the Scottish Office put out material about the Scottish Parliament elections, it said that voters should use their two votes and never mentioned the fact that there was a local government election on the same day.</p><p>To try to deny that there were problems in 1999 and 2003 is to deny the truth, which is that the electoral system in Scotland and the UK is broken and needs to be fixed. The present system, in which returning officers are autonomous in their own areas, is simply unsustainable. There must be a chief returning officer, and election administrators' practice and training must be consistent throughout Scotland.</p><p>We, the body politic in Scotland, must get it right. I am relaxed about a fuller review and about the committees of this Parliament and the UK Parliament considering the matter, but any review must be concluded early enough for arrangements to be approved in plenty time before the 2011 <place-holder colnum=\"4978\"/> elections. That is the key point. The culture among, and training for, election administrators must be changed. We are all partners in the election process but, in future, the voters and their interests&#8212;not those of the political parties or the political institutions&#8212;must be paramount.</p><p>Two principles must underpin any review: first, the responsibility for the Scottish Parliament elections must be passed to the Scottish Parliament; secondly, the Scottish Parliament and local government elections must be decoupled. Way back in 2000 and 2001, both McIntosh and Kerley recommended that the local government elections should be decoupled from the Scottish Parliament elections. For Andy Kerr's benefit, I point out that, in 2001, the Scottish National Party and the Conservatives voted against the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill at stages 1 and 3. In 2004, the Parliament approved PRSTV for local government elections, but the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats rejected a reasoned amendment in my name to decouple the two sets of elections. I pay tribute to the role that David Mundell played in that attempt. He, Tommy Sheridan and I tried to amend the Local Governance (Scotland) Bill&#8212;which introduced PRSTV&#8212;to decouple the elections, but that measure was ruled to be outwith the bill's scope.</p><p>So 3 May 2007 was an appalling night for democracy for the people of Scotland.

Exactly 43 years later, on 3 September 2007, the first ever Scottish National Party Government introduced the Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill to the Parliament. To the people of Fife and Tayside, the bill is another promise made and kept by the SNP Government.</p><p>The road to get here has been long and tortuous. The journey has involved broken promise after broken promise by Labour to the people of Fife. Having carefully examined the stage 1 report <place-holder colnum=\"3507\"/> of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee, I must say&#8212;with all respect to the committee members&#8212;that the report is a bit po-faced. The report criticises the lack of public consultation, despite the fact that there is no requirement for public consultation. I say as kindly as I can to the committee that the bridge tolls have been subject to public consultation: it was called an election. Labour paid a heavy price for its broken promises to the people of Fife.</p><p>Those broken promises go back a long way. In 1964, the Labour Government said that the tolls would be removed when the capital costs of the Forth road bridge were paid off. In 1985, Gordon Brown informed the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board inquiry into proposed increases in bridge tolls:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The unjust treatment of bridge users is exemplified by the fact that they effectively pay several times over for the facilities they use&#8212;as taxpayers, rate payers, road-tax payers and as toll payers.\"</p><p>Gordon Brown even went as far as to promise, by press release, a bill at Westminster to abolish the tolls. However, that promise went only as far as lodging a proposal in the House of Commons library; it was never translated into a bill that was considered. When Gordon Brown had time to do something about the matter in Government in 1997, he still did nothing.</p><p>In March 2006, when an SNP motion to scrap the tolls on the Tay was defeated by Labour and Liberal Democrats, I said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"One thing is sure: the SNP will vote to scrap the tolls on the Tay bridge. If we are defeated, the campaign will continue. An SNP Government will scrap the tolls on the Tay and Forth bridges next year.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2006-03-30.24570.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 30 March 2006; c 24570.]</citation></p><p>And that is just what we are about to do.</p><p>I found it mildly amusing that, in a recent motion, Helen Eadie castigated the SNP for not setting a date for the abolition of the tolls&#8212;that from a member who voted to keep the tolls on the Tay when her party was in Government. Of course, the bill is subject to the Parliament's timetable, not the Government's. However, provided that the Liberals and Labour support the bill, it is reasonable to assume that the tolls will be removed from the Forth and Tay bridges by January next year.</p><p>I offer particular thanks to <em>The Courier</em> newspaper, which came in behind the campaign and was truly a voice for the people of Fife, Tayside and Perthshire on the issue. I also thank my friends Shona Robison and Bruce Crawford, who would have dearly loved to speak in the debate but cannot do so.</p><p>I turn again to the committee's stage 1 report. Paragraph 182 states:<place-holder colnum=\"3508\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"However the fact remains that in Scotland it is only those who live in, visit or work in Fife who are subjected to the requirement to pay bridge tolls.\"</p><p>However, in paragraph 183 the report states that the committee</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is of the view that equity is a subjective as opposed to a scientific argument and, as such, should not generally be considered as a transport policy objective.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, I disagree profoundly with that statement. I know that I speak for the people of Fife when I say that I do not care what issues are used to support the abolition of the tolls or what arguments are used to retain them. There is, and has been since 1964, only one issue: fairness and equity. It is not a perception of unfairness for Fife to have two tolls when no other part of Scotland has any&#8212;it is unfairness.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392192", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On 4 September 1964, the tolled Forth road bridge was opened.

Now that Gordon Brown is Prime Minister, he has a duty to act immediately to ensure that the views of his constituents in Kirkcaldy, as well as my constituents in Methil and Buckhaven, are heeded.

I urge him to take the opportunity to give confidence to the businesses from the east of Scotland that the gap can be closed. We cannot have a situation in which there is no Forth crossing for HGVs between 2013 and 2016.</p><p>Let me turn to public transport options on the bridgehead. We need better and cheaper train <place-holder colnum=\"1166\"/> journeys from Fife if we are to reduce both the pressure on the bridge and carbon emissions. Until the rail prices are reduced and there is a more frequent service from Edinburgh to Fife and northwards, there will be continuing pressures on whatever crossing is built. Whether we keep to the existing bridge, build a new bridge or build a tunnel, there will always be pressure at that point unless we do something about the number of commuters going in each direction. That is why I urge the minister to look seriously at what can be done to ensure that the rail operators reduce fares. It costs over &#163;14 a day for a return ticket from Markinch to Edinburgh. That is simply out of many people's reach. I understand why people take their cars to work in such circumstances.</p><p>The question whether an incoming Government should be allowed to determine its own priorities has been thrown up several times today and in previous weeks. Margaret Smith said that we are engaging in the old politics and that we will have our way, regardless. I refer her to what Sarah Boyack&#8212;who is not in the chamber&#8212;once said. In 1999, as the Minister for Transport and the Environment in the incoming Labour-Liberal Executive, Sarah Boyack made a statement in which she ditched the previous Conservative Government's commitment to improvements to the Preston roundabout on the A92 to Balfarg, which is in my constituency, and reduced the A8000 from trunk road status. There was a debate, but the majority Government held no vote on whether what was proposed should be implemented.</p><p>I was the convener of the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill Committee, not one member of which was convinced of the robustness of the funding and the business case for the Borders railway, which is why we insisted on the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications coming to the committee and giving commitments.

He has a difficult brief because he has <place-holder colnum=\"1060\"/> inherited a mess from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who neglected housing in Scotland for the eight years for which they were in government. I acknowledge fully that the previous Administration put through the Parliament a raft of homelessness and housing legislation that had the SNP's support but, by and large, that legislation was underfunded and those chickens are coming home to roost.</p><p>Let us examine the state of housing in Scotland. We face record waiting lists, record levels of homelessness and the lowest number of first-time buyers on record. We did not need the research document that has been issued today to tell us that; the trends have been apparent for a number of years.</p><p>Given the importance of housing, I am delighted that the SNP Government has decided to hold a parliamentary debate on the subject in its first month in office. In the second session of Parliament, the previous Executive, in contrast, did not hold a single debate on housing in 2003. It was not until 4 February 2004 that it held a debate on the subject. In the first parliamentary session, the first such debate was not held until 10 November 1999, when the topic was homelessness rather than housing. The SNP Government should take no lectures from the Labour members who complain about a lack of commitment to housing.</p><p>The housing organisations claim that 30,000 houses are needed in Scotland. I have no doubt that they are right, but that is simply recognition of the backlog in house building that the previous Executive allowed to build up. The previous Executive's record is quite shameful. Every year between 1999 and 2004, the Executive built fewer houses than the Tories did in 1995. That is why we have a backlog.</p><p>I am delighted that the housing minister will progress the proposal to create a Scottish housing support fund, which was in our manifesto. That will make an enormous difference to first-time buyers. As Mary Scanlon mentioned, it is not dissimilar to the Tories' policy, but it is a great deal better. I invite Mary Scanlon to engage with us.</p><p>Patrick Harvie said that our proposal could be inflationary, but I am sure that he attended the meeting of the Communities Committee in session 2 at which the previous Executive's expert, Professor Bramley, said that a properly targeted Scottish housing support fund&#8212;which is what the SNP proposes&#8212;would not produce inflationary pressures in the housing market. Patrick Harvie should have another look at what Professor Bramley said.</p><p>There are many things that the Government must do. I urge the minister to examine, at the <place-holder colnum=\"1061\"/> earliest opportunity, the situation of the GHA and to ensure that those housing associations that are in a position to receive houses receive them as quickly as possible.

On <place-holder colnum=\"668\"/> Monday, I had the great pleasure of visiting Diageo's Cameronbridge distillery in Windygates to find out more about its &#163;40 million expansion plans. There has been whisky production on the site for almost 200 years. Those companies are two of the oldest in Fife, if not in Scotland, and I am delighted that they are both pushing ahead with plans for biomass energy projects. They are setting a necessary example to some of our newer businesses.</p><p>Tullis Russell has proposed a &#163;100 million biomass project, which will reduce Scotland's emissions by 20 per cent and contribute 6 per cent of Scotland's renewable energy targets. When I was in Brussels last week, there was real excitement about the Tullis Russell plans. The project is of precisely the kind that Scotland needs and I know that the SNP ministers have been working hard with the company to make its plans a reality. That is in contrast to the previous Executive, which did nothing to help Tullis Russell to bring its plans to fruition.</p><p>Diageo is determined that the Cameronbridge distillery expansion will generate environmental benefits. It expects to be able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through bioenergy options. I was surprised to learn that the distillery at Cameronbridge uses a quarter of all Scotland's wheat production. Without getting technical about whisky production, I can tell members that, after the process is completed, the spent grain is disposed of. That grain will be used in the new biomass plant. I cannot be alone in hoping that there will be emissions from that plant and that the air around Windygates will be filled with whisky fumes&#8212;alas, I fear that that will be a vain hope.</p><p>Diageo also wishes to open up a disused railway line from Methil to Cameronbridge to enable rail freight to be carried, which will reduce road transport by up to 2 million heavy goods vehicle miles a year. However, it is proving difficult to get agreement from Network Rail on the matter.</p><p>Tullis Russell and Diageo are doing their bit for the environment. In fact, they are leading the way in Scotland and I am delighted to offer them all the support that I can. However, it is vital that individual companies are given the support of Government, Government agencies and agencies under the direction of ministers. We need to ensure that those organisations match the ambition of our companies and make it clear that we will not accept it when obstacles or bureaucracy are used as excuses for inaction.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greener Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my good friend Joe FitzPatrick on his first speech.

Only the sheer pigheadedness of Labour and the Liberal Democrats has kept in place the tolls, which have discriminated against the people of Fife all this time. In March 2006, the former Minister for Transport and Telecommunications, Tavish Scott, announced that the tolls would be removed from the Erskine bridge. A debate on an SNP motion prompted the minister to announce a review of that review, which Labour and Liberal members then voted for instead of voting to abolish the tolls on the Tay. Repeatedly, the then minister was pressed to call a halt on the relocation of the toll plaza while the review was taking place, but he refused. That decision by Tavish Scott has cost millions of pounds, as the toll plaza has been renewed.

That is as important as connecting our communities by rail&#8212;one should not be done instead of the other.</p><p>It is almost 10 years since I became involved in the campaign to restore the Thornton to Leven rail link. Levenmouth is the largest urban conurbation in Scotland that has no access to a rail link. To me, the case for reopening the line is as overwhelming now as it was 10 years ago. I believe that the whole corridor is intact and that compulsory purchase would not be needed.</p><p>I well remember the case that was considered by Fife Council&#8212;when Christine May was its leader, I think&#8212;which was a travesty. Despite the huge conurbation and despite the fact that the line could be connected to the Fife rail line, Fife Council found that the reopening of the Leven to Thornton rail line would be uneconomic so it refused to support it. I am glad that time has moved on and that there now seems to be a willingness to acknowledge the case for the reopening of the Thornton to Leven rail line. That is mostly to do with Diageo. I cannot say how welcome the company's intervention in the debate <place-holder colnum=\"33687\"/> is; its commitment to the reopening of the line for freight brings the tantalising possibility that we will also see the return of passenger travel.</p><p>The new station at Markinch is very welcome and there will be more car parking space. More car parking space has also been provided at Kirkcaldy. However, Roseanna Cunningham made the important point about ensuring that there is provision further back on the line. If people in Leven and Methil did not have to travel to Kirkcaldy and Markinch but instead had their own railway station, we would not always be looking to expand the car parks at those railway stations.</p><p>I understand that there is still a problem with the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail line, in respect of freight, with Transport Scotland and English Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway Limited. I understand that Transport Scotland has not yet agreed to encourage EWS to come off the Forth rail bridge and use that line instead. Unless that problem can be solved, it will limit Diageo.

I was working with Shelter when the Children (Scotland) Bill was going through Westminster. I think that I am right in saying that, in the Scottish Grand Committee, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton was absolutely steadfast in ensuring that, for the first time, local authorities had a duty of care to young people and a duty to assist older children who were leaving care.</p><p>However, I will remember Lord James best for what he did not do. As Minister of State for Home Affairs and Health at the Scottish Office, he ensured that homelessness legislation that the Tories introduced in England and Wales was not introduced in Scotland. He, his officials, Shelter Scotland and many other organisations fought very hard to ensure that that regressive legislation did not see the light of day in this country, and we should pay great tribute to him for that. I wish him well in whatever he does in the future. He has graced this Parliament and has been a real gentleman to most of us.</p><p>Before I turn to the motion under debate, I should also say that Parliament was visited by a group of Madras college pupils, led by Lynn <place-holder colnum=\"33572\"/> Brown, who is an absolutely inspirational modern studies teacher. Despite the HMIE report that Iain Smith referred to, which slammed the college's physical state, the institution itself does extremely fine work, and teachers such as Lynn Brown must be congratulated on their commitment to the young people in their care.</p><p>Iain Smith mentioned Fife Council's education service. Last month, the council's latest education budget indicated a cut next year of &#163;5 million, which comes on top of the &#163;10 million cut that was made in 2006-07. Over the years, it has been almost impossible to find out from Fife Council the number of teachers who are employed in Fife&#8212;in fact, one official document gives two separate figures. It is hardly any wonder that the council has never allowed the information to emerge. As I made clear to Hugh Henry, in 1997, 1,733 teachers were employed in Fife; however, that number has now fallen to 1,691. That has not happened because pupil numbers have fallen: the current teacher pupil ratio in Fife is exactly the same as it was in 1998. The Labour mantra might well be, \"Education, education, education\", but any analysis of the figures for Fife's education service as set out in the statistical bulletin will show that there has been cut after cut after cut.</p><p>I am not the only one who is saying these things. I have a leaflet from two Labour candidates that was distributed in Levenmouth, which is part of Gordon Brown's Westminster constituency as well as being in the Central Fife constituency. Of course, none of the existing Labour councillors is standing for election in Levenmouth, as they have all taken the money and run, but one of the Labour candidates states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Labour in Fife will conduct a root and branch review of all funding with the objective of cutting out waste and bureaucracy and getting more money to the front line, to teachers, to classrooms and ultimately to pupils\".</p><p>That says it all. Labour has been in power in Fife for more than 30 years; the Labour Executive has been in power since 1999; and we have had a Labour Government at Westminster since 1997, but despite that, teacher numbers in Fife have gone down and levels of attainment in our secondary schools continue to fall.</p><p>I visited a school in Glenrothes recently, where the children were absolutely wonderful. They put on a debate for the MSPs who were present, the subject of which was whether school trips are necessary. Of course, most of us would say that school trips are necessary and that it is good for children to get out of their environment and visit places such as the Scottish Parliament. However, the two sets of children in the debate argued about whether school trips are necessary. The argument that was articulated against school trips was that they are too expensive and the money should be <place-holder colnum=\"33573\"/> used for books and other equipment. The money that they were talking about is money that schools and pupils raise in open days and jumble sales. That money should be used for school trips and other extras, but it is being siphoned off to pay for essentials, such as books.</p><p>That is the record of Fife Council and the Labour Party in Fife in the past 30 years. If the Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive is prepared to put up with that, that is disgraceful. Those parties have let down the pupils and parents of Fife through their refusal to get involved in the difficult situation in Fife Council's education service.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13382830", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That was one of the finest speeches that I have heard in the chamber for a long time, and I am very sorry that it marks Susan Deacon's final contribution to Parliament.

It is appropriate to record that, since the Scottish Parliament was opened in 1999, services for MS patients have improved. Most health board areas now have MS nurses, and beta interferon is widely prescribed rather than being available only on a postcode basis.

Why cannot ministers write to the SMC to say that they have additional information and to invite the SMC to reconsider?

I have never been known for making sound judgments and that was certainly not a sound judgment: the committee went on and on and on. The Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill showed the sheer complexity and technical nature of the long-running saga of the Borders railway.</p><p>I am pleased that the system has been streamlined, because it is unfair to expect MSPs to involve themselves in the technicalities that we encountered. On one side were the promoters with their technical advisers, and on the other side was the committee with its technical advisers. Although I pay tribute to all members who have been on private bill committees in the past, I am sure that they would acknowledge that the process was extremely onerous, difficult and time consuming.</p><p>I welcome the Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill. I would have liked it to include some parliamentary involvement in the new process, but we are where we are. It is certainly a heck of a lot better than the previous system, and I have no hesitation in giving it my support.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13378688", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy&#8212;actually, I am ecstatic&#8212;to speak in the debate after my experiences of the current private bill process.

The hungry for success campaign seemed to be working fairly well and I struggled to understand why statutory measures were required. The turkey twizzlers that were so hated by Jamie Oliver were never a feature of school meals in Scotland, thanks to the hungry for success campaign.</p><p>However, the exchange, which has already been mentioned, between the committee and the Scottish Food and Drink Federation and the British Soft Drinks Association convinced me that the bill is needed. They suggested that they could meet the nutritional standards by reducing the size of their chocolate bars and that concerns about fizzy drinks in schools could be solved by providing straws. We were grateful for the British Dental Association's absolute rejection of the idea that straws can mitigate the effects of fizzy drinks on teeth.</p><p>In the face of an obesity epidemic, appalling oral health and growing concern about the food that we shovel into ourselves and our children, the evidence from the food and drink associations was astonishing. It convinced me that culture change is not enough and that legislation is required. I hope that the food and drink associations and their member organisations will reflect on the evidence that was given to the committee and consider whether they served their cause and their membership well.</p><p>I turn to the issues that divided the committee and are the subject of the amendments to the motion. The bill does not provide for free school meals. It affords local authorities the flexibility to provide free breakfasts and snacks but not the flexibility to introduce free school meals. As Patrick Harvie said, that is illogical. If local authorities are to be trusted to make decisions about breakfast and snacks, I do not see why we cannot trust them to make decisions about free school meals. As Charlie Gordon pointed out, we should give them the flexibility to do that. The Government at Westminster has given such flexibility to local authorities in England and Wales, but the Labour and Liberal Executive in Scotland will not provide similar flexibility here.</p><p>The committee heard evidence from the Child Poverty Action Group and others on Hull City Council's pilot project to provide free school meals. That evidence was not sought by the committee and was not part of the Executive's consultation. The majority of the committee pointed out, rightly, that the pilot scheme in Hull has not been evaluated in Scotland. That is why they would not support my proposition that local authorities in Scotland should be able to introduce pilot schemes on free school meals. Today, in a statement on the project in Hull, the CPAG states:<place-holder colnum=\"31354\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"There has ... been a 'dramatic' increase in the take up of school meals, with 64% of pupils now taking a healthy school lunch.\"</p><p>That is a figure that we can only dream about. The CPAG also quotes the director of the institute for learning at the University of Hull, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There has been a significant impact in all areas of children's schooling: from behaviour, social relationships, health and learning, children were more relaxed, more alert, more calm and less irritable.\"</p><p>I instinctively believe that a nutritious school meal at lunch time is a benefit to children. Even if there is no evidence to prove that, I instinctively believe it, as a parent who has brought up children. Labour and Liberal members might believe that there is no benefit to a nutritional school meal at lunch time, but they have no evidence to support that view. If they are convinced that they are correct, why do they not have the courage to allow local authorities to run pilot schemes in Scotland so that we can evaluate the health benefits and the costs to local authorities? However, the Executive has set its face against that.</p><p>The Executive has also set its face against the committee's unanimous view that the provisions in the bill must be extended to independent schools. One of the minister's officials said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Essentially, it is not normal practice for the Executive to impose legislative burdens on independent schools as, by their very nature, they are independent.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Communities Committee</em>, 24 October 2006; c 4148.]</p><p>Frankly, I have never heard such nonsense in my life. That would mean that Disclosure Scotland would not apply and that no inspections would ever take place. Of course we place legislative burdens on independent schools. As I have said to the minister before, the issue is about all our children in Scotland, regardless of where they are educated. I suggest that the bill should be extended to cover the independent sector.</p><p>Anonymous systems using palm prints and biometrics have been talked about. If the Government wants to introduce identification cards or palm-print and biometric technology, it should have the courage to come to the Parliament and debate it. What is not acceptable is that, by the back door, in a piece of legislation that has nothing to do with it, the Executive would introduce palm printing and biometrics to our schools. That is unacceptable behaviour.</p><p>I am sorry that David Davidson is no longer in the chamber, because his speech was the silliest that I have heard for such a long time.

I also congratulate the Scottish Council for Single Homeless on its home smart campaign.</p><p>From a previous existence&#8212;many moons ago in 1988&#8212;I remember the I'm offski! campaign, which was, I think, the first attempt to get schools to engage young people in education on housing. In my time at Shelter, we tried hard to ensure that housing education was part of the curriculum. I look back on those days and wish that the Government of the day had taken Shelter, SCSH and other organisations up on that because there has been an explosion in youth homelessness since 1988. Advice such as was contained in I'm offski! and which is provided by the home smart campaign is just the sort of information that young people need so that they can avoid the pitfall of becoming homeless. Avoiding that pitfall is more difficult for them today than it was in 1988. There are greater pressures not just on young people, but on local authorities&#8212;which have to deal with more homelessness applications and longer general waiting lists for housing&#8212;than there were in 1988.</p><p>I turn to the problem of the number of young people who leave care and become homeless. There are many reasons&#8212;some of which Linda Fabiani mentioned&#8212;why they might not be able to sustain tenancies once they are given them. For example, they might allow their house or flat to become a community centre. As well as wanting schools to take up the home smart campaign, I would like the Executive to commit to introducing it to young people who leave care, wherever they may be, as part of its programme of education for that group. It is a tool that the Executive should use. There is a need for part of the campaign to be targeted at young people in care because they are the most vulnerable young people.</p><p>I want the home smart campaign to be rolled out throughout Scotland. At the moment, it is for <place-holder colnum=\"31317\"/> individual schools and teachers to decide whether to embrace the campaign, but it would be extremely useful if the minister and the Executive gave guidance to local authorities to the effect that it is an excellent example of a campaign that should be embraced. This week, the Executive has rightly agreed to the showing in schools throughout Scotland of the Al Gore film on climate change. That is an important move of which I am highly supportive, but the youngsters who become homeless on leaving school and home have great needs, so although I welcome the commitment to show the Al Gore film, I would like the minister to consider the possibility of issuing guidance to schools and local authorities to ensure that campaigns such as SCSH's home smart campaign are introduced.</p><p>I will finish on a wee sour note. The home smart campaign has been funded by the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, which is a registered charity, and by Lovell House Developments Limited, but it would have been nice if such an important initiative had been supported with Executive money. The Executive has failed to provide money, so I would like the minister to offer some Executive muscle to ensure that the campaign is encouraged in schools&#8212;the future of our young people depends on its success.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376770", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Home Smart"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to those that have already been offered to Linda Fabiani on raising this important debate.

Nobody is satisfied with it. Ministers believe that the Planning etc (Scotland) Bill will deal with those concerns. In that context, they have invested a lot of hope in pre-application consultation. The bill will go a long way to solving the current problems, but I regret that Sandra White's proposals on a very limited TPRA in specific circumstances have not been accepted.</p><p>Of course, legislation can do only so much. Changing the cultures of local authorities, developers and communities will be much harder than passing the bill, but it is required to make the legislation work. Furthermore, the shortage of qualified planners must be addressed urgently. The Executive must ensure that adequate resources are made available, or the legislation will not do what all members hope it will do.</p><p>Mr McLetchie and Fergus Ewing exposed the Executive's compulsory double tax on businesses. Ministers should have listened to the FSB on that issue.</p><p>I am not convinced that the position of Fife, which will be included within the overlapping boundaries of two strategic development plan areas, has been sufficiently addressed. I am still concerned that the wishes of Fife will be overruled by the needs of the larger partner authorities.</p><p>However, the bill has the potential to change the existing planning system for the better.

After almost two sessions of this Parliament, we are not getting it right. Unlike Westminster, we have only one opportunity to get legislation right. Stages 1 and 2 work adequately, but for a complex piece of legislation such as the bill, stage 3 leaves me profoundly dissatisfied.</p><p>I do not think that there is unwillingness to change, nor am I blaming the Executive. Rather, there is an inability to see how we can change. I have a couple of suggestions. We faced an avalanche of amendments at stage 3, some of which&#8212;Pauline McNeill's amendments on houses in multiple occupation, for example&#8212;had never been considered at stage 2 and on which no evidence had been led at stage 1. As it always does, the Executive lodged many stage 3 amendments, some of which were substantial. It would be helpful if we had a system whereby stage 3 amendments were accompanied by an explanatory paragraph from the member or minister. That might have gone some way to dealing with the briefings that we received on Pauline McNeill's HMO amendments.</p><p>The Presiding Officers also have a responsibility to be less flexible in what they accept as stage 3 amendments. For example, they should reject stage 3 amendments that could have been but were not lodged at stage 2. That would free up some time at stage 3 and force members to address issues earlier in the process, instead of looking at an issue two weeks before a stage 3 debate and then deciding to lodge an amendment, which I suspect is what is happening on some occasions.</p><p>We have a lot to do. We need to address those issues before next year.</p><p>Finally, I wish Johann Lamont well in her new role, although I warn her that it is only going to last until May.</p>", "hdate": "2006-11-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13371774", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning etc (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Communities Committee's clerks for their sterling work in the past months and all my Communities Committee colleagues for their work.

It is therefore quite appropriate that I bring the debate back to the glorious kingdom of Fife.</p><p>I want to pick up on a couple of issues such as the bronze age burial cist at Sillerhole. It is <place-holder colnum=\"29177\"/> important that some of our artefacts be retained locally and that the National Museum of Scotland does not always get to cherry pick the best&#8212;after all, it is our heritage and it is important to make sure that as much as possible of it remains in the care of local people. That is why I support the Historic Environment Advisory Council for Scotland's recommendation that local authorities and other agencies should have a statutory duty to conserve and care for the historical environment.</p><p>We have seen cultural vandalism in Fife in the not-too-distant past. Christine May mentioned the henge at Balfarg, which was moved by the then Glenrothes Development Corporation to another site. That is cultural vandalism, in my view and in the view of others. If there had been a statutory duty on public bodies such as that corporation, that could not have happened.</p><p>I also want to mention the Wemyss caves, which are close to my heart and to the hearts of many in Fife. They contain some of the best ancient cave drawings, but are under threat from coastal erosion. We have already lost too much of the Wemyss caves. I know that it will cost a great deal of money to protect them, but I cannot believe that any other country in Europe would allow such a valuable piece of heritage to disappear completely. Some of the world's most fabulous caves, particularly those in France, have been preserved, so I do not believe that it is beyond our wit or will as politicians and individuals to find a way to preserve one of the most spectacular examples of our heritage and past. I urge the minister to say something about the Wemyss caves in her winding up speech. When she is finishing the debate, could she also address the points that Christine May made about how best to preserve our heritage for the future?</p><p>I acknowledge the work that Christine May has done, particularly on the Planning etc (Scotland) Bill.

The Executive still has no plan B in place now that Edinburgh, Stirling and Renfrewshire have rejected wholesale stock transfer. As the Minister for Communities told me two weeks ago at the Communities Committee,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Where community ownership takes place, new borrowing is not public expenditure, so it makes perfect sense from the Treasury's point of view to write off debt for community ownership but not for councils that retain their own stock ... The debt is there and will remain there until people vote for community ownership. That is just a fact of life\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Communities Committee</em>, 24 October 2006; c 4127.]</p><p>Johann Lamont gave powerful support to housing associations in her speech, and I acknowledge fully that transfer to housing associations is not privatisation, that housing associations contribute a great deal to their communities and that, in many places, people believe in them passionately. However, the point is that the Government's flagship policy of whole stock transfer was never driven by the tenants' aspirations; it was driven by no more than Treasury policy.</p><p>At the Communities Committee, the minister rejected my suggestion that he get in touch with the Treasury and ask it to write off the capital debt on Scottish housing stock. If he genuinely cared about the conditions in which people live, he would recognise that it is unfair to expect current local authority housing tenants to pay out of their rent for the historical capital debt on houses that have been sold or demolished and to take responsibility for bringing housing stock up to the quality standard that the Government has set. Rents cannot keep going up. That would be neither fair nor sustainable.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm said last week at question time that the debacle over Glasgow's second-stage stock transfer had no bearing on the no votes in Edinburgh and Stirling. In fact, it was central to those votes. To put it simply, the people of Glasgow were promised the second-stage transfer of their housing to the housing <place-holder colnum=\"29028\"/> associations about which Johann Lamont spoke so passionately, but it has not been delivered. Even now, the minister is unable and unwilling to say when or if any of those transfers will take place. That is a debacle in anyone's language. It is a matter of trust, and tenants in communities that are now faced with a ballot simply do not believe the minister when he promises them anything because he has let down the Glasgow tenants. That is well known throughout Scotland and explains why he gets the results that he is getting.</p><p>Since the Government came to power, the communities budget, which includes housing, has risen in real terms by 5.9 per cent while the whole Scottish budget has increased by 17.1 per cent. The minister must explain to members why the housing budget has risen much more slowly than any other Scottish Executive budget. The impact of that underfunding is clear: in every year from 1999 to 2004, the Government built fewer houses in the social rented sector than the Tories built in 1995.</p><p>We have a crisis in housing.

This closure showed only too well the indifference of government, any government, to the future of the country's railways, closure procedures having been initiated by a Conservative administration and implemented by a Labour administration.</p><p class=\"indent\">Today, politicians promise a railway renaissance and there is even talk of restoring a service between Edinburgh and Galashiels, but the current railway fiasco, along with a lack of any meaningful financing for what remains of our railway network, does little to inspire confidence in the future.\"</p><p>Today, we have a wonderful opportunity to right the wrongs of years ago and to inspire confidence in the writer and others in the Borders that the Parliament will deliver the Waverley line.</p><p>The bill has taken 33 months to get to this stage, and I believe that no other bill has taken as long to go through the Parliament. I am not particularly pleased about that record. However, I thank most sincerely all the committee clerks, including Fergus Cochrane, who has been a star throughout the process. The committee travelled to Galashiels and Newtongrange on cold, windy and wet Mondays in February and sat together through evidence-taking meetings. We now know more about noise decibel levels than we perhaps ever wanted to know.</p><p>I will speak about some of the main issues that arise from our consideration stage report. We have debated Stow station and the railway's proceeding all the way to Tweedbank, so I will focus on other issues. In his closing speech, Ted Brocklebank will speak about appropriate assessment and respond to points that were raised during the debate.<place-holder colnum=\"26679\"/></p><p>I pay tribute to the objectors who engaged with us during our consideration of their objections. We sought to create a process and an atmosphere that allowed them to engage and openly question the railway's impact on them. The clarity and professionalism of their written and oral evidence were a credit to them. We realise that some of them, particularly those on whom land take will have an impact, will be disappointed at the conclusions that we reached in our report, but we had to make difficult decisions. I hope that everyone recognises the care and time that we took and the substantial improvements and safeguards that we introduced to the bill, many of which emerged from objectors' concerns. We had to balance the promoter's desire for the scheme and its preferred route against the impact on individuals. Our overall conclusion is that an appropriate balance has been struck between the rights of those individuals who will be adversely affected by the railway and the project's wider community benefits.</p><p>In addressing some of the objectors' most common concerns, we secured an assurance from the promoter that minimal land will be acquired&#8212;it will be restricted to the land that is required for the purposes of the railway. We have amended the bill to remove land plots that are no longer required.</p><p>We have further amended the bill to ensure that the environmental impact of the railway is no worse than the residual impacts that were identified in the various environmental documents and to ensure that pledges that the promoter made on the provision of environmental mitigation are delivered&#8212;for example, the promoter undertook to install a noise barrier at a property.</p><p>We have also amended the bill to ensure that the code of construction practice, which sets out how contractors will mitigate impacts during the construction phase of the railway, and the noise and vibration policy, which sets the threshold levels above which noise and vibration mitigation will be provided during the railway's operation, are legally enforced. If the promoter breaches the requirements of those documents, the local planning authority will have the power to enforce compliance to the extent that it could stop the project.</p><p>In our report, we were critical of the Scottish Executive over its lack of a decision on whether a voluntary purchase scheme would be supported and over the unacceptable time that it took to make a decision on whether it would support an advance purchase scheme. Objectors contacted the committee to describe the impact that the delay was having on them, yet that appears to have had little effect on the Executive in progressing the matter with due urgency. However, a positive decision has now been made <place-holder colnum=\"26680\"/> on APS, and I understand that discussions are now under way with affected property owners, albeit very late in the day. I look forward to hearing what the Minister for Transport has to say to those people&#8212;some of whom are in the gallery&#8212;in his speech.</p><p>On voluntary purchase, in our view, the Executive has paid little regard to people whose property could be bought because of the severe adverse impact of the railway on them. I wrote to the minister on 5 June, asking for a decision. I have received no reply whatever to that letter. I will give way to the Minister for Transport now if he is willing to give a straight yes or no answer on whether there will be a voluntary purchase scheme.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364515", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is an enormous pleasure to speak to and move the motion on behalf of the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill Committee.

It might assist the chamber if I clarify the purpose of those two sections and why we amended them.</p><p>Section 26 confers a power on the authorised undertaker&#8212;initially Scottish Borders Council&#8212;to acquire land compulsorily. On receipt of that power, it shall kick-start the compulsory acquisition process by serving notices to treat or general vesting declarations on affected landowners stating precisely what land is required.</p><p>The consideration stage amendment made by the committee reduced from seven to five years the time period during which those notices must be served. That means not that the land must be acquired within five years&#8212;desirable though that might be&#8212;but that the process of acquisition must begin within five years. In our view, there will be a <place-holder colnum=\"26665\"/> question mark over the competent management of the project if within five years the authorised undertaker is not able to firm up precisely the railway's design, identify exactly what land it requires and secure the necessary funding to pay for it.</p><p>Members will be well aware of the history of errors made in identifying land and landowners who might be affected by the railway and in failing to notify them. Those errors prolonged the passage of the bill, and such delay cannot go on. Surely, after everything that has happened, the promoter now has all the necessary arrangements in hand to move forward quickly to firm up the identification of land and to negotiate its purchase to allow construction to commence.</p><p>Amendment 2, in the name of the minister, would allow the Scottish ministers to extend by order the period for the compulsory acquisition of land from five years to a period not in excess of 10 years. The minister is seeking to insert a provision into the bill that will confer delegated powers on ministers&#8212;a provision that will not be scrutinised by the Parliament's Subordinate Legislation Committee within the time available. I note that the minister has chosen not to use the affirmative resolution procedure, which would have required any order to be approved by the Parliament. Where is the evidence for that approach? Why has the minister never made representations to us about those matters? He had nearly three years to do so.</p><p>The committee reduced the time period from seven years to five with no scope for extension, but now the minister wants to take it perhaps to 10 years. Why? Had the committee not reduced it to five, would the seven years still have been sufficient? Would the minister have sought to amend the seven years? Why is a period of 10 years needed, how did the Executive reach that figure, and why did it not do so at the outset, when it expected the railway to be built two years earlier than it does now?</p><p>I turn to amendment 3. Section 35 confers permitted development powers on the authorised undertaker. It grants planning permission for works subject to the condition that development must be begun&#8212;not completed, but begun&#8212;within eight years of royal assent. That means that digging excavation trenches might be all the authorised undertaker need do.</p><p>Desirable as it is for all concerned that the project is completed by 2011, development is taken to be initiated when operations are begun. The amendment made by the committee at consideration stage gives the authorised undertaker until 2014 to exercise those powers&#8212;eight years from now, and three years beyond when the authorised undertaker and the Executive <place-holder colnum=\"26666\"/> have repeatedly stated that the railway should be constructed and operational. Members may draw comparisons with the time limits provided for in other railway or tram bills, but those are different schemes, with different bills promoted by different promoters, scrutinised by different committees and with different histories and backgrounds.</p><p>I reiterate that people need clarity about the project.

The Stow maps, plans and sections identify land plots that have been revised as a result of new Ordnance Survey mapping of the area and provide an update of the details that are shown in the maps, plans and sections for the entire scheme that were lodged with the bill on introduction. I urge members to support my amendments.</p><p>I oppose the amendments that Bristow Muldoon lodged. He seeks to overturn the amendment that the committee unanimously agreed&#8212;that there should be a station at Stow. The committee made it clear at the preliminary and consideration stages that there should be a station at Stow. Of course, Mr Muldoon made no representations on that matter or any other in the preliminary stage debate in Parliament or to the committee. He should have made much of the case that he has made today at the preliminary stage, but he chose not to.</p><p>The promoter gave evidence that it had taken a hard-hearted economic business view of Stow. My committee looked beyond the business case and focused on maximising the social benefits that the railway can bring to the wider Borders community. If those benefits are to be maximised, the railway must serve a wider catchment area than just that around Galashiels. The railway cannot be called a Borders railway if it has only two stations at the bottom end of the line and then 20-plus miles of track until it reaches Midlothian, which will have five stations.</p><p>I hope that the Local Government and Transport Committee, which Bristow Muldoon convenes, does not make all its decisions based purely on the financial case. If we do that, we might as well close every railway in Scotland and not build another. As I recall, the evidence from the Strategic Rail Authority remarked on the difficulty of finding viable railways in Britain. Broadly speaking, railways are not profitable in London or Glasgow and are unlikely to be profitable in the Borders or, dare I say it, between Airdrie and Bathgate.</p><p>The creation of a station at Stow will provide scope to draw additional passengers to the railway from commuters and travellers from towns such as Lauder and Clovenfords. Widening the social and <place-holder colnum=\"26658\"/> economic opportunities and improving the area's accessibility to the capital are the prime reasons why the committee amended the bill to provide for an additional stop at Stow.</p><p>Bristow Muldoon suggested that timetabling would be a difficulty for the proposed station. However, I can assure him that the committee was told that time had been saved on the line. As a committee, we reckoned that the time that had been saved was more than adequate to serve the station at Stow.</p><p>In its evidence the promoter, which did not support a station at Stow on purely economic grounds, suggested that such a station could be added at a later stage. The committee's decision to include provision in the bill at consideration stage for a station at Stow was not inconsistent with that position. The bill as it stands does not require a station at Stow&#8212;although that is what we want&#8212;but enables the creation of such a station by providing for all the powers and permissions that would be necessary for such a station to be built. The amendments in the name of Bristow Muldoon would remove those powers and permissions. It is clear that he has no intention of ever providing a station at Stow.</p><p>The opportunity to build a railway comes very rarely. If the railway is to be built without a station at Stow, does anyone seriously believe that the station will be built at some time in the future? I do not, and I doubt that many other members believe that. That is why the Parliament should oppose the amendments in the name of Bristow Muldoon.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364440", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill: Final Stage: Section 13 &#8212; Authority to acquire land"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Amendments 6 to 8 and 13 to 15, which are in my name, are technical.

I am thinking, in particular, of transport infrastructure. When the open golf championship is being held in St Andrews, it is almost impossible for people to find their way through the town. The only people who are lucky are the ones who can afford to bring their private planes into Leuchars. The Ministry of Defence is quite happy to take private business into Leuchars to ferry the elite into St Andrews itself, but the rest of us who are in cars, vans, lorries and buses find it extremely difficult to find our way along the roads. That is not to say that I do not support the reinstatement of the railway&#8212;I do&#8212;but we desperately need adequate road links to and from St Andrews.

That might be an argument for reopening some of our disused railways.</p><p>Andrew Arbuckle was right to draw attention to the improvements that have been made to our coastline and beaches. The Fife coastal path has indeed opened up the area to tourism and the blue flags that we now see flying over some beaches are testament to the work that the Executive, Fife Council and others have done to improve the quality of our beaches and bathing waters.</p><p>As I sat watching the media coverage from Cellardyke a few months ago, two things occurred to me. The first was the good sense of the people and poultry producers of the area compared with the mass hysteria of the media. The second was that the beautiful coastal village of Cellardyke was being seen all over the world. I hope that that will translate into an increase in tourism.</p><p>I turn to the ship-to-ship transfer of oil, which is where Andrew Arbuckle started. There have been debates in the Parliament about the proposals and many questions have been asked of the minister, who has kindly met members who are interested in the issue. Although it is true that the consultation process that is being gone through at the moment leaves most of the decision making to Westminster, I am not as pessimistic as Andrew Arbuckle is that nothing can be done here. In all our communities, both those along the Fife coast and those along the East Lothian coast, all MSPs, regardless of political party, have argued that such transfers must not be allowed to happen. Ship-to-ship oil transfers would be a disaster simply waiting to happen.</p><p>The idea that we have little influence over the outcome of the consultation does not appeal to me. I believe that ministers still have a duty under the EU habitats directive to ensure that our coastlines and wild areas are protected. Therefore, I urge the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development to redouble her efforts to ensure that she can find a way through the issue for the benefit both of our communities and of our stunning coastal scenery. Quite frankly, I do not believe that the people and communities of Fife are prepared to accept that a <place-holder colnum=\"26223\"/> lack of clarity over whether Westminster or Holyrood is responsible means that the proposed transfers will simply be allowed to happen.</p><p>People do not want ship-to-ship transfers to happen and the political will is against the proposal.

Few communities are satisfied that their views are taken into account and they are at a disadvantage in terms of how the present system works. Will the bill meet the needs of planners, communities, business and local authorities? Will it restore confidence and trust? Those are big questions and they are difficult to answer because so much of the detail of the bill will be left to secondary legislation.</p><p>As the Communities Committee's report says, that absence of detail has restricted its ability to scrutinise certain provisions in the bill. Witnesses, too, felt that there were many aspects of the bill on which they were unable to comment. The Royal Town Planning Institute said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The success of this bill will depend ... on secondary legislation.\"</p><p>It went on to say that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the devil remains in the detail which has yet to come.\"</p><p>Frankly, ministers, that is no way in which to legislate.

The areas in which the committee has asked for secondary legislation under the affirmative procedure include neighbour notification, development plans, pre-application consultations, appeals, good neighbour agreements and planning obligations. Those areas are the nub of the bill, but we do not have the details on them. I would welcome the minister's confirmation when she sums up that she accepts the need for secondary legislation in those areas to be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p><p>It is a matter of regret to me and to other members of my party that the Executive and a majority of the committee do not agree that there should be a limited third-party right of appeal.

My colleague Sandra White will lodge amendments at stage 2 on a third-party right of appeal.</p><p>As Stewart Stevenson said, the financial resolution is simply not good enough. There are resource implications that have not been identified and, if the bill is to work, the Executive must be honest and transparent about where those costs will lie. The bill will place new burdens on local authorities and it is vital that they be fully resourced to carry out their work. Like Christine Grahame, I have concerns about the planning gain supplement; we need clarity from the ministers on that.</p><p>I remain unconvinced about the Executive's proposals to include Fife in the overlapping boundaries of two strategic development planning authorities. I know that other Fife members share that concern. The Executive has already said that it will amend those proposals but, as a Fife MSP, I want to be reassured that the larger city authorities will not ride roughshod over Fife's needs. We have plenty evidence of that happening with the Forth Estuary Transport Authority on bridge tolls.</p><p>I turn to the aspects of the bill that have the potential to make the planning system better. Neighbour notification of development plans will play a key part in ensuring that communities are involved at the earliest stage. I welcome the transfer of responsibility for notifying neighbours from the applicant to the local authority. I also welcome pre-application consultation, but I urge the Executive to ensure that notification of it is as wide as possible. There should also be greater access to information on how applications are dealt with. Good neighbour agreements are positive, but the Executive needs to do more work on them before introducing the necessary secondary legislation.</p><p>The requirement on key agencies to co-operate with planning authorities is of great importance. Many members have mentioned Scottish Water, and I am struck by the evidence that COSLA gave the committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is Scottish Water that is delivering our development plans at the moment, because there are large areas of Scotland where local authorities cannot do development because of Scottish Water, whether it is in the development plan or not.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Communities Committee</em>, 22 March 2006; c 3307.]<place-holder colnum=\"25711\"/></p><p>Scottish Water needs to be sorted out, and I urge the ministers to take that on board, because many of us are concerned about it.

I commend the approach that the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill Committee took on that and suggest that the Executive should consider whether it can be developed further.</p><p>The national planning framework is vital. That is why, like Christine Grahame and Patrick Harvie, I believe that the Parliamentary Bureau should be left to decide on the timing of the parliamentary consideration of the framework, as it does on the consideration of bills. We should not have in the bill a commitment to 40 or 60 days' consideration; it should be left more open than that.</p><p>I will highlight two other issues. One is the minister's commitment that a development's impact on human health will be taken into account as part of the environmental impact assessment. I look forward to guidance on that being submitted to the committee for examination. I also look forward to the Greens' input on that issue when the guidance is submitted, as they made good points about it.

The subject of the meeting was the threat from Fife Council to the future of the Fife institute&#8212;to give its proper name, the Fife Institute of Physical and Recreational Education. While the Executive has been rightly concerned about obesity and lack of fitness in young people, for the past five years Fife Council has by stealth been working up proposals to engineer a situation whereby that institute will be closed and a new joint facility for Glenrothes and Kirkcaldy will be situated elsewhere. Thanks to the work of the community action group and the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, the people of Glenrothes are now aware of a facility that is renowned both locally and nationally&#8212;in Glenrothes, Fife and throughout Scotland. Since the brief for a joint facility was drawn up secretly in 2001, the amount of money that Fife institute receives from Fife Council has declined steadily, such that its funding is now one third of its 2001 level. As a consequence, the institute is in need of refurbishment. Although Fife Council submitted an application for funding to sportscotland last year, the application was turned down on the grounds that Fife Council had not provided sufficient information and lacked a long-term commitment to Fife institute.</p><p>Tomorrow, Fife Council's adult services committee will consider the future of the Fife institute. At a time when more leisure and sports facilities are needed, Fife Council wants fewer. It would substitute a centre of excellence with mediocrity. Every school in the area uses Fife institute for swimming lessons.

It is true that cancer patients in Fife wait longer for treatment than patients in almost every other part of Scotland. The figures released by the Scottish Executive show that, despite Executive promises that all <place-holder colnum=\"22716\"/> cancer patients will receive treatment within two months of being diagnosed, only 61 per cent of cancer patients in Fife are treated within two months. That is the third worst treatment rate of any health board in the country. The figures indicate that only the Western Isles NHS Board and the extinct Argyll and Clyde NHS Board areas have worse treatment rates. Fife is also well behind the national average rate of 74 per cent.</p><p>Although there may be individual problems within Fife, it is clear that comparing like with like&#8212;health board with health board&#8212;Fife NHS Board is failing the patients of Fife. Patients with colorectal cancer are particularly badly served, as a mere 20 per cent receive treatment within two months of diagnosis. Only 55 per cent of lung cancer patients in Fife are treated within the Executive's target period of two months.</p><p>As Iain Smith rightly says, at Queen Margaret hospital the median wait is 57 days compared to a median wait of 31 days throughout Scotland. The increase in waiting times in the second quarter of 2005 is extremely worrying because the issue of cancer treatment is one that members of the Scottish Parliament have raised with Fife NHS Board. We sought and were given assurances that the health board was well aware of the issue and was taking steps to address it.</p><p>The people of Fife are losing out in the Executive's postcode lottery&#8212;it is difficult to define it in any other way&#8212;for cancer treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer are crucial to maximise the chances of survival, yet patients in every other part of Scotland receive treatment quicker than patients in Fife. The Labour and Liberal party Executive has manifestly failed to fulfil the promise that it made in 2001 that all cancer patients would receive treatment within two months of diagnosis. Cancer patients in Fife are paying the price for that failure to deliver. For only one in five colorectal cancer patients to receive treatment within two months for a potentially fatal illness is nothing short of a scandal. Cancer patients in Fife cannot wait any longer. There can be no more excuses. The Executive has a moral duty to ensure that all cancer patients in Fife receive treatment as quickly as patients in other parts of Scotland.</p><p>Like Iain Smith, I will be interested to hear the minister's response. Given that the figures that we are discussing are the Executive's figures, I would like to know what representations it has made to Fife NHS Board about its appalling cancer treatment rate to date, what action it has asked Fife NHS Board to take and, if Fife NHS Board has failed to react to Executive pressure, what the minister intends to do about that.</p><p>Having cancer is distressing; it is particularly distressing that people in Fife who have cancer <place-holder colnum=\"22717\"/> have to wait so long for treatment. For a moment, I will hark back to the previous debate and tell the story of a young woman and a young man who lived together. He was diagnosed with cancer.

As Christine May highlighted, some of Fife's success stories need to be rolled out not just to the rest of Scotland but to other communities in Fife that have yet to benefit from them.

My only difficulty with the time2act campaign is its length, as it is due to end in January 2006.

There is a shortage of supply and we must make every effort to ensure that in the 21<sup>st</sup> century everybody has a decent home that is fit to live in. Many houses in Scotland are simply not fit for anyone to live in.</p><p>The big difficulty with Colin Fox's motion and with knowing what we mean by affordable housing is that there is no definition of affordable housing. We all have a shorthand for what we understand affordable housing to be. We need to be clear and the minister must take the lead. The definition of affordable housing changes depending on who one talks to at any given time.</p><p>A definition of affordable housing would help all of us when we are having debates in the chamber or elsewhere. Measuring what affordable housing <place-holder colnum=\"20786\"/> is cannot be too difficult. We have a measure for fuel poverty, which involves comparing income and fuel costs, so I cannot see why having a measure for affordable housing that involves measuring income against the cost of rented or owner-occupied housing should be too difficult.</p><p>The reality is that many people simply cannot afford to buy and cannot access a council house because they are on a waiting list. Therefore, we have a huge problem. Fiona Hyslop talked about the pressures on Edinburgh, but there are also pressures in Fife, for example. People are moving to Fife because houses there are more affordable&#8212;young families and children are moving there from the centre of Edinburgh. In turn, that puts pressure on Fife's house prices, which keep going up. We must recognise that what happens in one area of Scotland will have knock-on effects on other parts of Scotland.</p><p>Last year, the lowest number of social rented houses, council houses and housing association houses was built in Scotland since the final full year of the previous Conservative Government. That is simply unacceptable. Therefore, I welcome Midlothian Council's commitment to build 1,000 new homes, although that commitment is overdue, as Midlothian is a pressured area. I also welcome the recognition that the Highland Council area is a pressured area and the stopping there of the right to buy.</p><p>Mary Scanlon talked about 47p in every pound being used to pay the capital debt in the Highland region. That figure would not have been nearly as high if there had been no right to buy in the first place. The debt was left behind when the houses were sold off; the few tenants who are there are paying the capital debt for houses that are long gone.</p><p>Murray Tosh made a good point about why we should not use people's housing situation as a way of getting across our ideological points of view. As Colin Fox's motion suggests, it is essential that we find a way to ensure that everybody in Scotland in the 21<sup>st</sup> century has a decent house to live in. If the Parliament ensures that everyone does, it will have made the people of Scotland proud. However, all of us must work hard.

The Executive must make it clear in its statement how the legislation will be implemented in full because we are a long way from ensuring that everyone has decent and affordable accommodation in which to live. The Government does not have a responsibility to build every house, but it has a responsibility to ensure that the resources and structures are in place to ensure that houses are built. The Labour Party has been in power since 1997 and the Labour-Liberal Executive has had responsibility for housing in Scotland since 1999, but people are still sleeping on streets and on friends' settees and are still spending nights in hostels for the homeless in Scotland in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Young people and families are living in overcrowded conditions with relatives because they cannot afford to buy a house and cannot get a council house, while council houses are lying empty because councils cannot afford to renovate them.</p><p>I have had many discussions with housing organisations, individuals and councillors in the past few weeks and I must tell the ministers that few people to whom I have spoken believe that the target of housing all the people who are homeless can be met by 2012 unless the Executive gets to grips with the situation now. Those who think that the target can be met believe that it will be met only at the expense of people who are not homeless. In other words, those who are homeless and in acute housing need will be set against those who are not homeless but still need a home of their own, and those who need a home of their own will in turn present as homeless because their circumstances will change and their need for a home of their own will result in acute housing need. Councils and other social landlords will not be able to deliver. Time is starting to run out.</p><p>Homelessness is not caused by people being inadequate or feckless; homelessness is a direct <place-holder colnum=\"20126\"/> result of a failure to deliver housing that meets need. Unless the affordability, the supply and the condition of housing in Scotland are tackled, we will always have homelessness. We need to build more houses, for which the land must be made available; however, we have a planning white paper that barely acknowledges the need for housing. Scottish Water is currently putting a stop on new housing development because it cannot or will not supply the infrastructure. Where is the ministerial direction? Councils are demolishing structurally sound houses because they cannot afford to renovate them and are then selling the ground to private developers to build houses that cost more than &#163;100,000, which people who are on the minimum or an average wage, or who are on council waiting lists, cannot afford to buy.</p><p>The supporting people fund, which supports vulnerable people in the community and helps them to sustain tenancies, has been cut in real terms by 12 per cent this year. There will be a further cut in the years to come, as the minister acknowledged at the Communities Committee yesterday. The target of ensuring that we do not have repeat homelessness will not be met and the Executive will fail in its objective. I would like the minister to say something more about the supporting people fund, which is absolutely crucial in giving the housing support and advice that the minister has said is needed to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm's first ministerial duty in 1997 was to attend a Shelter conference that I organised. There was great anticipation in the housing world, and there was great hope that at long last housing would be given priority. In 2004, not one local authority house in Scotland was built. Last year, fewer houses for social rent were built than under the Conservative Government in 1997. Yes&#8212;we have had a raft of housing legislation, which has found SNP support; however, passing legislation is the easy part. The role of Government is to deliver, and the Executive must by the end of the year set out clearly how it intends to do so and how it intends to meet the target for 2012. It must make absolutely sure that it will not fail to meet the targets that it has set because of its inaction so far.</p>", "hdate": "2005-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13347853", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I fully accept that there will be a statement by the end of this year, but I point out that the legislation requires the minister to come to Parliament by the end of the year to make such a statement.

For me and the other members of the committee, today's debate has been a long time coming. It is more than 24 months since the bill was introduced by its promoter, Scottish Borders Council. It is only right that I thank my fellow committee members&#8212;Christine May, Gordon Jackson, Ted Brocklebank and Margaret Smith&#8212;who have shared the past two years with me. I thank the private bills unit and, in particular, the committee's clerk, Fergus Cochrane, who has given us great assistance and is a great credit to the Parliament.</p><p>The main purpose of the bill is to give the promoter statutory authority to construct a railway between Newcraighall and Tweedbank, with stations at Shawfair, Eskbank, Newtongrange, Gorebridge, Galashiels and Tweedbank. The passenger service railway will follow much of the former Waverley route, which was closed following the Beeching report.</p><p>The promoter considers the railway to be the best way of improving accessibility to and from Edinburgh, opening up new housing markets, retaining the population, providing an incentive for inward investment and increasing local spend and business opportunities.</p><p>I thank all those who engaged in the process and assisted in broadening our understanding of the scheme. We approached the task with an open mind and sought throughout to ensure balance, fair representation and participation.</p><p>I turn to the detail of the report's recommendations, starting with tourism, an industry that is particularly important to the Borders economy. The tourism sector has sought to diversify and invest in recent years and to attract more high-spending, short-break and niche-activity markets. However, evidence indicated that the area was not attracting a high enough share of tourists and visitors. The Scottish Borders Tourist Board feels that significant potential exists to improve the area's share of the Scottish and world <place-holder colnum=\"19504\"/> tourism markets. The railway could open up the Borders as part of Edinburgh's special and important role in the tourism market, as visitors to the capital would be able to travel more easily to the Borders. At present, 96 per cent of visitors to the area travel by car, while the number of overseas visitors is relatively small. The spin-offs for tourism-related businesses are obvious: new jobs could be created, and almost &#163;2 million would be generated for the local economy.</p><p>Access and connectivity were common themes, as was the sense of isolation and exclusion felt in the Borders. Borders residents felt that there was an imbalance in opportunity. That, more than other issues, goes to the heart of the case for a railway as a way of tackling social exclusion. Midlothian and the Borders have faced the challenges of low-wage economies and the closure of traditional industries, whereas Edinburgh has enjoyed a stronger economic performance, with buoyant labour and housing markets. That success, however, has led to difficulties, not least in attracting skilled labour and in providing housing&#8212;particularly affordable housing&#8212;as there is a shortage of suitable development sites.</p><p>For the capital's economic performance to continue, the promoter argues the need for improved, clean, efficient transport links into the city. That would open up Midlothian and the Borders to meet Edinburgh's need for additional housing, as well as opening up the capital's job market to Midlothian and the Borders.</p><p>The promoter estimates that a railway would, over 30 years and, generate &#163;257 million, or, if one factors in new housing, almost &#163;310 million across the three areas, although Midlothian and the Borders would account for 96 per cent of that. In addition, more than 500 new jobs could be created in Midlothian and the Borders.</p><p>An important point is that the railway could assist in removing the feeling of disconnection in the Borders. That is consistent with the Executive's objective under its transport spending priorities of promoting social inclusion by connecting remote and disadvantaged communities and by increasing access to the transport network.</p><p>However, if the railway is to open up communities and access to the transport network, we felt that it was essential that a Borders railway should have more than one stop in the Borders. Therefore, we have indicated support for a station at Stow. It is difficult to understand how it is that a Borders railway has only two stations at the start, or the end, of the line in the Borders, despite two thirds of the track being in the Borders.</p><p>The report also makes it clear that we do not support the termination of the railway at <place-holder colnum=\"19505\"/> Gorebridge, nor its phased introduction to Tweedbank. The bill is for a railway to the Borders, not to Midlothian only. If the plan was to have a railway only to Gorebridge, the promoter should have made that clear when introducing the bill.</p><p>Our report makes clear our concerns about the proposed housebuilding programme: those houses must be built. It is forecast that by 2030, 27,500 new houses will have to be built in Midlothian to cope with the anticipated population expansion along the A7 corridor from Edinburgh. In the immediate future, local authorities are aiming at the completion of more than 10,000 houses by 2011. Of concern to the committee were the low house completion rates in both areas over recent years. That concern was echoed by Homes for Scotland, whose member companies build 94 per cent of new houses in Scotland each year. It was clear that the process was too slow and that the statutory development plan process was failing. As part of the Executive's watching brief, perhaps the new Minister for Transport and Telecommunications could explain what specific action the Executive has since taken to assist in delivering those houses. It would also be helpful if he could indicate what discussions he has had with ministerial colleagues on the matter. We examined both councils' plans to increase house completion rates. Although both council leaders offered a degree of reassurance, they are under no illusion as to what is required to meet the targets.</p><p>A further worry was the installation of water and drainage services. Again, on such an important issue, our impression was that the level of active and constructive communication between key stakeholders left a lot to be desired. It appears that agreements between developers and Scottish Water are now being reached to allow services to be installed, but are enough being reached to meet targets?</p><p>Both council leaders appear confident that difficulties can be resolved through partnership working, and Scottish Water indicated that it has a good relationship with both councils. However, in our view, that is not enough. There remains a lack of commitment, or a guarantee, from Scottish Water to include those housing programmes in its business plan to 2010. The developments may be given priority for investment consideration but, until March 2006, when Scottish Water finalises its investment programme to 2010, there will be uncertainty. I am sure that both authorities are doing all that they can to ensure the inclusion of their housing programmes in Scottish Water's development plans, but we cannot safely sign off on that until the commitments are given, which is why we must return to the issue before the final stage.<place-holder colnum=\"19506\"/></p><p>The importance of the issue cannot be overestimated. Success in meeting the housing targets is fundamental to the railway's success. The promoter might argue that meeting the 2011 completion target five years later in 2016 would have minimal impact on the net present value, but we do not agree. Not meeting the targets by 2011 will have a detrimental effect on the project's viability. Put simply, the houses will bring people, who will become passengers.</p><p>Let me turn to project costs. At 2005-06 prices, the project's capital cost is estimated at &#163;151 million, of which the Executive is providing nearly &#163;124 million, or around 85 per cent. I appreciate that costs are of concern not just to the committee and to members of this Parliament, but to the council tax payers of Midlothian and the Borders. Members will have noted with disquiet the recent increase in costs associated with the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway, for which the Executive is providing the bulk of the funding. With that in mind, I again emphasise the Executive's responsibility properly to monitor and evaluate the Waverley project to ensure that it comes in on time and on budget.</p><p>While the attachment by the Executive of four funding conditions is to be supported, there must be more assurances on whether, given past experience and the performance of the promoter to date, project costs are on target even this early on. We appreciated the direct \"yes\" from the previous Minister for Transport on 22 June, in response to Christine May's question on whether the estimated cost was still &#163;151 million. The minister indicated that the Executive was seeking to learn lessons from previous capital projects. Perhaps the present Minister for Transport and Communications could outline what those lessons are and how they will be taken into account with Waverley. The previous minister stated that a clear risk management strategy must be developed and delivered. It would be useful if the present minister could set out what progress has been made on that over the past six months.</p><p>Before I move to my closing remarks I will say a few words about patronage forecasts. I repeat our concerns that the business case assumptions are just that&#8212;assumptions and aspirations, rather than conclusions and realities. While the Executive believes that the business case stacks up in terms of overall value for money, we were not convinced&#8212;and neither was the Strategic Rail Authority&#8212;by the conclusion that the railway will operate free from subsidy and that it will make an operating profit within six years of opening. As the report makes clear, the promoter and the Executive must update us before the conclusion of consideration stage on whether they both still support the business case assumptions. It will be for the chamber to reflect on that at final stage.<place-holder colnum=\"19507\"/></p><p>Our report recommends that the bill should proceed as a private bill and that the general principles be agreed to. However, as paragraph 312 makes clear, we are critical of the performance so far of the promoter and its consultants on the project, and we call on the Executive to reflect on that and to take whatever action is needed. The report sets out serious concerns about the standard of communication on key issues and highlights delays to the bill's progress, much to the frustration and disappointment of the committee, the objectors and others.</p><p>Even if the motion is agreed to today, the promoter and the Executive need to carry out a lot of work on many issues before the Parliament can make a final decision on the bill. The Executive has based its decision to fund the railway on its support for the business case and the housebuilding projections. Although it has indicated that it is fully satisfied that the required water and drainage infrastructure will be in place, we must have firmer guarantees. Despite the Executive's belief in the accuracy of the revenue yield, the railway's operating costs and subsidies require further consideration. Although the Executive believes that the patronage forecasts are appropriate, agreed and accurate, both parties must maximise passenger uptake&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13346246", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill: Preliminary Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I talk about some of the key aspects of the committee's report, it might be useful for me to set out some background to the bill.

With the committee report and this debate, the commissioner has fulfilled her duty under the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc (Scotland) Act 2003 to consult the Parliament on the code of practice.</p><p>The committee's remit has been extended and there is now a mechanism for reporting to the Parliament any serious breach of the code. The committee states that it favours the anonymisation of applications. That is a welcome change from the interim code of practice whereby applicants' details are known throughout the appointments process and it will go some way to ensuring that appointments are made on merit. As Brian Adam has pointed out, it is in the interests of all of us to make it clear that appointments to public bodies in Scotland will be made on merit and not according to any other criteria.</p><p>I turn to the vexed question of cronyism and public patronage in the public appointments system. The committee recognises that<place-holder colnum=\"19307\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"there is a public perception that 'cronyism' and political patronage is prevalent in the public appointments system\".</p><p>If there is such a public perception, it is hardly surprising, when we consider the evidence of the number of members of the Labour Party in particular who have been appointed to public bodies. That perception in turn prevents others from even applying for appointments, as many believe that it is pointless and that they will not get appointed anyway. That is what I believe the code of practice and the appointment of the commissioner are about.</p><p>Like the committee, I believe that the commissioner, Karen Carlton, is genuine in her endeavours to ensure that the perception and the reality of the situation are overcome. I look forward to her further work on the equalities strategy. The public appointments system needs to be opened up. It must be open, transparent and fair. That is the only way in which public bodies will genuinely reflect the diversity and reality of 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland. In her response to the committee, Karen Carlton acknowledged that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"More work must be done to encourage a wider variety of people to apply for positions and this will be addressed by the Equal Opportunities Strategy\",</p><p>which she is now working on. The evidence continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Commissioner is charged with preparing and publishing a strategy for ensuring that appointments, and recommendations for appointment, are made by the Scottish Ministers in a manner which encourages equal opportunities.\"</p><p>It is important that the commissioner monitors how effective the public appointments process is at the moment, and whether or not the code of practice is leading to the changes that I think all of us believe are needed. The commissioner said that she has</p><p class=\"indent\">\"written to the Permanent Secretary to request access to information provided by applicants in their application and monitoring forms during the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2005, to determine applicants' gender, ethnic origin, ability, declared political activity, age, educational background and where they live.\"</p><p>That is important, but there is a flaw here. I do not think that the permanent secretary should keep that information once an appointment has been made. It is not right that the Executive, having made the appointment, hangs on to all the data. I would like the commissioner and the Executive to work together so that, when an appointment is made, such information is passed into the safe keeping of the commissioner for public appointments. I hope that she and the Executive will consider that.</p><p>I would like the commissioner to return to the Parliament at the earliest opportunity once she has carried out the assessment and monitoring of <place-holder colnum=\"19308\"/> political appointments from the start of the Parliament until 31 March 2005. We need that information. If we do not have that information, which precedes the code of practice, it will be impossible to work out whether the code of practice, once it has been adopted, has made a difference. I hope that the information on past public appointments will be placed in the public domain, and certainly in the Parliament's domain, so that MSPs may see whether the changes that have been made have indeed led to a wider field of people being appointed to public bodies in Scotland.</p><p>I congratulate the Standards and Public Appointments Committee on its examination of the draft code and I congratulate the commissioner, who has done a very fine job.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13345782", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in this brief debate.

To the outside observer, it seems to be a dry and technical bill that is mostly concerned with process, but it has the potential to put in place mechanisms that could prevent a repeat of the tragic circumstances that occurred in Tayport in January.</p><p>Last week, Colyn Evans was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Karen Dewar, who was 16 years old. She was strangled, mutilated, and her body dumped in a rubbish skip and set on fire. Colyn Evans is now 18 years old. He came to the attention of social work, the police and the children's reporter when he was 10. Between the ages of 10 and 16 he committed 14 offences, six of which were sexual offences. Of the sexual offences, five related to shameless or indecent exposure. He was never placed on the sex offenders register.</p><p>Fife Council and Fife constabulary produced their own internal report on the day that Colyn Evans was sentenced. They examined their involvement with Colyn Evans and admitted that there were shortcomings in communications and written procedures, but concluded that the murder of Karen Dewar could not have been predicted. What could have been predicted, because there were two psychiatric reports to say so, was that Colyn Evans was at high risk of reoffending.</p><p>In October 2002, Colyn Evans was reported for an attack on a young boy, and in November 2002 he was reported for indecent exposure to a 31-year-old woman. In April 2002, he was placed in Geilsland residential school, where he was expected to take part in an intensive programme but did not co-operate. Before he was returned home, a report concluded that he was still at high risk of offending. That report was never submitted to the hearing in April 2004, when he was discharged from his supervision requirement. He <place-holder colnum=\"18021\"/> was given a flat in Tayport, round the corner from Karen Dewar. The police were never formally advised that Evans was in Tayport. Social work asked the police to carry out an assessment. That assessment was never done, but no one asked why. There were two further incidents in Tayport before Karen's murder, but despite police involvement they were not linked to Evans's previous offences.</p><p>Fife Council and Fife constabulary's internal report reveals a catalogue of failure&#8212;failure to communicate within authorities, failure to communicate between authorities and, most important, failure to protect a young woman and a community. I often say how lucky we are in Fife to have a local authority, a police force and a health board that all share the same boundaries. Margaret Mitchell says that what we need is flexibility. Flexibility does not work. That flexibility failed Karen Dewar. If communication and joint working cannot happen naturally in Fife, which has those huge advantages, it cannot happen anywhere in Scotland, unless there are statutory obligations on authorities to work jointly.</p><p>On Friday, I wrote to the Minister for Justice asking for a full, independent inquiry into the Colyn Evans case.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13342590", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Management of Offenders etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The bill allows for the establishment of community justice authorities; seeks to place an obligation on ministers, local authorities and community justice authorities to co-operate; provides powers to intervene where there is a failure on behalf of the local authority; and at sections 9 and 10 seeks to establish joint arrangements for the assessment and management of sex offenders.

My party welcomes the world youth congress, which is holding its third meeting here in Scotland this July and August. It is often said that young people today are disengaged <place-holder colnum=\"17176\"/> from politics. All too often the picture painted of today's youth is of an apathetic generation that is uninterested in the wider world and lacking in the desire&#8212;associated with previous generations&#8212;to change society. As we well know, nothing could be further from the truth. The minister has mentioned the young Scots who are involved in the change 05 initiative; they are an inspiration to people in Scotland and throughout the world.</p><p>The world youth congress is just one example of young people refusing to conform to an ill-informed stereotype. A glance at the programme of this year's congress demonstrates a commitment among its 600 delegates to the major issues that confront our world in the 21<sup>st</sup> century: sustainable development, eco-friendly lifestyles, global citizenship, eradicating poverty and meeting the UN's millennium development goals. Those are the concerns not of a disengaged and selfish generation, but of a generation that is committed to changing our world for the better. They also reflect the failure of our generation to do the things that we hoped to do. The world youth congress proves that young people today are engaged with the important issues that face society and that they are prepared to take action to improve the world around them. It is vital that we in the Parliament&#8212;and, indeed, all politicians&#8212;give our support to those young people.</p><p>If proof is required of the commitment of the world youth congress to those themes, we need look only to a new development at this year's event. The Scottish summit is the first time that delegates will not be restricted simply to discussing the issues that I have mentioned but will actively participate in projects that encourage sustainable development. Those projects will take place throughout Scotland. In my constituency of Fife, for example, up to 15 delegates will take part in a regeneration project at Lochore meadows country park. I remember when the park did not exist but was the site of pit bings. Some regeneration has been done, but I look forward to the work that the young people will do. Such projects show that the delegates of the world youth congress are not afraid of getting their hands dirty.</p><p>The aims of the congress go beyond sustainable development to encompass a commitment to the fulfilment of all the UN millennium development goals. The SNP whole-heartedly supports that aim. The congress will debate some of the most important challenges that we face in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, including the eradication of poverty, the reduction of child mortality and the fight against the scourge of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Young people have an important role to play in the debate that is taking place on those issues. After all, it is largely on their generation that the huge task of ending injustice in the world will fall.<place-holder colnum=\"17177\"/></p><p>It is only right that we genuinely listen to the thoughts and views of those who are involved in the world youth congress. Those views will be contained in a strategy paper that will be prepared by delegates and presented to the UN General Assembly. The paper will describe the work that the young people have done to support the millennium development goals and suggest practical policy initiatives to encourage more young people to become involved in the effort. The Parliament has discussed before how best we can encourage young people to become actively involved in what we call civic society. The report from the world youth congress will contain ideas and suggestions from the very people whose participation we are trying to encourage. It is vital for each of us to learn from what the congress has to say and to do all that we can to put its recommendations into practice in our communities.</p><p>Finally, it would be remiss of me to give a speech about the world youth congress without mentioning the other summit that is taking place in Scotland this year. It is worth while noting the similarity in the programmes that will be discussed at the summits in Stirling and Perth. We can only hope that the leaders of the world's richest countries show the same level of commitment as the delegates of the world youth congress to tackling the global challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. If they do, we can all look forward to the achievement of the millennium development goals becoming a reality.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World Youth Congress"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to open for the Scottish National Party in this debate.

I think that they get in the way. As the convener of the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill Committee and as the Scottish National Party chief whip, I am involved in all parts of the process. I know how difficult it is to get MSPs to go on to a private bill committee.</p><p>I have served on the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill Committee for a year and a bit. I was promised that it would only last a year, but there is probably another year and a bit to go before we are finished. After long trials, jury members can be given exemptions for life. Some MSPs have served a long time on private bill committees. The committees are extremely time consuming and difficult, and work done by MSPs on such committees is in addition to their work in the Parliament and on other committees.</p><p>I welcome the Procedures Committee's report and the scrutiny that the committee has given to the system for private bills. I welcome the proposal for a statutory system; that is a sensible way forward. The way that we operate at the moment is not helpful&#8212;either to the proposers of the bills or to the MSPs on the private bill committees.</p><p>It was not anticipated that there would be many works bills, but we now have two tram committees and the Waverley committee, as well as a smaller committee that is not considering a works bill. <place-holder colnum=\"16707\"/></p><p>Many MSPs are involved on those committees.

We are close enough to the action but not actually involved in it. Because it would be unfair to bring somebody down from Aberdeen or Inverness on a Monday to serve on the committees, some other MSPs are being distinctly put upon. I include myself in that category. All business managers should be a bit fairer to the folk of Fife in future.</p><p>This Parliament and its processes are evolving. At the beginning, we were not sure what would be involved. We sucked it and we saw, and it is not to anybody's advantage to continue as we are.</p><p>The Procedures Committee has taken the Parliament and its processes a big step forward. As Susan Deacon said, the challenge is to translate that into real infrastructure. Although I welcome the proposal for the Executive to introduce legislation, I urge that such legislation should be introduced as soon as possible.

Members will be aware that charities legislation is close to my heart&#8212;that was the case before I became an MSP in 1999&#8212;as a result of my past employment with Shelter Scotland, which is a homelessness charity.</p><p>When I worked for Shelter Scotland, it was frustrating that an organisation called the Homeless Aid Trust went round various communities to raise money by selling scratch cards. I remember the sheer inability of the Inland <place-holder colnum=\"15130\"/> Revenue and the Scottish Charities Office to deal with that organisation, which clearly did not put the money to the purpose to which it should have been put. Things were extremely difficult and fraught. At that time, I believed that bad charities and organisations that were there to con and defraud should be driven out and that&#8212;more important&#8212;genuine organisations and charities that worked hard should not be brought into disrepute by bad charities and organisations. That is why I have been so frustrated that it has taken six years for legislation to come to the Parliament.</p><p>I am sure that all members acknowledge the huge contribution that charities make to Scottish society, especially in supporting our most vulnerable people. However, if charities are to perform their roles as effectively as possible, it is crucial that they have public confidence in their actions. Unfortunately, as a result of the well-documented activities of a tiny minority of people who are involved in charity work, confidence has been eroded over the years. That is why the bill is important; by creating a robust regulatory framework, the bill will go a long way towards re-establishing public confidence and allowing charities to flourish.</p><p>I disagree with the committee on a number of matters. Given what I have said previously, I disagree with what the committee says in paragraph 16 of its report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee commends the Executive for conducting an extensive and inclusive consultation exercise\".</p><p>The consultation on the bill was absolutely right, but I still regret that reaching this point has taken us so long.</p><p>I turn to some vital provisions in the bill that have not been mentioned and, in particular, to chapter 4 on the supervision of charities. The chapter will give OSCR the power to obtain information, to hold inquiries and to remove and suspend people from office. It will allow the putting in place of the monitoring and supervisory framework that is needed to restore and keep public confidence in our charitable sector, which has been absent for many years.</p><p>Independence, too, is close to my heart and I want to talk about the independence of charities and protecting them from local and national Government interference. That is absolutely imperative. Some of us will remember something called the Third Age Group, which an independent review found to be a creature of Fife social work services. That is an example of interference in a charity. In fact, that charity was set up by Fife social work services&#8212;that has never been, and should never be, the purpose of a charity. The independence of charities has to be protected <place-holder colnum=\"15131\"/> from interference from national Government and local authorities.</p><p>I welcome the publicly accessible register of all bodies that are eligible to operate as charities. The Inland Revenue, which was responsible for registering Scottish charities, failed to monitor the charities and there are now a number of non-functioning, dormant charities in existence. If there had been, in Scotland, the kind of monitoring and supervision that is conducted by the Charity Commission in England and Wales, we would not be in the situation that we are in now. There are 28,000 charities in operation in Scotland, and they are desperate for the bill to be passed so that public confidence in their activities will be restored.</p><p>Like other members&#8212;Patrick Harvie, Scott Barrie, Karen Whitefield and Fiona Hyslop&#8212;I regret the fact that much of the debate has been taken up by discussion of private schools. The bill is about much more than private schools; it is important for the present and future of charities. The bill treats private schools no differently from any other organisation. Just like any other body, private schools will have to make the case to OSCR that they should be registered. I welcome paragraph 150 of the committee's report, which is key to all that. The committee has recognised the importance of ensuring that only organisations that have as their overriding purpose the provision of a benefit to the public should qualify for charitable status.

That must and will be addressed by the proposed bill. I welcome the committee's view that paid advocacy only takes place where there is a connection between the receipt of a benefit that represents a personal gain to the member and that member undertaking action as an MSP. That clarity is welcome and will be much needed when we come to debate the bill.</p><p>I have long argued that non-pecuniary interests can be at least as important as pecuniary interests and welcome the tests that will apply. Members should be required to register a non-pecuniary interest that a member of the public could reasonably think might influence their actions as an MSP. I remember the avalanche of mail that I got and the many press criticisms to the effect that I was trying unreasonably to vilify freemasons.

There is still concern about First Minister's question time being held at noon on Thursdays, but we need an opportunity to let it bed in a bit more before we take the step of putting it back into an afternoon slot.</p><p>The proposals that we are considering are more acceptable than all the other schemes that the Procedures Committee discussed. The proposals are that FMQs would be retained at 12 o'clock and, with the earlier start of 9.15 on Thursday mornings to take account of general questions beginning at 11.40, a block of almost 2.5 hours of debating time would be retained on Thursday mornings and Wednesday afternoons. That there is the capacity for us to have longer debates is absolutely critical.</p><p>I turn to the vexed question of the method of selecting questions. Like many members, I have been frustrated by the seemingly uneven selection of questions. Many of us no longer submit questions, as we believe that our questions will not be selected; even if they are, we believe that they will be so far down the list that they will not be reached anyway. I think that the lack of confidence in and the frustration with the system are the reason for the lack of attendance at question time. That is why I warmly welcome the move towards names being randomly selected, meaning that members would go away and submit a question <place-holder colnum=\"14789\"/> only after their names had been randomly selected. There is nothing more frustrating than submitting well-considered questions and simply not getting them taken. Through what has been proposed, at least we will find out whether we will be number 1 or number 12. We can then decide whether submitting a question is worth while.</p><p>I share the concerns that many members have raised about the allocation of tickets to the public galleries. It is simply unacceptable that, after all this time, the corporate body cannot get its act together and produce a system of two-hour slots so that people are in the chamber on Thursday afternoons when we are debating, rather than tickets being retained for FMQs. That a decision has not been taken on that matter by now is unacceptable and I hope that members of the corporate body who hear the debate or read the <em>Official Report</em> of it will take on board members' views on that matter.</p><p>I am sure that this will not be the final word on question time timings or question time procedures. Of course, the Procedures Committee will react to members' concerns and I am sure that it will monitor how the new arrangements bed in. However, the arrangements are welcome for the moment and the Scottish National Party will support them at 5 o'clock.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334596", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Standing Orders (Changes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is always a pleasure to speak after Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.

The debate gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to my friend Mike Russell, whose bill ensured that the case for retaining and encouraging Gaelic was firmly on the Parliament's agenda. It was regrettable that the Executive could not fully support that bill, but we are where we are and I welcome the Executive's bill. As Alex Neil and others have said, stage 2 amendments are needed to make the bill better. I look forward to the Executive's support for those amendments.</p><p>I will take the minister back to spring last year, when the Council of Europe published a report that criticised the UK and the Executive for their <place-holder colnum=\"14122\"/> failure to comply with their obligations to Gaelic under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The report said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There appears to be less emphasis on minority language policy on the part of the Scottish Executive\"</p><p>than there is in Wales. The minister will recall that I lodged a series of questions on the subject, to which I received a response on 27 April 2004. The minister's attempt to explain the lack of emphasis from the Scottish Executive was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This statement is not surprising given the relative position of Welsh in Wales and Gaelic in Scotland. In the 2001 Census, 20.5% of the Welsh population were found to speak Welsh ... The comparative figures for Gaelic in Scotland were 1.2% speaking Gaelic ... Although this difference would account for the different emphasis on minority language policy in Scotland and Wales, the Scottish Executive is committed to protecting the Gaelic language in Scotland.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-04-27.S2W-7285.h\">[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Written Answers</em>, 27 April 2004; S2W-7285.]</citation></p><p>I was not the only one who was concerned about the minister's apparent lack of understanding of the parlous state of Gaelic. Surely the fact that only 1.2 per cent of people in Scotland are Gaelic speakers, compared with the fact that 20.5 per cent of people in Wales are Welsh speakers, means that the Executive should place greater emphasis on Gaelic. To suggest that the smaller numbers are an excuse for less emphasis on Gaelic in Scotland than on Welsh in Wales does the whole campaign a disservice.</p><p>There are 6,000 languages in the world, of which the vast majority are under threat. It is reckoned that a language dies every fortnight. Gaelic is in a parlous state; it needs to be protected and encouraged. This national Parliament has a duty to ensure that Gaelic does not die and that all necessary steps are taken to ensure that Gaelic is a living, breathing, vibrant and essential part of Scotland.</p><p>The bill is a first step to halting the decline of the Gaelic language, but there is no point in passing the bill without a long-term commitment. That is why I welcome the Education Committee's recommendation that a duty should be placed on the b&#242;rd to report to ministers on progress against the commitments that the UK Government made with regard to Gaelic in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.</p><p>I would also like an amendment to include a duty to report to the Parliament&#8212;to a committee of the Parliament, which I hope would be the Education Committee&#8212;on progress on the national plan.

That is a startling admission from Elaine Murray.</p><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate, and to record the names of the young men from Fife who went to Camp Dogwood and did not come back: Kevin McHale; Stuart Grey; Paul Lowe; Scott McArdle; and their comrade Pita Tukatukawaqa from Fiji. In one week alone, Fife buried three young men, and the pain of the families goes on. As we welcome back the Black Watch, our thoughts naturally go to the families of those young men who have not come back. While those young men fought and died near Camp Dogwood, Geoff Hoon and Tony Blair were laying their own plans to get rid of those young men's regiment. Scotland's regiments are effective, professional and valued by everybody in Scotland and beyond. The recognition of that professionalism is why the Black Watch was sent to Camp Dogwood in the first place.</p><p>For all the strength of the American battalions, it was the Black Watch, with 850 men, which was sent to protect the backs of the United States troops. I have never believed that United Kingdom <place-holder colnum=\"12994\"/> troops should have been sent to fight an illegal war, based on lies, but they followed the orders that they were given by the politicians&#8212;the same politicians who will take the decision today to disband and amalgamate the Scottish regiments. Those are not military decisions. They are not based on military imperatives. They are decisions that are taken by politicians at Westminster who, as Elaine Murray has said, feel free to ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people. Those politicians will now airbrush proud family and local regiments from history. There is a huge feeling of betrayal in Fife about the plans, but then Tony Blair, Geoff Hoon and Alistair Darling would know nothing of that, because they sent our young men to fight and die and did not bother to come to their funerals.</p><p>The plans to amalgamate and disband are opposed by soldiers, ex-soldiers and the wider Scottish community. [<em>Interruption.</em>] If Elaine Murray wishes to intervene, I would be happy to let her, but she should not sit there and hiss at me. Labour claims that it will retain the identity of the regiments by retaining the cap badges. That identity is rooted not in cap badges, but firmly in the communities that the soldiers come from. When that link is cut, there will no longer be a local identity. John Home Robertson commented about Rosyth and Devonport. It is true that the Tories awarded the contract to Devonport, but in 1997 the Labour Government had the opportunity to change the contract and it did not do so. The contract with Devonport continued.</p><p>This is a difficult debate for many people here, but there is great strength of feeling. A decision will be taken and, at 5 o'clock tonight, the Scottish National Party, like the Liberal Democrats, will support the Conservative motion because it is important&#8212;despite what Elaine Murray says&#8212;that the view of the Scottish Parliament is heard, and that that view is heard at Westminster.</p>", "hdate": "2004-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13329871", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Defence Reviews"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I continue to be astonished by Elaine Murray.

The papers reported that there would be an increase of &#163;200 million in transport spending and &#163;100 million in university building programmes.

I have absolutely no hesitation in welcoming the initiative in Coatbridge and I hope that it will be followed in schools throughout Scotland.</p><p>I have no doubt that members are aware of the health benefits of breastfeeding to both children and mothers, but it never hurts to remind ourselves of some of the facts. Research has shown that breastfeeding can play a large role in reducing the number of childhood illnesses and in improving health in later life. A move to help our children get the best start in life must be welcomed. The World Health Organisation recommends, where possible, exclusive breastfeeding for infants up to the age of six months. Although Scotland might boast increasing levels of breastfeeding over the past 10 years, there is certainly no room for complacency.</p><p>An equally important point is that statistics show that rates in poorer areas are worse than those in affluent ones, which Elaine Smith touched on. In Shettleston in Glasgow, a mere 21 per cent of mothers breastfeed six months after their child is <place-holder colnum=\"10591\"/> born. It is in tackling that inequality that the benefits of the bill can be seen most clearly, by creating a culture that encourages breastfeeding among all social classes. There is evidence to suggest that prior exposure to breastfeeding or a positive role model in breastfeeding increases the likelihood of a new mother choosing to breastfeed her child. That evidence is true no matter which area or social class it is applied to.</p><p>Ending the negative attitudes towards breastfeeding and helping to create a culture across all sections of society where breastfeeding is the norm would be the bill's most important achievement. However, just as the bill respects the right to breastfeed, we need to ensure that those mothers who cannot breastfeed for whatever reason are not made to feel inadequate. Childbirth is a traumatic enough experience without new mothers feeling pressured into breastfeeding in the first place.</p><p>At present, funding for breastfeeding promotion and support is spread across various departments. Investment in the promotion of breastfeeding will save money in the longer term. Research has shown that there could be savings in the national health service of &#163;3.5 million if breastfeeding rates increase&#8212;a fact that the Executive must take into account when deciding on funding in this area.</p><p>In conclusion, I am happy to support the general principles of the bill. I believe that it can play a vital role in making breastfeeding more acceptable in our society, but legislation alone cannot achieve that. The bill can achieve its aims only if it is supported by a coherent national breastfeeding strategy and education campaign. I welcome Malcolm Chisholm's remarks about a breastfeeding action plan, given that some health board areas do not have a strategy for breastfeeding. The action plan is long overdue and it will enhance the bill once it is enacted.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13323832", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Breastfeeding etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the member for that intervention.

However, I and many members and other people outside Parliament will continue to press to make that extension a reality. I welcome the minister's comment today&#8212;just as I welcomed it during the previous debate&#8212;that he, too, sees the opportunities. However, there is a difference between seeing opportunities and seizing them. <place-holder colnum=\"9824\"/></p><p>We will ensure that the minister understands that difference.</p><p>The new rail link will take freight pressure off the Forth rail bridge and free up capacity for more passenger trains. The Executive must take the opportunity that is offered by the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link to ensure that there is an increase in passenger trains from Fife to Edinburgh. Like Christine May, I urge the minister to work with Fife Council and other partners to ensure that Levenmouth&#8212;the largest conurbation in Scotland that has no rail link&#8212;will have access to the Fife circle, with connections for Leven and Thornton. Long-suffering Fife passengers deserve a far better rail service than they have at the moment. If the minister needs to be reminded of that, I point out to him that a number of those Fife passengers sit around him in the chamber. We will ensure that we continue to press the case for Fife at every opportunity.</p><p>As Scott Barrie said, the Presiding Officer is not, as constituency member, permitted to speak in this debate. However, I am sure that the Presiding Officer will agree that it is now up to the promoter of the bill to review compensation. I am sure that Mr Reid's office and Scott Barrie will work closely with the promoter and the objectors to try to reach a fair solution. Balancing public gain and private loss is never easy, but if the promoter is willing to assist, I think that all the people of Clackmannan and Fife will welcome the new rail link, which few of us believed would ever be restored.</p><p>After the bill is passed today, the imperative is to ensure that the rail link is up and running&#8212;only that will turn the dream into reality.

No one has a monopoly on being right&#8212;that includes ministers&#8212;and Mike Watson should not interpret constructive comments from the SNP as being an expression of opposition to what the Executive is trying to do. That is not the case.</p><p>We must not be complacent about volunteering in Scotland. I welcome the research that has been done and I welcome especially the recognition that demographic changes will have an impact on the supply of volunteers in that young people and people from urban backgrounds are less likely to get formally involved. There are a number of reasons for that. Such people feel that they might not be welcome and, unfortunately, there is a traditional image of volunteering as being middle-class. The situation is not helped when Mr Brocklebank&#8212;I am sorry, but I cannot resist the temptation&#8212;continues to perpetuate that myth.</p><p>Research does not reflect accurately the numbers of informal volunteers: people who baby-sit; people who look after the neighbours; people who go for messages; and people who run football clubs and the like. There is a gap in the research in that it does not reflect accurately the communities about which members have all spoken, nor does it reflect the people in those communities who are doing their best to help.</p><p>I welcome project Scotland and the Scottish Executive's support for volunteers, which has already been highlighted. However, there is concern&#8212;not only from the SNP, but from Dr Davis Smith of the Institute for Volunteering Research&#8212;that the state should not be involved to the extent that volunteers are no longer independent. That perception of volunteering is not helped by Government's insistence that those who receive jobseeker's allowance be called in and given the choice of jobs, training or volunteering. Such coercion means that people will in the future be less likely to embrace volunteering than they would otherwise have been.</p><p>It has been my pleasure to award certificates for millennium volunteers in Fife to young people who <place-holder colnum=\"9694\"/> help people who have disabilities. Their commitment is total and many opportunities are now open to the volunteers because of the skills that they have developed.</p><p>Christine May, who has sat through the debate, will know about the fantastic work that has been done over the years by the Auchmuty tenants association in Glenrothes. It runs Christmas parties and, more important, it is a contact point for the community.</p><p>The Drug and Alcohol Project Levenmouth is a leader in providing help for people who have addictions. The success of the project lies in the fact that its counsellors are volunteers who come from the communities that they seek to help.</p><p>Scott Barrie and I were recently present when Fife Council celebrated children's panel members in Fife. We sometimes forget that they are volunteers who get very little out of their work apart from the satisfaction of knowing that they have helped others.

For a long time, the introduction of STVPR has been SNP policy, as we believe that such a system is needed for local government elections.</p><p>Because the Executive parties were dragging their feet, last year I introduced a member's bill on the issue. We could already have had STVPR in place if, regrettably, the Labour Party and the Liberals had not opposed my bill. In passing, I point out that the provisions for STV in the Local Governance (Scotland) Bill bear a remarkable resemblance to the provisions of the Proportional Representation (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill, which was rejected because the Liberals and others believed that there was not enough detail on the face of the bill&#8212;the same detail that the Executive has chosen to include in regulations.</p><p>The reason for the amendment is that amendments that Mr Sheridan, Mr Mundell and I attempted to lodge at stage 2 to decouple the Scottish Parliament elections from the local government elections were ruled inadmissible because they were outwith the scope of the bill. We believe that that matter is serious. When the Local Government and Transport Committee took <place-holder colnum=\"9456\"/> evidence at stage 1, it became clear that there were concerns that holding two different elections on the same day using different forms of proportional representation would be problematic not just for voters, but for those who administer the elections. In evidence to the committee, the Society of Lawyers and Administrators in Scotland said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The firm and unanimous view of the Society in its submission to the Scottish Executive on September was that if STV was to be introduced for local government elections then these elections should be decoupled from the Scottish Parliament Elections.\"</p><p>The SNP opposed combining the two elections in the first place, but the Parliament cannot now ignore the compelling evidence in favour of decoupling them, given that we are almost at the point of passing a bill to introduce PR.</p><p>Time is short, but I would like to make a couple of other points about STVPR. First, I agree that the mechanisms of the election should be determined by regulation. However, it is important that the Executive should take on board the serious concerns that have been expressed about the extent of those regulations and the method by which the Parliament deals with them. Secondly, I refer to the point made by my colleague Bruce McFee about the role of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland. In trying to square away the councillors, the Executive has compromised the commission's independence. The SNP believes that that will leave the door open to a potential legal challenge. I ask the Executive to reflect on that point.</p><p>The bill is not perfect and we are concerned by aspects of it, but the SNP will support it. For many of us, the introduction of PR for local government is a long-held ambition. I recognise the commitment to it among MSPs from every party and acknowledge that tonight some members from the Labour Party cannot bring themselves to support it. However, all parties will win and lose in local government elections held under STV. The SNP will lose in Angus, whereas Labour will lose in Midlothian and Glasgow. The winners will be the voters, who will get the council for which they voted&#8212;their votes will count. That alone is reason enough for supporting the bill. We call on members from all parties to do so tonight.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-1495.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"but, in so doing, considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward legislation, as a matter of urgency, to decouple elections to Scottish local authorities from the elections to the Parliament.\"</p>", "hdate": "2004-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13321098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Governance (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I speak to the amendment in my name, I put on record the Scottish National Party's long-standing support for STV proportional representation.

It is accepted that the more members per ward in a system, the more proportional the system is. It is also accepted that the councillor-ward link must be maintained.

Our parents lived through and fought in the war, but I bet that few of us are even aware of the horrors that they endured to ensure that we would live in a free, democratic Europe. My father was a Bevin boy and did not fight in the war, but I did not become aware of the level of commitment that had been shown by all my other relatives until I was much older. That says something about the generation that fought in the war. The Europe that has now been created is a union of 25 states and is truly that generation's legacy.</p><p>I watched some of the television coverage of the D-day events, which was extremely moving. I was struck by the dignity, humility and courage of the veterans. It is astonishing how they managed to return from the war to pick up their lives and to create a better society for themselves, never mind their children, to live in. These days, counselling is given as a matter of course to people who have experienced minor traumas. It is staggering that when the veterans came back, filled with the horrors that they had experienced, they got on with creating the kind of society that we have now.</p><p>Another point that struck me forcefully was the certainty of the veterans' belief that they were fighting a just war. Like Trish Godman, I was appalled by George Bush's attempt to link the second world war to what is happening in Iraq. The people who fought in the war believed that they had a part to play in ridding Europe of the evils of Nazism and fascism. Nazism killed millions throughout Europe in concentration camps&#8212;not just Jews, but communists, socialists, Gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, the homeless and beggars.

It is not the case that St Andrews, in particular, is becoming unaffordable; housing is unaffordable in many areas of north-east Fife. If house prices in Scotland had increased only by the rate of inflation since 1975, the average price would be &#163;48,000 lower than it is.</p><p>Throughout Fife, house prices are rising at an unprecedented rate, partly as a result of the fact that prices are so high in Edinburgh. Because people on modest incomes are unable to buy in Edinburgh the kind of houses that they want, we are seeing a ripple effect throughout Fife. As Iain Smith rightly said, that extends all the way up to Cupar. The parts of Fife that have access to a mainline railway station are the areas in which house prices are rising. Perhaps we should consider the dispersal of jobs from the likes of Edinburgh to places such as Fife and taking jobs to where people are, because at the moment those people are commuting to Edinburgh for jobs.</p><p>People are moving into Fife and into West Lothian, where house prices are much lower. To the mix of reasons for the rise in house prices, we must add the fact that the number of council houses is decreasing, because houses have been bought under the right to buy and not replaced.

There is only a small rented housing sector in north-east Fife&#8212;I refer to both council and private rented accommodation. As Iain Smith said, there are fewer than 1,000 council houses in the whole of north-east Fife.</p><p>Houses are being built that cost more than &#163;100,000. Few young people can afford to buy such houses and people on average incomes are simply being priced out of the market. Many young people live with their parents for longer, because they simply cannot get into the housing market.

We are fortunate that St Andrews is part of the cycle that ensures that the open is brought to Scotland three out of every five years. I apologise to John Scott for my next remark, but it is true that, as all great golfers know, winning the open in St Andrews is that bit more special.</p><p>Fife and Scotland have been late in realising the potential for golf tourism&#8212;in spite of the fact that we in Fife have more golf courses per head of population than anywhere else in the world. We can learn many lessons from Ireland's marketing of its golf industry. St Andrews is a success despite appalling transport links and poor road, rail and air links and we must do much better for our visitors than we are currently doing.</p><p>Pauline McNeill has already mentioned T in the park, which is an example of a major event that results in huge benefits for the local economy. I have been told that it has been estimated that &#163;2.5 million is pumped into the economy in the town of Kinross alone.

Roadies, scaffolders and other essential workers who put together the festival site fill the hotels and bed and breakfasts in Fife and Kinross. Of course, youngsters make money for weeks afterwards clearing litter from the site. I have been told that a healthy tent-recycling industry has grown up around the site, thanks to people leaving behind tents, which are then sold on by enterprising youngsters.

He made a brilliant suggestion that, because we are so rich in such dates, we should market a winter celebration of Scotland.

Indeed, their commitment has been highlighted by the amount of work that has been done over the past four years to keep MS on the political agenda through asking parliamentary questions and so on.</p><p>The Parliament previously debated MS's effect on so many people in Scotland in October 2000. That was a poignant occasion because many MSPs either contributed to the debate or listened to speeches. In fact, it was the last occasion that our first First Minister, Donald Dewar, was in the chamber. Although he did not speak in the debate, he sat and listened to members' speeches.</p><p>Four years on, I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate to assess the improvements that have been made in the care for MS patients in Scotland. However, before concentrating on the advances&#8212;or lack of them&#8212;that have been made since the previous debate, I will give a brief explanation of the illness that we are discussing.</p><p>MS is a complex disease of the central nervous system that impairs the brain's ability to transmit instructions to the muscles. Although different people are affected in different ways, in most cases the symptoms become more severe over time. So far, there is no cure for the disease.</p><p>Scotland has the highest rate of MS in the world, with approximately 10,500 people suffering from the disease. No one knows why Scotland has such a high number of MS patients, but we do <place-holder colnum=\"7753\"/> know that the standard of care for people with MS remains unacceptably low. That was the case four years ago and remains the case today.</p><p>When we previously debated the issue, the Scottish needs assessment programme&#8212;or SNAP&#8212;had just published a report that stated that care for MS was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"substantially sub-optimal, inadequately resourced and unacceptably fragmented\".</p><p>At that time, I called on the Executive to introduce a national strategy and standard of care across Scotland to end the injustice of substandard care for people with MS. However, only ad hoc and piecemeal improvements have been made since then. We still lack a coherent and well-funded national strategy and, when it comes to treatment, Scottish MS patients still face a postcode lottery. The Executive's response to the problem has been many warm words but precious little action.</p><p>The October 2000 SNAP report recommended that managed clinical networks should be established across Scotland for those with MS. However, as no requirement was placed on health boards to adopt that recommendation, there is currently only one MCN in the country, and that was set up only through the commitment of individual specialists in Forth valley.</p><p>The varying standards of care mean that MS patients are still discriminated against depending on the part of the country in which they live. Four years ago, members highlighted the lack of specialist MS nurses in the national health service. Since then, there has been a welcome increase in the number of nurses from seven to 14. However, that is not enough: the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland has argued that at least double that number is required. Indeed, five health boards provide no specialist nursing for MS at all. Moreover, the increase in specialist nursing has been possible only because of the society's financial assistance.</p><p>Scotland's 44 neurologists recently wrote to the newspapers to profess their embarrassment at the quality of care for people with MS. For example, nine out of 10 neurology patients wait 266 days for an appointment. That is unacceptable. Despite the minister Malcolm Chisholm's acceptance that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"MS specialist nurses have enormous potential to improve patients' quality of life\",</p><p>the Executive has still failed to provide adequate funds for such nurses.</p><p>Finally, I want to touch on the area of research. Well-funded research is vital not simply to find a cure for MS but, in the meantime, to develop treatments to improve the standard of life for people with the disease.

For more than three and a half years, we have been getting parliamentary answers from Executive ministers, saying that the matter is one not for them but for COSLA and the employees.

The SNP opposed that measure in 2002 and we oppose that arrangement now. We opposed it then because voters were being asked to use two different electoral systems and three separate ballot papers. If STV is adopted for council elections, voters will be faced with two different kinds of PR and a first-past-the-post system on the same day.</p><p>The evidence for the need to decouple the Scottish Parliament elections from the local government elections is overwhelming, as the Local Government and Transport Committee heard from senior officials from Scotland's councils and from Neil McIntosh of the Electoral Commission.

I welcome the Executive's proposals to reduce the age at which people may stand for election as a councillor, but we need to go further and to reduce the voting age to 16. That was one of the recommendations of the previous Local Government Committee's inquiry into renewing local democracy. The committee asked ministers for their response to that idea and what actions they would take in discussing lowering the voting age to 16 with their Westminster colleagues. I would be grateful if the minister told us, when summing up, what discussions have been held with his Westminster colleagues and what can be done under the bill not only to reduce the age at which young people can stand as candidates to be councillors, but to address the possibility of lowering the voting age to 16.</p><p>The SNP will support the motion and the amendment that Tommy Sheridan lodged but did not speak to.

The figures for excess winter deaths in Scotland are a disgrace to a civilised country. Every winter, what can best be described as a cull of elderly people takes place. It is important to remember that we are not talking about statistics; we are talking about people. Of course, the death certificates do not say, \"Died of hypothermia\" or \"Died of cold\", but that is why those people have died. Stirling Howieson, of the University of Strathclyde, says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"These additional winter deaths are mainly in the elderly population and about 90 per cent are registered under heart, stroke and respiratory diseases, all of which are known to be exacerbated by cold living conditions. These deaths are essentially preventable if the elderly live in warm, dry homes.\"</p><p>That is the challenge for all of us. When we talk about excess winter deaths, it is important to remember that warm, dry homes will prevent those deaths.</p><p>As John Swinburne rightly said, between 1997 and 2002, Scotland registered 16,600 excess winter deaths among the over-65s in the period from December to March. However, we do not need research to tell us that; we just need to read the columns upon columns of death notices in our local newspapers in winter.</p><p>Why do people die of cold in winter in fuel-rich Scotland? We do not have particularly harsh winters; Sweden, Germany, Finland and even Siberia have harsher winters but fewer excess winter deaths than Scotland. All those countries, however, have higher standards of housing and a better quality of life.</p><p>I am grateful to Energy Action Scotland for its continuing work on fuel poverty. Fuel poverty is age related. Some 31 per cent of people over 75 are officially fuel poor, compared with only 5 per cent of people who are aged between 25 and 39. That is why today's debate is so important. The Government claims&#8212;and the minister claimed earlier&#8212;that the causes of excess winter deaths are complex and uncertain. However, there is <place-holder colnum=\"6530\"/> consensus that poor heating and insulation and low income are the major factors.</p><p>The amount of money that it takes to heat a house varies considerably in different parts of the United Kingdom. It costs 41 per cent more to heat a house in Aberdeen, and 28 per cent more in Edinburgh, than it does in Bristol, yet the pension is the same wherever people live in the United Kingdom. I acknowledge that the Executive has made strides forward with the central heating programme, but that is only one part of the equation in tackling fuel poverty.</p><p>In a recent debate, the Executive claimed that the number of people in fuel poverty had decreased; that claim is replicated in the Executive's amendment today. During that debate in December, I pointed out that the central heating programme was only one aspect and that we had to take into account household income and fuel prices. Within a week, fuel prices in Scotland went up: Scottish Gas put up gas prices by 5.9 per cent. I asked the Executive in a written question what impact that 5.9 per cent increase would have on the number of people in fuel poverty. The answer began:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The information requested could only be obtained at a disproportionate cost.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Written Answers, </em>13 January 2004; S2W-4886.]</p><p>I acknowledge that the Executive has made strides forward, but let us not pretend that the central heating programme is a panacea. We can eradicate fuel poverty but we have to be able to support income and pension levels. Excess winter deaths are caused by poverty. We need to tackle poverty, and this Parliament needs the power to do so.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-1021.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and that fuel poverty in Scotland will not be eradicated until the Parliament has the full range of powers, including control over the pension and benefit system.\"</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13313129", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Cold-related Deaths"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank John Swinburne for bringing this important debate to the Parliament.

I invite the minister to give at least an indication in her summing up of when we might expect a bill to be introduced. At the Communities Committee, I raised several concerns, including the fact that there is no Scottish appeal process in the UK legislation, and I was not satisfied with the minister's response. I invite the minister to make her position clear when she sums up. My colleague Campbell Martin raised his concern that Scottish charities that are presently accepted as charities could, if the Scottish Parliament changes the definition of charity, be stripped of that recognition, and that CICs are the fallback position.<place-holder colnum=\"6365\"/></p><p>I am concerned that, in accepting the principle of community interest companies, in effect we limit the Parliament's deliberations on public interest benefit before we even get to the stage of considering our own charities bill. An Executive official told the committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The DTI recently published a set of regulations for the bill, which set out proposals for the community interest test. The idea is that the CIC would benefit a narrower range of people than we would expect a charity to benefit. It will be proposed that the test for a charity will be that it will have a wide public benefit, whereas the CIC ... test could be ... more restricted ... perhaps it could relate to a community hall in a village, for example\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Communities Committee</em>, 25 February 2004; c 655.]</p><p>In other words, we are being asked, in advance of our Scottish charities bill, to agree the scope of what a public benefit test might be when we eventually discuss it. The suggestion that the public benefit test for charities in the Scottish legislation will involve a wider geographic area than that of a village concerns me. We will not support such a provision when it is introduced.</p><p>Social enterprises or other companies can opt to become community interest companies under UK legislation. That matter is reserved to the Department of Trade and Industry under the bill. The acceptance or otherwise of the Sewel motion will not affect those companies' ability to choose that option. However, the motion puts the cart before the horse.</p><p>I share other MSPs' view that it is extremely unlikely that Scottish charities will seek approval to become community interest companies. If the Sewel motion is accepted, it might pre-empt discussions that are needed on the public benefit test that this Parliament should consider as part of the charities bill. If the Executive has made up its mind to have a limited public benefit test and if the Parliament cannot change that view when the time comes for us to consider our own charities bill, we need to preserve the option in the UK legislation, for those charities in Scotland that could find themselves stripped of charity status, to allow them to become CICs.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament is not permitted to give powers to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator under the companies legislation.

Now, a few years later, we are moving towards that position and it is important that we do that as quickly as possible.</p><p>There is no dispute that Scottish housing is in bad condition. The very worst of the housing stock is in the private sector. That is why I welcome the report of the housing improvement task force, and the opportunity to debate that report today. Tommy Sheridan and Murray Tosh are right that there needs to be a debate in Scotland about the supply side and the need for new housing. That will be an important debate when it happens, but it is not the debate that we should be having today; it is a debate for the future.</p><p>I will deal first with owner-occupiers. No one denies that some owners spend money on new bathrooms and kitchens, and not enough on repairs and maintenance. Of course that is true, but what is needed&#8212;as Pauline McNeill rightly said&#8212;is a culture change. If owner-occupiers are to be cajoled and encouraged to carry out regular repairs and maintenance, we must ensure that local authorities do the same. I recall that Glenrothes Development Corporation had planned maintenance programmes, under which the windows of houses were painted regularly&#8212;perhaps every three years. Few local authorities do that now. We should ensure that as well as expecting owner-occupiers to do such maintenance, we expect the same from landlords in other sectors.</p><p>At the extreme end of the scale of disrepair are houses that are dilapidated and which are nuisances in neighbourhoods. Local authorities must take action on such houses far more quickly than they are doing at present. I am not convinced that that is a matter for legislation. It is possible that local authorities could use the power of well-<place-holder colnum=\"4701\"/> being, which was introduced by the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003, to ensure that dilapidated and dangerous houses are dealt with under existing legislation. The minister may wish to consider that and issue some guidelines.</p><p>Pauline McNeill raised the issue of grants to private owners. Before 1996, the Government told local authorities how much they were allowed to borrow to spend on private sector repair and maintenance grants. Until then, local authorities routinely spent more than &#163;100 million a year on such grants. In 1996, that ring fencing was removed at the behest of the local authorities and the amount of money that was available for repair and improvement grants plummeted to as low as &#163;29 million in 2000-01. Twenty years ago, &#163;167 million was available in grants for private sector repairs and improvements, but in 2000-01 only &#163;29 million was available.</p><p>Shelter estimates that, if local authority spending on repair and maintenance grants for private houses had remained at the level that it was set at before the ring fencing was removed in 1995-96 and had increased in line with inflation, &#163;667 million more than has actually been spent would have been spent on private housing by now.</p><p>I accept that, as the minister said, money should not be used indiscriminately, but we should, at the very least, ensure that the care and repairs scheme, which is such a success, is funded and expanded to ensure that elderly people in particular have access to it, regardless of where in Scotland they live.</p><p>The worst housing conditions are in the private rented sector, which houses some of the most vulnerable people in Scotland. I welcome the Executive's intention to explore a national registration scheme, which it announced in December. Like Cathie Craigie, I am firmly of the view that the condition of a property must be of a certain quality before any registration is permitted and that private landlords must take responsibility for dealing with tenants who indulge in antisocial behaviour.

As Scott Barrie and other members have said, the development will free up capacity on the Forth bridge and in Fife. According to English Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway, the beneficial effect of the development will be felt right across <place-holder colnum=\"4252\"/> the network. As Marilyn Livingstone said, reliability and frequency of service on the Fife to Edinburgh line has not been given the attention that it deserves and is a priority. Freeing up freight from that line gives us an opportunity to ensure that the passenger service from Fife is the best that it can be and that Fife can benefit from the investment that it has been starved of for at least the past 25 years.</p><p>As has been said, the proposal is incomplete. There is no indication of who will operate the railway and I would have liked the comfort of some agreement, in principle, on that. Nicol Stephen said that the Executive will support the line and I am heartened by his comment that he will try to ensure that the line is developed as far as Rosyth to link with the ferry terminal. That is absolutely essential, because we must make sure that we get all the benefits from the line.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nicol Stephen said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I want not only to support the principles of the project, but to help to develop it.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2003-06-12.742.7\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 12 June 2003; <br/> c 743.]</citation></p><p>I urge the minister to ensure that the project's benefits are extended beyond Clackmannanshire to Fife.

There is an opportunity to develop the project and open up access to Europe. That opportunity must be grasped and I urge the minister to roll out Rosyth proposals alongside the consideration and implementation of the project, if it is agreed by the Parliament. Kenny MacAskill almost said earlier that for a ha'p'orth of tar, the ship was spoiled. The project and the line will be spoiled if the huge benefits that would accrue from extending the line to Rosyth are not grasped.

She is absolutely right. Communities the length and breadth of Scotland are crying out for support. Everybody has the right to live in their own home in peace and security.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I attended a public meeting in Auchmuty. That is an area of Glenrothes that Scott Barrie knows well. It is a strong community, with an active tenants association in which I was involved for many years. The association supports both the young folk and the old folk; it runs old folks treats and the like.</p><p>Nearly 150 people turned out at the meeting. The police, the local authority and other agencies were present, as were Christine May, the local councillor and me. It became clear that the community, like other communities, believes that it is being abandoned by the statutory authorities.</p><p>That community knows about antisocial behaviour. It was, after all, the community where the Graham family from Glenrothes lived. The <place-holder colnum=\"2318\"/> community knows well what it is talking about when it talks about antisocial behaviour. When 150 people turn out on a wet night to present their concerns to MSPs, councillors and statutory authorities, we have an absolute duty to listen, and not only to listen, but to take action.</p><p>The minister said that the authorities should be accountable to the communities. In some cases, there is scant evidence that that is happening. A culture change is needed among some local authority staff. It is unacceptable for a Fife Council official to tell a community, as one did at a meeting in Tanshall last year, that the council would not do a clean up because the community had caused all the dumping and littering in the first place. Nor is it acceptable for council officials to sit at public meetings, as they did last week, wringing their hands and blaming the police, the community and the Scottish Parliament for not taking action.</p><p>Legislation alone is not enough: it needs to be enforced by our police and understood by our local authorities. The police must be adequately resourced to ensure that current legislation is enforced properly. Part of the problem is that mere lip service is being paid to existing legislation. Local authorities are not willing to enforce it and the police lack the resources to do that.</p><p>I supported ASBOs when they were introduced. The rhetoric was that ASBOs would deal with antisocial behaviour, and we raised expectations in our communities that that would happen. In reality, it did not.</p><p>In the little time that is available to me I want to raise some specific issues. I know that other members have already raised them, but I would like to reinforce the points that have been made. Janis Hughes spoke about off-licences and the difficulty of older people getting alcohol and giving it to youngsters. I raised that issue a couple of weeks ago, when we debated the licensing laws. Janis Hughes is right to highlight the problem. I hope that the ministers will take the point on board when they consider the licensing laws.</p><p>We need to examine the location of some off-licences in our communities. In Auchmuty, the off-licence is right beside the children's play park, which is unacceptable. When communities come to public meetings or to MSPs they are able to say where drug dealing is happening and who is doing it. Why do the police seem unable to take action or to get convictions? We must have zero tolerance of graffiti and vandalism in our communities. Nicola Sturgeon is right to say that bus shelters are repaired in the morning and destroyed at night. As a society, we must say that that is not acceptable. Bus shelters must be repaired, because we cannot allow the good folk in communities to believe that they are being abandoned and that because things are being <place-holder colnum=\"2319\"/> destroyed, we are doing nothing about this problem. We must create communities in which people are respected and that people can respect.</p><p>We must take action against private landlords and their tenants to ensure that they are not allowed to flout the law. I would like a licensing scheme for private landlords to operate in each local authority area. Unless landlords adhere to a code, local authorities should refuse to license them as private landlords.

At the council's first meeting following the elections, the Liberal Democrats proposed a motion asking Fife Council to agree immediately to build a new school in north Fife. Quite rightly, the SNP and the Labour administration felt that so important a decision could not be made in a motion of three or four lines, but would need a far greater review of <place-holder colnum=\"397\"/> the issues.</p><p>The school refurbishment bill for the whole of Fife is about &#163;60 million. To attempt to commit Fife Council and its budgets to a new school in Fife overnight was simply a piece of political posturing by the Liberal Democrats. That is why the SNP and the Labour administration opposed the motion.</p><p>It has always been my view that we need a new school in north-east Fife, but I believe that educational attainment for all the pupils in Fife is equally important. Ted Brocklebank said that I had never congratulated Madras College and Bell Baxter and their teachers on their attainment levels. That is simply not true. They are doing a wonderful job in appalling conditions. I refer Mr Brocklebank to my comments during the debate on Bell Baxter that we had in Glasgow.</p><p>I find unacceptable the suggestion that money should be spent in north Fife alone, to the detriment of the rest of Fife. It is unacceptable that we have low levels of attainment in Buckhaven and elsewhere. We need to stop pupils in such areas going to the north-east Fife schools because their parents believe that they will get a better education there. We must ensure that resources are spread evenly.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank made a great case for proportional representation in local government. He mentioned that there has never been a Labour councillor in north-east Fife and that the Labour party has never had any political representation in that area. For a long time, the Conservatives provided that representation and now the Liberal Democrats are there. If we had PR in local government, north-east Fife would have some Labour councillors.</p><p>I suggest that the quality of the representation by the Conservatives and the Liberals for generations in north-east Fife has contributed to the lack of consideration of the needs of north-east Fife. If the Liberal Democrats had been a bit more proactive recently, they might have been able to convince the Labour administration and others in north-east Fife that we needed a school.</p><p>Many issues need to be considered. I welcome the review that Fife Council is carrying out. It is important that that review is conducted fairly and that the council looks at the whole of Fife and at the places where the population is increasing.

As we come to the end of the Scottish Parliament's first session, it is unacceptable that the Executive has not legislated on the matter. Charity law reform would have found all-party support in the Parliament&#8212;I note that members of all parties have asked questions about it from 1999 and, if we look around the chamber now, we can see the great groundswell of support in the Parliament for charity law reform.</p><p>The McFadden commission was established in January 2000 and reported in May 2001, as Jackie Baillie said, after which the Executive decided to consult on the commission's recommendations. That consultation ended on 30 September 2001, but although eighteen months have passed, there is still no bill. The Executive has let down the charities and voluntary organisations in Scotland, which realise how vital charity law reform is.</p><p>Jackie Baillie was right: for years policy officers from the SCVO urged charity law reform legislation at Westminster and the SCVO had high hopes that, in the first session of the Scottish Parliament, the Executive would introduce such legislation. At the first Justice and Home Affairs Committee meeting in June 1999, I highlighted the need for charity law reform. I said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"One of the major problems faced by charities and voluntary organisations in Scotland is that there is no <place-holder colnum=\"19714\"/> regulatory framework for them: charities are allowed to do whatever they want. Unlike the Charity Commission for England and Wales, which has regulatory powers of investigation, the equivalent office in Scotland is small and has virtually no powers. Anybody in Scotland can set up a charity with very little investigation even when things go wrong. ... We would do a great service to the voluntary and charitable sector in Scotland if we could initiate legislation on that.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice and Home Affairs Committee</em>, 29 June 1999; c 11-12.]</p><p>At that time, I even considered introducing a member's bill on the subject. Unfortunately, I was talked out of doing so by Martin Sime of the SCVO while we chatted at the Parliament's official opening in July&#8212;I am sure that he remembers the conversation. He urged me not to introduce a member's bill because he believed confidently that the Executive would legislate: how disappointed he must be.</p><p>The Executive has let down charities in Scotland. Jackie Baillie spoke about the need for positive action, but it is a pity that we did not have positive action four years ago. I assure members that there will be positive action in the Scottish Parliament's next session, because we must ensure that we have charity law reform.

There are approximately half a million dogs in Scotland and they produce 80 tonnes of excrement a day. Dog fouling is not only unsightly, but a health hazard&#8212;I am sure that we were all grateful to Richard Simpson at stage 1 for outlining exactly what the hazards are. I am unable to repeat some of the words that he used, because they were medical words. The problem is stressful <place-holder colnum=\"19538\"/> for those who have to live with it, and it costs councils money to clean the dog mess up. The existing legislation is simply inadequate to tackle dog fouling.</p><p>Andy Kerr and I had an exchange at stage 1 about who cleans the boots or the wellies. I had come to the conclusion that that was the man's role. Since then, I have been inundated with e-mails from women saying that I am absolutely right: it is something that the men do. Instead of going out and grabbing animals and bringing them back for food, these days the men of our households are cleaning dog poo off wellies.</p><p>It is a serious matter. Many trips to parks or play parks have been ruined by dog mess getting on children's feet. The key to the proposed legislation lies in redefining the offence, from one of allowing a dog to foul to failing to clear up after the dog has fouled, while giving powers to local authorities to appoint officers. The new approach could also be applied to other legislation that needs to be introduced in future, including legislation to tackle littering.</p><p>I am sure that Keith Harding would agree that, had the Executive not supported the Dog Fouling (Scotland) Bill, we would not be holding today's stage 3 debate. As we come to the end of our four-year session, members of all parties should reflect on the fact that no members' bill has succeeded in becoming an act without the overt support of the Executive throughout its scrutiny, perhaps with the exception of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill.

I have been concerned about the subject for several years, because the effect of lead on the development of children has been known about for decades&#8212;it is not new.</p><p>Towards the end of last year, I lodged a number of questions asking the Executive how many houses in Scotland had water supplies that contain lead piping, but the Executive could not tell me. Furthermore, there are no plans to collect that information centrally, which is not good enough.</p><p>There is a grant system for domestic householders to replace lead piping. The problem is that the grants that are available to local authorities, or rather those that are available to householders, are extremely limited. The number of grants that may be granted each year is constrained by the amount of money that is available. It will take many years to make progress on eliminating the existing problem in old houses and to get rid of lead piping in domestic water supplies. The Executive needs to address that as a matter of urgency.</p><p>I turn now to the issue of the lead solder that is used in new homes. I, too, welcome John Scott's announcement that at stage 3 of the Building (Scotland) Bill he intends to lodge an amendment to address that matter. The SNP will consider that amendment and, if it is as John Scott describes, SNP members will support it. The practice of using lead solder is clearly detrimental to health, and I wonder whether it is a criminal matter. If so, why have there been no prosecutions for using lead solder? As well as ensuring that completion certificates are right, so that building warrants are not issued if lead solder has been used, we must <place-holder colnum=\"18276\"/> use the force of law&#8212;if necessary&#8212;to ensure that contractors who do not comply voluntarily are aware that their actions will be dealt with.</p>", "hdate": "2003-02-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13290833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Supplies (Lead Pipes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Robert Brown on securing the debate.

The partnership document said that immediate progress would be made on PR. In July 1999, the McIntosh commission report was issued and we debated it in this chamber. McIntosh said that there should be PR for local government, but he did not specify the form. Then another consultation was set up. The Kerley working group reported in June 2000 that the system of PR that would best meet the criteria set down by McIntosh, including maintaining the councillor-ward link, was PRSTV. The Executive's response was to set up a working party, which was established in August 2000. The working party met only three times between August 2000 and February 2001. That was the kind of progress that was being made. The motion on my bill was lodged in November 2001.

I refer him to the Fairshare briefing&#8212;he has obviously not read it&#8212;which says that 73 out of 129 MSPs in the chamber believe in PR for local government. There is a clear majority for PR in local government and there has been a clear majority from day one of the Parliament. Fairshare knows it, it knows what the names are and Robert Brown is simply not right.</p><p>We will discover what kind of support there is for single transferable vote PR in local government at 5 o'clock tonight.</p><p>I will now explain what my bill will do and tell the chamber what some members of the Local Government Committee were prepared to do to manufacture concerns about the bill.</p><p>First, I will deal with the Liberal Democrat amendment. Yesterday, I said that the Liberal Democrats had been conned again on PR. Having seen the amendment that Iain Smith lodged for today, I now realise that that comment was much too generous. If the Liberal Democrats do not vote for the motion, which can put the PR bill on the statute book by March 2003, they are not simply stupid, they are unprincipled and they are hypocrites. On a television programme in December last year, Charles Kennedy said that all he wanted for Christmas was PR. His colleagues in this chamber have the chance to have PR by March 2003 but, instead, they will vote for a bit of paper.</p><p>I can hardly wait for Iain Smith to explain how he can vote for the general principles of the bill in the Local Government Committee and today move an amendment that rejects the general principles of the bill. On second thoughts, it would do us all a favour if Iain Smith spared us the self-serving, \"gie's another job\" type of speech that he usually makes.</p><p>Why are the Liberal Democrats voting against PR today? The answer I got from a Liberal Democrat MSP last night was, \"We still favour STVPR, but we oppose the SNP.\" There we have it&#8212;the real reason is nothing to do with PR and nothing to do with the bill, and everything to do with the fact that this is a bill from a member of the Scottish National Party.</p><p>The arguments for STVPR are well rehearsed. All parties in the chamber will be both advantaged and disadvantaged by STVPR. What kind of <place-holder colnum=\"17841\"/> system gives Labour in Midlothian 94 per cent of the seats on 46 per cent of the vote, the SNP in Angus 72 per cent of the seats on 47 per cent of the vote or the Lib Dems in East Dunbartonshire 42 per cent of the seats on 27 per cent of the votes? As Mr Harding well knows, the Conservatives have 41 per cent of the seats on 27 per cent of the vote in Stirling. Whatever we call that system, it is neither fair nor democratic.</p><p>My member's bill was drafted privately because, despite support from the Greens, the SSP and Dennis Canavan, it was denied non-Executive bill drafting time. None of the parties, including the Liberal Democrats, was prepared to support a motion on PR.</p><p>I thank Alyn Smith and Scott Martin for all their work. I also thank Andrew Mylne of the parliamentary staff, whose wise advice helped to prepare the bill for introduction.</p><p>My bill is simple. It has one aim and that is to enable STV for local government elections. When the bill was introduced in June, there was an opportunity for the 2003 elections to be held under PR. After all, it took only three months after enactment of PR for the Northern Ireland elections to be held. The Scotland Act 1998 was passed in November of that year and the Scottish Parliament elections were held in May 1999 using a proportional system. The 2003 elections could have been held under an STVPR system&#8212;what a wasted opportunity.</p><p>I turn now to the Local Government Committee's stage 1 report on the bill and the discussions that took place in public and private sessions. On the casting vote of the convener, the committee decided not to support the general principles of the bill. However, at paragraph 22 on page 4, the report claims that Tricia Marwick, Sandra White and Iain Smith supported the bill, and that Trish Godman, Sylvia Jackson, Richard Simpson and Keith Harding were opposed to it. That statement is not true. Keith Harding was not even at the meeting; it was John Young. John Young did not oppose the bill; he abstained. That left the committee tied at 3:3 and Trish Godman used her casting vote against the bill. Page 24 of the report gives the voting results.</p><p>The committee concluded that the consultation on the bill had not been adequate, despite the fact that representatives from Fairshare said in evidence that the principle of PR in local government had to be the most consulted on in local government history, that the issue had been \"consulted to death\" and that it was time for the Government to act.</p><p>The committee also concluded that the lack of prescription on ward sizes was a major flaw in my bill. In fact, it is a major strength. The flexibility of <place-holder colnum=\"17842\"/> having up to eight members per electoral ward in an STV ward would allow rural and sparsely populated areas to have fewer members, which is precisely what members from rural councils such as Borders Council argued for in their evidence to the committee. In the PR system in the Scottish Parliament, Orkney and Shetland have separate MSPs so that account is taken of rurality and geographical differences. Not all constituencies have the same number of electors at present and, indeed, the Executive's draft bill also allows for different numbers of councillors in different wards.</p><p>Paragraph 79 of the stage 1 report says that the committee concluded by a majority that it was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"not content with the Policy Memorandum.\"</p><p>That conclusion was reached despite the fact that the bill is a member's bill and I was not required to produce a policy memorandum in the first place.</p><p>I have some sympathy with the view that the financial memorandum may be inadequate. The bill could enable the first STV elections on mainland Britain, and it is impossible for an individual member to quantify costs. However, if members were to approve the general principles of the bill, the Executive would be duty bound to work with me to work out costs before it lodged the financial resolution.

If the Executive is prepared to meet the costs of its bill, it should be prepared to meet the costs of mine.</p><p>I turn to the most shameful manufactured opposition to a bill that I have experienced in the Parliament. Paragraph 90 of the report says that when the committee was considering its draft report, which concluded that too much power had been given to ministers to determine ward boundaries, the Subordinate Legislation Committee had already considered the matter and was satisfied with those powers. That committee had submitted its report to the convener two weeks before the Local Government Committee was to consider its own draft report.</p><p>The Subordinate Legislation Committee's report was withheld from the Local Government Committee on the instructions of the convener. It was finally distributed to the committee when I asked where it was. I have yet to get a satisfactory explanation of why a committee was asked to approve a report that was critical of the subordinate legislation powers in a bill without being given any explanation or indication that the Subordinate Legislation Committee's report was available and that it supported the measures I proposed.</p>", "hdate": "2003-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13289591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proportional Representation (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I confirm for Robert Brown that it is not what I think that matters.

I have said this before and will say it again, because it is worth repeating: the measures contained in the bill, along with proposals to tackle litter, fireworks and so on, could all have been accommodated in a new civic government bill to replace the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. It is regrettable that, at the end of almost four years and after considerable work has been undertaken by the Convention of Scottish Local <place-holder colnum=\"17123\"/> Authorities, the Executive has not introduced such a bill and that we are not discussing that instead today.</p><p>That is not to take away from Keith Harding's determination or from the worthiness of the bill before us. COSLA is considering civic government proposals, but it recognises that they will be a long time coming and that a stand-alone bill will find support more quickly.</p><p>Everybody acknowledges that the current legislation is inadequate and does not work. To the huge frustration of councils and councillors, the legislation is clearly inadequate to deal with dog fouling and has been so probably since the hour that it was drafted. That is why it is right and proper that the Parliament should discuss the bill. I know that members and people outside the Parliament are wondering or turning up their noses at our discussion of something that they might not consider important, but the Parliament is about legislating and it is for the Parliament to put in place the legislative framework to allow councils to undertake the job that citizens expect them to undertake.</p><p>Changing the emphasis from an offence of allowing a dog to foul to one of failing to clear up after a dog has fouled is the proper way to go. It is a pity that previous legislation did not make that big leap. If it had, perhaps we would not have had the problems with implementing it.</p><p>The bill proposes that fixed-penalty notices should be issued. Keith Harding has said that he will consider an amendment at stage 2 to ensure that the time limit for issuing a fixed-penalty notice is seven days and not 72 hours, which is the limit in the bill. I commend Keith Harding's willingness to consider amendments, which is to his credit. He and the rest of the members who are in the chamber genuinely want a good bill. I commend Keith Harding for working to achieve that.</p><p>The bill gives local government officers the power to issue fixed-penalty notices. That is a major new power that is a precedent for future legislation on a subject such as litter. Just as the emphasis on dog fouling has changed, so will allowing council officers to issue fixed-penalty notices in other circumstances be the leap that is needed to ensure that legislation on a subject such as litter is enforceable.

To slip in an amendment that will deny any scrutiny of the proposals is to legislate by diktat. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the closure of fire stations and a reduction in the number of firefighters and appliances. It will take away the right of communities to be consulted about those changes. I see the minister shaking his head when I suggest that the amendment will do that specifically.</p><p>I will quote the Bain report and the reasons that it gives for recommending the repeal of section 19 of the 1947 act. In case the minister still has any doubts, I will tell him that Bain said that the Government must repeal section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947, because, under that provision, a fire authority in Great Britain may not close a fire station or reduce appliances or firefighter posts without consent. Bain said that that is not consistent with the delegation of responsibility and effective management, which is why he believes that the repeal of section 19 of the 1947 act is needed.</p><p>What the minister has been saying today is simply not true. The Executive has taken the most contentious of all the Bain recommendations and <place-holder colnum=\"16746\"/> is now trying to bludgeon it through the Parliament without allowing for any scrutiny. Delicate negotiations are going on with the Fire Brigades Union and the employers to end the present dispute. This shabby sleight of hand will inflame that situation and the responsibility for that rests squarely with the Executive and the Government.</p><p>The consultation paper said that the most significant thing to happen to the fire service in Scotland was the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, because the Parliament has responsibility for all matters concerning the Scottish fire service.

The biggest tragedy of all is that, while we are putting resources into tackling drugs and alcohol, we are putting very few resources into tackling solvent abuse or even into raising awareness about solvent abuse. Some 10 or 15 years ago, solvent abuse was something that was spoken about quite often, because that was what many young people indulged in. Unfortunately, we now concentrate so much on drugs and alcohol abuse that we have all but forgotten that solvent abuse is still going on. It is only when there are tragedies such as that of Lee O'Brien that the public and politicians focus on the problem.</p><p>Lee's death has highlighted the issue once more. It is not an issue that has gone away, but one that continues to damage people, with 70 young people dying every year in the United Kingdom through solvent abuse. That means 70 wasted young lives and 70 destroyed families. That is why it is important that we congratulate the O'Brien family on putting their grief to one side and campaigning to ensure that we raise awareness about solvent abuse in general and the abuse of lighter refill gas in particular.</p><p>I congratulate Fife Council and the other local authorities that have signed up in support of the campaign. They know the problems in our communities, and it is vital that we recognise where all the pitfalls are for young people. We must raise awareness and ensure that the resources are in place. If we are not considering legislation to encourage retailers to address their responsibilities, we should be ensuring that, even without legislation, retailers take responsible social action and do not sell solvents such as lighter fuel to young people in the quantities that they are undoubtedly selling them in. The retail community has a responsibility, notwithstanding any need for future legislation. Retailers must address what they are doing to our communities and we need to raise awareness within the retail community.</p><p>I ask the minister to respond positively to the pleas of Marilyn Livingstone and to the campaign by the O'Brien family, who have come to the Public Petitions Committee and have now had their campaign highlighted in the Parliament. I ask the minister to make a positive contribution to the debate, so that we can see where we can go and how we can help the O'Briens' campaign.

No issue is more pressing, more emotive or more desperate than homelessness.</p><p>Under the bill, priority need is to be phased out by 2012. The priority need in current legislation is an artificial gate-keeping mechanism. The priorities are hoops that homeless people have to go through. They are asked questions such as, \"Are you homeless? Have you priority need? Are you intentionally homeless? Have you a local connection?\" When I first joined Shelter, I thought naively that if someone was homeless, they were homeless. One of the great frustrations was that although someone was homeless, they might not be statutorily homeless and, regardless of their circumstances, if they did not manage to meet all the tests, they were simply not entitled to local authority housing.</p><p>There are concerns about resources and the supply of housing, and those issues must be addressed. Johann Lamont mentioned the concerns that have been raised about whether anti-social tenants will use the proposed legislation to continually get access to local authority housing. I agree with Shelter. The bill should not be used to tackle anti-social behaviour. Anti-social behaviour is criminal behaviour and should be tackled by the justice system. Some of our communities are terrorised by those who blight the <place-holder colnum=\"16480\"/> lives of others. Such people need to be dealt with quickly and effectively by the courts. In my experience, anti-social behaviour orders are simply not working.</p><p>However, the proposed legislation would be diluted if we were to use it as an opportunity to express our frustration with the failure of the criminal justice system.

Matters are left entirely at the discretion of the commissioner, who, I am sure, will be a very good person. Obviously, the commissioner must be as independent as possible, but the Parliament must be informed of the actions of the commissioner to allow for scrutiny and the total transparency of the system and to maintain faith in the system.</p><p>Ultimately, the Parliament holds ministers to account and we cannot do that unless the commissioner has been given a duty to report to the Parliament any breaches that they come across. The bill is also flawed in that it allows for the possibility of an appointment being made in breach of the code. In evidence, Roger McClure of the Scottish Funding Councils for Further and Higher Education agreed with me that, before an appointment was made, the commissioner should confirm that all the processes were followed, thereby avoiding an appointment that breached the rules. That would give the Parliament and the public a guarantee of the rigour of the process.</p><p>I acknowledge what the minister said and also what he said when he gave evidence to the committee. He asserted that the bill allows the commissioner to intervene before an appointment is made and to tell Parliament that they do not think that the minister is acting in accordance with the code. However, that is not the same as the commissioner having a duty to do so.</p><p>As the minister has said, whether there should be a public appointments committee to manage the new scrutiny role is a matter for the Parliament, which is the point that Alex Neil raised with the minister. While it is a matter for the Parliament, the Executive has the majority of the MSPs in the Parliament. Can the Executive guarantee that, if a resolution to establish a parliamentary committee is made, the Executive will support it? It is not the role of the Executive to establish a committee, but it is impossible to establish a committee without the Executive's support. It is surely self-evident that a committee should be established to give support and to ensure that the commissioner is able to carry out his or her own duties. Such a committee should be given as wide a remit as possible and the powers to bring matters to the attention of the commissioner.</p><p>Quangos and public bodies in Scotland spend nearly &#163;9 billion of public money.

It is important that we go back to 1999, when the Standards Committee hoped to set up an inquiry into all aspects of lobbying. The reason why lobbying was important to the committee and filled some of our early discussions was that we were aware that the Parliament was set up at a time when the institution of Westminster had been discredited over such issues as cash for questions. There was a great desire among the people of Scotland that the Parliament should be different. I am sure that I am not alone in recalling that one of the aspirations that was often cited during the referendum campaign and the 1999 election campaign was that the Scottish Parliament should be different from that lot down at Westminster.</p><p>That was the background to the initial discussions about standards and lobbying. At that point, as Kay Ullrich said, we found ourselves parachuted into an inquiry subsequently known as lobbygate. In the context of commercial lobbying organisations, it is important to remember what that inquiry was essentially about&#8212;a lobby company, Beattie Media, boasting to a potential client that it could deliver privileged access to ministers. The subsequent inquiry found that, on the evidence available, none of the ministers in question had transgressed. Why did that <place-holder colnum=\"14382\"/> commercial lobbying organisation boast that it could offer privileged access? It made that boast because, if it had not, the client might have wondered what the point of employing the firm was.</p><p>I believe that lobbying is an essential part of the democratic process. Whether we are talking about the man who came to my office last week to lobby me about his concerns over fluoridation of the water supply or Help the Aged, Shelter Scotland and other voluntary organisations, they are all engaged in lobbying. As Kay Ullrich and others have said, the information that such bodies and individuals have provided has helped to inform debates in the Parliament. It has allowed us to make better legislation than we would otherwise have made.</p><p>Commercial lobbying organisations fall into a different category. They lobby for profit and engage with the Parliament and parliamentarians on behalf of third parties. During our inquiry, it became clear that the commercial lobbying companies were lobbying heavily to influence the thinking of the Standards Committee. The inquiry took a long time.

We need only go back to Westminster in the early 1990s to see how corrosive allegations and impropriety can be to the democratic process. As other members have pointed out, much of the public's disenchantment with politics and politicians probably has its roots in cash for questions and other scandals of the 1990s.</p><p>However, it is important that we do not get allegations of sleaze out of proportion. It has been a busy parliamentary session for the Standards Committee, but for all the right reasons. Through the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Act 2002, we have established robust and transparent procedures for investigating complaints. We have produced a comprehensive code of conduct and&#8212;as we did today&#8212;we have not hesitated to make changes to it as we have learned from experience. We have also conducted a wide-ranging inquiry into lobbying, which we will debate later.</p><p>The complaints that we have dealt with have generally been matters of protocol not probity. Today, following a comprehensive review of the Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Members' Interests) Order 1999, we seek the Parliament's agreement to introduce a committee bill.</p><p>Other members have outlined the key elements of our proposals. We have recommended changes to the rules on gifts that will balance transparency with allowing family members to have legitimate privacy. I seem to recall that, when Karen Gillon was a member of the committee, the two of us discussed the fact that our husbands were mean. At that time, she said that she hoped to get a ring worth &#163;250. I have looked at the register of members' interests and have found no such declaration. Therefore, I am forced to conclude that Karen never received the ring from her husband, Jim. That is a disgrace; after all, she has <place-holder colnum=\"14368\"/> had two children since then.</p><p>We have suggested changes to the rules on shareholdings, which will make the registration and declaration of such interests far more meaningful. Moreover, we have proposed the mandatory registration of non-pecuniary interests, which we believe will enhance the current registration framework. The registration of such interests will not only strengthen our commitment to openness but provide a fuller picture of the experience and expertise of the member concerned. Every step of the way, we have tried to ensure that our response has been proportionate.

MSPs should display more grown-up behaviour. I know from experience that there is nothing worse than finding that the newspapers have been briefed that a complaint is to made against oneself. I suffered that, not at the hands of a fellow MSP, but at the hands of a member of the public, who faxed her letter of complaint to the press. Of course, it was found subsequently that there was no case to answer. That situation was difficult, but I dealt with it robustly. I defended myself and said that the allegation was not true. However, it is not helpful to any member to find in the press details of a complaint that is subsequently considered and in respect of which the member is exonerated. Often, complaints do not reach the Standards Committee.</p><p>I ask all members to support the proposed change to the code of conduct.

The one thing that cannot be said about the bill is that it is bold; indeed, it is not. Although it addresses some of the issues in local government today, it does not represent the kind of reform that could have been introduced and which would revitalise Scottish local government. The Local Government in Scotland Bill was to be the Executive's flagship local government bill, but the Executive has delivered a bill that covers best value, community planning and the power of well-being, but goes no further.</p><p>I was interested in the minister's final remarks when he said that he will lodge miscellaneous amendments to the bill at stage 2 and that he will share those with the convener of the Local Government Committee. I would like to hear from the minister when he is summing up what kind of amendments he will lodge.</p><p>The McIntosh commission, to which the minister referred, considered the whole issue of renewing local democracy. Many of us had hoped that many of the McIntosh recommendations would have been included in the Executive's flagship local government bill. The measures in the bill are perfectly reasonable, but there is no mention of councillors, nor is there mention of proportional representation for local government, which would be a significant measure that would renew local government and release its potential. There are a number of concerns about well-being, community planning and best value.</p><p>At this stage, I pay tribute to the work of the Local Government Committee, which has&#8212;as it always does&#8212;scrutinised the bill thoroughly and fairly. The members of the committee have the thanks of the rest of us in the Parliament for the work that they have done on this and other bills.</p><p>I turn now to best value. I feel&#8212;so, indeed, did the Local Government Committee&#8212;that securing best value could become problematic if different public bodies are subject to different guidance, which would result in different public bodies potentially interpreting and pursuing best value in different ways. That could lead to problems in achieving best value through partnership working, ultimately devaluing best value and undermining partnership working practices. When that issue was raised, the deputy minister indicated in a memorandum that steps would be taken to ensure <place-holder colnum=\"14275\"/> that guidance</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is consistent between local government and these other bodies\"</p><p>I am not persuaded that guidance alone is enough. If bodies are to work with local authorities, it is only right and proper that best value be applied equally to them all and that the matter is not left to interpretation.</p><p>There also appears to be uncertainty over whether the powers and duties of the Auditor General in relation to the Scottish Executive and public bodies have been modified to take best value into account. An element of confusion has been introduced, but that confusion could be remedied easily if the bill were to provide for common guidance, audit and enforcement.</p><p>There is also a lack of clarity around the duty to secure best value and the duty in relation to community planning. It has not been considered necessary to use primary legislation to place on accountable officers a duty to secure best value, whereas it has been considered necessary to do so in order to place a duty on them to participate in the community planning process. That apparent double standard calls into question the Executive's commitment to best value. Although I welcome the minister's comments, I would still like the bill to include a statutory framework for best value that would be applied throughout the public sector. If best value and community planning are to work and if they are to give local authorities the impetus to develop policies, the bill must include that statutory framework.</p><p>Local businesses and local communities have an impact on sustainable development, which we must consider in relation to securing best value. The bill's policy memorandum places great emphasis on sustainable development and on how</p><p class=\"indent\">\"local authorities will want to consider the impact on sustainable development\"</p><p>of the bill.</p><p>We must recognise and acknowledge the requirements of sustainable development in order to allow councils to address those requirements. The lack of a definition of sustainable development causes another problem. Should that definition appear in the bill, or will the statutory guidelines contain a sufficiently robust definition? It would be useful if the deputy minister would indicate&#8212;before stage 2&#8212;what the guidelines are likely to include. If it appears that the Executive's proposals for statutory guidance are insufficiently robust, members of the Local Government Committee and others would be better informed as to whether to lodge amendments to the bill on that matter. It is not good enough to leave until a later date the debate on whether the guidelines are sufficiently robust.<place-holder colnum=\"14276\"/></p><p>The work of local authorities is vital to the well-being of the communities that they serve. Any changes to working practices must come under the scrutiny of the Parliament. Under the provisions of the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000, the principal accountable officer for Scotland&#8212;the permanent secretary&#8212;can change the terms of reference of other accountable officers to include best value. That also means that the principal accountable officer could remove best value without the approval of the Parliament, which is simply unacceptable. The functions of council accountable officers must fall under the scrutiny of the Parliament, and the Parliament must have the power to scrutinise any binding directions to councils on what they do and how they do it. It is a matter of concern that such an undertaking will not come under the scrutiny of the Parliament or of the Local Government Committee. When the deputy minister sums up the debate, I would be grateful if he would explain what the term \"substantial harm\" means with reference to issuing such directions.</p><p>I repeat that the bill is a lost opportunity. It fails to address some of the major issues that affect local government, which is a disappointment, given that we are three and a bit years into the life of the Parliament. I am disappointed by the bill, as, I believe, are many others. The Executive has failed to deliver&#8212;the bill could have done so much more.

I know that members of all parties are as committed as I am to ending fuel poverty. I welcome the new research that the minister announced, but we know some facts about fuel poverty already. We know that only those who are poor live in fuel poverty. People who are old, young or who have a long-term illness are more likely to live in a cold, damp home. People who live in cold, damp homes are almost certainly poor, because if they were not poor, they would not live in cold, damp homes&#8212;they would have alternatives.</p><p>Fuel poverty is a scandal in oil-rich 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland. We pay a high price for it in ill-health and excess heating bills and in stress and worry for the families who are involved. I welcome the Government's central heating initiative and I acknowledge that it has made a difference to many people, but I will highlight the adverse effects of fuel poverty on two of my constituents in central Fife and how the Government's programme has not met their needs.</p><p>The first constituent is a 46-year-old disabled man whose central heating system does not work. He has mobility problems because of childhood polio and he has sciatica. He also takes medication for irritable bowel syndrome. However, he does not receive disability living allowance. He is unemployed and an owner-occupier. As a result of his illnesses, he spends much time at home, where the lack of central heating exacerbates his health problems. He needs a warm house, but because of his age, he is ineligible for help under the Executive's scheme. My office has spent months trying to assist him. We have contacted the local authority, charities and other agencies to try to find assistance for that young man. So far, we have been unable to offer him any assistance. <place-holder colnum=\"13417\"/></p><p>I would like to hear from the minister how that young man is to be assisted to get himself out of fuel poverty.</p><p>The second constituent is a pensioner from Glenrothes. She is entitled to help under the Executive's central heating scheme, but she has been informed that, because of the backlog, new central heating will not be installed in her home for a further 18 months. That will leave her throughout this winter in a cold, damp home. She phoned me last week and said that she cannot face another winter in that house without central heating. She is arranging to pay from her savings to have central heating installed.</p><p>I have pursued fuel poverty over the life of the Parliament. In last year's debate on fuel poverty, I voiced my concerns about the central heating scheme criteria. I will restate that Shelter Scotland said at that time that it would be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"very concerned if the Executive think their central heating scheme will be a major step in eradicating fuel poverty.\"</p><p>It is a step forward, but it is not a major step and we should not allow the Executive to believe that that is the case. I chose to highlight two individual cases to expose the inadequacies in the Executive's scheme. Common sense dictates that those two constituents should be given help and that they should be given help now. They should not have the worry and stress of facing another Scottish winter in cold, damp homes.</p><p>I believe that Margaret Curran is personally committed to tackling poverty.

On this occasion, on behalf of my colleagues on the Standards Committee and the ad hoc committee, I offer my sincere thanks to Sam Jones and her team and to David Cullum of the non-Executive bills unit. The bill is most complicated, as it deals with the relationship between the standards commissioner and the Standards Committee. I pay tribute to the clerks and the non-Executive bills unit for all the help and guidance that they gave us.</p><p>As Ken Macintosh said, we are considering the bill at a time of growing concern about people's disengagement from politics, which is reflected in low election turnouts and a general atmosphere of cynicism about the motives of politicians. In reality, that scepticism and cynicism about the ethical conduct of MSPs and the suspicion of endemic sleaze are misplaced. In this Parliament, we are governed by a tough code of conduct, which the members of the Parliament put in place. Breaches of the rules on the registration and declaration of members' interests are a criminal offence. To date, the Standards Committee has never had to recommend the imposition of sanctions on a member. The few breaches of the code that we have identified have related to matters of protocol, not of probity.</p><p>However, we cannot afford to be complacent and we must acknowledge that although public cynicism might not be well founded, it exists and has the potential to erode the democratic process. I am sure that I am not the only member to notice that not one member of the press is present for this debate. Perhaps the press simply does not want to report a debate about standards in the Parliament and the good news about the independence of our process.</p><p>By passing the bill, we will demonstrate the Parliament's commitment to upholding the highest standards of integrity among members. The appointment of a commissioner will inject an independent element into the complaints procedure. He or she will consider complaints and conduct investigations in private, independently of the Standards Committee. The commissioner will also have the backing of statutory powers to compel evidence.</p><p>The four-stage complaints process that we have developed strikes the right balance between the need for investigations to be carried out in private and the demand for transparency. We make no apology for proposing that the commissioner's inquiries take place in private, because we simply cannot countenance trial by the media. Speculation in the press is not only unfair to the complainer and members, but it will erode <place-holder colnum=\"13138\"/> confidence in the complaints procedure.</p><p>I make a plea to colleagues from all parties to ensure that the complaints procedure is not used to settle political scores. The later stage of the investigative process, which is oral evidence to the Standards Committee, will of course take place in public. Both the commissioner's report and the committee's report will also be published, together with any relevant evidence. It is important that the member, the complainer and the wider public see the reasons for the findings of the commissioner and of the committee.</p><p>The bill marks the end of a long journey for the Standards Committee, which began in 2000 with the models of investigation inquiry. That concluded that an independent element was critical if the Parliament's handling of complaints about conduct was to have credibility. By enacting the bill, all members of the Parliament will make our commitment to accountability and integrity a reality.

In Fife, procedures have been reclassified and patients waiting for such procedures who could have been treated as out-patients have been taken off waiting lists.

Mrs May Cullen from Burntisland was admitted to hospital in March and was advised to seek an appointment with a neurologist with respect to her condition.

Mrs Cullen received a reply from Fife Acute Hospitals NHS Trust telling her that the first appointment with a consultant would be early in 2004&#8212;almost two years away.</p><p>Mary Mair, the trust's directorate manager of medicine, wrote to Mrs Cullen and admitted that the delay was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"unacceptable to yourself and to the trust.\"</p><p>The unacceptable delay is not helped by the fact that there is no neurosurgeon in Fife.

The Executive refused to do so, which is why the Local Government Committee undertook the work on behalf of the Parliament. Again, I commend the committee for doing so.</p><p>The committee took evidence from many organisations and individuals and its report highlights several areas of concern. The SNP does not, however, agree with all the report's recommendations. We do not, for example, support the return of business rates to local authority control. We are not persuaded by arguments that the return of business rates to local authority control would increase business opportunities and expansion, nor do we agree that doing so would increase revenue to local authorities. It is more than likely that the Executive would give with one hand and take away with the other. The end result would be that local government finance would remain in the chaotic position that it is in at the moment.</p><p>Local government finance is in chaos. There is a lack of transparency and a lack of agreement between local authorities and the Executive about how much money should go into local government and how much should be ring fenced. We spend so much time arguing about local government finance that there is no time to reach a baseline agreement on a definition of local government finance and of how much money is involved. However, the argument about that is sterile. We should instead concentrate on delivering the public services that we all need. The Executive and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities disagree about the percentage and the amount of funds that should be ring fenced. Their disagreement is silly and needs to be sorted out as soon as possible. Such disagreements damage the good work of local government.</p><p>The lack of transparency in local government finance between the money that is raised and the services that are provided leaves local residents confused about who delivers what. If we, as citizens, are asked to come out and vote in local council elections, the least that politicians can do is ensure that local council finances are conducted openly and transparently.

The business community firmly opposes such a move and the SNP will not sanction penalisation of local businesses in order to overcome the inadequacies of central funding to councils.</p><p>The Executive should consider a local income tax that is based on ability to pay, which the SNP has advocated in the past. The introduction of a local income tax would bring accountability and fairness to local funding. That proposal is supported by various organisations and it is recommended in the Local Government Committee's report. I agree with Trish Godman that the proposal for local income tax is radical and I am extremely disappointed that the Executive has not accepted the committee's recommendation to consider local income tax in the short and medium-term. There is agreement throughout the chamber that there should be examination of how we raise the money for local government. The proposal for a local income tax has much to commend it. I, along with the members of the Local Government Committee, commend that proposal to the Executive; I hope that the Executive will reconsider its rejection of that proposal.</p><p>Ring fencing of funding erodes the financial responsibility and freedom of local authorities. It is rigid and bureaucratic and it weakens co-ordination of services. It creates pressure to ring fence other services and can sometimes generate an almost perverse outcome. No one denies that, in some circumstances, ring fencing should be accepted; however, the problem is that neither COSLA nor the Executive can agree about the level of local government finance that is ring fenced. Until that is sorted out, we will find it difficult to track the amount of local government spending that is available for core services and the amount that is available for ring fencing. Council services are no longer being addressed by core services. COSLA believes that almost 30 per cent of local authority funding is either ring fenced or <place-holder colnum=\"12802\"/> centrally directed.

If the fire service is so important to the Executive, why have we had to wait three years for a debate?</p><p>We have heard from ministers who seem more focused on producing publications than on delivering the services that they talk about. The minister indicated that no legislation will come before Parliament before the elections in 2003. However, many of the provisions that are set out in the consultation paper on which we can all agree could be implemented without legislation. It would be helpful if the minister could indicate a time scale for implementing some of those recommendations.</p><p>The consultation exercise should not be an excuse for doing nothing. Trish Godman raised important points about fire at sea and Michael Matheson addressed serious issues about the appalling number of fatalities in Scotland and the financial cost of fires. Many members have commented on the changing role of the fire service and it is important that that is reflected. Many members have spoken about personal issues that are not contained in the document, but which form a worthy part of the debate.</p><p>However, six of the 28 recommendations in the <place-holder colnum=\"11902\"/> document tie up more taxpayers' money with consultants rather than with service delivery. There is even a recommendation&#8212;number 20&#8212;to appoint consultants to \"reduce bureaucracy\". That is a real case of creating paperwork to make more paperwork.</p><p>I am concerned that the document contains recommendations that might lead to a reduction in the service. We have already reaped the results of the privatisation of key industries. Air traffic control, Railtrack and the national health service are the most obvious casualties of new Labour privatisation. The fire service cannot be viewed as anything other than a vital public service. It is there for our protection and safety. As ever, new Labour is far from clear about what it means by increased private sector involvement.</p><p>The consultation document recommends</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the development of partnership schemes with the private sector\"</p><p>and the minister claimed that an example was the private sector producing fire alarms. However, tucked away at recommendation 26, the document says clearly that:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Executive will appoint consultants to evaluate the suitability of implementing the PFI model as a means of reducing public expenditure.\"</p><p>I might be a cynic, but that suggests to me that we are going far beyond working with the private sector to produce fire alarms. We are appointing the private sector to tell us why we should place the fire service in the private sector&#8212;in order to cut public expenditure.</p><p>We have seen what cutting public expenditure does to public services.

Susan Deacon is absolutely right to draw a distinction between this debate and the debate about whether committees should meet in private and the circumstances that make us do so. In my experience, committees normally meet in private to consider draft reports and documents that they want to discuss fully. We are coming forward with changes to the code of conduct in relation to draft documents and the periods in which MSPs meet in private.</p><p>I echo Mike Rumbles's opening remarks that the proposed changes to section 9.4 of the code of conduct are not extensive or severe. The Standards Committee is not suggesting draconian measures. Despite the hysterical response from sections of the media that we are seeking to gag MSPs, nothing could be further from the truth. The changes are merely a clarification of the rules. They should be seen as enhancements and welcomed as producing a clearer set of guidelines for us all. They are not intended to be a straitjacket to stifle debate among members.<place-holder colnum=\"10164\"/></p><p>Last year, the Standards Committee spent a fair amount of time dealing with unauthorised disclosures or leaks. I do not mean to suggest that we reached a situation in which the Parliament and committee structure was leaking like a sieve, but the Standards Committee considered three reports from the standards adviser on unauthorised disclosures from committees to the media.</p><p>Our subsequent inquiries into the adequacies of the provisions in the code on leaks and the arrangements for their investigation are based on experience. As a result of the inquiry, we concluded that clarification was required to ensure that the rules that the Parliament endorsed were robust enough.The Standards Committee report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Code's provisions on confidentiality largely focus on the treatment of draft committee reports. The Committee's inquiry and the Adviser's investigation, however, have suggested that the current provisions may not adequately reflect the range of Committee business that is conducted on a confidential basis.\"</p><p>That is one of the main reasons for the revisions of the code. The code is perhaps not clear enough about what is considered to be confidential. The Standards Committee agreed that a tidying-up exercise was required.</p><p>Although misunderstanding of the rules can account for some disclosures, others cannot be laid at that door. Leaks have occurred when someone had what they considered to be a good reason to put information into the public domain without the consent or foreknowledge of their colleagues. That is not an acceptable way for us to work. It can quickly lead to an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust and it can hamper our proceedings.</p><p>I refer specifically to proposed section 9.4.6 of the code, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is also unacceptable, unless the Parliament or the relevant Committee has agreed otherwise, to disclose any information to which a member has privileged access, for example derived from a confidential document or details of discussions or votes taken in private session, either orally or in writing.\"</p><p>That change, which was required to be made, came out of the discussion of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill, which has been mentioned. Within hours of a committee having met in private and taken a vote, the result was leaked to every member of the press, who, by the following day could tell how every member of the committee had voted.</p><p>That kind of leaking is unacceptable behaviour for the Parliament. If people do not know by now that they really ought not to leak details of private discussions or votes, the changes to the code that we are proposing will allow them to be absolutely <place-holder colnum=\"10165\"/> clear about what is required of them.</p><p>The words \"confidential\" or \"in confidence\" are the key to the issue. Any definition of confidence must relate to faith, reliance or trust. We must be able to have trust in one another. We must be able to demonstrate the integrity that people want of their elected representatives.

Those amendments&#8212;particularly to include 16 and 17-year-olds, vulnerable people and people who are experiencing domestic abuse&#8212;were proposed by me when the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 was discussed. The then housing minister rejected them because the Executive's</p><p class=\"indent\">\"strong preference is not to make ad hoc amendments to the current categories, but to wait for the considered opinion of the task force.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Social Justice Committee</i>, 4 April 2001; c 1995.]</p><p>Although I welcome today's announcement, I cannot help but reflect that the categories for priority need could already have been extended for at least a year.</p><p>I hope that the minister will take on board the recommendations of the report, because its thrust is not a new philosophy. Solving and preventing homelessness is not, and has never been, simply a housing matter. As the report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Part of the answer ... lies in reducing the social and economic divide between those who are prosperous and those who are disadvantaged.\"</p><p>The report makes a series of recommendations on benefit policy. I will highlight some of them, particularly those that relate to young people. Although benefits are beyond the Parliament's competence, the issues are critical to tackling homelessness. The report is the result of considerable effort to tailor a Scottish solution to the Scottish homelessness problem and our work must not be undermined by a Whitehall department's one-size-fits-all attitude to benefits.</p><p>I urge the Executive to ensure that the Department for Work and Pensions is fully aware of Scotland's needs. It is vital that the Executive demands that DWP policies are dovetailed to meet Scotland's needs and priorities, rather than an arbitrary London-based assessment of the situation.</p><p>I want to move on quickly to something that has concerned me for a long time&#8212;tied housing. The minister knows of my concern about the lack of legal provision for people who live in tied housing. In rural areas in particular, evictions from tied housing cause part of the homelessness problem. I hope that ministers will consider the forthcoming legislation very carefully to see whether there is any way in which we can extend protection to people who live in tied housing but who can be evicted for various reasons, some of which are not very important. I urge the minister to consider that point, because that protection is essential.<place-holder colnum=\"10105\"/></p><p>Considerable work has gone into the task force's report.

From the outset, members of this Parliament believed that it should be a model of probity. That belief has driven the members of the Standards Committee, past and present, not only to produce a bill that makes provision for the appointment of an independent standards commissioner, but in the other work that they have done, which is the cornerstone of the Parliament. I refer to the rigid code of conduct that has been drawn up, the possible registration of commercial lobby companies and the members' interests order. All those measures will be in place by 2003. By the end of the first session of the Scottish Parliament, structures will be in place that will enable the Scottish people to have confidence both in the procedures of the Parliament and in the politicians who are members of it.</p><p>In February 2000, the Standards Committee introduced a rigorous code of conduct, which was endorsed by the Parliament. Members will recall that at that time the Standards Committee made a commitment to put in place robust arrangements for enforcing the code. The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Bill is the result of the committee's endeavours in that regard. We believe that the proposals contained in the bill, together with the exacting requirements of the code of conduct, will ensure the highest possible standards in the Parliament. They may also go some way towards dispelling public cynicism about politicians.</p><p>Under the Scotland Act 1998, the Standards Committee has the power to carry out investigations. It is to the credit of members of the Standards Committee that they wanted to ensure that there was some independence in that process. That is why we have come forward with the Scottish Parliamentary Standards <place-holder colnum=\"9782\"/> Commissioner Bill today. The appointment of a commissioner would bring that independent element into the complaints procedure. He or she will consider complaints and carry out investigations in private and independently of the Standards Committee. Secondly, the bill will give the commissioner statutory powers, which will enable him or her to carry out those investigations effectively. That is an important distinction from the arrangements at Westminster.</p><p>Refusal to co-operate with the Scottish Parliament's standards commissioner will not be tolerated, although we hope that the commissioner will not have to use their powers in that respect. The power to summon witnesses to give evidence will also enhance the independence of the post. The commissioner will not have to rely on the committee's powers under the Scotland Act 1998. When Elizabeth Filkin gave evidence to our inquiry, she was satisfied at that time that she had no powers independent of the Standards and Privileges Committee at Westminster. She felt that there was no need for her to have such powers, because she worked well with the committee at Westminster. I suspect that she does not think that now.</p><p>The next aspect of the bill that I highlight relates to the procedure for appointing and removing the commissioner. Those are transparent and will ensure that the appointment is made strictly on merit. We envisage an open recruitment process with the post being advertised. The commissioner can be removed only by a two-thirds majority of those voting, thus providing security of tenure. The appointment and removal provisions will also serve to underpin the independence of the post.</p><p>The committee has also indicated that there will be an open and transparent recruitment process. The commissioner will be appointed by the Parliament on the recommendation of the Standards Committee. It is envisaged that that recommendation could be the subject of a debate in the chamber if need be.</p><p>Any evidence taken by the committee at stage 3 of the complaints process will be in public session, as will the committee's decision on the complaint. I emphasise that the commissioner and the committee's report into investigations will be published with relevant evidence.</p><p>Alex Neil's point about the make-up of the Standards Committee struck me. Mike Rumbles and the members of the Standards Committee have operated thus far in a strictly non-partisan manner. I pay tribute to all my colleagues on the committee, past and present, who have worked in that way. The Standards Committee is probably the one committee of the Parliament that has worked in such a way. I am struck by what Alex Neil said and I think that we could consider it in <place-holder colnum=\"9783\"/> terms of the standing orders and procedures to ensure that an underpinning is there.</p><p>The Standards Committee is currently undertaking a review of the members' interests order, which has had a fair amount of publicity recently. The bill also covers breaches of the order, but makes it clear that the commissioner's power will apply to any legislation that replaces the order.</p><p>We will shortly publish our interim conclusions for consultation with a proposal for a further committee bill this year. I urge every member to get involved in that consultation process to ensure that we have legislation on members' interests that is transparent and proportionate.</p><p>I am happy to take interventions but, failing that, I will continue.</p><p>The reputation of the Parliament stands or falls on the integrity of its members. That is inextricably linked to confidence in the arrangements for handling complaints of misconduct. I believe that the bill will provide a strong foundation for such confidence in the probity of Parliament and its members.</p><p>I turn briefly to another point that Alex Neil made about petty complaints and the role of the commissioner. Some people have said that the bill is very complicated and perhaps it looks extremely complicated. The bill essentially defines relationships between the independent commissioner, the Standards Committee and the Parliament. It is inevitable that it has to be a fairly complicated-looking bill. I am sure that members of my party and other parties, who will consider the bill at stage 2, will find themselves working through that.</p><p>Alex Neil is right that the standards commissioner should not be used for petty fights between members.</p>", "hdate": "2002-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13268368", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When we entered the Parliament in May 1999, we were determined that it would not be sullied by sleaze or by a repeat of the scandals that took place at Westminster in the 1990s, which did great damage to the reputation of politics and politicians.

I thank Les Ward, from Advocates for Animals, and the Scottish Campaign Against Hunting with Dogs. I thank Peter Hastie for the work that he did on the bill, but I will not praise him too highly, because that might cause him difficulties in his new employment. I thank the Scottish Gamekeepers Association for the constructive way in which it has engaged with the Parliament on the bill. It has done a power of work in lobbying, on which it is to be congratulated.</p><p>Mike Watson and I gave a commitment to the Parliament at stage 1 that the final bill would do three things: it would ban mounted fox hunts; it would ban hare coursing; and it would ban fox baiting. I am satisfied today that we have achieved <place-holder colnum=\"6511\"/> all three aims. We also gave a commitment to the Parliament, particularly to Karen Gillon when she raised the issue, that legitimate pest control would continue. I am satisfied that the amendments that have been passed today, and the amendments that were passed at stage 2 that have been retained, will allow gamekeepers and hill packs to continue their necessary pest control work.</p><p>George Lyon said that the bill would be challenged in the courts. Well, what a surprise. I seem to recall that the bill was challenged in the courts before it even got to the Parliament. It was challenged in the courts in an attempt to prevent this day from happening.</p><p>I agree with John Home Robertson that the bill is not a priority for the Parliament. It has never been a priority for Mike Watson, Tommy Sheridan, Bristow Muldoon or me. I have been progressing other matters in the Parliament, but just because the bill is not a priority does not mean that it is not worth having.</p><p>Euan Robson said that the bill would devastate the Borders economy. I say to him that the Borders has suffered grievously during the past few years. It has lost hundreds of jobs at Viasystems and elsewhere. However, very few jobs are associated with the hunts. If the hunt owners would go over to drag hunting, there would be no job losses. That would be the sensible thing for them to do. Why will the hunt owners not go over to drag hunting? A master of foxhounds said, \"We will not indulge in drag hunting because it would be like having sex with a condom on.\" Perhaps he, rather than me, should explain that.</p><p>I want to make it clear to those inside and outside the chamber that the bill will not be the forerunner of future bills. The Scottish Countryside Alliance and others in rural Scotland have peddled lies. Those lies need to be nailed and they need to be nailed today. I will never give my support in the Parliament to a bill that would ban fishing or shooting. Those activities are an essential part of our countryside. I do not believe that any member of the Parliament would support such a move.</p><p>The bill is not about rural Scotland versus urban Scotland. There is a majority in both rural and urban Scotland for the bill. I resent being told by people who leave Edinburgh's new town every week in their Range Rovers to hunt in the Borders that the rest of us do not understand the countryside. This is our country.

It is required, usually in rural areas, to ensure that someone who does a particular job also has somewhere to live. The reason for eviction is that the house is needed for some worker who comes in to do the same job as the person who has left. If employers or hunt managers argue that, because of the bill, a job no longer exists, the person who does that job will be made redundant. If the job has ceased to exist, the person will not be replaced and there is no need for the former worker to lose the house. It is simple for the hunt managers to convert the tied tenancy into a secure tenancy.

I hope that he will continue to reflect on those that he has not yet accepted. I am sure that the convener and other members of the committee will press those points during the debate.</p><p>The bill will make it simpler and more effective for members of the public to make complaints about maladministration in the public sector. However, we need to be clear that a public sector ombudsman will not be a panacea and will not solve all the problems that the public have with public services. Although it is right and proper that we publicise the service as much as possible when it comes into being, we must also make it very clear that the ombudsman cannot solve problems that do not fit within the parameters of maladministration.</p><p>For many, one of the frustrations of the present system is that their complaints do not seem to fit into any category. We must consider that matter outwith the bill. Although I welcome the commitment to publicise the new service when the bill is enacted, we must be careful not to raise hopes that the service will do what it simply cannot do. I was struck by evidence that only something like 8 per cent of all the complaints that go to the present ombudsmen are dealt with. That means that a substantial number of complaints are not resolved in the ombudsman service. Although it is right that we have a single framework and that we publicise it, I do not want anybody to get the impression that any problem that they take to the ombudsman will be resolved, because the parameters for the ombudsman's work will still be defined within maladministration.</p><p>I was disappointed that the minister did not accept the need for amendments to the bill to safeguard and enhance the ombudsman's ability to resolve dispute by informal measures and means. I hope that the minister will reconsider. I was certainly persuaded by the evidence that the committee heard that informal resolution is sometimes better than formal resolution. I understand what the minister is saying, but there will be opportunities at stage 2 to lodge an amendment that will meet those concerns.</p><p>I am still not persuaded that the water authorities should not be brought within the scope of the bill. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities gave evidence to that effect. I hope that the minister will reconsider that issue during the passage of the bill. If he does not, concern will be expressed in the future about the water authorities not being included. Water is, and will continue to be, a vital public service.<place-holder colnum=\"5931\"/></p><p>I turn to the question of the consistency of the range of investigative powers that are included in the bill. At the moment, the Executive continues to allow the NHS ombudsman to have greater powers to investigate judgments as opposed to maladministration. The bill gives an opportunity to widen the range of powers. If we are to have a public services ombudsman, it will be helpful for the ombudsman's range of powers to be consistent. The committee felt strongly that the Executive should consider amending the bill to extend the range of investigative powers so that they are consistent across all authorities.</p><p>I will move on to a matter that arose in the evidence that was given to the committee. The Scottish parliamentary commissioner for administration expressed concern about the present ombudsman staff. He was not persuaded that the bill conforms to the code of practice for staff transfers in the public sector. When the minister appeared before the committee, he gave an assurance that the code of practice and the guidelines would be met and that staff would be protected at transfer. I am not persuaded that that is the case. I hope that the minister will examine the situation to ensure that staff will not be disadvantaged.</p><p>I thank the minister for his positive response to some of the committee's report. I am sure that several amendments will be lodged at stage 2&#8212;he is committed to lodging some, but there will be others. All members want the bill to work and want the new office to work well. However, members will lodge amendments to make the bill work better.</p><p>I hope that the minister will reflect positively on the comments that were made in the report. I hope that he will not give the usual Executive knee-jerk reaction of rejecting amendments that it does not want. I ask the minister to examine carefully and reflect on some of the amendments that will be lodged. The Scottish public sector ombudsman should be allowed to gain the trust of the people of Scotland.

Some &#163;6 billion has been made available to Scotland through structural funds.

It is unfortunate, to say the least, that successive Tory and Labour Governments have not provided the necessary match funding to allow our country to access European money. Significant improvements to our nation's infrastructure that could have been put in place remain unmade. The Executive was also responsible for losing objective 1 status for the Highlands and Islands.

First, rather than being inward looking, we must take an outward-looking, European viewpoint. New European regional policy will be based on the lessons of the past. As one of the main beneficiaries of EU funding, Scotland can make a valuable contribution to the debate. Securing regional assistance for our own areas will present some difficulties. However, securing such funding will be possible only if we are involved in discussing the mechanisms by which that funding will be distributed. If we want to argue that funding should be allocated on social criteria, the case will have to be made for using a different statistical approach. If we want to make Scotland's case on geographic criteria, we must start to make common cause, and find common ground, with neighbours such as Sweden and Finland.</p><p>We must do three things. First, we must acknowledge that changes to European politics mean that we will face a significant drop in EU funding. Secondly, we must take an honest, rather than a self-congratulatory, look at the way in which we spend what remains of the current round of funding. That means that we must concentrate on sustainability as we ready our economy to be in the leading EU 15. Thirdly, and perhaps most important, we must engage Scotland in the European debate.

The bill is designed to allow people to get married in a greater variety of places than they can at the moment. Of course, as I think the minister said, marriage should be a happy occasion and it is only right that people should be able to choose where they get married. That said, no one can pretend that this is a particularly happy debate; indeed, it is a bit boring. Judging by the small number of people in the chamber, I believe that people may wonder what the bill has to do with their lives.</p><p>The fact is that the bill has the potential to make a special day an even happier day in the lives of many couples. On behalf of the Scottish National Party, I am pleased to support the general intentions behind the bill.</p><p>At the moment, there are clear restrictions on where people can marry. In too many cases, the choice comes down to one between faith and location. In a truly pluralist and multicultural society, the idea that a couple's lack of religious <place-holder colnum=\"5553\"/> belief should limit their choice of where they can be married is outdated. When almost a third of people who got married in a religious ceremony would have preferred to have a civil ceremony if a suitable location had been available, it is clearly time for change.</p><p>That is why the SNP has no hesitation in supporting the aims of the bill. However, we have considerable reservations about the mechanisms and the specific proposals in the bill and regulations. I will make two points on that.</p><p>First, I return to a theme that I mentioned earlier: the use of secondary rather than primary legislation to hoard power, which limits the ability to make necessary amendments at stage 2. It is fundamentally wrong that, when we consider a bill, its important aspects are hidden away in secondary legislation. Although I accept the minister's assurances that the secondary legislation will be subject to the affirmative procedure, I do not think that that is the same as the committees having the opportunity at stages 1 and 2 to give the bill the scrutiny that it deserves and to amend it.</p><p>That is significant. The Executive shows a pattern of putting more into regulations. The bill is a bad example of that trend. As James Smith of Dumfries and Galloway Council said in evidence to the Local Government Committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We do not want the paternalistic approach that all the regulation and guidance represents.</p><p class=\"indent\">Government officials should not issue guidance on matters that are way outwith their remit.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Local Government Committee</i>, 27 November 2001; c 2421.]</p><p>To put it bluntly, the approach is incorrect. Matters of a constant nature, such as the appeals procedure, should be contained in primary legislation. That is also the opinion of the Subordinate Legislation Committee, whose opinion is that the bill does not strike the right balance between primary and secondary legislation.</p><p>That was reflected also in the Local Government Committee's consideration of the bill. So many of the powers of the bill are exercised through secondary legislation that it was felt necessary for the committee to examine the draft regulations which, technically, are not part of what we should have considered. It was a useful exercise, not least in highlighting the dangers of the Executive reserving so much power by means of secondary legislation.</p><p>If I recall correctly, the minister talked about \"seemly and dignified\" venues and said that the phrase would not be subject to amendment in the regulations. There was considerable and widespread concern about matters such as the <place-holder colnum=\"5554\"/> definition of seemly and dignified venues. The Executive's wish to retain that phrase in the subordinate legislation and regulations means, in effect, that there is no opportunity to amend it at stage 2. That is wrong. I ask the minister to go back and think again. The Equal Opportunities Committee, other committees of the Parliament and individuals are concerned about the wording.</p><p>There is a considerable body of opinion, including in local government, that says that the approach that has been taken in the bill is incorrect. It has been widely suggested that to use the existing expertise and resources of civic government licensing would be more efficient and cost-effective than setting up a separate framework to regulate the places in which marriages may take place. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities favoured that model and outlined how it might be done. Dumfries and Galloway Council&#8212;which conducts one in four of Scotland's marriages thanks to Gretna Green and the success of the tourism industry there, which brings people from all over Scotland and elsewhere to be married&#8212;has outlined how amending the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 would achieve that. It indicated that a minimal amount of legislation would be required if that alternative route was used.</p><p>I am pleased to be able to support the policy intention of the bill. I note what the minister said about amendments. I am disappointed that he seems to be suggesting that the Executive will continue down the road of regulations, thereby limiting amendments at stage 2. I am also concerned about the mechanisms by which the Executive is attempting to achieve the policy intentions of the bill. All members support those policy intentions, but we are concerned about the mechanisms. We believe that the Executive has made the bill unnecessarily complicated and has not taken the right route.</p><p>I ask the Executive to reconsider seriously its position on amending the bill and the regulatory framework before it comes back to the committee at stage 2. I also ask the Executive to consider carefully how the policy aims of the bill, which we all support, could be better achieved.</p>", "hdate": "2002-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13264796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There will be a degree of difficulty in reaching seven minutes, Deputy Presiding Officer.

That is a great concern.</p><p>On the outcome of a decision such as is suggested, the council says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is considered likely that Fife's needs would be subsumed into a city dominated agenda. The regeneration issues which are socio-economically and geographically central to Fife would be peripheral to the new strategic planning areas. Locally-significant concentrations of deprivation and exclusion would require to compete for resources with deprived areas outside Fife. There is deep and universal concern amongst communities in Fife that they would be swallowed up in such a larger planning overview, contrary to the principles of subsidiarity.\"</p><p>It is important to recognise, as Marilyn Livingstone and Iain Smith said, that Fife Council has the same boundaries as all its strategic partners: Scottish Enterprise Fife, Fife NHS Board and the Kingdom of Fife Tourist Board. Those are the circumstances in which Fife can develop its services, and they must continue to apply. The very idea that Fife may be split up and subsumed into two strategic planning authorities in Dundee and Edinburgh, with the wee bit in the middle just left to rot, is totally and absolutely unacceptable. I think that the minister is getting a flavour of the debate, and we hope that she will come forward with something positive at the end of it.</p><p>We also need to consider the fact that Fife is one of the largest local authorities in Scotland in terms of population. Indeed, Fife is greater in population than either Dundee City or the City of Edinburgh. Given that, it makes sense for Fife to remain a large unit.</p><p>Marilyn Livingstone raised the matter of the Rosyth ferry.

I believe that someone who is opposed to the bill should simply vote against the Executive motion. As a result, Tommy's amendment is unnecessary and the SNP will not be supporting it.</p><p>The Executive believes that the bill will increase the turnout at local elections. That is no doubt true, as parliamentary elections currently attract larger turnouts. However, such turnouts will not confer any additional democratic legitimacy on local government. Confronted with an additional ballot paper in the polling booth, most people will simply fill it in not out of an interest in the affairs or the remit of local government, but because that is the most obvious thing to do with another ballot paper in the polling booth.</p><p>The serious flaw in the Executive's argument is its naive suggestion that an artificially inflated turnout provides an increased mandate for local government. It is quite clear that the reverse is true, and that will have a cost in the form of a democratic loss for the very local authorities for whom the bill is intended. The local agenda will be overshadowed and overtaken by the coverage of national elections. No member of this chamber could seriously argue that local authority issues will even surface, far less be given a decent hearing, in the press m&#234;l&#233;e of the parliamentary election campaign. Councillors will not be able to make their case for election or re-election as they will be completely displaced from the agenda by MSPs seeking to make their case.</p><p>I make no apologies for returning to the Kerley report, although I know that members will find that uncomfortable. The report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"However, the higher turnout could not be claimed as an increased democratic mandate for local government ... In fact, coincident elections would tend to reduce the electorate's focus on local government issues. Conversely, separate elections would ensure that local government issues are at the heart of local government elections: this seems to us an essential part of democracy and democratic renewal.\"<place-holder colnum=\"5032\"/></p><p>I see from press reports that the Executive parties are consulting on all the Kerley recommendations. It is a pity that they did not take note of his comments on coincident elections.</p><p>The situation faces further confusion in 2003 with the prospect of a referendum on the euro being held on the same day as other elections. It is absurd for three totally different agendas to be considered in the same election campaign. Will national politics and personalities, the on-going question of the euro or local councillors and other municipal matters head the list of press priorities? As for the national agenda, local government will be relegated to the back burner and the gas simply turned off. This bill will diminish the local agenda and undermine local democracy; it is corrosive to the democratic legitimacy of our councils.</p><p>I want to address one further point to the Liberal Democrat members of the coalition. The logical time for local government elections is the midpoint of the Scottish Parliament session. If the Liberal Democrats are so confident that they will deliver PR for local government elections, why on earth are they supporting this bill, which could delay the implementation of PR until 2007 when it could reasonably be introduced for elections in 2005?</p><p>I see that Mr Rumbles is rumbling.</p>", "hdate": "2001-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13263277", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although the bill contains a number of sensible proposals for piloting projects that try to encourage greater electoral participation, any good intention is completely undermined by the main principle of the bill&#8212;to hold council elections on the same day as parliamentary elections.

There is no doubt that the Parliament needs more powers, but the powers that we require should not be taken from councils.

Our Parliament is a national Parliament. Scotland is a nation. Contained within that nation are regions. It is right and proper that those who are elected at regional level should be represented on the Committee of the Regions. We have a tier of local authorities and it is logical that councillors are best placed constitutionally to provide regional representation.</p><p>As Iain Smith said, our parliamentary representatives are national representatives. It follows that this Parliament should be represented at national level within Europe. This Parliament's focus should be on representation on the Council of Ministers.

That was a year and a half ago and now we have an admission that not much has happened during that period. When the Liberal Democrats were confronted with the decision whether to support the third First Minister, did Jim Wallace, the bold Liberal leader, stand up for his party and his principles? Did he stand up to demand an end to cronyism and the one-party domination that, in the words of Ken Richie of the Electoral Reform Society, encourages</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a political culture in which there is a danger of councils and councillors becoming arrogant, aloof and detached\"?</p><p>Even Jim Wallace said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We must not underestimate the self-interested resistance from those fiefdoms which will be challenged by a fair voting system.\"</p><p>What hard-nosed bargain was the tough negotiator, Mr Wallace, able to extract from the new First Minster?

However, poodles bark&#8212;sometimes&#8212;and the problem in the Scottish Parliament is that the Liberals are Labour's lapdogs: they have no bark, no bite and no backbone.</p><p>It is frustration with that utter lack of progress that forced me to lodge a bill on PR, proposing the STV system. The Fairshare campaign and the Electoral Reform Society support both my bill and the STV system. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many dedicated members of all political parties who work tirelessly to advance the campaign for a fair voting system, some of whom have joined us in the public gallery today.</p><p>The events of the past few weeks have shone a light into the dark corners of Labour's crony networks. The networks of influence and cronyism <place-holder colnum=\"4305\"/> have begun to be exposed, from the legal firms that rent office space to the job creation schemes for Labour friends such as Esther Roberton. As the answer to a written parliamentary question lodged by David McLetchie showed, of those appointed under the public appointments system since 2000, 75 per cent who declared a party connection were members of the Labour party. It is no wonder that Angus MacKay was sacked this week&#8212;imagine a Labour minister letting that little gem into the public domain.</p><p>The Parliament can clear up Labour's midden by doing two things. First, it can support Alex Neil's bill, which would give the Parliament power to scrutinise public appointments. Secondly, it can introduce fair voting for local government elections.</p><p>It is appropriate for me to acknowledge at this point the many councillors in Scotland who want only to serve their communities and who put in long hours for little reward, beyond the satisfaction of doing their best for the communities and people whom they represent.</p><p>A fair voting system would remove the unhealthy taint that Scottish local government has unfairly earned from the worst of Labour's rotten boroughs. It would restore public confidence and public interest in local government. Because a fair voting system would eliminate the wasted-vote syndrome, it is the single biggest step that could improve turnout. STV, which uses multimember wards, would retain the member-ward link. In England and Wales, 80 per cent of wards are already multimember. Northern Ireland already has PR.

No one argues that the party that gains the majority of votes in an election should not have the majority of the seats on a council. However, it is quite unacceptable that a party that has gained only 46 per cent of the <place-holder colnum=\"4306\"/> vote should have 95 per cent of the seats. In the elections for Dundee City Council and East Ayrshire Council, the SNP polled more votes than the Labour party but ended up with fewer seats.</p><p>A fair voting system in local government is now imperative. This autumn, the genie of Labour cronyism has been let out of the bottle and will not go back in. That cronyism is corrosive to democracy and poisonous to society. In the eyes of the people of Scotland, it undermines the work not only of the local authorities but of the whole political process. It is now imperative that the Parliament acts decisively and quickly. The universally agreed way to do that is to end the one-party states and destroy the fiefdoms by delivering a fair voting system for local government.</p><p>Let me turn to the fig leaf&#8212;sorry, the amendment. The amendment does not advance the case for a fair voting system but merely allows the Liberals and the Executive to pretend that something is happening. It is widely speculated that the Liberals are looking for an excuse to parachute out of the coalition so that they are free to fight the 2003 elections as though they were independent of Labour. The Liberal Democrats are complicit in engineering the lack of progress on PR to give them just that excuse. If the Liberals want to play fast and loose with their principles and with the expectations of their supporters, so be it. However, they should not expect the rest of Scotland to sit back and accept the cynicism of a party that, like its coalition partner, puts narrow party interest above the interests of Scotland's democracy.</p><p>Let me end on this note: a fair voting system for local government elections is supported by a majority of the supporters of each party in the Parliament. Contrary to Mike Rumbles's view, I believe that a majority of members in the chamber would, in a genuinely free vote, support such a system for local government in Scotland. The new First Minister, Jack McConnell, spoke about the need to deliver on the people's priorities. Fair voting is one of the people's priorities and a democratic imperative.

We have known each other for a long time in different roles and I am sure that he will bring to the job his commitment to and passion for health and social inclusion issues.</p><p>In the policy memorandum, it is made clear that most of the bill's provisions will have an impact on local government because of local government's central role in delivering social services. I am surprised and disappointed that I am the only member of the Local Government Committee who will speak in today's debate. The Local Government Committee took evidence and fed in to the Health and Community Care Committee's report. Local authorities expressed a number of concerns in that evidence. The minister acknowledged that there are challenges for local authorities in the bill in respect of joint working and resources in particular. I will perhaps address that later.</p><p>My colleague Nicola Sturgeon addressed the need for a definition of personal care within the bill. The Local Government Committee also felt strongly that there should be such a definition and the social work directors of Perth and Kinross Council and South Ayrshire Council indicated in their evidence to the committee that there should be a base-line definition of personal care on the face of the bill. I welcome the minister's commitment to introduce an amendment at stage 2, because it would be quite unacceptable if such an important piece of legislation gave to present and future ministers the power to determine by regulation what personal care is. We cannot allow personal care to be a political football that is juggled between health and finance ministers, who will decide by regulation from year to year what constitutes personal care and what does not. Decisions should be made based on what the patient needs, rather than on what can be trimmed to accommodate the budget of the day. I welcome the assurances that the minister has given.</p><p>An issue&#8212;which is not directly related to the bill and therefore cannot be removed by amendment&#8212;that came up in the Local Government Committee is the problem of dual financial assessments. Those assessments will be <place-holder colnum=\"4245\"/> required as a result of the different levels of capital assessment for income support and for home care. It is absolute nonsense that we should even consider putting elderly and vulnerable people and their families through two different assessments. Not only will that lead to increased stress and confusion, it will&#8212;to be frank&#8212;be a bureaucratic mess.</p><p>Although I acknowledge that benefits and income support are a reserved matter, I would like the Executive to consider with colleagues in Westminster the possibility of a single assessment procedure. I would welcome an assurance from the minister that he will take forward that suggestion as a matter of great urgency.</p><p>Local authorities will be pivotal in delivering the social work services and as many members have said, joint working will present many challenges to the culture, management, structures and accountability of local authorities and health boards. The Local Government Committee heard evidence of good practice out there, but we need to ensure that that good practice is the minimum that is required in joint working.</p><p>My view is that much more work needs to be done before we can be confident that joint working arrangements are flexible and secure enough to ensure that the person who needs the service gets the service. We need to stop the turf wars that take place between health boards and local authorities.</p><p>Local authorities are also concerned about the resource implications of aspects of the bill. It is vital that the necessary resources are provided to ensure that the bill has the opportunity to make the difference that we know it can make.</p><p>The bill will be better when it is amended, but it must not be allowed to fail simply because there is not sufficient money to support it. I give a warm welcome to the bill and the amendments that the Minister for Health and Community Care said that he would lodge. However, it is vital to local authorities and health boards that the resources that are needed to fund the bill are put in place and that they work for the benefit of the people who need the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2001-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13261190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Care and Health (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Malcolm Chisholm on his appointment.

It says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Although unitary police authorities could use their 'general funds' to carry forward unspent police grant, a re-determination of that grant ... would require the repayment of any unspent grant.

I hope that he will not allow unitary authorities to be under a different regime from that governing the joint boards. We have only two unitary authorities in Scotland: Fife Council&#8212;my area&#8212;and Dumfries and Galloway Council.

It is a nice coincidence that they are visiting today when we are discussing the Police and Fire Services (Scotland) Bill. I am certain that they will find the proceedings of great interest, even though the two unitary authorities, Fife and Dumfries and Galloway, are not covered by the legislation insofar as it relates to the carry-forward of unspent requisitions.</p><p>The bill is a sensible measure that will allow police and fire authorities to carry forward working balances from one financial year to the next. It offers greater flexibility and more prudent financial planning and, as the minister said, it will stop the rush to spend as the end of the year approaches. The SNP supports the general principles of the bill.</p><p>I am pleased that the general principles of the bill command support throughout the public service spectrum. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has welcomed the principles of the bill because of the greater financial flexibility it offers; the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland has stated that the bill would enhance significantly the efficient use of resources; and the Accounts Commission for Scotland believes that the bill will be helpful in assisting police and fire brigades to deliver better value for money.</p><p>As the minister outlined, there are a number of concerns about the bill. I am grateful that the <place-holder colnum=\"2975\"/> minister has suggested, at an early stage in the debate, that he is willing to consider amendments at stage 2. It is important that during the debate we run through the reasons why many members feel that some parts of the bill need to be examined.</p><p>The first concern is about ministerial approval for carrying forward working balances. Local councils do not require ministerial approval to carry forward their working balances and we believe that police and fire boards should have the same flexibility as local councils. We do not believe that additional bureaucracy and control is necessary and we do not understand why it is necessary to exercise ministerial control over the amounts in question, which will be modest. The minister indicated that ministerial approval will be dealt with by informal arrangement. If that is so, most of us are at a loss to understand why that informal arrangement must be enshrined in legislation. That control is unnecessary and it will undermine the modest provisions of the bill.</p><p>Of greater concern is the requirement that joint police or fire boards have approval from all the constituent authorities to carry forward the underspent money. I am grateful that the minister has already acknowledged that that will be subject to amendment. Chief Constable Rae of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland highlighted his concerns about what would happen if one constituent authority refused to allow the carry-forward:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is difficult for me to say that I will not send as many police officers to an incident because that authority has withheld a proportion of the budget.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government Committee</em>, 4 September 2001; c 2152.]</p><p>That perhaps explains why there is concern and why we are grateful that the minister has indicated that that proposal will be amended at stage 2. COSLA believes that the proposal would undermine the basis of the current relationship between joint boards and the constituent members.</p><p>It is appropriate to mention the democratic legitimacy of the joint boards. They comprise, after all, elected councillors and have been a standing feature of Scottish local government for many years. They must be free to determine their priorities, not just from the perspective of one authority, but from the strategic perspective of all the areas that they cover.</p><p>It would be a matter of regret if amendments were not to be lodged that prevented that legitimacy from being undermined. That might also lead to delay and set council against council to no great purpose. In any event, the local authorities would take action to ensure that any joint police board or fire board that was building up unreasonable reserves would make the necessary <place-holder colnum=\"2976\"/> adjustments during the normal budgetary procedure. That is how the situation should be.</p><p>I confess to having no strong opinion at this point on whether an upper limit of 3 per cent should be placed on the carry-forward. COSLA believes that the joint boards should decide the percentage of carry-forward by a normal consultative process with the joint bodies. Representatives from the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association have expressed concern that the figure seems to have been plucked from thin air.</p><p>I will now speak on an issue that is not specific to the bill&#8212;pensions. The intention behind the bill is laudable. It has found support throughout the public sector. However, the reality is that the benefits of the bill will not be felt for some time, because any underspends are currently used to fund the pensions of the fire service. On that point, Tim Stone of COSLA said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A major problem with the increasing cost of fire service and police pensions is forthcoming. Those will increase substantially over the next 10 years and will somehow have to be funded. I suggest that that cannot be dealt with using the reserves with which the bill is concerned.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government Committee</em>, 4 September 2001; c 2141.]</p><p>Although the bill will have a modest effect on underspends in the future, the reality is that it is terribly academic in the medium term until such time as police and fire pensions are dealt with. I urge ministers to address that matter with some urgency. All the representations that I have received indicate a belief that there is a time bomb under the pension schemes for the police and fire services in Scotland. I urge the minister to go away, think about that and find out whether we can put in place a better system.</p><p>The principles of the bill are welcome. A number of issues should be addressed by amendments at stage 2. However, we need sufficient funding and resources for pensions in the first place. I congratulate the minister on the bill. It is modest, but it will make a real difference to the police and fire services in Scotland.

Alex Fergusson's amendment adds nothing to the debate. It was lodged to maximise the speaking time for members of the committee who have already spent 18 months delaying the debate in the Parliament. Elaine Murray's amendment, I am afraid to say, is confused. It is not an alternative to the bill. It is designed to kick the bill into touch.</p><p>It is no secret that I have had concerns about the wording of the bill&#8212;not because I disagreed with its aims or intentions, but because I feared that the apologists for hunting would use the imperfect drafting to tell lies, misinform and mislead. And so it came to pass&#8212;including the lie that someone out walking, whose dog chased a rabbit, would be liable to prosecution. It was hardly surprising that it was Mr George Lyon who raised that point today.</p><p>The bill has three aims: to ban mounted fox hunts, to ban hare coursing and to ban fox baiting. When we discuss the general principles of the bill, it is incumbent on the committee members to pay attention to what the member thinks are the general principles instead of making them up to suit their own conclusions. Mike Watson's final submission said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The first principle of my bill is to ban mounted fox hunting ...The second principle of my bill is stop hare coursing ...The third principle of my Bill is to ban fox-baiting\".</p><p>The Scottish Countryside Alliance paid Jack Irvine and Media House &#163;250,000 to halt or significantly water down Mike Watson's bill. Let me quote from Media House's chilling account of how it set about doing that:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"By providing the media with the 'sticks' with which to 'beat' the new Parliament we were able to capture the agenda and find a voice for pro-hunt arguments. An early <place-holder colnum=\"2606\"/> tactical decision was made not to address the issue of animal rights head on ... The SCA have been positioned as a formidable political force in Scotland and the delayed Bill is dogged with controversy. The conduct of the presenting member is in question\".</p><p>The Duke of Buccleuch and David McLetchie said that the Scottish Parliament should concentrate on matters other than fox hunting.

I also pay tribute to Joe Paterson, the former Scottish National Party councillor who has been responsible for compiling the memorial book to all the men who have been killed in the Fife pits.</p><p>I speak as one whose grandfather was killed in one of the Fife pits, as the daughter of one who was invalided out of the pits and the sister of a miner who was sacked from Seafield at the time of the strike. The Donibristle disaster of 26 August 1901 is etched deep into the psyches of all of us who were born and brought up in Cowdenbeath, including my good friend Dennis Canavan. All of us who come from mining communities lived with the mining disaster and the tales of our fathers and grandfathers.</p><p>It is true that the heroism that was displayed in the Donibristle disaster was way beyond what any community could have expected. It is also significant that that heroism was rewarded with gold watches from a newspaper but that the same people received no reward from the establishment of the day. That probably indicates how little regard the establishment had for the mining communities.</p><p>The Donibristle disaster led indirectly to the setting up of the mine rescue service 11 years later. That was set up in Stenhouse Street in Cowdenbeath. Dennis Canavan knows it as well as I do.</p><p>It was a privilege and pleasure to be at the ceremony in Trinity church in Cowdenbeath. I saw miners, ex-miners and their families coming from all over Scotland, Yorkshire and beyond simply to <place-holder colnum=\"2397\"/> pay tribute to the many brave men of the disaster.</p><p>Of all of the brave men, I will single out one&#8212;Robert Law. After people were trapped and when almost all hope was gone, Robert Law went down and led out some of the rescuers and other men who were abandoned in the pit. After Robert Law brought out the last of those men, there were still eight men trapped in the pit. Their bodies were recovered, as Helen Eadie rightly said, some months later. From the stories that I heard when I was young, it was not a quick or easy death. The fate of the men in the pit can only be imagined. It was quite horrible.</p><p>I accept that we should pay tribute not just to the miners of Fife but to the miners throughout Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom who died to build the communities that we know. It is about time that we gave something back. Fife, like many other areas, was built on the back of the miners. The prosperity that we enjoyed for many years was built on the work of the miners.</p><p>It is appalling that, after all this time and when we have only one deep mine in Scotland, there is no lasting memorial to the miners of Fife and that it is almost impossible for the miners of Fife to get the money necessary to build a heritage centre. We need to remember who we are and where we have come from. If we do not remember that, we will have no idea about where we should be going in future. I urge the minister&#8212;he is the minister with responsibility for culture&#8212;to give, in his closing speech, some hope to the ex-miners of Fife that their relics and artefacts will be preserved for eternity.</p><p>I finish by welcoming those visitors in the gallery who have come from Fife.

MSPs from all parties have highlighted the increasing importance of lottery funding to communities throughout Scotland and the Government's increasing reliance on lottery funding to deliver its policy objectives. The SNP will support the Conservative amendment.</p><p>The stated aims of the new opportunities fund are to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to encourage community participation. It was good to hear members highlighting the awards in their areas, but I am sure that Cathy Jamieson will forgive me if I do not take up her invitation to jump into the open-air swimming pool, however warm it might be this summer.</p><p>The projects that the new opportunities fund is tackling and prioritising are in health and education and include out-of-school learning and child care. The projects in the new round of funding include drug support, palliative care, sport and schools. All those projects are welcome and all are devolved matters.</p><p>The new opportunities fund projects are meant to complement the national and local strategies. As many members have said, the new opportunities fund has no Scottish committee to provide a focus or to decide on Scottish allocations. The SNP agrees with the SCVO, which said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"SCVO would like to record its continued view that all decisions about the Scottish proportion of the New <place-holder colnum=\"2164\"/> Opportunities Fund should be the subject of scrutiny by the Scottish Parliament after wide consultation in Scotland\".</p><p>Elaine Murray said that the SCVO briefing had a fairly nationalistic tone. That notion would be rather bizarre to the authors of the briefing paper and I refer her to the report itself.</p><p>Elaine Murray also mentioned additionality as a concern. Donald Gorrie said that the current system is not working. I will return to that later. Ian Jenkins said that we should look at some of the problems.</p><p>Despite all the welcome news and the individual projects throughout the country that members have highlighted, the current system is failing in some areas and the basic aims of the new opportunities fund are not being met.</p><p>I will expand on the point that I made to the minister. Some of the most deprived areas in Fife&#8212;the ex-mining communities&#8212;have missed out completely. Not a penny has gone to Kirkcaldy, Levenmouth, Cowdenbeath, Methil or north-east Fife. There is not insufficient funding; money is simply not being accessed. I welcome the minister's comment that that issue has been considered and I would like him to expand on that when he sums up.</p><p>The Parliament has no role to scrutinise or oversee the new opportunities fund. We cannot find out why in some areas new opportunities fund money is being accessed and organisations are receiving it while other areas are simply losing out.</p><p>Robert Brown delivered a well-argued speech, which deserves further consideration. He made several valuable points. As I said, there is a problem with the new opportunities fund in some areas. Perhaps that is owing to lack of publicity or lack of support and assistance from the local authority. We must examine the new opportunities fund to find out where the problems are. That can be achieved only if this Parliament examines the matter, but it has no remit to do so. That is a failing.</p><p>The Parliament should rise to the challenges of the new opportunities fund. This is a useful first debate, but we must have more debates on the matter. There must be greater scrutiny in the Parliament about where the funding is going. More consideration must be given to the priority areas, which should be decided here in Scotland. We should not shy away from our responsibilities. It is our obligation to say that we know that there is a problem and that we want to provide a solution. The problem can best be addressed by this Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255906", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Opportunities Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been useful and informative.

In England, housing has to meet a fitness standard, which, in terms of quality, is set far higher than the standard that we have in Scotland. In October 1997, Malcolm Chisholm, when he was the Scottish Office minister with responsibility for housing, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is clear that too many people in Scotland still live in poor housing conditions. ...

A Scottish Office consultation was concluded in 1998. Since then, there has been barely a cheep from the Executive about what it intends to do with the responses that it received to the consultation document. Indeed, it was clear at stage 2 that the Executive still does not intend to act on the tolerable standard in Scotland. It prefers to kick the whole matter into touch with the housing improvement task force and an index of housing quality.</p><p>The tolerable standard is, and should remain, a minimum standard below which no house should fall. It is not an aspirational standard that sets the optimum housing standards, nor should it be. The minimum standard has three purposes, as the Scottish Office outlined in its 1997 consultation paper: to identify defects that unless remedied could result in the loss of the house to the housing stock; to identify issues of health and safety of the occupants; and to target resources. I agree with those three purposes. In its report, the committee recommended that a wider definition of tolerable standard be introduced.</p><p>Amendments 10 and 11 are very modest and do no more than adopt the English fitness standard, which is under review. The wording of my amendments was chosen with great care.

The minister has the opportunity to do something now. The matter has needed to be addressed for many years. It is no great secret that the homelessness task force will seek to recommend amendments that are similar to my amendments and I see no reason for further delay. Indeed, the Social Justice Committee recommended at stage 1 to extend categories of priority need to include single young women who have been abused, people who have institutional or care backgrounds, and all 16 or 17-year-olds. My amendments seek to do those things.</p><p>Amendment 2 concerns young people between the ages of 16 and 18. It is astonishing that the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 accepts that all young people under the age of 18 are children and are therefore vulnerable, but that a number of other pieces of legislation&#8212;including homelessness legislation&#8212;and now the Housing (Scotland) Bill do not accept that young people under the age of 18 are vulnerable by virtue of their age. It seems contradictory that the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 accepts that people under 18 are children, but that proposed homelessness legislation does not. We all recognise how vulnerable young people are. We need to give them support and I urge members to reject the minister's advice and make a commitment to young people&#8212;particularly to 16 to 18-year-olds who might end up on the streets with very little support from local authorities.</p><p>I will deal with amendment 3 very briefly. Amendment 3 seeks to give priority need to those who have left care institutions, other institutions and the armed services. Currently, those people have no priority under homelessness legislation, despite the fact that research shows that people who leave the armed forces are more than likely to end up on the streets. We have a duty to support them.</p><p>Amendments 4 and 5 deal with violence and the fear of violence. They are particularly relevant to this Parliament and to the support that it can give to women who are trying to flee from domestic violence, and to people who are in fear of violence, which is generally external violence that is perpetrated against them. Many people leave their houses because of the fear of violence. Unless we accept that they have priority need, we will not be able to address their problems.</p><p>Finally, I acknowledge that local authorities must have regard to the present code of guidance. <place-holder colnum=\"1321\"/></p><p>However, having regard to a code of guidance is not the same as adhering to statutory rights. The amendments seek to give very vulnerable people statutory rights. At the moment, not only are there postcode waiting lists in Scotland, but there is postcode treatment of homeless people. The code of guidance is merely guidance and has no statutory force. Unless local authorities act in concert throughout Scotland, people in parts of Scotland will be treated differently from those in other parts. That is why we need statutory rights, rather than codes of guidance.</p><p>I urge members to support amendments 2, 3, 4 and 5.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13253688", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 3 &#8212; Homeless persons and persons threatened with homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Amendments 2, 3, 4 and 5 all seek to extend   priority need categories.

By so doing, we hope to reassure the people of Scotland that their new Parliament will not be afflicted by sleaze and corruption. Rather, members are bound by the key principles of the code of conduct, which set the tone for the relationship between members and those whom they represent.</p><p>We believe that the proposals strike a balance between ensuring that complaints are dealt with in a rigorous and transparent manner and making certain that members are not unjustifiably exposed to malicious or ill-founded complaints. In short, we aim to ensure that complainer and member alike can be confident that they are being treated fairly and justly.<place-holder colnum=\"916\"/></p><p>I want to pick up on some of the key elements of the proposals. First, the bill will contain powers to enable the commissioner to summon witnesses and to compel the production of documentary evidence. Those powers will underpin the independence of the post, and that independence will be a critical guarantor of the confidence of the Scottish people and of members of Parliament in the complaints process.</p><p>Secondly, I want to highlight the commissioner's relationship with the committee and with the Parliament. As Mike Rumbles explained earlier, the commissioner will be responsible for carrying out investigations in private and independently of the Standards Committee. However, the committee will continue to be responsible for recommending whether the sanctions that are set out in rule 6.5 of the standing orders are appropriate. The commissioner's role will be restricted to a consideration of and decision on the facts of each complaint. It will be for the committee to scrutinise the commissioner's findings and to make the appropriate recommendations to the Parliament.</p><p>Thirdly, a decision on whether to impose sanctions on a member who has been found to have breached the code of conduct will be taken at a meeting of the whole Parliament. We believe that that is fundamentally important. It will also give the member the right to come before the Parliament to put his point of view.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I commend to members the proposal for a standards commissioner committee bill. We are convinced that the appointment of a commissioner will be an integral component and demonstrate the Parliament's commitment to ensure that there is the highest order of probity in our affairs. The introduction of legislation to appoint a commissioner will mark another important milestone in our commitment to maintaining and strengthening the public's trust and confidence in the integrity of the Parliament and its members in conducting public business.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13252406", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Standards Commissioner"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add the thanks of committee members to those of Patricia Ferguson for all the support that Sam Jones and Jim Johnston gave us when we were reaching our decisions.

The maisonettes and flat-roof, back-to-front and upside-down houses are all testament to some of the worst examples of municipal architecture&#8212;at election time, canvassers and leafleters find a ball of string an essential campaign tool. However, the new towns also contain some architectural gems. For example, St Paul's Church in Glenrothes, which was designed by Gillespie, Kidd and Coia, has been hailed as a modern-day masterpiece and described as the most significant piece of modern church architecture north of the English channel. I urge <place-holder colnum=\"736\"/> members to visit it.</p><p>There is one area in which Scotland's new towns and Glenrothes in particular, led the way: public art. The beautiful and powerful Benno Schotz sculpture, \"Ex Terra\", was unveiled in 1967. It is a 23ft bronze of a mother and six children, which is designed to represent the growth of a town while recognising where Fife came from and to whom we owed the strength of the community&#8212;the miners who hewed the coal. The sculpture has pride of place at the bus station, where everyone can see it as they come into Glenrothes.</p><p>Glenrothes Development Corporation, with remarkable foresight, appointed the first-ever town artist. Over the years, David Harding and Malcolm Robertson delighted, amazed and amused children and their parents with huge stone creations. Glenrothes was the template for the appointment of town artists in other towns across the UK and beyond. My one regret about the demise of the Glenrothes Development Corporation is the loss of the town artist. I recognise that these are difficult times for local authorities and the arts and that priorities need to be established. However, it cannot be beyond local authorities to encourage the inclusion of a work of public art in medium-scale building developments.</p><p>The legacy of the town artists remains. In every precinct of Glenrothes, there is a piece of public art to admire or to be amused by. The giant blue and yellow irises, which were such a hit at the Glasgow garden festival, were repatriated back to Glenrothes and now nestle among the real spring flowers. There are also the horse and chariot in Caskieberran, the giant hands at Collydean, the chairs and television at Pitcoudie, and the totem poles and the old man and woman having a blether in the town centre. Everywhere there are giant stone mushrooms.</p><p>We all have favourites. I have two. Who could fail to love the family of hippos that inhabits the town park. They amble out from the River Leven to wallow in the paddling pool, sometimes sharing it with the local children. Then there are the poetry slabs, with snatches of verse by some of Scotland's finest poets: Bud Neil's sad tale of wee Josie's skintit nose; and the works of Joe Corrie, the miners' playwright and poet. In passing, let me say that it is beyond time that the arts establishment in Scotland recognised Joe Corrie's enormous contribution to Scottish literature. Corrie was referred to by T S Eliot as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the greatest Scots poet since Burns\",</p><p>yet he is all but forgotten.</p><p>I will wind up with a small snatch from Joe Corrie's \"The Image o' God\", which is etched into <place-holder colnum=\"737\"/> the stone slabs in Glenrothes and into the hearts and minds of miners and their families everywhere.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Crawlin' aboot like a snail in the mud,<br/> Covered wi' clammy blae,<br/> Me, made after the image of God&#8212;<br/> Jings!

That is a dangerous thing to do, because although local authorities are supposed to record every homelessness application, many do not.

In fact, when the district councils came together they adopted the best practice of recording every application to them, which other authorities did not do.

The hoops are that the person must be in priority need&#8212;they are if they have children&#8212;and they are not intentionally homeless.

The Government has ignored the industry's representatives, who have fought not for higher wages but for the future of their industry and their communities. Theirs is a just case. A relatively modest amount of money to support them through a tie-up scheme would have assured a future. In some communities, up to 60 per cent of all employment is fishing related&#8212;there is no other employment.

We have seen the destruction of the mining industry and of the communities that went with it. We know the effect of the pit closures on the strong, independent and proud mining communities. We see the effects today on communities that were dependent on the pits: high unemployment, loss of amenities such as shops and, most critical, loss of hope. Henry McLeish may not have been in a position to save our mining communities, but he is in a position to save our fishing communities and our fishing industry.

Duncan Hamilton made some important points. There are issues that the minister must address in summing up. He must tell us what discussion there has been with his Westminster colleagues. He must also tell us whether there has been discussion with the member who introduced the bill. He must explain the meaning of this statement by Margaret Beckett:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Government is likely to oppose any private Member's bill which seeks to alter the law on devolved subjects in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

That does not take away from the fundamental issues in the bill. We can do both: we can consider the way in which the issue affects people in Scotland and debate a similar Scottish bill.

Support from the devolved body should be informed, rather than based on a half-hour debate. The UK Government has not yet expressed a view on the bill, as the bill's second reading does not take place until 12 February.</p><p>We must ask the minister why the Scottish Executive is in such a hurry to transfer its responsibilities over devolved matters by means of a private member's bill promoted by a back-bench MP who represents an English constituency.

Consensus cannot be assumed, regardless of the proposals on the table.</p><p>As Tom McCabe said, the process of reviewing the committee system began so long ago, and there have been so many changes to the original proposals, that this final proposal has lost sight of what we were trying to achieve. The start of the process was a genuine attempt to make our committee system work more effectively. It was begun in response to concerns from members of all committees. Last October, John McAllion wrote an excellent article, which appeared in <i>The Herald</i>. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are 16 different committees in the Scottish Parliament. Budgetary constraints mean that committee clerks have to double up and serve at least two committees.</p><p class=\"indent\">This not only stretches, but weakens the ability of each committee to establish itself as a power in its own field . . . many MSPs now find themselves having to serve on two committees at the same time. This is an enormous workload in Parliamentary terms and is unheard of in Westminster.\"</p><p>There was unanimity throughout the parties on the need for change.</p><p>The decisions that established our current system were based not on experience, but on a best estimate of how a modern committee system would work in a 129-member Parliament. The committee system was expected to be dynamic, as it has been. The challenge for all members is to ensure that it continues to be.</p><p>It was initially envisaged that the committees would meet once a month and that being on more than one committee would not be an onerous commitment. What was unexpected was the work load of the committees and the dedication of the MSPs to making the committee system the powerhouse of the Parliament. MSPs have been committed to scrutinising legislation, holding <place-holder colnum=\"1085\"/> ministers to account for their departments and actions, conducting investigations and inquiries and submitting legislation. The work load has increased beyond expectation and it is a tribute to the commitment of members to making Scotland more democratic than ever before. Eighteen months on, we know that scrutinising a bill or taking part in an inquiry does not mean one meeting a month; it can mean two or three a week.</p><p>When the review process first started earlier this year, the proposals&#8212;not only on committee numbers&#8212;were radical, as it was proposed that the whole structure of the committee system should be altered. Changes were to be far reaching, with some committees to be combined with others and some to be split, while the remit of some committees was to be absorbed into others. Those proposals found almost universal condemnation within the party groups.</p><p>What we are left with&#8212;after all that time, all those months and all those permutations&#8212;is the proposal to create two justice committees. That is the one proposal that the Scottish National Party has objected to from the outset. The SNP has argued consistently that there should be only one justice committee and that two such committees, with identical remits, would create an inherently unstable situation.</p><p>I accept Tom McCabe's assurances that decisions on what legislation goes to which committee would be decided by the conveners of the two committees. He acknowledges that, when there is a dispute between the two conveners, the bureau, with its built-in Executive majority, would decide which committee the legislation should go to. However, he has not said what would happen if the two committees decided to hold similar inquiries. That is not a matter for the bureau and it is one of the reasons why we are unable to support the proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2000-12-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13241480", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Committee Restructuring"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The SNP has tried hard to achieve consensus on the proposals to restructure the committees.

Organisations and individuals outwith the Parliament might assume <place-holder colnum=\"1086\"/> that the bigger the committee, the greater its importance&#8212;that the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and the Rural Development Committee, with their 11 members each, are more important than the Social Justice Committee or the Education, Culture and Sport Committee. No one in the chamber believes that that is the case, but we must face the fact that that will be the perception. Without a logical reason for the difference in committee sizes, we will be open to a public perception that the priorities of the Parliament are misplaced.</p><p>At the outset of my speech, I underlined the need for reform and the expectation that reform, drawing on the strength of our collective experience, was essential. The procedure to date has involved extensive consultation with all the party groups and has had to take into account 129 different experiences of the working of the parliamentary committee system and 129 different opinions about how that system could work best. Within every group, there have been arguments for and against, with different emphases and focus.</p><p>The fact that there is no unanimity today suggests that we are too tightly bound up with the system and that it is now impossible for us to take an impartial, independent view of what the committee structure and the committee sizes should be. We are all committed to the strong committee system, but we bring to the debate our own perceptions and experience and remain unable to reach universal agreement about how what we want can best be achieved.</p><p>I suggest that consideration be given to an independent review of the committee system&#8212;my colleague Kenny MacAskill will expand on that.

On behalf of the SNP, I recorded my group's objections with the bureau and advised that today I would move an amendment to the business motion.</p><p>The purpose of my amendment is to allow the reports by the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and the Education, Culture and Sport Committee to be debated fully by the Parliament. Last week the Parliament approved a business motion that provided for a debate lasting almost three hours. Today the Parliament is being asked to agree to a motion that would slash an hour off that time. The effect of that would be to deny 15 back-bench members the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the SQA and the exams crisis. If the debate was important enough last week to warrant three hours, it is important enough this week to warrant three hours.</p><p>The Executive will claim&#8212;Tavish Scott already has&#8212;that the SNP motion of no confidence has impacted on the time available for the SQA debate. Let me deal with that charge right now. What has impacted on the time available for the SQA debate is the sheer intransigence of the Executive. The standing orders of the Parliament are clear. When a motion of no confidence has been lodged and has attracted 25 signatures, it must be debated by the Parliament&#8212;no ifs, no buts, no maybes. The role of the Parliamentary Bureau is to find the time for that debate. It was the Executive's business managers who timetabled the two debates to run consecutively this morning.</p><p>As I could not accept that one hour should be slashed from the SQA debate, I offered the business managers two other options. The first was that this morning's business should continue until 1.30 pm, to allow one hour for the debate on the motion of no confidence, which would be followed by the previously agreed three-hour debate on the committees' reports. That offer was turned down. I then suggested that the SQA debate should take place this morning, as originally timetabled, and that the SNP group would give up an hour of its Opposition time on Thursday morning so that the motion of no confidence could be debated. That suggestion was also rejected.</p><p>I do not intend to speak about the debates that will follow. However, we all recognise the work that has been done by the committee conveners, Mary Mulligan and Alex Neil, by the members of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, and by the clerking staff. I pay tribute to them for that. <place-holder colnum=\"836\"/></p><p>They have investigated the debacle of the past year and have made important recommendations for next year's exam process. The Executive has let down the two committees, which have worked tirelessly on behalf of the Parliament to take evidence and to produce their reports. Those reports deserve to be debated properly and thoroughly. According to one commentator, they are reports that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"made this Parliament worth having.\"</p><p>Students, teachers and parents will not understand why the Executive has prevented a full debate today. The message that will go out from the chamber is that the agony and heartbreak of the summer are worth only two hours of the Parliament's time. That is a shameful message. Thousands of young people are relying on the Parliament to make things right for them this year and next year. I say this to the Executive, as gently as I can: by its actions today it has not even begun to put things right.</p><p>I urge members of all parties to support the amendment and to extend the SQA debate until 1.30 pm to allow a proper debate of the issues. The committees and Scotland's young people and teachers deserve no less.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-1457.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and after the 'Education, Culture and Sport Committee and Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee Debate on SQA Inquiries' insert to be concluded at 1.30 pm\".</p>", "hdate": "2000-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13240759", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Business Motion"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yesterday I indicated to the other business managers that I could not support the business motion that is before us today.

It is a substantial report that deals with several complex issues, which I and my colleagues on the committee have enjoyed grappling with. Our thanks go to the committee clerks for their guidance and unfailing good humour.</p><p>Much of the committee's work to date has been about laying the foundations for the future conduct <place-holder colnum=\"315\"/> of Parliament and its members. The recommendation to create the post of independent standards commissioner is another example of that work. I hope that the appointment of a commissioner would emphasise the Parliament's commitment to the highest level of standards in public life&#8212;the public have the right to expect such a commitment. We believe that the report's proposals on the independent and thorough investigation of complaints about members' conduct will go a long way towards convincing the Scottish people of that commitment.</p><p>The report proposes a clear set of investigative procedures, which are fair and robust. The committee recognises that, in the interest of fairness, it is essential that members and the public are fully aware of the procedures that should be followed when investigating complaints.</p><p>It is fair to say that, when the committee started the inquiry, a number of colleagues shared my view that the Standards Committee should continue to investigate complaints on its own. Having dealt with lobbygate, we felt that we had demonstrated the committee's capacity to carry out an investigation thoroughly, speedily and independent of our political affiliations. However, having taken evidence from several witnesses, we accepted that the investigation of complaints could become substantially time consuming and could compromise the committee's other work. We came to the unanimous view that such a proposal was not compatible with our emphasis on the need for an independent element in our investigative model.</p><p>At the same time we were conscious of the committee's remit as prescribed in the Scotland Act 1998 and Parliament's standing orders. The commissioner would therefore report to the Standards Committee and the committee would review the commissioner's conclusions before it decided whether sanctions were appropriate. However, Parliament would make the final decision, on a case-by-case basis, on the extent and duration of any sanctions.</p><p>The Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Members' Interests) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1350) enables Parliament to prevent or restrict a member's participation in proceedings when he or she has failed to register or declare a registrable interest. Certain breaches of the members' interest order on the registration and declaration of interests and paid advocacy could constitute criminal offences. In such cases, the complaint would be referred to the procurator fiscal.</p><p>Members will wish to note that the committee has agreed to conduct a review of the members' interests order. As the first part of that process, we will consult colleagues widely. Members will <place-holder colnum=\"316\"/> receive a consultation paper presently. I urge all members to take time to input into the process, because the members' interest order has an important bearing on us all. It is vital that we understand it fully. The Standards Committee's inquiry is aimed partly at improving its clarity.</p><p>The Standards Committee remains fully committed to developing procedures that reflect the Parliament's commitment to the highest level of probity in our affairs and to fairness for members. I have no doubt that, in recommending the proposals that are set out in our fourth report on the investigation of complaints and the appointment of a standards commissioner, we will add to the previous building blocks that the committee has recommended.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13239237", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Standards Commissioner (Appointment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Mike Rumbles pointed out in his opening speech, the report is the outcome of a major part of the Standards Committee's work over the past nine months.

There has been no question time for two weeks while the Parliament has been in recess. It is more than three weeks since some of the questions in the business bulletin were lodged. Ministers have been running the country; they have been making decisions. An acting First Minister is in place, as Alasdair Morgan said. In view of the impending Cabinet reshuffle, some ministers will not be here next week; therefore, this is the final opportunity to have questions answered before portfolios are shuffled or ministers are dumped.</p><p>Has nothing happened in the past two weeks that has required attention? Are not Nicola Sturgeon and Gordon Jackson entitled to ask the acting First Minister what he has done about the Govan orders? Are no members for the north-east and Inverness entitled to ask about the abandonment of Great North Eastern Railway services north of Edinburgh? Are not Kenny Gibson and Paul Martin, who have questions 1 and 2, entitled to a response about fireworks and property factors? Of course they are.</p><p>Tom McCabe says that the selection of a First Minister should be a parliamentary occasion. The SNP does not disagree with that.

For many of those people, getting here was not as simple as it is for the rest of us, because they have multiple sclerosis. At this point, it is appropriate to thank all the people who made what was in many cases a difficult journey to lobby MSPs today. I also thank the Multiple Sclerosis Society in Scotland, which organised such a successful lobby. It is also appropriate to thank the staff who have made our Parliament accessible to the people here today and who have helped them to take part in this evening's proceedings.</p><p>The people with multiple sclerosis told us how difficult it is even to get out of bed in the morning, let alone travel to Edinburgh and get into the visitors gallery for this debate. Moreover, they have to fight for services that ought to be freely available. They might have to wait six months to see a neurologist; they might be told that there is no money in this year's budget to put a ramp at the front door; and they might be denied the only drug that can moderate the effects of the disease <place-holder colnum=\"1058\"/> because they have the misfortune to live in Edinburgh and not Aberdeen.</p><p>This is an important debate and I am grateful that the minister&#8212;not the deputy minister&#8212;will reply, which shows the importance that she places on the subject. The debate gives us an opportunity to turn our attention to a condition that affects more than 10,000 people in Scotland. Multiple sclerosis is an incurable and progressive disease of the nervous system. It affects different people in different ways. A significant proportion of people end up in wheelchairs, and there is no known cure.</p><p>In Scotland, we have the unenviable distinction of leading the world in the incidence of MS. The incidence of MS is far higher the further north one goes. People are twice as likely to have the disease in Orkney than elsewhere in Scotland. As with many other aspects of the disease, the scientists do not know why that is. The Executive is not funding any research to find out why Scotland has the highest incidence of the disease in the world. If we are the world capital of MS, we must start to lead the world in the standards of care that we give to people with MS. We in this Parliament must strive to set those standards of care and to provide the best care that is available.</p><p>I draw members' attention to the final report of the Scottish needs assessment programme&#8212;SNAP&#8212;which is about to be published. The report was commissioned before the current Administration took office, but its conclusions are vital to those who make decisions about the treatment of MS and the care that is given.</p><p>The report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Current care is substantially sub-optimal, inadequately resourced and unacceptably fragmented.\"</p><p>It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is an urgent need to develop properly resourced services in MS care.\"</p><p>It also states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Health boards should urgently develop strategies for the achievement of good practice outlined in the MS Society's standards document.\"</p><p>The extensive report does not paint a picture of satisfactory MS services in Scotland. There are seven specialist MS nursing staff in Scotland, but 10,400 people who have MS. We have some way to go before we can be proud of the standards of care that we offer to people with MS in Scotland.</p><p>It is time that we considered how to improve the level of service&#8212;how to change the sub-optimal, inadequately resourced and unacceptably fragmented situation that we have at present. One drug&#8212;beta interferon&#8212;has been proved to moderate the course of MS in some people. The drug is widely available in every developed health <place-holder colnum=\"1059\"/> service bar Britain's, but it is in danger of not being available at all to people with MS in Scotland. It is easier to be prescribed beta interferon in Turkey than it is in Tranent.</p><p>I am aware that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence believes that physiotherapy could be seen as an alternative to beta interferon, but I point out to the minister that that view is not supported by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, which rightly states that physiotherapy should be part of an overall programme of treatment and not a cheap substitute for drugs.</p><p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland is about to conduct its own inquiry into the availability of beta interferon in Scotland. In doing so, it should bear in mind the fact that beta interferon is widely held to be of assistance to as many as a fifth of MS sufferers. Why then are only 1.5 per cent of Scottish MS sufferers prescribed the drug? We have a responsibility to represent the interests of all our constituents and to ensure that the drug is far more freely available.</p><p>I am delighted that this debate is taking place, because it will bring hope to many thousands of people in Scotland. It will bring hope to the many people here today&#8212;and those who have never spoken to a member of the Scottish Parliament or, indeed, any elected representative&#8212;who have come to highlight their condition to us.

I shall address Pauline McNeill's point later in my speech.</p><p>The report that we recommend to Parliament today is another building block for the Parliament. The proposals of the Standards Committee are aimed at further enhancing the transparency and openness of our proceedings and at increasing public confidence in our work. Although the report <place-holder colnum=\"900\"/> places an onus on members to ensure that their staff comply with the registration requirements, our proposals should not be seen as a burden on staff or on MSPs. As Mike Rumbles said in his opening remarks, the report is also intended to provide protection for members and their staff from allegations of undue influence.</p><p>The Standards Committee report represents the culmination of a lengthy process in which we sought the views of those in the Parliament who will be directly affected by our proposals. The committee was keen to get it right and I believe that, with the help of those who responded to the consultation exercise, we have done that. I particularly want to thank the staff associations and trade unions that contributed to the process. Although we have not taken on board all their concerns, we have certainly considered them very carefully. I think that the committee has got the balance right, for the staff and for MSPs.</p><p>If staff still have concerns, members of the committee have made it clear that they are more than willing to talk to them if they are still not clear about the burdens that they feel may have been placed upon them. It is important that staff do not feel that they are singled out in a way that employees in other industries or workplaces are not. We want to ensure that we have happy staff, who understand why those burdens might have been placed upon them.</p><p>We have clarified who is covered by the proposals by using the definition of parliamentary duties set out in the members' allowances scheme, with which we are all familiar. In the previous debate, Richard Simpson raised that problem, because he wanted greater clarity about who was covered&#8212;we were asked about volunteers, people who came into the office or folk who put posters up on lampposts. By pinning it down to the duties of the parliamentary allowances scheme, we are all much clearer about which staff or volunteers are covered by the report. I am sure that Richard will agree that we have clarified that point for him and for other members.</p><p>We also reviewed how the register will be published, taking on board concerns that it should not be on the internet. That is something that concerned an awful lot of staff. The committee considered that carefully and concluded that the staff were right and that it would be unfair to place all those details on the internet. However, we have taken the view, all along, that a public document would be required. That document will be available for inspection in the chamber office.</p><p>We have also set out the rationale behind the requirement to register gifts or hospitality with a value in excess of &#163;50.</p><p>If any member feels moved to make an <place-holder colnum=\"901\"/> intervention, I would be more than happy to accept. <i>[Laughter.]</i></p><p>When we debated the subject in March, some members felt that we had moved a bit too quickly and that MSPs and their staff had not had sufficient time&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2000-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13236301", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Register of Interests (Members' Staff)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On behalf of my colleagues on the Standards Committee, I thank members for contributing to the debate, although I am sorry that there were not more contributions.

If we cannot put the burden on the staff, we must be able to say to MSPs that they employ staff and that those staff work on an MSP's behalf in their constituency office; they also work on the MSP's behalf, and sometimes instead of the MSP, in the Parliament itself. Those members of staff are in contact with a great number of people and there is a possibility that they could be under undue influence.</p><p>The Standards Committee can take no sanctions whatever against staff. The sole reason for placing the burden on MSPs is that MSPs do the employing.

As a result, we feel that we have got it right this time.</p><p>As Mike Rumbles said, the proposals are evolutionary; they are not set in stone.

As other committee members have pointed out, the &#163;250 threshold on gifts and hospitality for MSPs not only covers all such gifts and hospitality; it is a statutory responsibility imposed on us by the Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Members' Interests) Order 1999. As Karen Gillon and I have said on many occasions, <place-holder colnum=\"903\"/> any gifts costing more than &#163;250 that our husbands might be moved by generosity to give us must be registered. Jackie Baillie raises her eyebrows at me; however, it is entirely true that she has to register those gifts. Who knows&#8212;she might get lucky.</p><p>Any breach of those rules by an MSP could lead to a criminal prosecution. However, under our proposals, no such sanctions will apply to members' staff. Tokens of gratitude such as flowers, chocolate, whisky and modest hospitality will not come within the rules. Furthermore, our proposals will not prevent staff from accepting gifts and hospitality in connection with their work that are in excess of &#163;50, providing that they enter receipts in the register itself.</p><p>As for the publication of the register, there will inevitably be a conflict between individual privacy and public access to information of legitimate public interest.

The first is housing. People who rent a house have a secure, assured or short-term tenancy. However, only a small minority of people living in supported accommodation have such tenancies. Instead, they have occupancy agreements, which offer many fewer rights and are intertwined with the relationship between the occupant and the service provider. A 1999 Scottish Homes research report concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is nothing in the nature of supported accommodation which prevents the legal use of tenancies even in shared accommodation or dual agency situations.\"</p><p>However, only 16 per cent of people in supported accommodation have assured or short-term tenancies. In other words, 84 per cent of people in supported accommodation have fewer rights than <place-holder colnum=\"208\"/> people in mainstream housing. That is not acceptable.</p><p>If we want people with learning difficulties to be the same as you&#8212;as the document has it&#8212;or the same as me, we must address the most basic issues: their right to a home and to legal rights. They must have no less protection than anyone else renting a home. A housing bill is soon to be introduced in the Scottish Parliament. I understand that, although there is to be a single social tenancy, the specific issue of supported tenancies will not be addressed. I would be grateful for an assurance from the minister that he will discuss that with the Minister for Communities as a matter of urgency.</p><p>My second point is about the quality of care for people with learning disabilities. The SNP has long supported the concept of community care. I share the joy of those who have escaped incarceration in long-stay hospitals and are now, perhaps for the first time, enjoying a quality of life that was unthinkable only a few years ago. However, I am concerned that nurses qualified in caring for people with learning disabilities are finding it difficult to gain employment because local authorities and the voluntary sector are employing social workers and care workers in community homes, rather than using the much-needed expertise that is available. I know that resources are limited, but the many welcome recommendations in the report cannot be implemented on the cheap or by reducing the level of expertise.</p><p>Finally, I come to a problem that has not been sufficiently addressed&#8212;the facilities available to people who have what is referred to as challenging behaviour. There is a real need for specialised support for that group of people. In particular, I understand that in most health board areas, no accommodation exists for youngsters with learning difficulties who are sexual offenders. That is something that we should address honestly.</p><p>This is the first review to be undertaken in 20 years. It will bring the learning difficulties service in Scotland up to date. However, I urge the minister to go further and to ensure that the service is the envy of the rest of Europe.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13230456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Learning Disability Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to the Executive and, in particular, to the minister on producing the document \"The same as you?\" I also congratulate all those who contributed to the document.

I say to the minister with respect that that is nothing to do with rough sleeping; it is to do with homelessness. We need to separate in our minds what we are talking about: homelessness is not rough sleeping and rough sleeping is not homelessness. However, the target date of 2003 is a realistic one and it can be met.</p><p>I am concerned, and concern has been expressed to me, about the interim research to which the minister referred.

The school has a good record of achievement and it is important that we give it the support that it needs.</p><p>As Keith Harding mentioned, he and I visited the school. Frankly, I was appalled by what I saw: a two-site school that is joined by a very busy road. When my children were at school in Fife, they had to have permission from me as a parent to step outside the school or to go on a school trip. I am seriously concerned about young schoolchildren walking up and down a busy road many times a day. There is an accident waiting to happen. If I were the parent of a child at the school, I would be very concerned about the regime, which has existed for a long time. The road is extremely busy, the pavement is extremely narrow and the children have to walk half a mile between the sites.</p><p>I will talk about the physical conditions of the school. The physics laboratory is like a school museum. When I was at school, a bit before Iain Smith, the conditions in my school were far superior to those that I saw at Bell Baxter. There is what is known as hut alley&#8212;where children are taught in 40 huts, which are falling apart&#8212;and there is a dining hall in which I would not allow my children to eat. The health and safety issue has to be addressed urgently.</p><p>Iain Smith is quite right that Fife County Council, Fife Regional Council and Fife Council have given no priority to Bell Baxter. Nobody denies that improvements have been made, but it is unacceptable in this day and age that school pupils should have to go to two sites. I know that the problems of Bell Baxter are replicated throughout Scotland. The Executive will have to address urgently the recent report that showed that repairing Scotland's schools would cost &#163;1.3 billion&#8212;it is estimated that it will cost &#163;70 million to repair schools in Fife alone.</p><p>I leave members with this thought. Every week, the schoolchildren at Bell Baxter spend an hour travelling back and forward. That is a week a year during which those children are denied an education because of the circumstances in which they find themselves. That is not acceptable.

Millions are being siphoned off from private sector grants to home owners, which would allow people to live in their own homes.</p><p>\"Modernising community care\" was described as \"an action plan\". Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that, having identified weaknesses, the Executive would be tackling those weaknesses and making improvements, rather than lodging <place-holder colnum=\"807\"/> self-congratulatory motions. The things-can-only-get-better Government is now the Government where things could hardly be worse.</p><p>Between 1998 and 1999, the number of hours of home care services provided dropped by around 7 per cent. Since this year's local government settlement, things are getting worse rather than better. In my own area of Fife, where Labour runs the council, home care services have been cut to the point where there is simply not enough to go round. I am sure that Hugh Henry should be talking to his colleagues about how Renfrewshire Council is able to save its services while Fife Council has had to make cuts. Someone, somewhere is simply not telling the truth.</p><p>The cash constraints placed by the Executive on Fife Council's budget mean that 1,600 hours of home care services will be lost to vulnerable communities in Fife&#8212;that is a cut of 5 per cent on an already overstretched service.</p><p>In the past, I have spoken at length about housing waiting lists. Now there are waiting lists for home helps. Iain Gray said that the Executive is doing things that were unthinkable; waiting lists for home helps are unthinkable. How old, infirm or vulnerable does one have to be before one can get one's name on the list? How much older, more infirm or more vulnerable does one have to become before one reaches the top of that waiting list?</p><p>What is the motivation behind the change in Fife Council's policy? I will quote from a press release from that council:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"An increased demand for the service, limited resources plus more complex needs have led us to the introduction of waiting lists.\"</p><p>The council has done that to patch a huge hole in its budget&#8212;a hole such as has been made by Jack McConnell and the Executive in social work budgets throughout the country. The Labour party&#8212;which makes all those recycled announcements&#8212;is the same party that tries to spin a reduction in services into a good thing. Fife Council's press release says that home care services should focus on those who need it most, but it makes little mention of the fact that such services are being cut.</p><p>Has the Executive ever considered the burden that is placed on carers&#8212;the relatives and friends who are left to look after older and vulnerable people when the state has given up on them? The Executive has again produced a glossy document that talks a good game, but I will quote from Fife Council's press release again. Councillor Irene Connolly said, when commenting on the changes:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is the first time we have had to introduce a waiting list for this service.\"<place-holder colnum=\"808\"/></p><p>I will repeat that to the Labour party:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is the first time we have had to introduce a waiting list for this service.\"</p><p>That did not happen through the long years of Tory government&#8212;throughout those years, Fife Council did not have to introduce waiting lists for home help services. In the first year of the Labour Executive, there are waiting lists for home care services in Fife.</p><p>Elaine Smith said that the Tories have a brass neck. They have, but the Labour party should be black affrontit that the day has come when waiting lists that affect the most vulnerable people in our society have been introduced in Fife.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13228241", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will start with a familiar quotation from the document, \"Modernising community care: an action plan\": \"Most people want home-based care.

Nobody in Parliament will dispute the conservative estimate that a quarter of our population is too poor to keep warm, or that those who are poorest&#8212;pensioners, single parents and the chronically ill&#8212;are the same people who are forced to live in the poorest and worst housing.</p><p>Investment in housing is essential if we are to make a serious attempt to tackle fuel poverty. The Government's pensioners bonus is welcome, but it is sad to see&#8212;as Robin Harper said&#8212;that the money is escaping from the purses of our pensioners to the profits of the fuel companies. The extent of the problem is that there are half a million households in Scotland&#8212;the most energy-rich nation in Europe&#8212;that cannot afford adequate heating. Surely that should have put fuel poverty at the centre of the Executive's programme. The SNP hoped that that would happen.<place-holder colnum=\"1178\"/></p><p>When the Executive launched its flagship social inclusion document, \"Social Justice . . . A Scotland Where Everyone Matters\", in a blaze of publicity last year, we might have expected that the fuel poverty problem would be addressed, but how disappointed we were. Instead of addressing fuel poverty, the document sets out an impressive list of targets, milestones and statistical indicators, from the number of mothers who smoke during pregnancy to the number of people who draw an old-age pension and still take exercise.</p><p>Such precision and attention to detail might have inspired confidence, but anybody who looked for hope for those who are in fuel poverty was sorely disappointed. Rather than setting a target, the document simply says that the Executive will increase</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the quality and variety of homes in our most disadvantaged communities.\"</p><p>There is no mention of how many homes that means, how quickly it will happen or when it will happen. Why? The same answer is repeated time and again&#8212;we are told by ministers that the warm deal will meet Scotland's needs with a budget of &#163;12 million per annum.</p><p>Looking back through the answers and exchanges on the matter, I was astonished to see the range of needs that the &#163;12 million warm deal is meant to address. Until now, the warm deal has been the minister's stock answer to questions on matters that range from provision for the elderly to the time scale of a fuel poverty review. As Frank McAveety said today, the warm deal can be used to tackle draught-proofing and insulation; it can be used for lagging pipes and tanks; it can be used for advice; and it can be used to buy energy-efficient light bulbs.</p><p>The warm deal, however, will not install any new heating systems and it will not install a single new boiler or radiator. Such things are beyond the parameters of the warm deal in Scotland&#8212;in contrast with the situation south of the border. Even if the Government had a 100 per cent take-up rate, the warm deal would affect only one sixth of the families who are unable to afford heating. It is not a warm deal&#8212;it is a raw deal. It is a raw deal for the people who need things to get better. Perhaps that is why the Executive has not included fuel poverty in its glossy list of targets and milestones. Theirs is a Scotland where everybody matters&#8212;unless one is old, ill, cold or poor.</p><p>I welcome Frank McAveety's honesty in acknowledging the limits of the warm deal. The warm deal is not a panacea for fuel poverty. Perhaps for the first time, we can have the kind of debate that we need to have, so that we can genuinely tackle fuel poverty and bring hope to the <place-holder colnum=\"1179\"/> half a million people in Scotland who are suffering.</p><p>The time is now&#8212;Parliament can do something about alleviating the problem, but we must all get together to achieve that.

At that time, the Minister for Justice undertook to consider those matters and said that he would take steps to allay the concerns that had been expressed by many individuals and organisations. The fact that those concerns have not been allayed causes me great disquiet. Like Michael Matheson, I urge members of the Parliament to vote as their conscience tells them.</p><p>I accept that it is not and never has been the Executive's intention that the bill should allow euthanasia, but I do not believe that the Executive has moved sufficiently to convince genuine and sincere people that euthanasia will not be possible if the bill is passed without amendment.</p><p>The main problem, as Michael Matheson says, is that benefit is not defined. In the absence of a definition in the bill, it is likely that the meaning given in the Law hospital judgment, that the continued existence of a patient with persistent vegetative state \"was not a benefit\", will prevail. That wording was also used by the BMA in its recent guidance, in which it advised doctors that \"treatment\", including nutrition and hydration, may not benefit patients with advanced dementia and stroke. The BMA guidance goes far beyond the Law hospital judgment, which concentrated on the very few patients with PVS.</p><p>During evidence-taking sessions held by the Justice and Home Affairs Committee at stage 1, I was struck by the fact that the BMA's evidence about current practice flew in the face of the guidance given by the Lord Advocate following the Law hospital judgment. It is worth repeating Lord Hardie's statement at that time. He said that he</p><p class=\"indent\">\"would not authorise prosecutions of qualified medical practitioners who, acting in good faith and with the authority of the Court of Session, withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a patient with PVS, which results in the patient's death\".</p><p>In evidence to the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, the BMA representatives said that it was not necessary to go to court to get permission for cessation of treatment for every case of PVS. At the moment, the law and the practice are not the same. An examination of the bill's guiding principles and common law makes it clear that, if the bill were enacted in its present form, it would be almost impossible successfully to prosecute a proxy or doctor who caused the death of a person with incapacity by withholding or refusing treatment.</p><p>I am not a vitalist. I do not believe that doctors should strive to keep alive every patient no matter <place-holder colnum=\"1050\"/> what, but I cannot accept death being caused by withdrawing nutrition and hydration. I cannot accept circumstances that would allow people to die from starvation. The Executive has claimed from the outset that the bill will not permit euthanasia. My concern is that the bill, if not amended, will not prevent it from happening.</p><p>We will have a lot of important debates in this chamber, but I truly believe that none will be more important than this.

It continues the important work of seeking to achieve as open and transparent a system of government as possible, which the Scottish people can trust and have confidence in. It is important to remind MSPs and their staff at this juncture, that the register of staff interests is not to be taken in isolation. It is part of a package. That package started with the code of conduct for MSPs. We will also be looking at how lobby companies and others engage with Parliament.</p><p>The report is good and we have heard nothing to contradict that. In summarising the debate, I believe that it is fair to say that colleagues in all parties have no problems in principle with the introduction of a register of staff interests. At a meeting on 23 February, the Standards Committee took the view that the proposed register should be introduced as a priority&#8212;that was based on our experience of drawing up the code of conduct for MSPs and on our previous inquiries.</p><p>As Standards Committee colleagues have emphasised, MSPs' staff might be in a position to exert influence over members and&#8212;indirectly&#8212;over Parliament and its business.

We were both disappointed that we had nothing to declare after Christmas.

I would particularly like to thank members of the Standards Committee's clerking team for their advice, good humour and hard work in helping to bring the code of conduct before members today.</p><p>The need for a code of conduct was identified as a priority at the first meeting of the Standards Committee last June. Work was started almost immediately. I point that out to members and to the media to remind them that work on the code was already under way at the time of the so-called lobbygate inquiry, and was not developed as a response to it.</p><p>Why do we need a code of conduct in the first <place-holder colnum=\"188\"/> place? During the referendum campaign, I was struck by the number of people who said that not only did we need a Parliament, but it must be different from Westminster, from the sleaze, lobbyists, cash for questions and the general feeling that all politicians were somehow at it. That all contributed to the general belief that the Scottish Parliament could and should be different.</p><p>The code draws on the recommendations of the consultative steering group and is consistent with the principles that were set out by the Nolan committee. It was drawn up for this Parliament and I hope that members will give it their full support today.</p><p>No one claims that the code is perfect; as Mike Rumbles said, it is an evolutionary document and much more work needs to be done. For example, a number of points in the members' interests order need to be addressed from a legal perspective, particularly the difficulties that we have experienced relating to the rule on paid advocacy. While we are satisfied with the current interpretation, clarification might be needed in the future. As has already been mentioned, there are problems with the registering of gifts from spouses, which was a matter that greatly exercised Karen Gillon and me during the Christmas period. Members will note that we made no declaration and can take it from that that we were disappointed that our gifts were less than &#163;250.</p><p>The Standards Committee will review and revisit such legal matters. The committee has tried to be as pragmatic as possible and has set out standards of behaviour while trying not to constrict the ability of members to do their jobs.</p><p>On lobbying, we have restricted the code to dealing with how MSPs should conduct themselves in relation to lobbying organisations. We will start a separate inquiry at Easter into how lobbyists and lobbying companies interact with the Parliament. As Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said, we will hear evidence on registration and regulation and a report will be brought back to the Parliament. It is vital that people know how to engage with their Parliament, that everyone who approaches MSPs is treated in the same way and that there is no question of organisations or individuals getting preferential treatment.</p><p>The lobbygate inquiry was a searing experience for most of us. The procedures for carrying out an inquiry were not in place, but the inquiry was carried out swiftly and professionally. We have all learned from that experience. Jack McConnell said a few weeks ago that the inquiry made him grow up. It made us all grow up. Indeed, it made the Parliament grow up. It established the right of the Parliament to conduct its own inquiry and we now have in place procedures for inquiries, although <place-holder colnum=\"189\"/> we hope and pray that they will not be needed.</p><p>The Standards Committee has still to consider the possible appointment of a standards commissioner for the Parliament. Lord James outlined some of the arguments for that. It will be a matter for discussion in the near future and we will come back to the Parliament with our recommendations.</p><p>With regard to Dennis Canavan's amendment, it is no secret that I opposed the inclusion of the oath in the code of conduct. I believe that the code should deal with MSPs' behaviour, not their beliefs.

He said that the intimate knowledge of any country must form the rational basis of legislation and diplomacy. He also said that a census would encourage the social sciences to flourish. We can discount some of his other reasons for a census, such as planning the corn needs of the population, but I commend another of his reasons to the Government. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In a time when many fear the dissatisfaction of the people, doing a census would improve Government's image, as setting out to promote a public good.\"</p><p>We will see whether the census has that effect on the popularity of this Government. Somehow I doubt it.</p><p>A memorandum from the Scottish Executive, dated 1 February, states</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The 2001 Census, the first to be held under the auspices of the Scottish Parliament, offers a unique opportunity to collect information which can shape the policies aimed at improving social and economic conditions in Scotland.\"</p><p>We are all agreed about the need for the census. Where we have differed is on the kind of questions that need to be asked.</p><p>The census is a unique document. It will be pored over by researchers, local authorities, central Government and health service providers <place-holder colnum=\"1094\"/> for the next 10 years. The census is also a historical document that will provide a snapshot of the Scottish people at the beginning of the third millennium. That is why we must ensure that we include the proper questions in the census. We need questions that will reflect the ethnic, religious and social diversity of Scotland. I urge members to support the SNP motion on Scots, which was so eloquently presented by Irene McGugan.</p><p>I welcome the Pauline conversion of the Minister for Justice to some of the concerns expressed by the Equal Opportunities Committee about the type of questions to be asked in the census. Many organisations and individuals made representations, such as the Commission for Racial Equality, leading academics and researchers and the Medical Research Council. For several years, all those organisations have made representations to the minister and to the registrar general.</p><p>The Minister for Justice failed to listen, just as he failed to listen to the concerns expressed by the Equal Opportunities Committee from early January. Only last week he met the committee and said that there would be no questions on religion, on income, on languages spoken at home or on Scots. There was no question of him doing anything that would meet the concerns of the committee. He said that it was too difficult, it would make the form longer, the census was not the best tool and there was little demand from service users. There was plenty of demand from service users for an income question, but he ignored that.</p><p>Michael McMahon said that Jim Wallace's reasoning was bizarre. He was right; it was bizarre. Now he has brought the same motion here today but he has said that he will concede a question on religion and will consider a more detailed breakdown of ethnicity. Of course, that is not new information. Mr Wallace's conversion was widely trailed in the press at the weekend. He now accepts the arguments not because he is persuaded by those arguments but because the motion on behalf of the Equal Opportunities Committee was finding back-bench support and there was a risk that the motion would be defeated.</p>", "hdate": "2000-02-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13221336", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Census (Scotland) Order 2000"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Towards the end of the 18 th century, John Rickman, clerk to the House of Commons, outlined 12 reasons for conducting a census.

I shall come back to the Conservatives' record a bit later.</p><p>It is not possible to tackle unemployment by examining the enterprise network in isolation. It must be set in the wider political context and must work as part of our overall co-ordinated strategy. The potential for job creation cannot be viewed in isolation from the new deal, for example.</p><p>As Henry McLeish pointed out, under the Conservatives, the nation witnessed the politically engineered destruction of coal, steel and shipbuilding, and the doors clanged shut on <place-holder colnum=\"927\"/> industry after industry. The Tories' response at the time was quite simple; they did not want to deal with those who were unemployed, so they simply stopped counting them.</p><p>We all remember that the local enterprise companies scheme was drawn up on the back of a fag packet by Bill Hughes, as the Conservatives' answer to investment in employment. It is hardly surprising that the LECs were not the answer then and are certainly not the answer now. It is only right that we should study and review the enterprise network. The world is changing and we are operating in a global economy.</p><p>The empty Hyundai plant in Dunfermline is the living legacy of the folly of placing all the enterprise eggs in one basket. Let us consider Henry McLeish's constituency, Central Fife; what a pity he is not here to listen to this list. There have been 60 job losses at Anderson paper mill, 65 at Fraser Gray, 200 at Bekaert Handling and Display, 70 at Methil power station, 40 at Balfour and, in the past few weeks, 25 at Central Farmers and 35 at Glencast. Those jobs have been lost in his constituency in the past year. If some of the millions of pounds that were thrown at Hyundai had been used to support our existing companies and the start-up of new indigenous companies, our communities would not now be suffering such devastating job losses.</p><p>I mentioned that the enterprise network alone cannot create prosperity, so I will refer to the Government's main initiative to cut unemployment. Tony Blair promised the best of the American slogans, and hailed a new deal and a promise of jobs. Blair hijacked the idea of Roosevelt's new deal, but he sold out on the ideal.</p><p>Under the new deal, there are a number of different assessments on those without work, but in itself it does not create jobs. More than three quarters of new dealers have left the scheme without going into a marketplace job. Industry is not impressed by the scheme. Only 6 per cent of Scottish businesses have signed up to the new deal.</p><p>Roosevelt's new deal created the Tennessee river valley project, which provided flood control and navigation to satisfy a national need, electricity, and jobs for the unemployed. Blair's new deal has done none of that. Tennessee got a dam, but all that we got was a dome.</p><p>I believe that restructuring the enterprise network is not enough. We welcome it, but the goal of full employment can be achieved only if our Parliament is allowed to take responsibility, and not just for the enterprise network, because that is only part of the budget. The &#163;200 million for the new deal should be handed over to this Parliament to allow us to succeed where Westminster has <place-holder colnum=\"928\"/> failed.</p><p>We need to put together all the pieces of the jigsaw, combining the strategies of promoting enterprise, investing in communities, creating jobs and businesses, and getting people back to work. We can restructure the enterprise network, but we are having to watch while millions of pounds are squandered on the new deal, and while people are pitched between the scheme and the dole, creating work only for those involved in the resulting paper chase. While I welcome the measures that were announced by the minister today, they do not go far enough.

The rolling stock on which Fifers are expected to travel predates even my first rail journey. Indeed, I suspect that the rolling stock is almost as old as I am. I have never before suffered the sustained delays and the shoddy standard of service which we have had to put up with in Fife during the past few months.</p><p>After standing on a cold platform in a futile wait for a train that simply does not arrive, we are offered platitudes, not reasons. Sometimes we are even offered apologies. Such is the anger of the commuters in Fife that at my station the clerk has the complaint forms ready for us before we ask for them. On the occasions when the long, cold wait yields a result, an old, dirty multiple unit from the 1950s rattles and belches its way through Fife. <place-holder colnum=\"1610\"/></p><p>Ancient rolling stock running on lines that have been starved of investment for years is not a recipe for a punctual or comfortable journey.</p><p>Sometimes the problem is the wrong kind of snow; sometimes it is the signals, the track, the points, engine trouble, the fact that there are no staff to man the station or a slow-moving train in front of us. Always, the problem is uncertainty, delay or cancellation. By the time that the trains pull into Inverkeithing, they are so overcrowded that they closely resemble cattle trucks.</p><p>Helen Eadie has already mentioned the problem of people at South Gyle and Dalmeny who simply do not get on. People from Inverkeithing stand in the aisles, because there is no space. They do not fall down, because so many people are jammed up against them that it is impossible to move in any direction&#8212;sideways, upwards or downwards. Initial relief at the eventual arrival in Edinburgh is tempered by the inevitability of the return journey. It is little wonder that ScotRail bosses declined my invitation to join their customers on the journey from Markinch to Edinburgh.</p><p>Among the platitudes that pass for excuses for the service, we are told that Fife is suffering because of a delay in getting new trains for the Edinburgh-Glasgow line. What is the relevance of that? The answer is that Fife is waiting patiently for the cast-offs from that line&#8212;the trains that are currently running between Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p><p>The message from the Parliament to ScotRail and Railtrack is that while we may not be the flagship Edinburgh-Glasgow line, we are not second-class commuters. It costs &#163;46 a week for the privilege of travelling from Markinch to Edinburgh. We do not want second-hand rolling stock, nor do we want a second-class or, more likely, a fifth-class service, which is what we get at the moment.</p><p>I expect my work in the Parliament to be challenging. I do not expect the 25-mile trip home to be even more challenging. We cannot expect people to move from using their cars to using the train when the journey home at the end of the night is a fraught and uncertain experience.</p><p>I urge the minister to make representations to Railtrack and the operators about the service.

During evidence <place-holder colnum=\"1575\"/> sessions, it became clear that no research had been done to find out just how many properties are still subject to feudal duties and how many people are affected. It is reasonable to assume that many occupants are elderly and are living on fixed incomes. I am concerned that superiors who have not bothered to collect in the past will now demand payment of arrears. I would welcome a statement from the minister that the issue will be investigated to ensure that elderly people in particular, who have not asked for this legislation, will not be placed under financial penalties that they simply cannot meet.</p><p>As the minister said, commercial companies have made many representations about section 65 of the bill, which prohibits a lease of more than 125 years. I share the Executive's concern that, without a statutory limit, such companies could introduce leasehold arrangements every bit as restrictive as the current feudal system. However, although I am mindful that we should not create disincentives to investment, I am not persuaded by the companies' argument that any such restrictive arrangements would be a consequence of a statutory limit of a 125-year lease.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham and Christine Grahame touched on my final point about the need to retain some public interest in land. Some witnesses argued that the Crown's role as paramount superior creates a public interest.

Such groups are important to the ethos of the Parliament. In order for them to remain valuable, they must be regulated. Cross-party groups are important to the transparent, open and accessible culture that needs to be fostered in the Parliament. I think it has to do with putting one's money where one's mouth is.</p><p>The recommendations of the consultative steering group set out that the Parliament should be open, participative and democratic. The group paid particular attention to the role of civic Scotland in terms of the sharing of power. Paragraph 17 of the group's report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Power-sharing is not only about the balance of power between the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament, but also about the empowerment of external groups and individuals in all sectors of Scottish society.\"</p><p>Cross-party groups as well as committees contribute to the ethos of our Parliament and provide a channel for information, criticism and advice. More important, the groups allow MSPs to explore longer-term policy direction on a cross-party basis and to use the expertise that members of the group can bring.</p><p>Cross-party groups are also useful in areas where the Scottish Parliament does not, as yet, have legislative competence. That means that there can be debates on issues that are outside the parliamentary remit. That feature of cross-party groups is particularly welcomed by those organisations in civic Scotland whose interests are not devolved matters.</p><p>In order to remain valuable, however, cross-party groups must be regulated. Mike Rumbles has already outlined the features of such regulation. Everyone must be clear about the purpose of the groups and who is responsible for <place-holder colnum=\"1484\"/> them. The groups must remain essentially parliamentary in nature. That is why the Standards Committee has insisted that MSPs should take up the senior positions in the groups.</p><p>The groups have been the subject of much debate in the Standards Committee, and I am pleased that members of the committee from all parties have unanimously agreed the report. The subject of this debate is important, as the Parliament was set up to be inclusive. Cross-party groups are a method of ensuring that the Parliament is so, but they will work only if they are properly administered.</p><p>Cross-party groups are a framework to encourage participation in Parliament, but they are not the sole method of influencing the Parliament. There is a danger that the existence of the cross-party groups could be used as an excuse to ignore the rest of civic Scotland and the other groups that are involved. Parliament could consult the cross-party group on the elderly and claim that it has consulted widely, as that group could be seen to be representative of all the elderly groups. That cannot be allowed to happen. The cross-party groups should not become exclusive. The Parliament's members should be open to all views, regardless of where they come from.</p><p>In short, while I appreciate that cross-party groups are an important mechanism of participation, they are only one of many. In order that we get the best out of the cross-party groups, it is important that we have a framework of regulation. The Standards Committee has achieved the right balance in the document.

The problem is that there are widely differing interpretations of the current law, or rather ways in which it is carried out in practice. Following the Law hospital case, the Lord Advocate stated that he would not authorise prosecutions of qualified medical practitioners who, acting in good faith and with the authority of the Court of Session, withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a patient in a persistent vegetative state, which results in the patient's death.</p><p>In its evidence to the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, the British Medical Association contended that it is not necessary to go to court to get permission for cessation of treatment for every case of PVS.

It said that the Executive's interpretation&#8212;and, by definition, Lord Hardie's statement&#8212;would cause it concern. It also said that it hopes that the general principle of withdrawing and withholding treatment from a wider group of patients who are similarly incapacitated will operate with the same flexibility.</p><p>It is against that background that alarm has been raised about the intentions behind the bill and what will happen in practice.

I also believe that there is no intention on the part of ministers to make euthanasia possible. However, many witnesses have expressed sincerely their view that the law is confused. The Executive has a responsibility to reflect on and to allay all such concerns. This Parliament has a responsibility to produce legislation that is unambiguous.

There is a demand for that service today.</p><p>Once the stock of roll-on-roll-off ferries on order comes into operation, the capacity of UK ports will increase. It is estimated that within the next 10 years, the capacity for freight transport at UK ferry terminals will rise by 32 per cent.</p><p>There is also a great demand for that service from passengers. Most passengers in Scotland would prefer to travel to a port within two hours of their home. As Bruce Crawford said, almost half the passengers who travel to Hull come from Scotland. It also works the other way.

Rosyth is the ideal location for such a terminal. As a former naval base, Rosyth could offer riverside berths, a deep-water channel and direct access to trunk road and rail networks. Rosyth also has close at hand a plentiful supply of land for expansion. Most important, a terminal would create jobs in an area that has been devastated by job losses. In short, the whole of Scotland would benefit from the ferry port.</p><p>Not only is there demand for the terminal, but it is viable. Rosyth is an ideal location for a ferry port and Fife could certainly use the extra jobs. However, if Rosyth is to be established, it must survive in the commercial environment. Rosyth will face a hard world.</p><p>If the project at Rosyth is to be launched and is to sail, not sink, the Executive must provide support and assistance to ensure a safe landing for a Scottish sea route to the European continent. The Executive has the power at its fingertips to write the memo and to sign the cheques for freight facilities grants.

The reasons are twofold: first, household incomes are not enough to pay for adequate heating; secondly, the condition of houses means that they are almost impossible to heat.</p><p>Elderly people die of cold in winter in Scotland; every year, more people die in winter than in summer. A glance at the columns of death notices in local newspapers between November and March reminds us of that. We seem to accept that, somehow, it is inevitable. The annual cull of people in Scotland is something like 2,500, most of whom are pensioners. That does not have to happen. In places with colder climates, such as Scandinavia or Siberia, those excess winter deaths do not occur.</p><p>Energy Action Scotland reported that in Siberia, despite an outside temperature of minus 25 deg, there is no increase in winter mortality rates, because indoor temperatures are kept at a consistent level. In Scotland, more than 100,000 pensioner households have no form of central heating. Fuel-poor families spend a higher than average proportion of their household income on fuel, but the heat goes out the doors, windows and roofs&#8212;that makes for nicely warmed pigeons but freezing cold pensioners.</p><p>Fuel poverty must be tackled on two fronts: first, housing must be improved, so that it is energy efficient; secondly, incomes must be increased to make fuel affordable. The Executive has paid little more than lip service to the first issue. Its warm deal programme is inflexible; it allows expenditure on insulation, but not to tackle problems such as dampness. As John McAllion and others have said, that is in contrast to the situation in England, where the home energy scheme allows for grants for central heating.</p><p>Until the basic problem of inadequate pensions is tackled, any measure to provide a winter heating allowance will be undermined. An increase in investment in housing is necessary to tackle fuel <place-holder colnum=\"1149\"/> poverty.</p><p>Given the number of people who live in fuel poverty in Scotland, it is hardly surprising that last week the Executive disgracefully refused to set a target for tackling fuel poverty in Scotland. It recognised that, if it set a target, it might have to do something about it, which would cost money&#8212;God forbid, it might mean opening Gordon Brown's war chest.</p><p>We need to raise our ambitions and Scotland's horizons.

If the press report was accurate and that is what she thinks, she does not understand how homelessness occurs.</p><p>Of course rough sleeping is a housing problem. It is also a poverty issue. Government policies are responsible for the increase in rough sleeping in Scotland. The most recent statistics indicate that around 1,000 people sleep rough on the streets of Scotland every night of the year. Ten years ago we rarely saw people sleeping rough, except for a hard core&#8212;usually old men with an alcohol problem. The increase in rough sleeping in Scotland in the late 1980s can be traced back to three factors: the removal of benefits for 16 to 18-year-olds; the reduction in the amount of money for council housing; and care in the community, which was underfunded and left vulnerable people without the support needed to sustain their tenancies. Every one of those three factors was a Tory policy; every one of them was opposed by Labour in opposition; every one of them is embraced by new Labour in government.</p><p>We need a commitment from the Executive to tackle not only rough sleeping, but homelessness in its wider sense.

Its authors have not said how they intend to tackle damp housing in Scotland. </p><p>Thirty per cent of children in Scotland live in damp houses. More than half a million children and pensioners have no choice about the circumstances in which they live. The link between damp housing and health is well established. Asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases are prevalent among people who live in houses that are riddled with damp. </p><p>A study of damp housing and asthma in Glasgow, published in 1996, states: </p><p>\"The greater the severity of dampness or mould in the home the more likely the patient was to have severe asthma.\" </p><p>More children suffer from asthma in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe.<place-holder colnum=\"36\"/></p><p>All of us come into this chamber with experience from previous jobs and from events in our lives. I am no exception. While I worked for Shelter, I came into contact with people in the most appalling housing conditions. I met mothers who were in despair because their babies were constantly being admitted to hospital with respiratory diseases, and children who could not go to school because their clothes stank of dampness. </p><p>One such mother was Michelle from Glasgow, whose young son had been constantly in hospital; he screamed non-stop and he failed to thrive. Consultants finally discovered that he was suffering from Weil's disease, a rare illness caused by being exposed to rat urine. The rats were living under the floorboards in a Glasgow City Council house, scraping and scratching all night and terrifying the family. The disease has left that child with no lining in his nasal passages and his health will be affected for the rest of his life. </p><p>What choice did that baby have in the lifestyle or life circumstances in which he was being brought up? I warn members that I shall return again and again to the issue of dampness and health. I ask the minister why, having mentioned damp housing in the document, she is not setting targets for tackling dampness in Scottish homes. Why have no targets been set for reducing respiratory diseases? </p><p>In the earlier part of this century, the massive investment in public housing came as a drive to improve public health. The departments have forgotten the lesson of the joined-up thinking of 60 years ago. We must re-establish the link between housing and public health. </p><p>It does not have to be like this. We need to invest money to tackle dampness. A recent project in Cornwall invested &#163;300,000 in housing to improve the homes of children with asthma. Central heating was installed, dampness was eliminated, the children's health and school attendance improved and their life chances improved as a result. </p><p>I welcome the white paper, but it does not go far enough.

It is a pity that that consensus has been cast aside by the Labour party. It serves none of us well in the eyes of the public that in this Parliament so far we have done little other than to discuss ourselves. </p><p>This debate should be about parity, principle and the Parliament itself-and about recognition that all MSPs are equal and that none is more equal than others. This debate is about principle in the shape of the Parliament. What we agree today will be difficult to change; other parties would be well advised to consider that point. The staff allowances and office accommodation allowances are not for the benefit of MSPs but are to allow us to do our jobs well and, most important, to provide a service to the people we represent. Until 6 May there was widespread acceptance that all MSPs would be treated equally and that constituents would have a choice of MSP to approach. It is a pity that Henry McLeish is not here to hear this again. He told the House of Commons in May 1998: </p><p>\"The Scottish people value their Parliament and want it to work for them. The nation does not want the Parliament to work for any political party.\"-[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>, 19 May 1998; Vol 312, c 719.] </p><p>Ms Whitefield would do well to remember that when she talks about \"my office\", \"my constituents\" or \"my community\".

My mailbag suggests that that is not the case. I have been contacted by constituents and I intend to take up their concerns and problems. </p><p>Donald Dewar said in a newspaper article that it is all a question of work load. Can we look forward to the Labour party arguing for a 60 per cent reduction in the allowances of Westminster members, because this Parliament and its members are taking on 60 per cent of their work? I think not. The Welsh Assembly has voted to treat all members equally, but the Labour party in Scotland has set its face against that principle. We <place-holder colnum=\"308\"/> are told that devolution means that Wales and Scotland can do things differently if they so choose. It is all right for Alun Michael in Wales, and it is all right for Donald Dewar in Scotland: that is what is meant by choice. </p><p>Fairness, democracy and equality should be non-negotiable, regardless of where the Parliament is situated.
