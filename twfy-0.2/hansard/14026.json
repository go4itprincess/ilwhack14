No objection to it has been received.</p><p>The first thing that struck me about the bill when the committee was given the task of scrutinising it was its rather unwieldy title. It was not long before I appreciated that, although there is one bill, it deals with two different and unconnected purposes. Therefore, although it is fair to say that the bill is not controversial, it has still given the committee plenty of substance to consider. We also had to make ourselves familiar with the rather unique procedures that concern an important area of the Parliament&#8217;s work.</p><p>Before I provide some background information on what led to the bill and talk about its broad principles, I will speak briefly about private bills more generally and why they are necessary.</p><p>Private bills propose laws that allow individuals, groups of individuals or corporate entities to acquire powers or benefits in excess of or in conflict with the general law. Private bills for large-scale works are somewhat rarer these days, but the Parliament still sees a steady stream of governance reorganisation bills and the occasional bill that seeks to make changes to private legislation to enable construction to take place. Unusually, the bill that we are debating deals with both issues. The common denominator is the promoter: the City of Edinburgh Council.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s first objective is to amend section 22 of the schedule to the City of Edinburgh District Council Order Confirmation Act 1991 so that the erection of a statue of John Rattray on Leith Links is no longer prohibited. Currently, section 22 prohibits the erection of buildings, including monuments and statues, on Leith Links.</p><p>Members might ask: who is John Rattray, and why should he be commemorated in that way? John Rattray was an accomplished golfer on Leith Links in the 18th century, and was instrumental in setting down the rules for the game of golf. For that reason, the Leith Rules Golf Society wishes to erect a life-size statue of him on Leith Links. In giving evidence, the chair of the statue committee, Pat Denzler, said:</p><p>&#8220;The aim was to have something iconic to represent Leith.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, City of Edinburgh Council (Leith Links and Surplus Fire Fund) Bill Committee, 14 November 2013; c 13.]</p><p>The sculptor David Annand has been commissioned to create that statue. I am sure that members will be acquainted with his work, particularly as one of his bronze statues&#8212;that of Robert Fergusson the poet striding out at the entrance to Canongate church&#8212;resides not too far from the chamber.</p><p>The committee was concerned with ensuring that the power that was sought was indeed necessary and that no unintended consequences would arise from its use. We were clear that the issues of aesthetics and the security of the statue had already been the subject of the planning process. Planning permission was granted on 18 April 2013</p><p>&#8220;on the basis that the proposals comply with the Council&#8217;s development plan and the relevant non-statutory guidelines, and would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and have no effect on residential amenity.&#8221;</p><p>Our site visit to Leith Links on 5 November 2013 further served to reassure us.</p><p>The committee is satisfied that the bill is tightly drawn to create an exception only for that particular statue and that no further development can take place on the site at Leith Links. Fundraising to erect the statue is continuing, and the Leith Rules Golf Society hopes that the Ryder cup will help to focus those efforts. The committee also heard that a proportion of the funds that are raised will be given to the promoter to pay for the statue&#8217;s on-going maintenance.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s second objective concerns the revitalisation of a fund that was set up to assist those who were caught up in a series of fires in Edinburgh&#8217;s High Street in 1824. The Surplus Fire Fund is constituted under the Edinburgh Corporation Order Confirmation Act 1927, later amended by the Edinburgh Corporation Order Confirmation Act 1967 and the City of Edinburgh District Council Order Confirmation Act 1991. Esmond Hamilton, from the City of Edinburgh Council, explained that &#163;11,000 was originally collected to assist those who were caught up in the fires, and that that had grown into the sum of &#163;1.25 million, which generates approximately &#163;30,000 per annum.</p><p>The Surplus Fire Fund lay dormant until 2001, when the Fire Brigades Union contacted the City of Edinburgh Council, which led to the fund&#8217;s reactivation. The council&#8217;s pensions and trusts committee discussed the future management of the fund during 2011 and 2012, considering how its assets might be put to better use while having regard to the spirit of the fund&#8217;s current purposes, changes in society, the effectiveness of its present constitution and engagement with key stakeholders. On 31 January 2013, the full council agreed to promote the bill, which includes three changes to the fund. The bill proposes to transfer the assets, rights and liabilities of the Surplus Fire Fund to the Edinburgh Voluntary Organisations Trust; to amend the purposes for which the fund can be used; and to dissolve the fund as currently constituted.</p><p>The committee heard from Ella Simpson, the director of the Edinburgh Voluntary Organisations Council, about EVOC&#8217;s experience of running various grant programmes and several restricted funds and about its large network of organisations, which could refer possible beneficiaries of the fund.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854689", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Leith Links and Surplus Fire Fund) Bill: Preliminary Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open the preliminary stage debate on the City of Edinburgh Council (Leith Links and Surplus Fire Fund) Bill, and to provide the Parliament with some background information on how the committee has considered the bill so far.

The written and oral evidence that we received was informative and very useful in understanding the issues in hand.</p><p>During my time as an MSP, I have been contacted by many constituents who have had concerns about the operation of property factors and in particular the mechanisms surrounding so-called land-owning maintenance companies. Those companies are given ownership of common property in new housing developments, such as parks, open spaces and play areas, with the burden attached to maintain that land in exchange for a fee.</p><p>The committee found that there were issues surrounding the dismissal of land-owning maintenance companies, particularly where residents were unhappy with the level of service that was being provided. I welcome the Government&#8217;s response that it will prepare a code of practice. Perhaps during the debate the minister can outline the proposed timetable for the work to prepare the code.</p><p>Although the inquiry focused on the provisions that deal with property factors, the report very much touched on issues that are relevant to local government. The committee heard that land-owning maintenance companies sometimes came about when local authorities withdrew from taking on the responsibility for the maintenance of open spaces around new developments.</p><p>The report was right to note that local authorities need to look seriously at whether the maintenance of those common areas is being carried out in a fair and equitable way. The adoption and maintenance of common spaces would have resource implications for local councils, but we must be careful to avoid creating disparities in the services that are provided to council tax payers in new-build property developments and those in older developments who have their open spaces maintained for free by their local authority.</p><p>I highlight to members that, in the Government&#8217;s response to the inquiry, it noted that Clackmannanshire Council has recently called for a change in the law so that the adoption and maintenance of public spaces should be treated consistently with the adoption of associated public roads, footpaths and street lighting.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s indication that it will take steps to promote the use of owners association schemes to maintain common areas in the short term and work with local authorities in the long term to consider the future role of councils in the maintenance of land in new developments.</p><p>The inquiry came across some interesting, if perhaps technical, points about the 2003 act. We heard that there were issues surrounding the enforceability of real burdens where a land-owning maintenance company was involved. In order to create a burden, a developer must own both the property to be benefited by that condition and the property to be burdened by the condition. Typically, developers do not transfer the common areas to land-owning maintenance companies until after all the houses in the new estate are sold, which means that they no longer own the benefited property.</p><p>That was all explained to us very clearly by Professor Robert Rennie, who taught me conveyancing and commercial missives at the University of Glasgow. At times, the committee evidence session felt more like a tutorial, but the committee heard that there were issues surrounding the enforceability of real burdens. That is important, because it relates to the rights and obligations of home owners. The Government&#8217;s response to the inquiry does not appear to acknowledge the legal uncertainty over that point, which is perhaps disappointing. Although there was disagreement about the extent to which that was an issue in practice, I urge the Government to look closely at whether a change in the law is needed in that area.</p><p>Professor Rennie and others also told the committee that there were issues surrounding the enforcement and application of section 53 of the act, which extends enforcement rights of real burdens where a &#8220;common scheme&#8221; is created with &#8220;related properties&#8221;. We heard that the unintended consequence of section 53 may be to create rights where none had existed before and that it went much further than what was necessary to ensure that housing associations can continue to enforce burdens against owners, which was the primary motive behind the section. I therefore welcome the Government&#8217;s response that it will invite the Scottish Law Commission to review that section.</p><p>As modern housing developments become more common, issues surrounding property factors and the maintenance of shared spaces will affect more people. Some of my constituents certainly feel that there is room for improvement on the right of home owners to enforce their rights in relation to common areas and spaces in their developments. I hope that, following the inquiry, we can take steps to provide greater clarity and fairness in this area of the law.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830498", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Justice Committee&#8217;s inquiry into the effectiveness of the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.

That finally banishes the argument that we should have diverged from our path of implementing sensible economic measures and controlling our spending.</p><p>The SNP&#8217;s fabled plan MacB seems to have disappeared, as the SNP has finally come to terms with the reality that the UK Government is doing what is best for our economy. The measures announced by the chancellor in last week&#8217;s autumn statement continue that good work, while also helping people and businesses across Scotland. The fuel duty freeze will provide real help to motorists who have had to pay more and more in recent years just to keep up with the cost of running a vehicle; a reduction in green levies will help more than 2.5 million Scottish households with the cost of their electricity bills; and, with the abolition of national insurance contributions for under-21s, the UK Government will help to support the 138,000 jobs for young people that we currently have in Scotland and grow that number.</p><p>However, there is one issue that I want to concentrate on that is of particular concern in my constituency in the Borders. In the autumn statement, the UK Government announced significant measures towards helping with business rates, because not only will retailers and food and drink premises south of the border get a special discount of &#163;1,000 from their business rates, but all businesses will be protected with capped business rate increases. Those are important measures that will undoubtedly help businesses in the rest of the United Kingdom and provide a welcome boost to struggling high streets. It is therefore unfortunate that the Scottish Government has not fully replicated those measures for the benefit of Scottish businesses.</p><p>The measures are the sort of help that Hawick High Street in my constituency badly needs. In a trend that has become all too familiar throughout Scotland, Hawick has seen many shops close in its town centre over the past few years. The number of empty premises is on the rise and they are scarring what I believe is one of the most beautiful town centres in Scotland. However, as much of the High Street is designated&#8212;wrongly, in my opinion&#8212;as a prime retail area, none of the premises is entitled to benefit from the bonus scheme or discounts that are currently on offer. I have been contacted by many local businesses asking for help with their rates, and in turn I have been in contact with the cabinet secretary to raise those concerns, but so far the Scottish Government has been unwilling to take action. Something can and must be done to help those businesses. The situation has become so bad that the community council has organised a special meeting to discuss the situation.</p><p>I am sure that everyone in the chamber appreciates how important town centres are. Not only are they the living face of our communities, but they are vital to our towns&#8217; economies and their social wellbeing. They influence how people experience and relate to their local area, and they remain the place in our communities where people meet and interact. We do not need any surveys or statistics to know why our high streets are so popular with our constituents. Local residents recognise the important role that town centres play, especially in our more historic market towns.</p><p>The next few weeks will be a nervous time for those retailers. The Christmas rush represents the busiest time of year for many small businesses and they know that, if they do not achieve good sales this month, the rest of the year will be a struggle. With online retailers taking more and more business away from our high streets, the nature of our town centres is starting to change. The Scottish Government needs to acknowledge that change, and the onus is on us to do something to help.

Wherever that engagement has taken place, we have found passionate, profound and deeply held views on all sides of the debate.</p><p>I speak today as a Church of Scotland elder as well as a Conservative. I therefore understand the anxiety that the proposals for same-sex marriage are causing churches and religious groups across Scotland, but I also understand and share the desire for religion to remain relevant in our modern, 21st century, progressive society. Religion is not, after all, afraid of change. It has responded in the past to changing conditions and standards, and the religions that many of us celebrate and enjoy in our lives today are products of the environment that they operate in.</p><p>We do not even have to go back as far as Leviticus and its proclamations on footballs made of pig skin, beard trimming and bowl-shaped haircuts to prove that point. In the New Testament, Mark is seemingly unequivocal in his opposition to divorce, as is Timothy in his prohibition of the wearing of pearls and gold. Religion has moved on from those times. Indeed, it has done so repeatedly, time and time again, and when it did it was right that the state recognised and facilitated that evolution. That is a point that I would like to stress.</p><p>I have heard opposition to the same-sex marriage proposals on the basis that they represent an unjustified and unwarranted interference in the affairs of religion by the Government, or by the state. That could not be further from being the case. If religions do not want to embrace this gradual tide of change, they will not be forced to do so. If anything, the bill will give religions greater freedom and greater autonomy by allowing them to pursue the agenda and the pace of change that they believe to be right when it comes to same-sex marriage.</p><p>If the change is no change, that would be, in my view, a sad state of affairs. I believe that our country, our society and our religions would be worse off for that, but I recognise that it is a religious and not a political decision. Our role as politicians here today is limited to deciding whether we should enable that process of change, whatever it may be, to occur. I believe that such change is not only right but inevitable. Religion and the church do not exist in a vacuum. Indeed, they cannot if they are to remain relevant in our society and to continue to act as a credible force for good in our world.</p><p>That is why I urge those who oppose the proposals that we are debating tonight to seriously and critically examine the reasons for their opposition to same-sex marriage and to ask themselves whether they want their religion, their church and their society to fail to embrace change, the time for which has surely come.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752660", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Few matters in politics today have evoked such emotive engagement as the issue of same-sex marriage.

If the corroboration rule was removed, far greater scrutiny of the quality of witness evidence would be needed before prosecutions proceeded and courts convicted.</p><p>The Scottish Government argues that corroboration has acted as a barrier to justice, but the truth is that it has never been easier to prosecute. Corroboration has become a more flexible concept in Scots law, particularly in the light of the Moorov doctrine, the relaxation of the rule against double jeopardy and the introduction of statutory exemptions. I admit that the corroboration rule is complex, but while that may be a reason for reform, it is not a reason in itself for abolition.</p><p>As the law has adapted, the requirement for corroboration is much less onerous than it used to be. Modern developments in evidence gathering, such as DNA identification, forensic analysis and the use of CCTV, mean that, from an available evidence perspective, there is less reason to abolish the corroboration rule than there ever has been. To put it another way, it is easier for the Crown to secure corroborated evidence than it ever has been.</p><p>The primary argument for the change is that removing the corroboration requirement will increase the number of convictions, particularly for rape and sexual offences, which often lack witnesses. Poor conviction rates are extremely worrying, but abolishing the corroboration requirement is not the way to address the problem, and the removal of the corroboration rule will not lead to increased conviction rates.</p><p>I have no doubt that the Scottish Government will point to the analysis that the Carloway review carried out, which concluded that, of cases marked as unable to proceed because of insufficient evidence, 80 per cent could have proceeded without the corroboration requirement, and 59 per cent would have had a reasonable prospect of conviction. However, that analysis was carried out by prosecutors who have no experience of a world without corroboration and who were asked essentially to guess how many convictions would occur if corroboration were no longer necessary, and then to second-guess juries&#8217; conclusions.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697497", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Corroboration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to defend the principle that has been described as the cornerstone of the Scottish criminal justice system.

My home town of Coldstream is no exception. The annual ride out to Flodden is seen as the zenith of the annual civic week. It was 51 years ago that the first cavalcade of horses made its way to Flodden, with more than 100 horses and riders being piped over Coldstream bridge to &#8220;Blue Bonnets&#8221; against the background of the waters of the River Tweed.</p><p>Although 500 years ago we crossed the border to meet our foes, making the journey as outlaws, today we cross it as friends, neighbours and, indeed, family. Although 500 years ago we Scots rode over the border to raid, today we do so to remember an ancient rivalry, remember those on both sides who fell and celebrate the central importance of the battle of Flodden in our Scottish story.</p><p>James IV&#8217;s defeat at Flodden gives him the unique claim of being the last monarch of Scotland, England or Wales to die in battle. However, although those are certainly the main facets of his memory that have been immortalised by history, they are far from being his only achievements, if that is the right word to use. His accomplishments ranged far beyond his ability to lose decisive battles. He was an experienced horseman and, despite what I have said, a talented military leader. However, he was far from being a warmongering brute. He was a steadfast patron of the arts, and his drive to improve cultural, political and scientific developments in Scotland earned him the honorary and rather becoming title of the renaissance prince.</p><p>As Christine Grahame notes in her motion, 505 years ago, James IV issued the first royal licence for printing in Scotland. The first printed book in the nation was published one year later in 1508 on a printing press not far from here in the Cowgate. A copy of that volume remains to this day in the National Library of Scotland and stands as a testament to his contribution to literature, learning and enlightenment in Scotland. Not only that, but the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which stands a few hundred feet from where we debate, owes its existence and location to his vision.</p><p>However, it was not only Scotland&#8217;s culture and landscape that James IV influenced; its shape as a nation was transformed as a result of his life. His marriage to Margaret Tudor and the eventual unification of the Scots and English royal households that resulted strengthened relations between Scotland and England. At the time, the poet William Dunbar hailed it as an end to the Anglo-Scottish rivalry that had raged for centuries. The influence of that marriage on the eventual act of union in 1707 is hardly insignificant. Therefore, James IV&#8217;s legacy remains pertinent to us today.</p><p>Christine Grahame may not have forgiven James IV for the consequences of his choice of companion, but that debate is for another day.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694366", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: James IV and Flodden Field"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Christine Grahame on securing the debate on this important topic.

The Justice Committee has spent a lot of time considering the bill and gathering the views of all those who are involved in the justice system. As the committee&#8217;s convener said, we also took evidence in private from witnesses, who recounted their experiences.</p><p>There is a consensus that more needs to be done for victims of crime and that more can be done to ensure that victims are put in their rightful place, which must be at the heart of the justice system. I therefore welcome the bill, which the Scottish Conservatives will support at stage 1.</p><p>The bill will go a fair way towards helping those who are unlucky enough to be affected by crime. Some of the most useful measures include the introduction of a victim surcharge, which will mean that offenders contribute to supporting those who are affected by crime; the creation of a right for victims and witnesses to access certain information about their case; the widening of the application of special measures that are available to witnesses who are deemed to be vulnerable; the right to choose the gender of an interviewer in sexual offence and domestic abuse cases; and the creation of police restitution orders to help support officers who are injured in the line of duty.</p><p>The Scottish Government is to be commended for introducing a bill that is dedicated to victims and witnesses; that has not happened in Scotland before. The committee considered a number of suggestions for improving the bill, which I hope that the Government will reflect on. Perhaps most significantly, we heard from a number of witnesses that, although it confers rights on victims, the bill does not define the term &#8220;victim&#8221;. That appears to be a glaring omission, and I hope that the Government can come up with a definition that will provide clarity while protecting the right to a fair trial.</p><p>The bill extends the entitlement to special measures that are available to victims who are deemed vulnerable. Those are important measures that can make it easier for witnesses to give evidence. However, the bill also introduces a right for parties to object to the use of standard special measures in all cases. Lawyers welcomed that, but it was of great concern to Victim Support Scotland and the children&#8217;s commissioner, because it introduced uncertainty for vulnerable witnesses about whether the support that is offered to them will be challenged and possibly withdrawn. To seek a solution that is accepted by victims and prosecutors must be one of the priorities as the bill progresses.</p><p>We heard concerns about section 3(4), which allows the police, the Scottish Court Service and the Crown to withhold information that victims request if they consider it inappropriate to release that information. The Government should consider whether that needs amending or, at the very least, provide clear guidance on what factors should be taken into account when considering the appropriateness of disclosing information.</p><p>More generally, the committee heard that communication between justice bodies is poor and that that is causing problems. Astonishingly, David McKenna of Victim Support Scotland suggested that victims have to tell their story about 16 times to various agencies, which is clearly unnecessary and can add to victims&#8217; distress.</p><p>Some of the evidence that was received painted a less than enthusiastic picture of the bill. It is worth pointing out that the bill will bring Scotland up only to the minimum standards that are required by the EU directive on victims and witnesses. In some respects, it is arguable that the bill falls short of that minimum standard. For example, it does not establish a formal right to review a decision not to prosecute.</p><p>Peter Morris, a campaigner for victims&#8217; rights, expressed his disappointment with the bill in his submission. He wrote:</p><p>&#8220;To say that this legislation as it stands will make any significant difference to victims&#8217; lives is just not true. To say that this legislation is radical is not true and to say that this now puts victims at the heart of the justice system is also not true.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives&#8217; priority is to strengthen the bill so that it does more and goes further towards improving the lot of victims and witnesses. For example, the victim surcharge should apply to all offenders, so that we do not have a situation in which motorists must contribute but violent offenders do not do so.</p><p>Ten days ago, the Sunday Post reported that sex offenders who had been placed on the register for life but who now have the right to challenge that are being taken off the register without their victims being informed. The bill will give victims of life prisoners the right to be notified when the offender is released; the same right should be granted to the victims of sex offenders who were put on the register for life but have been taken off the register.</p><p>The bill can be criticised for being modest. Moreover, there is an elephant in the room. Even if the victim is better and more swiftly informed about the process, and even if they are given more support throughout and can have a more meaningful role before a conviction is secured, that is cold comfort for the victim if the sentence that is served is nothing like the sentence that was imposed.</p><p>Automatic early release of prisoners, which the Scottish National Party promised in 2007 to abolish, is a scandal. It does the victim a disservice, it discredits the system and it destroys public confidence. The Scottish Government&#8217;s claim that it wants to stand up for victims would be more credible if it did not continue to allow the vast majority of offenders to be released from prison after serving only half their sentences.</p><p>I accept that it was a United Kingdom Government that introduced automatic early release. However, that Government quickly realised the error of the approach and left provision for its repeal on the statute books in 1997. That was ignored by the incoming UK Labour Government, just as numerous calls from the Scottish Conservatives to end automatic early release have been ignored by the SNP Scottish Government.</p><p>Where was the consideration of victims when the Scottish Government and SNP members of the Justice Committee pushed through the closure of a fifth of our sheriff courts? The closures might save the Scottish Court Service money, but they will pass on costs to victims and witnesses and create yet more delays and a clogged-up justice system.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694151", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.

Religious warfare, in whatever insidious form it takes, is one of the worst things that can happen to a society. Although we in Scotland have had, and continue to have, our fair share of religion-incited discord, when it comes to such a deeply ingrained and divisive matter as sectarianism, we would often do well to look further afield than our own back yard, if not for answers, then at least for a degree of perspective.</p><p>Unfortunately, the persecution of religious populations is an all-too-common feature of our 21st-century world and, as the motion notes, the Shia Muslim population is no exception. Pakistan and Iraq in particular are two countries in which sectarian attacks against the Shia population are common, if not widespread. Human Rights Watch, in its 2012 report on Pakistan, summed up the situation in five words:</p><p>&#8220;Pakistan had a disastrous year&#8221;.</p><p>The report noted that Shia groups were routinely persecuted and that some supposedly banned militant groups operated with impunity, even in areas such as Punjab, where state authority is well established. Human Rights Watch&#8217;s 2013 report does not paint a more positive picture. It estimates that, last year alone, about 325 Shia Muslims were killed in targeted attacks across Pakistan.</p><p>The UK Government rightly welcomed President Zardari&#8217;s speech last year, in which he recognised the problems that minorities in Pakistan have faced and the efforts of those in Government to address the situation. Of course, more needs to be done.</p><p>Two months ago, I noted in the chamber the persecution that Shia Muslims have in the past faced in Iraq. Although we can all be thankful that oppression on such a widespread and repugnant scale no longer exists in that country, it is of course a matter of great regret that any form of sectarian persecution should still occur.</p><p>However, I am encouraged by the words and actions of the Iraqi Government when it comes to attacks against the Shia community. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and President Jalal Talibani know all too well the evils of sectarianism, being victims of it themselves, and I share their determination to refuse to allow religious militant groups that are attempting to exploit political instability to exacerbate sectarian tensions in Iraq. I admire their resolve to ensure that religious insurgency</p><p>&#8220;will not be able to bring back the atmosphere of the sectarian war&#8221;.</p><p>It is regrettable that sectarian attacks are not limited to Shia Muslims or to the geographical areas of Iraq and Pakistan. In both those countries, other religious groups are also targeted, and sectarian attacks occur in Saudi Arabia, Syria and even in countries that have strong traditions of religious diversity and tolerance, such as Indonesia.</p><p>The UK Foreign Secretary has repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to working with Governments to end sectarian attacks against religious and ethnic minorities. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office has a strong voice on the world stage and it is right that that should be put to good use. Therefore, I welcome current FCO initiatives supporting interfaith dialogue and integration. The list is long, but it includes projects to encourage Pakistan&#8217;s political parties to recognise the electoral power of minority communities; campaigns by the FCO&#8217;s Jakartan embassy to raise the right to freedom of religion with the Government of Indonesia; the funding of a series of grass-roots meetings in Iraq bringing people from different faiths together to combat sectarian violence; and general ministerial engagement lobbying federal and provincial Governments to guarantee the rights of all citizens.</p><p>As noted in Sandra White&#8217;s motion, the UK Government has a crucial role to play in eliminating sectarian attacks against the Shia Muslim population worldwide.

Mrs Thatcher has a very proud record not just in giving people the right to own their own house.</p><p>Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s society was one in which more people than ever before also owned a stake in the company for which they worked. The number of people who owned shares nearly quadrupled from 3 million to more than 11 million.</p><p>Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s society was a more prosperous one, too. Between 1979 and 1990, the Scottish economy grew at an average rate of 2.5 per cent. GDP per capita increased by more than 150 per cent and the disposable incomes of hard-working Scots more than doubled as a result of her policies. Indeed, all levels of income in all income groups increased under her Conservative Government.</p><p>It was a society in which workers got to keep more of what they earned, with the basic rate of income tax falling from 33 to 25 per cent and the personal allowance increasing by nearly &#163;1,000.</p><p>It was a more enterprising society, too. Service sector employment grew by 147,000 jobs between 1983 and 1990 and the number of companies registered in Scotland increased by 62 per cent during the 1980s.</p><p>Scots not only had more freedom, more choice, more prosperity and more wealth under Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s Government; they also produced more than ever before. Far from there being a decline in manufacturing, under Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s premiership it boomed. As we have already heard from Ruth Davidson, Scotland&#8217;s manufactured exports increased by 26 per cent in real terms over that decade. By 1990, Scotland was exporting more goods than even Japan&#8212;that is a fact.</p><p>When Margaret Thatcher left office in November 1990, that was the society that she left.

We have heard much rhetoric from other members, but surely they would not want to return to 1970s socialism and the sickness that we all had to deal with then.</p><p>Margaret Thatcher was a revolutionary Prime Minister who smashed the class as well as the glass ceiling.

However, the debate provides us with an opportunity to remember those crimes, to learn the lessons that we can and, importantly, to celebrate the Kurdish people, their future and their contribution to Scotland.</p><p>I turn first to remembering. It was 25 years and 10 days ago that the skies above Halabja rained bombs, both conventional and chemical, on its innocent inhabitants. An estimated 5,000 civilians were massacred over the two-day bombardment with a further 10,000 injured, some in the most unimaginable ways.</p><p>The massacre at Halabja was just one part of the Anfal campaign during which, at the behest of Saddam Hussein, some 180,000 Kurds lost their lives between 1987 and 1989. It is right that we remember those outrageous atrocities and it is for that reason that I recently lodged a motion in the Parliament to remember the struggles of the Kurdish people and formally to recognise the genocide committed against them. I am pleased that so many members supported that motion. It is also a tribute to the Scottish Parliament, as well as an indication that we take the Kurdish population and its interests at home and abroad seriously, that the formal recognition of the Anfal genocide was also the subject of motions by both Labour and the SNP. Today is a significant and symbolic occasion on which the Kurdish genocide can receive further parliamentary recognition.</p><p>Secondly, I turn to the lessons that we can learn from the events in Kurdistan over the past 25 years. As all of us here will surely agree, there are profound lessons to be learned. For my part the Kurdish experience confirmed my belief that human nature is incompatible with totalitarianism and that only when a people are liberated from tyranny can they progress, prosper and flourish.</p><p>That brings me to my third point&#8212;what can we celebrate, 25 years after Halabja and the Anfal campaign? Since liberation in 1991 we have seen democracy flourish in Kurdistan. We have seen the economy prosper, civil society blossom and the regeneration of Kurdish civil rights and liberties. Kurdistan now has seven public universities bringing higher education to its citizens. It has a stable and democratically elected Parliament, with a percentage of women representatives similar to that in our own Parliament. It has progressive laws that have banned female circumcision and which protect women from domestic abuse. Violence, terrorist activity and the persecution of religious minorities are significantly lower&#8212;in some cases, non-existent&#8212;in comparison with the rest of Iraq.</p><p>All that serves to underline Kurdistan&#8217;s place as a progressive beacon in the Middle East. Tonight&#8217;s debate represents an opportunity to celebrate Scotland&#8217;s links with Kurdistan, both internationally, with the relationship between our Parliaments and Governments, and nationally, with the Kurds who live and work in Scotland.</p><p>We must never forget the atrocities committed against Kurds&#8212;atrocities which led the head of the Iraqi graves commission to remark that,</p><p>&#8220;There is another Iraq, buried under Iraq.&#8221;</p><p>Tonight&#8217;s debate allows us to remember, learn and celebrate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687810", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Kurdish Contribution to Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I too congratulate Bob Doris on securing the debate and I welcome those in the gallery who have travelled to be with us in the Scottish Parliament.

Not only that, but in the south of Scotland the profile of Borders television has changed significantly since the amalgamation of ITV Borders with ITV Tyne Tees in 2009. For many, that was one merger too far, with viewers in the Borders becoming understandably upset at the loss of regionally tailored services that resulted in programming and news coverage from areas that were of little local interest or relevance.</p><p>Therefore, it comes as little surprise to me that contentment levels with channel 3 have been in decline, with satisfaction in Scottish news programmes in particular decreasing by 9 per cent between 2007 and 2010. It was against that background that the UK culture secretary, Maria Miller, announced in November 2012 that channels 3 and 5 are to have their licences renewed for another 10 years in 2014. That move is to be welcomed; it gives much-needed certainty to the broadcasting industry that depends on those channels and the significant investment that they attract in their regions.</p><p>The secretary of state has instructed Ofcom to begin discussions with licence holders on the cost and terms of possible renewals. I agree&#8212;and endorse&#8212;the two issues that she has highlighted as important components of any negotiations. Those issues are, first, the need for licence holders to maintain, or increase, current levels of public service requirements; and, secondly, the requirement for careful scrutiny of proposals advanced by ITV that could leave viewers in the south of Scotland with a lower level of Scottish programming than elsewhere in Scotland.</p><p>On the first point, it is, of course, essential that licensees deliver quality public service programming. It is therefore pleasing to see that Ofcom&#8217;s recent report, &#8220;Licensing of Channel 3 and Channel 5&#8221;, concluded that licensees of both services exceeded their respective production and programming obligations between 2007 and 2010. However, although exceeding current obligations is to be applauded, that does not mean that we should not be pushing further.</p><p>The secretary of state has secured increased commitments for UK-sourced children&#8217;s programming on channel 5 from Northern and Shell, and there is no reason against an ambitious approach to public service requirements for channel 3, for example, in local news or regional content.</p><p>That brings me to my second point. Some&#8212;including members in the chamber, as we have heard tonight&#8212;have used the disquiet and the lack of regionally tailored television services in the south of Scotland as an argument in favour of a Scotland-wide service, as under the model proposed by STV.</p><p>However, as Ofcom&#8217;s report noted, although viewers in the south of Scotland were less satisfied with Scottish news coverage from their channel 3 licensee than viewers elsewhere in Scotland were with the coverage from STV, they placed &#8220;considerably more importance&#8221; than other Scots on the need for a focus on their local area. On that basis, especially when it comes to news, neither the status quo nor a Scotland-wide STV service appears to be the way forward.</p><p>For that reason, last June I asked the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs whether she agreed that local broadcasting in the Borders would be better served by having a more local service dedicated to the south of Scotland, which could be supplemented with coverage of national Scottish issues, than it would be by having a Scotland-wide service, as would be the case under the STV proposals. I was pleased that, in her response, the cabinet secretary agreed with me on the matter, and I hope that other members will join us in agreeing that that is the best way forward.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683091", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Television (South of Scotland)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to debate television services in the south of Scotland, and I congratulate Joan McAlpine on securing parliamentary time to discuss the issue.

Scotland&#8217;s criminal justice system does not exist in a vacuum and must respond to and evolve within modern-day conditions if it is to remain a credible and effective institution.</p><p>Today, we have heard of a number of the difficulties that the modern world and the digital era present to the criminal justice system. Many of those challenges can be observed most starkly when considering the Contempt of Court Act 1981. In an age of citizen journalism and unfettered access to new media platforms, some have raised concern about the suitability of a strict liability offence of contempt of court. During evidence to the Justice Committee earlier this month, some witnesses observed that the majority of the public do not know and cannot be expected or presumed to know the legal implications of what they write or broadcast online regarding criminal trials.</p><p>While &#8220;ignorance of the law is no excuse&#8221; and the need to ensure the fairness of criminal trials must remain fundamental tenets of our legal system, the appropriateness of a strict liability offence punishable by a custodial sentence of up to two years must, in the light of modern conditions, be seriously assessed with regard to the principles of fair labelling and proportionality. However, evidence to the Justice Committee raised the possibility of the need for a more comprehensive reform of the 1981 act. Aamer Anwar commented on the need to bring the law of contempt into the 21st century, and Steven Raeburn likened the 1981 act to</p><p>&#8220;using a bow and arrow against chemical weapons&#8221;,&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee 2 October 2012; c 1777.]</p><p>and called for a &#8220;fundamental overhaul&#8221;. The witnesses did not share one view, though, with Alistair Bonnington supporting the case-by-case discretionary approach that the 1981 act allows.</p><p>It cannot be denied that today&#8217;s digital era threatens the efficacy of the 1981 act in securing its objective that jurors&#8217; minds are free from the effects of prejudicial information that may endanger the fairness of a trial. Nevertheless, although there is evidence that jurors are discovering and actively accessing information relevant to their trial online, we have no similar evidence as to the effects that such exposure has on the decision making of a jury. Studies from Canada and Australia have shown the effects of trial reporting on the jurors&#8217; consideration of evidence to be markedly less pronounced than expected. For example, a study from New South Wales found that, although jurors often tracked down coverage that was relevant to their trial, they were generally not influenced by bias or incomplete reporting. Publicity was found to have influenced a verdict in only three out of 41 cases, underlining jurors&#8217; scepticism towards sensationalist and speculative reporting.</p><p>The need for such information in a Scottish context is clear. If experience elsewhere shows that jurors either do not believe or are uninfluenced by prejudicial information from citizen journalists, bloggers or even ardent tweeters, a knee-jerk overhaul of the 1981 act in the absence of solid empirical evidence would simply put the cart before the horse. A more sensible suggestion, which has been mooted in England and Wales, is an amendment to section 8 of the 1981 act to allow evidence on the matter to be gathered.</p><p>Discussion of the media brings us to the televising of court proceedings. Although rare, cameras in Scottish courts are nothing new. We have accepted their use in principle since 1992. It was Lord Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice, who said that it is</p><p>&#8220;of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.&#8221;</p><p>Open justice is critical in ensuring the fairness of a legal system, and the televising of certain court proceedings has the capability of furthering that aim.</p><p>However, the public interest in open justice is not limited to its capacity to deliver fairness in our legal system; there is also a public interest in increasing public knowledge of our legal, court and criminal justice systems. The most recent Scottish crime and justice survey statistics show that 64 per cent of Scots do &#8220;not know very much&#8221; about the criminal justice system, with 17 per cent saying that they knew nothing at all. Furthermore, only 19 per cent of those surveyed stated that they had ever come into contact with the Scottish judiciary. Making court proceedings more accessible to the public through television not only may increase the public&#8217;s awareness of the criminal justice system, but goes to the very heart of the authority of the law.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of the Media in Criminal Trials"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We welcome today&#8217;s opportunity to consider the role of the media in the criminal justice system.

Indeed, our manifesto last year contained a proposal for a single police force while the SNP remained committed only to reducing the number of police forces. A single police force could represent an opportunity to get rid of duplication in backroom functions such as human resource, information technology and administration functions, and, in turn, protect front-line policing. I am therefore pleased that the Scottish Government has come round to supporting a Scottish Conservative election manifesto commitment.</p><p>I am less pleased about how the Government has gone about implementing the policy. The bill is far from perfect. Despite the best efforts of the Opposition parties, it will not adequately protect local accountability or ensure that savings are delivered. The Scottish Conservatives support the idea of reform and a single police force, but that support has always been conditional on a number of factors.</p><p>Any reform must protect local accountability. Any restructuring must ensure that police services are accountable to local people and the communities that have a direct relationship with them, which they serve. Unfortunately, the bill is very quiet on how the single police force will work with local authorities; instead, the Government has invested a great deal of faith in its pathfinder projects. Only time will tell whether that was a good idea. We would have preferred to have seen real power delivered to local residents by the introduction of directly elected police commissioners. It is unfortunate that the Government has not accepted that proposal or a number of other amendments that the Scottish Conservatives and other Opposition parties proposed that would have provided clarity on local authority engagement with the single force and enhanced local accountability.</p><p>Additionally, the creation of a single force must deliver efficiency savings, and it is important that those savings are delivered alongside the protection of front-line services. The Scottish Conservatives, too, are committed to the maintenance of 1,000 additional front-line officers, whom we helped to secure during the previous session. That is all the more important given yesterday&#8217;s news that the number of crimes and offences committed in Scotland has risen this year. If the bill enables more money to be spent on front-line policing, it has to be welcomed.</p><p>We have heard a number of times in the chamber that a single police force could achieve &#163;130 million-worth of savings within a year and a total saving of &#163;1.7 billion over 15 years, but those figures are based on an outline business case that was produced in July 2011, before the Government had even decided to establish a single police force. We have already heard that Chief Constable Smith said that that document was</p><p>&#8220;never intended by the police officers who were party to it, or by the consultants, to be a document that contained sufficient detail on which to base significant decisions about investment and savings.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 28 February 2012; c 971-2.]</p><p>We are still waiting for a full business case to be produced. It remains the Government&#8217;s position that that is a matter for the police and fire services. The consequence of that is that the Parliament has been forced to debate a critical piece of legislation without full figures on how much the single police force will save, which is unacceptable.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has made a bit of a song and dance about the VAT position throughout the passage of the bill. The reality is that, when the Scottish Government first set out the proposals, it had full knowledge that they would result in the loss of the VAT exemption; indeed, its own estimates of the impact of the reforms assume that loss. The United Kingdom Government has tried its best to work with the Scottish Government to make the proposals work and to allow the VAT exemption to be retained, but the Scottish Government has failed to engage.

Of course, the latter point has been given greater significance by the results of last year&#8217;s elections. It is more important than ever that the Parliament can hold ministers and Governments to account.</p><p>It has been 13 years since the Parliament first met, and it is right that we are now considering whether reform is necessary. The passage of the Scotland Act 2012 earlier this year means that the largest ever transfer of financial powers to Scotland since the United Kingdom was created has taken place. The Scottish Government will have to decide how best to use those significant new powers. As the Parliament&#8217;s powers increase, the ability to hold to account those who exercise those powers must be robust and effective.</p><p>Presiding Officer, parliamentary reform has been discussed before, but you must be praised for creating the momentum for change. The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee was tasked with considering chamber and committee sitting patterns and reported on the topic last December, as we heard from the committee&#8217;s convener. A range of recommendations was made, including the recommendation that the changes should be implemented before Easter. It is important to take our time to get any changes right, but that should not be used as an excuse for delay. Equally, we should view the reforms not as the final stage but as part of the process of continuing evolution of our Parliament.</p><p>The focus of our debate is the committee&#8217;s second report of 2012, on parliamentary reform, which outlines the standing order rule changes that are required to implement the proposals. The committee and the Parliamentary Bureau share the same aim for reform. The bureau did not accept some of the committee&#8217;s initial proposals, but it has supported fundamental changes to the Parliament&#8217;s working practices.</p><p>It is important to note that some of the committee&#8217;s recommendations involved matters that are outwith standing orders and therefore beyond the committee&#8217;s control and remit. For example, the committee recommended a trial of allowing a smaller number of longer back-bench speeches in open debate. In response, the Presiding Officer was correct to point out on behalf of the bureau that such a proposal is not for standing orders. I note that the Presiding Officer strongly shares the committee&#8217;s aim of encouraging debate and I commend the actions that she has taken to encourage interventions. To that end, we will continue our approach of sharing with members information on debates.</p><p>I turn to the recommendations that the standing order rule changes are to implement. The Scottish Conservatives are broadly in favour of the proposed changes. The creation of a three-day plenary working week will enhance Parliament&#8217;s ability to respond to live events. The proposal will not increase the length of the working week, but it will mean that three days a week are available for parliamentary business.</p><p>However, as we noted in our initial response to the committee, that change should be more than mere tokenism, and substantial business must be scheduled over all three days. The inclusion of question time on all three days and the introduction of topical questions will further enhance Parliament&#8217;s ability to respond to recent events and hold ministers to account.</p><p>The recommendation that committees should be able to meet at the same time as chamber business takes place, when circumstances do not allow them to meet at any other time, is a sensible suggestion to streamline committee business. It is right that that procedure should be used only in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Some of the proposed changes raise concerns in my mind and the minds of my Conservative colleagues. The proposed changes will allow debates to take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. In theory, Government or Opposition debates could be scheduled on any of those afternoons. However, given that the Government in effect controls the allocation of debating time, the concern must be that a Government that was under pressure would allocate Opposition time to the Thursday afternoon, to avoid closer scrutiny.</p><p>Thursday afternoons are undoubtedly less attractive for a number of reasons, not least because they are at the end of the week and because the media focus on Thursdays is on First Minister&#8217;s question time. Like Labour, we argue strongly for a presumption against using the Thursday afternoon debating slot for Opposition debates.</p><p>It is correct to reduce the time between lodging and asking questions, but the bureau&#8217;s suggested timetable will mean that the deadline for lodging all questions will fall at 12 noon on Mondays. Although I am supportive of that, there is a risk of duplication of questions and a reduced opportunity for Opposition members to question the Government on a variety of topics, as all questions will be lodged around the same time. We may want to review how that is working in a few months&#8217; time.</p><p>As made clear in the initial report, the committee sees this as the start of a process. It is important that the effects of any reforms are considered and further changes made, if necessary. It would be regrettable if another 13 years were to pass without any further consideration of the Parliament&#8217;s working week.</p><p>I am pleased to confirm that the Conservatives will be supporting the committee&#8217;s motion.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parliamentary Reform (Changes to Standing Orders)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is fair to say that all parties share the desire for the Parliament to be modern, flexible and fit for the job that it was established to do&#8212;to pass laws that will benefit the people of Scotland and to hold the Scottish Government to account.

I hope that, by making savings, the bill will protect front-line fire services.</p><p>Crime remains a real concern for many people in Scotland. Too many people live in communities that are blighted by crime. The challenge is to step up the fight against lawlessness, antisocial behaviour and violence so that our citizens can live free from crime and from the fear of crime. The question that we must ask is: how can we maintain the service that the police provide within the current financial parameters?</p><p>When public finances are under such extreme pressure, it is appropriate that we look to cut duplication and unnecessary costs across Scotland&#8217;s police forces to ensure that we keep police officers on the beat in our communities and not behind desks. However, making those savings will involve difficult decisions. With 87 per cent of the policing budget going on staffing costs and with large savings having to be found, it is clear that there is little scope for minor efficiency savings or tinkering round the edges.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives therefore agree that it is appropriate to review the structure of fire and police services in Scotland. I certainly will not defend the historical police force structures if that means sacrificing more police officers who could fight crime on the streets. However, our support for the bill has been conditional on three factors: that local accountability is protected; that real efficiency savings are delivered; and that front-line police numbers are protected. The Scottish Conservatives have real concerns that those conditions will not be met by the bill as it stands.</p><p>On local accountability, any restructuring must ensure that police services are accountable to the people whom they serve. We need a system that involves local residents, so that communities have a direct relationship with the police who serve them. It would be regrettable if the bill simply amounts to yet another attempt by the Scottish Government to grab power, remove local accountability and centralise services. At least there is a recognition of the importance of local accountability through the proposal in the bill to create, for each local authority, a local commander who is responsible for the delivery of local policing plans. However, we, like the Justice Committee, have serious concerns that that does not go far enough to counteract or balance the centralised single police force.</p><p>We argue that a better way of achieving local accountability would be to establish directly elected local police commissioners, which is a policy that the Scottish Conservatives have called for repeatedly. Under that policy, operational matters would remain matters for the police, but the police would be accountable to those locally elected police commissioners. Voters and residents would have a direct link to their commissioner and would hold them to account for local police performance. The UK Government is introducing elected commissioners in England. Will the cabinet secretary consider improving the bill by including that policy to enhance local accountability?</p><p>The second and third conditions for the Scottish Conservatives&#8217; support for the bill are that efficiency savings are delivered and&#8212;crucially&#8212;that they are delivered alongside the protection of front-line services. When the cabinet secretary made a statement to Parliament on police and fire reform back in September 2011, he said that a single police force could achieve &#163;130&#160;million of savings within a year and a total saving of &#163;1.7&#160;billion over 15 years. I asked him:</p><p>&#8220;What systems does the Government plan to put in place to ensure that those savings are delivered?&#8221;</p><p>His reply was remarkably vague. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Those matters will be dealt with.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 8 September 2011; c 1562.]</p><p>The Government continues to provide little detail on how it plans to ensure that the oft-quoted savings are delivered.

I might not win all the debating points, but surely I will win that one.</p><p>The number of people who cycle in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has grown at an incredible rate in recent years. There has also been an increase in the public debate about cycling, following the successful cities fit for cycling campaign by The Times, which I fully support. About 30,000 people have now expressed their support for its eight-point manifesto. Perhaps more important is that the campaign has also been backed by organisations such as the Automobile Association and the RAC.</p><p>The benefits of cycling have been mentioned by others, but it is also important to recognise that</p><p>&#8220;Cycling is the most efficient form of transport in the world. ... A 2009 study by Professor David MacKay found that an average cyclist will use less than a third of the amount of energy required to walk, a sixth of the energy needed to travel by coach and an eightieth of the energy a car would use.&#8221;</p><p>Given that</p><p>&#8220;three quarters of our journeys in the UK are five miles or fewer&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 23 February 2012; c 343WH.]&#8212;</p><p>it is clear that cycling could and should be promoted as one of our basic transport needs. It is clearly not suitable for all journeys, and there are additional challenges in rural areas such as those in my constituency. However, rural areas and towns can all do things to promote cycling, although the exact details will be different in each case.</p><p>The health benefits of cycling are significant, and my colleague Nanette Milne will cover them in her speech. Cycling is good for the environment: even if one takes into account the food that a cyclist has to eat, where it comes from and how it was produced, carbon dioxide emissions are a fraction of those from other vehicles.</p><p>If we hope to encourage cycling&#8212;I think that we should&#8212;we must ensure that the safety of cyclists is improved. One way to do that would be through improved training. One training organisation suggested that two hours of training, costing &#163;70, would transform the safety of cyclists on the road. We must also look at what our schools are doing to ensure that our children are introduced to the benefits of cycling at a young age, that they are encouraged to cycle to school, and that they are given training to do so safely.</p><p>However, it works both ways. Some cyclists ignore red lights, thereby endangering themselves. Many others do not use proper lighting on their bikes either at night or when visibility is poor. That is not the responsibility of Government or motorists; it is up to the cyclists to behave properly.</p><p>When cycling in Europe, I am always struck by how considerate other road users are towards cyclists. Indeed, I understand that in most other European countries the law states that the less-vulnerable road user causing harm is deemed to be responsible or culpable, unless evidence is produced to the contrary. Similarly, other countries often insist on minimum passing distances.</p><p>Local authorities need to do more to improve the safety of cyclists. Some councils have very good cycle-friendly schemes, but others have been found wanting. We must do more to invest in cycling infrastructure, not least to ensure that our roads are up to cycle quality. As a cyclist and a car driver, I know that what might be a relatively small hole for a car often becomes a more serious problem for a cyclist.</p><p>We will support the Scottish National Party and Labour amendments. I lodged my amendment simply because I feel that the motion is slightly too prescriptive and does not recognise the potential involvement of the business and third sectors in developing and promoting cycling.</p><p>With the Olympics and the Commonwealth games fast approaching, the next few months and years will give us a huge opportunity to transform cycling in Scotland. If our cyclists are as successful as we hope, many more people&#8212;particularly youngsters&#8212;will get on their bikes.</p><p>Finally, I will be taking part in the Galashiels triathlon in about nine days.

The logic behind that is that some tenant farmers may not have children or grandchildren, and so the tenancy could be forfeited on their passing. However, if the tenancy rights were conferred on nephews and nieces, the tenancy could be carried on in the wider family, which would restrict the landlord&#8217;s ability to retake possession of the property.</p><p>On that point, I fully agree with the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, who in his evidence to the committee cautioned that any extension of the succession rights could have unintended consequences. An overly broad definition could further limit the landlord&#8217;s confidence and create even more uncertainty in the tenanted sector. If such a definition was implemented in an attempt to protect the tenant&#8217;s rights, the landlord&#8217;s rights could be seriously undermined, which would make it more unlikely that a landlord would lease his land in the future in order to avoid the effective loss of his property.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664295", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Conservatives are pleased to support the bill&#8217;s general principles.

There is a view that the freedom to contract is being undermined. That is having an impact on the supply of land, which in turn has an impact on new entrants&#8217; ability to come into farming.</p><p>Tenant farmers and landowners have told me that, because they are unable to negotiate freely, they are entering into short-term arrangements rather than secure tenancies. As a consequence, tenant farmers are not prepared to invest in the land and the farm steadings in the way that they would have done if they had the benefit of a more secure tenancy.</p><p>Given the drop in the number of tenancies, which we have heard about already, we should be concerned that, by further interfering with the parties&#8217; contractual freedom, we could be indirectly undermining the parties&#8217; ability to enter into arrangements as they wish to. I know that that is not the Government&#8217;s intention, but we must keep the unintended consequences of such changes in mind when we consider further reform.</p><p>In the brief time that is available to me, I will focus on the lack of data. In January, the Government released figures that showed a 10 per cent drop in the number of holdings with tenancy agreements between 2005 and 2011. However, it became apparent during the committee&#8217;s scrutiny of the bill that there is an issue around the lack of accurate data in a number of areas, including rented land, which makes it much more difficult to understand fully the extent of the implications of the bill or of any possible future reform.</p><p>The briefing note from Scottish Land &amp; Estates states that there is scepticism about those numbers, which show only a snapshot of the issue and fail to take into account that there are a number of destinations for the land once the tenancy comes to an end. Some of the land is bought back by the tenant, some is taken back to be farmed by the landowner and some is split to support existing businesses and current tenants. I agree with the committee report that the Scottish Government must, as a matter of urgency, work with the relevant parties to ensure that more accurate data is collected.</p><p>The fundamental issue is that we must get the balance right between the rights of the tenant and those of the landlord. The relationship between the two parties must be based on mutual respect and confidence in the other party, rather than leave those involved fearful of letting their land or unwilling to invest in their tenanted property.</p><p>The bill will make progress in the right direction, and we are happy to support it, but we must be careful about further reform.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664295", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That was very helpful, but it does not necessarily mean that I have to agree with that view.

I know that a number of MSPs hope to speak in the debate, and I look forward to hearing their contributions.</p><p>I put on record my admiration for the rail action group east of Scotland&#8212;or RAGES as it is known locally&#8212;for its tremendous work and relentless campaigning to bring rail services back to Berwickshire and East Linton. Particular recognition should be given to its chairman Tom Thorburn, vice-chairman Barrie Forrest and secretary Russell Darling. I doubt that the campaign would have had the impact that it has had were it not for their hard work, which has been supported by the RAGES committee.</p><p>That work has also been supported by the wider community, in the form of Coldingham community council, Eyemouth town council, Reston community council and Joyce McLean from Reston. I do not have time to name everyone who is involved, but I am delighted that many of them have been able to join us this evening in the public gallery.</p><p>My motion refers to the need for rail services for Reston and East Linton. However, for the purposes of the debate, I will focus on the case for Reston, as it is in my constituency. I am sure that lain Gray and others will focus on the case for East Linton.</p><p>The eastern Borders and Berwickshire area does not have good transport links and I believe that that is now having a serious impact on the economic viability of the area. Indeed, a recent study highlighted particular concerns around Eyemouth and suggested that it faces the danger of rural marginalisation.</p><p>It is estimated that a train station at Reston could serve a population of approximately 10,000 residents in the eastern Borders, giving those residents easy access to the economic powerhouses of Edinburgh and Newcastle. Young people would be able to stay in the area while commuting to access further education and high- quality, skilled jobs. By offering improved public transport links, those communities would also be able to attract new families who would look to take advantage of the Borders&#8217; quality of life. Crucially, retaining people and attracting new residents would have a knock-on effect on the overall viability of Reston, Eyemouth and other Berwickshire communities. There would be more families to use local schools, spend money in local shops and more generally support the life&#8212;the existence&#8212;of the local community. New businesses would be attracted to the area and there would undoubtedly be huge potential for the untapped local tourism market, not just in Berwickshire but across the Borders, to be exploited.</p><p>We all know that we live in tough economic times and that public money must be spent wisely to ensure good value and maximum public benefit. However, there is no doubt in my mind that extending local train services to Berwickshire and Berwick-upon-Tweed from Edinburgh would be money well spent. I hope that that was evident to the Minister for Housing and Transport during his recent visit to East Lothian and Berwickshire.</p><p>In the limited time available to me I would like to make the following points to the minister. Those who have been involved in the campaign are frustrated by the fact that it will now be necessary to pursue the Scottish transport appraisal guidance 2 appraisal process. The minister&#8217;s predecessor&#8212;with whom we had positive engagement and who visited Reston and East Linton&#8212;made it clear to me, lain Gray, and the other campaigners that a STAG 2 appraisal would not be necessary and that, instead, Transport Scotland would pursue an alternative study into the viability of reintroducing local train services. Frankly, there is no point trying to work out the rights or wrongs of the current position or the reasons for it; I mention the issue only to record officially the frustration that was felt by the campaigners when they were told that much of the work would have to be repeated, and that that would have to be done in a very short timescale.</p><p>To that end, I would be grateful if the minister could give two commitments when he winds up the debate. First, I would like the Scottish Government to give a commitment that it will ensure that Transport Scotland meets the costs of the STAG 2 process. Secondly, I would like a commitment to be made that, within the new rail franchise agreement, the possibility of local rail services returning to Reston and East Linton will be kept open.</p><p>I also say to the minister that it is clear that, unless the project has the political backing of the Scottish National Party Government, it is going nowhere. If the minister believes that the money cannot be found or that the business case cannot be made, I urge him to come clean and say so. Frankly, it is better that the campaigners know where they stand rather than be given false hope.</p><p>The Scottish Government should not fall into the trap of thinking that the Borders railway will be the answer to all the public transport problems in the Borders. I was particularly concerned when the Minister for Housing and Transport stated recently in this Parliament that the Borders railway was the SNP&#8217;s number 1 priority for improving public transport in the Borders. The reality is that the Borders railway will go to Galashiels. It will arguably improve public transport to residents living in and around the central Borders, but it will do nothing to assist communities further afield, such as those in Berwickshire. I hope that the SNP Government understands that every resident in the Borders should be able to access good-quality public transport, not just those living in and around Galashiels. I hope that the minister will also acknowledge that the delivery of local train services to the eastern Borders and East Linton could be achieved at a fraction of the cost of the Borders railway.</p><p>I will finish where I started.

I give my apologies for having to leave the chamber slightly early.</p><p>The recent news that many courts are under threat of closure is worrying for the future of justice in Scotland. It is particularly threatening for the delivery of justice in rural communities such as those in the Borders for which I have the privilege of being the MSP. The potential impact of such closures would have significant implications for ensuring that victims are treated fairly and that justice is delivered in an efficient manner. The effective operation of the court system in Scotland is essential to ensure a fair judicial process for all those who are involved.</p><p>I suggest to Joan McAlpine that the current backlog of more than 14,000 cases surely shows that our justice system cannot accommodate any further reduction in the number of courts.</p><p>We have heard that the Scottish Court Service report proposes closing up to 15 of Scotland&#8217;s 49 sheriff courts. We should remember that rural residents often travel long distances to attend court already. The court closures would affect travel time for witnesses and victims alike, but the change would disproportionately affect people in rural areas. I believe that further serious consideration of the proposals is necessary.</p><p>Another important point is that the Scottish Court Service document has also revealed that the number of sheriff courts hosting jury trials could be reduced from 47 to 14. If fewer than a third of the courts remain in operation, court schedules could be further delayed and there could be little chance of a fair and swift trial. Cases involving jury trials, which often deal with the more serious matters, cannot be taken lightly, and jury trial postponements are already a concern for many under the current system.</p><p>In my constituency, Duns and Selkirk are two of the sheriff courts facing the possibility of closure. As they cover a vast geographical area, they consider a large number of cases. The courts in Scotland that remain open could easily face further backlogs, lessening our citizens&#8217; chances of seeing justice quickly and efficiently.</p><p>As Christine Grahame said, the Lord President gave evidence to the Justice Committee last November. Lord Hamilton gave a number of examples of how the court structure could be reformed. In particular, he noted that sheriff courts and JP courts could be combined in a single building. He also noted, as we have heard, that maintenance costs are rising in court buildings. However, I would say to the Lord President, and indeed to Christine Grahame and others, that that in itself is not sufficient reason to close nearly a third of the sheriff courts in Scotland, particularly given the disproportionate impact of closures on rural areas, such as mine.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662066", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Iain Gray for securing this important debate and giving us the opportunity to raise our concerns about the proposals.

The opinions of the people using the court system must be considered, to ensure that justice is delivered quickly for those accused of crimes, for the victims of crime and for other people using the system.

Aidan O&#8217;Neill QC described this as the worst drafted bill that he had ever seen, and concerns have been raised by the Law Society of Scotland, the Church of Scotland and others, which are all worried about the potential harm that the bill could cause. They agree that bad law is worse than no law.</p><p>There are a number of reasons for that, which my colleague David McLetchie identified. The Scottish Government has failed clearly to define the behaviour that it is trying to criminalise. The SNP has been unable to identify the problem at the heart of the issue, and its members cannot seem to agree on whether it is tackling a religious or a political issue. As such, the Government has produced a catch-all measure that could result in those with innocent intentions being punished by the law.</p><p>There is no clear definition of what constitutes an offence, and many are rightly concerned about what might be caught and become criminal behaviour. Churches throughout Scotland are worried that Christian teachings might be in jeopardy because of the vague definitions in the bill. Other organisations have raised similar concerns. Indeed, when I asked the minister in committee whether the singing of the national anthem would constitute an offence, she was unable to answer me, stating that it would depend on the other circumstances.</p><p>I know that the minister will direct members to the guidelines that support the bill, but that is not the point. The legislation itself must be certain and clear, and it is simply wrong of the Scottish Government to rely on guidelines to deal with the inadequacies in the bill&#8217;s drafting.</p><p>Many are concerned that the bill will impinge greatly on the ability to associate, speak freely and voice opinions with anyone or on any matter. That will inevitably mean that the people who are criminalised are not the individuals who are peddling these unacceptable views but innocent Scots throughout the country who will be seen as committing an offence, despite having honest intentions.</p><p>Although there is an agreement that we must tackle this serious issue, that does not condone the something-must-be-done mentality that the SNP Government has adopted. Existing measures are in place that, if used more effectively, could start to deal with the problem.</p><p>The Justice Committee report called on both the SFA and the SPL to take more action on the issue and it is vital that they now start to do so. Closer working between the two groups in charge of Scottish football could produce a co-ordinated effort to take action against fans who are guilty of sectarianism. As the committee noted in its report, it is highly regrettable that that has not already been achieved and more pressure should and must be put on them to ensure that the issue is dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives will rightly consider any initiative that aims to reduce sectarian behaviour in our society but, having looked at the bill, we think that it has been found wanting. David McLetchie has tried to improve the bill with amendments, but they have been rejected and our concerns remain. We have tried to be reasonable but have been rebuffed by the Scottish Government, which is determined to force through this shoddy bill.</p><p>I therefore urge every MSP to think carefully before voting to approve the bill. If it is to become law, there are real concerns and a real danger that it could end up causing more harm than it does good.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657243", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank my former colleagues on the Justice Committee for their work in scrutinising the bill.

No wonder so many Scots feel that the planning system is stacked against them when it comes to wind farm applications.</p><p>The other frustration that I have is that, by focusing on wind energy, the Scottish Government is failing to plan to provide Scotland with a secure energy supply. We should not forget that nuclear power currently provides a large proportion of our electricity needs, yet the Scottish National Party has no plan for nuclear power in its energy strategy. We should also not forget that nuclear power provides thousands of high-tech jobs, which facilitate the retention of engineering talent within Scotland&#8212;and, more particularly, in my constituency. Despite what the SNP Govermnent might say about the safety of nuclear power, the fact remains that Scotland is one of the world&#8217;s safest nuclear power providers. While the wind may not blow, nuclear provides a reliable and secure energy supply.</p><p>In the remaining time available to me, I want to touch on a couple of economic factors around wind farms. Over the next decade, billions of pounds-worth of taxpayers&#8217; money will be channelled into subsidies for wind farms, effectively raising energy prices for hard-working Scots. Fuel poverty is a serious issue in Scotland. Cold winters coupled with rising energy costs have led many Scots to make difficult choices between essential purchases and staying warm. Questions must be raised about whether it is a good use of taxpayers&#8217; money to support wind energy while pushing up energy prices.</p><p>Lastly, greater consideration needs to be given to the impact of wind farms on our tourism industry. Tourism&#8217;s value to the Scottish economy is comparable to that of energy, yet the relentless push of wind farms puts that in jeopardy. I urge the Government to use common sense in setting targets, because unrealistic targets lead to rushed choices on renewable energy.

Before I do so, however, I want to emphasise the importance of house building and construction to the overall wellbeing of the Scottish economy.</p><p>According to the Scottish Building Federation, the Scottish construction industry workforce has been reduced by 31,000, or 15 per cent, between 2009 and 2011. Private sector construction has been particularly badly hit, with the consequence that the house-building industry has become increasingly dependent on public sector investment for new work. Those in the sector are therefore concerned by the fact that the Scottish Government&#8217;s affordable housing budget faces a cut of 30 per cent between now and 2014-15 and by the impact that that will have on jobs in the construction sector.</p><p>As my colleague Alex Johnstone did, I will mention the importance of the right-to-buy policy and the success that it has been for many people in Scotland. We should not forget the sense of pride that people gain from owning their own homes. Home ownership gives people a stake in the maintenance and improvement of their communities and neighbourhoods. It also fosters social mobility and enables people to build up capital. That is why we believe that as many Scots as possible should have the opportunity to share in the benefits of home ownership. They must include those who live in social housing, which is why we have opposed, and will continue to oppose, the restrictions on the right to buy that the Scottish Government has imposed in order to prevent people from exercising that right. None of us should forget that almost half a million households in Scotland have taken advantage of the right to buy since it was introduced in 1980.</p><p>The policy is about more than allowing people to own their homes; the Scottish Government could use the right to buy as a means to re-energise the Scottish economy. By increasing the available discounts to encourage tenants to buy their own homes, it would increase the funding that would be available for investment in building affordable homes for people on low incomes, which would also boost jobs in the construction sector. I am pleased that British Government has recognised that, but I am disappointed that the Scottish Government has not.</p><p>I will return to the main point of my contribution, which relates to the allocations policy that prevents many RSLs from giving priority to local people when allocating properties. That can often lead to frustration among applicants and anger in communities. Under the current legislation, landlords cannot take into account the length of time for which an applicant has lived in the area. They can give preference to people who reside in the area, but they have to give the same preference to other groups who meet certain criteria&#8212;for example, people who want to move into the area to take up employment. We want social landlords, including councils, to be given greater ability to take into account local connections when deciding on housing applications and transfer requests.</p><p>The situation is a particular concern in rural communities such as those in my constituency. One issue that has been raised with me time and again is the difficulty that people face when they want to apply for a house within their own community, only to find that they are so far down the housing list that it is impossible. The effect of that is to break up communities, to force young people from the communities in which they have grown up and, in the long run, to increase the average age of people who live in more remote areas, which has an obvious impact on provision of services in those communities.</p><p>I am strongly of the view that the Scottish Government should allow social landlords more scope to give extra weight to local connections in allocating houses. That would be a welcome step that would help to ensure that local people have access to local houses. We must do everything that we can to keep rural communities together and to support families who want to move house within their community. Changes to the allocation rules would benefit rural areas such as those in the Borders.</p><p>The debate is a welcome opportunity to highlight the importance of the housing sector to the Scottish economy. Even if ministers do not accept our arguments about the right to buy and the importance of the housing sector, the Scottish Government must surely acknowledge the need to help people to stay in their communities by reforming the allocations procedures.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654922", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will use my contribution to the debate to raise an issue that I am sure many MSPs frequently have to deal with on behalf of their constituents: that is, how local councils and other RSLs allocate houses.

However, it is vital that it recognises that, in keeping our communities safe, this is not the time to be complacent. Although I recognise that the latest crime statistics are, overall, encouraging, there are other trends that the Government must take into account. An increase in violent crimes is unlikely to make people feel safer in their communities. Indeed, the latest Scottish crime and justice survey shows that 87 per cent of people perceive the crime rate in their local area either as having stayed the same or as having gone up in the past two years.</p><p>As the motion highlights, front-line policing is set to face pressure as a result of a reduction in the number of support staff. There are also indications that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will not meet its performance targets. Most worryingly, however, the rates of reoffending remain unacceptably high, and have stayed virtually the same for years. Unless we tackle that issue, we will never properly cut crime rates.</p><p>I will start by dealing with front-line policing. We should not forget that the Scottish Conservatives were responsible for the delivery of the 1,000 extra police officers on our streets. We were pleased to see that commitment extended into the future. However, there seems to be a serious risk of that becoming a public relations exercise rather than a real, visible change in the police presence on our streets. The fall in support staff numbers has led some people to believe that the hole will need to be plugged by front-line police officers. Indeed, the Justice Committee took evidence from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, which has warned the Government that there are likely to be pressures on front-line policing as a result. It is hypocritical to boast about falling crime rates while allowing police officer numbers, which have been instrumental in that fall, to dwindle again.</p><p>I have argued, on several occasions, that the single most important thing to tackle in our justice system is the almost unbelievable rate of reoffending, which is the focus of my amendment. The latest Audit Scotland report shows that 69 per cent of those who were imprisoned in 2009-10 had more than five previous convictions. Reoffending rates have fallen by less than 1 per cent in three years, despite having been a policy priority for several years. It seems clear that something must change. I am sure that the Scottish Government&#8212;indeed, most MSPs of all parties&#8212;will agree that we need to take a different approach.</p><p>I will touch briefly on the need to tackle reoffending through rehabilitation in our prisons.

It is vital that Scotland has a modern, fit-for-purpose prison estate with a focus on rehabilitation. The answer is not simply to abolish the short-term alternatives. We must always ensure that there are sufficient prison spaces to deal with those who are sent to prison by the courts and not try to interfere with courts&#8217; discretion to send people to prison if that is their decision.</p><p>We should not forget that prison terms have several functions.

I want to use my closing remarks to focus on the victims of crime.</p><p>I have always believed that victims should be at the heart of our criminal justice system. A visible police presence is pivotal in giving victims and communities a deserved sense of security, but the other side of the coin is their sense that justice has been done. If there are serious delays in the prosecution of criminals, victims rightly feel disillusioned and disheartened. It is the job of the Scottish Government to ensure that justice is served appropriately and swiftly for the sake of victims and of wider society.</p><p>Despite what the Scottish Government has said, concerns have been raised about the backlog of cases building up at the Crown Office, not least by the Procurators Fiscal Society&#8212;a point that was highlighted well by Alison McInnes.</p><p>I return to community sentences and rehabilitation, which were raised earlier in the debate. The Scottish Government and, it seems, Christine Grahame are great champions of community sentences. We on this side agree that there is a place for community sentences in our justice system, but we strongly oppose the idea that community sentences should be preferred to prison sentences just for the sake of a reduction in prison numbers. Under the current community payback orders, which in effect replace short sentences, those who are being spared jail include a four-time drunk and disqualified driver, a knife carrier, someone who is guilty of domestic violence and a small-time drug pusher, all of whom have previous convictions. What message does that send to the victims of crime and to wider society?</p><p>Scottish Conservatives have never shied away from being tough on crime. We need to make sure that criminals do not get off lightly, for the sake of the victims who need the satisfaction of justice being served appropriately. We also need to ensure that we attempt to rehabilitate those who are convicted of offences, whether that is done in prison or during a community sentence. Reoffending rates suggest that the Scottish Government is failing miserably in that regard.</p><p>We believe that community sentences have to be tough, but there are indications that they are not. A recent freedom of information request revealed that almost a third of offenders who have been given community payback orders do no work whatsoever. There are also clear problems with enforceability of community sentences, as several recent examples illustrate well.</p><p>It is very important that punitive measures be properly enforced. We all remember the case of the first community payback order, which was breached because the offender simply did not show up. That will always be a challenge with community sentences; it does not apply if the person is serving their time behind bars. Overall, short-term sentences offer better punitive measures in some cases and, combined with proper prison rehabilitation, should and can be more effective.</p><p>To conclude, I have always stood proudly on the side of victims and not on the side of the criminal. Our criminal justice system should reflect this; victims should be at the heart of all the Scottish Government&#8217;s policies on criminal justice. First and foremost, we need to address reoffending and tackle crime in order to lower the number of victims and to make sure that victims can rightly gain a sense that justice has been done.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654352", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Keeping Communities Safe"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a useful debate because it has highlighted many concerns that wider Scottish society has about the operation of our criminal justice system.

We had an informative debate on the interim report in June and we are now in a position to look at Lord McCluskey&#8217;s final report.</p><p>I add my appreciation to that of others for the work that Lord McCluskey and his team did in producing the report. Disagreements on the detail of the report&#8217;s conclusions are inevitable, but the report undoubtedly provides a clear and helpful analysis of the issues that are at stake. Unfortunately, many of the Scottish Government&#8217;s pronouncements have been less than helpful. To avoid doubt, we should be clear that the McCluskey review endorsed the proposition that the Supreme Court should retain a jurisdiction in respect of appeals in criminal cases from Scotland when those cases raise questions of compatibility with convention rights.</p><p>The UK Supreme Court acts as a buffer between the High Court and the European Court of Human Rights. It allows human rights issues in controversial criminal cases to be resolved in the UK before the time and resources of an already overburdened international institution are demanded. The cabinet secretary has claimed that referring cases from Scottish courts directly to the European Court of Human Rights would be simpler. Perhaps he should remember that the court in Strasbourg has a backlog of about 150,000 cases and a three to four-year waiting time. If we slowed access to justice through such an approach, we could find that more cases were eligible for appeal.</p><p>When the UK court rules on Scottish cases, it does not judge on the facts of the case or release a proven or not proven verdict. Instead, its remit is restricted to particular points in connection with the European convention on human rights, so the constitutional system provides a more immediate process for interpreting the human rights rules that the ECHR establishes more conveniently than going directly to the European court in Strasbourg.</p><p>The motion rightly mentions the Scottish legal system&#8217;s historic independence and the need to maintain that. I doubt whether any member from any party disagrees with that. However, I gently remind the cabinet secretary that, just as the proudly independent Scottish legal system historically did not exist in a vacuum, so our justice system today must be seen in the context of our national and international legal obligations. That the High Court of Justiciary has a relationship with the UK Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg does not in itself imply that Scotland&#8217;s legal system is in some way bereft of integrity. Rather, it shows that Scotland and her legal system is an independent part of the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p><p>As the Law Society recognises, Scots law has always been outward looking, both in providing a model for other legal systems to follow and in looking to other legal systems for good practice and inspiration. We believe that our legal system is strong because of that willingness to learn from other systems, and the SNP ought to be careful that its political attempts to reduce the UK Supreme Court&#8217;s influence on Scotland do not come at the cost of an effective legal system that provides fair access to justice for all.</p><p>That said, we fully recognise the need to tidy up how the UK Supreme Court engages with Scots law in determining points that relate to human rights. It is to be welcomed that the report underlines the need for coherence in the way in which human rights laws are applied north and south of the border. The UK Government has made it clear that it will review Lord McCluskey&#8217;s recommendations carefully. The Advocate General, Lord Wallace, has met Lord McCluskey to discuss his report and I understand that he will do so again. In clear contrast to the negativity and bickering from the Scottish Government, Her Majesty&#8217;s Government at Westminster has shown that it is prepared to take a responsible and constructive path to ensuring that the integrity and effectiveness of Scots law are respected and maintained.</p><p>As we have seen, the review group recommends in its report that the UK Supreme Court should have the power to rule on human rights issues that arise from Scottish criminal law cases. However, it argues that that should occur only if the High Court of Justiciary permits the appeal. Permission would be granted through a certificate that notes that the case raises a point of general public importance. The Government, which has done all that it can to undermine the integrity of the UK Supreme Court in recent months, has welcomed the proposal with open arms. We in this part of the chamber believe it to be an unnecessary proposal that might have far-reaching negative consequences for access to justice in Scotland.</p><p>The Law Society has also made it clear that it disagrees with the recommendation. Its point is that individuals, whether they are in Scotland or in other parts of the UK, have rights that are particular to the individual and they should not be assessed against such a test. The SNP&#8217;s dogmatic political desire to narrow the UK Supreme Court&#8217;s scope on Scottish matters should not be pursued at the price of restricting full access to justice for Scots.</p><p>As I said, we welcome the work that Lord McCluskey and his team have done on the role of the Supreme Court in relation to Scots law, but we do not accept the spin that the Scottish Government has put on it. We will continue to fight to maintain the integrity of Scottish criminal law, but firmly within the context of Scotland&#8217;s place in the United Kingdom.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-01133.1, to leave out from &#8220;this position&#8221; to second &#8220;criminal cases&#8221; and insert:</p><p>&#8220;the position of the High Court of Justiciary should be maintained in its rightful place at the apex of that system&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Criminal Law (Integrity)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the opportunity for members to look in detail at the final report by Lord McCluskey&#8217;s review group.

Christine Grahame deserves congratulations for bringing it before Parliament.</p><p>The story of broadcasting in the Borders has been mixed in recent years. I will explore some of the background to the debate and consider how we have to got to where we are.</p><p>For almost 50 years, ITV&#8217;s Border Television provided local news and programming to the Scottish Borders, south-west Scotland, north Northumberland, Cumbria and the Isle of Man. It had the second-largest geographical region in the ITV network. Despite the difficulties in catering for such a wide and differing audience, the flagship daily news programme &#8220;Lookaround&#8221; had one of the highest ratings of any BBC or ITV regional news programme in the United Kingdom. Indeed, one survey in 2005 found that, while &#8220;Scotland Today&#8221; and &#8220;North Tonight&#8221; drew a 26 per cent audience share and &#8220;London Tonight&#8221; took a 28 per cent share, Border&#8217;s &#8220;Lookaround&#8221; was watched by a whopping 42 per cent of the population at 6 pm on a weekday evening.</p><p>The affection in which &#8220;Lookaround&#8221; was held by Borderers was further made clear when, in 2007, ITV announced plans to merge Border with Tyne Tees. I remember well in my first few months as a member of this Parliament the volume of correspondence from constituents who were concerned about losing such an important service. Nevertheless, ITV pressed ahead with the merger and, since then, many Borderers have expressed to me their frustration at the reduction of a local service.</p><p>In August, the UK Government announced 65 locations across Britain that could be in the running to run local television services, including nine in Scotland. According to the Government, the locations have been selected because they have appropriate transmitter coverage, and the list will be whittled down further before the final decisions are made. Despite that, I am disappointed that the Borders and the wider south of Scotland are not included for consideration. The roll-out of the new scheme by the UK Government is to be welcomed, but I have made it clear that ideally the proposals should be modified to allow our region to benefit from a genuinely local TV service. My colleague Alex Fergusson and I have made a written submission to the culture secretary Jeremy Hunt on the issue and to ask why the region appears to have been left out.</p><p>The Borders and the wider south of Scotland region are already at a disadvantage due to the poor broadband service in many areas. There are also some concerns about the lack of coverage by STV and the recent decision by Freeview to include the BBC Alba channel at the expense of a number of Scottish digital radio channels, on which many of my constituents relied as their only means of local radio reception.</p><p>I think that we all want local TV to work, but we must also ensure that any local television service is not only local but sufficiently good quality, relevant local TV. I have made clear my disappointment at the Borders being excluded from the list of potential locations for the UK Government&#8217;s proposals, and in my final moments I want to bring to the debate a point that some of the local broadcasters in my constituency have raised with me.</p><p>A number of local reporters have expressed the concern&#8212;which we should all bear in mind&#8212;that there may be a trade-off between scale and quality when it comes to providing relevant local output. When we talk about local news services, we often hear about local television in a United States context, but those examples often cover significant areas of population consisting of several million people. That is clearly not comparable with the situation in the Borders, in Dumfries and Galloway or in other parts in the south. We should therefore be realistic about what we can expect from a local TV news service, and we should bear in mind the advice from the professionals who deal with the work on a day-to-day basis. We have to strike the right balance between scale and quality if we are to move forward effectively.</p><p>I congratulate Christine Grahame again on securing the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653079", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadcasting (Scottish Borders)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in the debate on the important issue of local broadcasting.

How we will do that has been one of the most high-profile issues in recent months. The Scottish Government has made no secret of the fact that such reform is needed. As we have heard today&#8212;and as we have all suspected&#8212;it favours a single police and fire service. It is clear that to make the savings that are required, significant changes are needed in how the police and fire services in Scotland are organised. The harsh reality is that the status quo of separate services is not an option. That is a position on which there is almost complete cross-party consensus.</p><p>We should recognise the progress that has been made in recent years. Today, there are 1,000 more police officers on our streets than there were four years ago. They prevent crime and provide reassurance in our communities. I am very proud of the role that the Scottish Conservatives played in making that achievement, although it is disappointing that certain other parties felt unable to support the provision of those extra officers.</p><p>A key priority for the next five years is to retain those extra officers. We have made it clear that in any restructuring of police forces in Scotland, the priority must be to retain a visible, effective and locally accountable police presence on our streets. Of course none of us wants to be in the position that we are in of having to make cost savings in important public services such as the police, but if savings need to be made, it is preferable that they are made by cutting down on duplication in police headquarters up and down the country rather than by cutting down on front-line policing.

The Government&#8217;s decision to delay the bill will allow us to produce more robust legislation that tackles more effectively the awful problem that affects part of our society.</p><p>We welcome parts of what the Government is doing in the justice system, but it is disappointing that several measures are missing from the legislative programme. One of Scots&#8217; biggest frustrations in relation to our justice system is about sentencing. There is considerable room for improvement in restoring public confidence in the criminal justice system. All too often, criminals are seen to get away with serving sentences that do not come close to matching the crime. We should not be seduced by the view that prison exists only to exact retribution and punishment on criminals and should be used as little as possible.

That much I warmly welcome. However, the issue has undoubtedly become marred in recent weeks by much tub thumping and name calling on the part of the Scottish Government, which has done little to foster the mature debate that we need on such important issues. Whatever the merits of the argument, encouraging incendiary headlines in our newspapers is not the way to conduct a meaningful and rational discussion on an issue of such importance. The Government ought to argue its case on the basis of facts rather than personal slurs on senior Scottish judges.</p><p>We in the Conservatives pay tribute to the talent and service of Lord Rodger, who died earlier this week. Along with his colleague Lord Hope, Lord Rodger served as one of two Scots on the UK Supreme Court. From the tributes that have been paid to him this week, it is clear that Lord Rodger brought a substantial talent to his role. His death is a great loss to the Scots legal profession. In the context of today&#8217;s debate, he brought a great deal of knowledge of the Scots legal system to the Supreme Court.</p><p>We are indebted to Lord McCluskey and his team for their interim report, not least because of the timing demands that the Scottish Government placed on them. They have produced a clear and concise summary of the key issues in a short space of time. However, it is not clear what the Government&#8217;s rush is to have a debate on the issue. Of course it is important, but why not wait for the final report, by which time the review group will have had time to engage properly with experts and stakeholders in the field? Holding a debate when we have only an interim report suggests that things are being rushed for some reason.</p><p>No one denies that there are issues with how the Supreme Court engages with Scots law in determining points that relate to human rights. After all, those issues are hugely complicated, given that they deal with the legal relationship between the High Court, the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. That relationship between the workings of a Scottish court, a UK court and a European court demonstrates simply that Scotland is part of the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Scottish Government is clearly uncomfortable with one of those facts&#8212;for political and ideological reasons&#8212;but they are the facts, and the Scottish Government needs to learn to deal with the national and international legal obligations by which we are bound.</p><p>That said, we fully support any effort to tidy up the way in which our courts operate and to establish the most effective working relationship between the institutions.

We have heard several thoughtful speeches.</p><p>The PCCS was established in 2006 and took over powers to review the handling of complaints about the police on 1 April 2007. As members are aware, the PCCS&#8217;s main function is to review the manner in which a police force or other police authority has handled a complaint from a member of the public. It has the power to direct the relevant police authority to reconsider the complaint.</p><p>The commissioner is appointed by and accountable to the Scottish ministers. The body plays an important role as the organisation that polices the police. In that sense, it is extremely important for police accountability that it is allowed to operate as effectively and independently as possible.</p><p>As we have heard, merging the PCCS with the SPSO has been proposed. The proposals were introduced with good intentions but, as Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s motion suggests, concerns exist about the practicalities of a merger. I will discuss some of those concerns.</p><p>First, from a legal and civil liberties perspective the importance of police complaints demands dedicated and specialised oversight. That is not to say that the SPSO deals with unimportant complaints, but complaints about the police often involve complex legal arguments, so a specialist oversight body is more appropriate. If the PCCS were merged with the SPSO, that specialised oversight would, to an extent, be lost. It is interesting to note that most European countries have a specialised police oversight body. To deal effectively with police complaints requires knowledge of criminal law and procedure, the police misconduct regime and the internal policies and procedures that policing bodies apply to all aspects of policing.</p><p>The concern has been expressed that a transfer would result in the process becoming more complicated for complainers and less effective and efficient. We should remember that the police are here to keep us safe, so we need an effective and efficient organisation that corrects issues that prevent the police from fulfilling their responsibilities.</p><p>The merger&#8217;s appropriateness has also been called into question because of the timing of the proposals. Given the continuing discussions about the future structure of Scotland&#8217;s police forces, it seems unwise to press ahead with major changes to the system for dealing with police complaints when significant changes to the policing structure could be just round the corner. I was pleased that the cabinet secretary recognised that when he told the Justice Committee earlier this week that there should perhaps be a pause while further discussions take place on the future of Scotland&#8217;s police forces.</p><p>As for the PCCS&#8217;s future structure, a discussion must be had about whether to establish some sort of criminal justice complaints body that incorporates not only the police, but prisons and fire services. The Government should consider that when it returns to the proposals.</p><p>Whatever the future structure for dealing with police complaints is, a robust system needs to be in place for dealing with unfounded complaints. Of course, genuine complaints must be dealt with seriously, but unfortunately some people abuse the system in a manner that can be described only as frivolous. Complaints must always be investigated and dealt with, but we must do what we can to avoid the police being distracted from undertaking their important job by those who want to misuse the complaints system.</p><p>We all understand that savings must be made in Government spending. However, who polices the police is crucial to ensuring the safety of the people of Scotland. We all want to keep our police forces as efficient as possible. To do that, we need an organisation that is staffed by law enforcement experts who are devoted to ensuring that Scotland&#8217;s police forces are as professional as possible.

In the limited time that I have available to me this morning, I will focus on three areas of concern: first, the lack of consultation; secondly, the uncertain nature of some of the offences in the bill and the unintended consequences; and thirdly, the wider problem of sectarianism in small parts of our society.</p><p>Concerns have been raised in a number of quarters, both by the Justice Committee and by other individuals and organisations, about the speed with which the bill is being pushed through Parliament. Given the nature of the events that we witnessed at the end of the last football season, it is understandable that the Government wants to move swiftly to address the problem of sectarianism. We have seen some very ugly scenes plastered across our television screens and newspapers in recent months; however, we should not pretend that the problems are new. We should be wary of falling into a pattern of legislating to suit short-term media headlines rather than finding long-term solutions to Scotland&#8217;s problems. Legislation can make a difference, but we have a responsibility to ensure that it is fair, workable and consistent.</p><p>There are also concerns about how the legislation might be interpreted. For example, could a republican Scot claim that someone singing &#8220;God Save the Queen&#8221; was engaging in offensive behaviour under section 1? Despite what the minister has said this morning, neither she nor the Lord Advocate has been able or willing to rule out that possibility, which I still have concerns about. It would be ridiculous if we passed legislation that had the consequence of criminalising those who sing their national anthem.</p><p>Even more than is usual for legislation on criminal behaviour, much will depend on the police&#8217;s and the procurators fiscal&#8217;s interpretation of the law; however, the ambiguity that is allowed for in the bill will make their job extremely difficult. What about songs that have more than one set of lyrics but have been known to be offensive in the past? What about football supporters humming or whistling the tunes of offensive songs without singing any of the words? What about songs that do not refer to religious aggravation but instead celebrate events such as the Ibrox disaster or the death of former prominent players?

The problem of sectarianism in parts of west central Scotland is much bigger and wider than just sectarianism at football matches. The reality is that young men at football matches act in that way as a result of the conditioning that starts at an early age. Certain parts of society&#8212;admittedly small&#8212;in west Scotland have promoted that culture, including partly through our education system. The segregation of our young people brings them up to believe that the two communities should be kept separate. That is something that I know a little about, having been brought up and educated in the system of west central Scotland&#8212;the same system that produced many, if not all, of those who have been responsible for the shocking behaviour that we have witnessed in recent months.</p><p>I am a former pupil of Kilwinning academy&#8212;a school that I am incredibly proud of and which gave me an excellent education, got me into university and probably taught me more about life than many other schools might have done.

Unfortunately, others at my school were less naive. When the old firm played or on dates of historical importance, I clearly remember the stones and eggs that were thrown at the buses ferrying pupils past my school. The pupils in the buses would spit at my classmates as they walked to school. Of course, the school tried to take tough action against those responsible, but when so many are involved in such behaviour, that is extremely difficult.</p><p>The education system in that part of Scotland is effectively the state-sponsored conditioning of those sectarianism attitudes. I say that as someone who believes that as a Christian country we should do more to promote Christian values in our young people and to support religious education in schools. In those small pockets of west central Scotland, those attitudes are being entrenched at home and in the wider community. It was not just football supporters or pubs that were segregated in that way. More respectable institutions such as rotary clubs and golf clubs were split on religious grounds.</p><p>However, we should not be surprised by that, when in west central Scotland we allow our children to be educated into believing that there is something so different about the two religions that pupils cannot be allowed to share the same school building.

The wide-ranging issues that we are discussing are crucial to our country. It is therefore welcome that the Government is taking this opportunity at the start of the parliamentary session to set out its priorities for the coming five years.</p><p>Although the political make-up of the Parliament means that the role of Opposition parties is somewhat different from before the election, I welcome the Government&#8217;s stated desire to work closely with members from all parties. I hope that that responsible approach will be more than warm words and will mean something in practice. My colleagues and I on the Conservative benches will engage fully with the Government on issues where there is common ground, and we will challenge the Government where we feel that it has got things wrong.</p><p>I congratulate Roseanna Cunningham on her new role and I look forward to working constructively with her. Similarly, I welcome Johann Lamont and Alison McInnes to their new roles.</p><p>The issues that will be raised today are of fundamental importance in determining what kind of society we live in, how we prevent crime and how we deal with those who break the law. Too many people in Scotland today feel that the criminal justice system is on the side of the criminal, not the victim. That balance is wrong. I will explore a few key areas where I think that we could do more to restore public confidence in our justice system.</p><p>The first area is policing. We should recognise the progress that has been made in recent years. Today, there are 1,000 more police officers on our streets than there were four years ago, preventing crime and providing reassurance to our communities. I am proud of the role that the Scottish Conservatives played in achieving that, although it is disappointing that certain other parties felt unable to support the extra police officers. A key priority for the next five years is retaining those extra officers. We will push the Government at every opportunity to provide the additional funding to back the policy.</p><p>As members will be aware, there has been a great deal of discussion about the future of police forces in Scotland. We have made it clear that, in any restructuring of the police forces, the priority must be to retain a visible, effective and locally accountable police presence on our streets. None of us wants to be in the position that we are in&#8212;having to make cost savings in important public services such as the police&#8212;but if savings need to be made it is preferable that they are made by cutting duplication in police headquarters up and down the country rather than by cutting front-line policing.</p><p>One of the biggest frustrations that Scots feel with our justice system relates to sentencing, and there is considerable room for improvement in restoring public confidence in the criminal justice system in that regard. We should not be seduced by the view that prison exists only to exact retribution on criminals and to punish them, and that it should be used as little as possible. Putting dangerous criminals in prison means that they cannot terrorise communities and commit more crime, which means that our streets and communities are safer. Prison can and should be the starting point for rehabilitating offenders towards a life free from crime and addiction. We should be aiming to turn criminals from tax burdens into law-abiding, tax-paying citizens.</p><p>Another challenge for the Government is to restore honesty in sentencing. The public and the victims of crime are becoming increasingly exasperated with criminals being let out after serving only a small proportion of their sentence. We have long argued that the situation would be improved by ending automatic early release. The SNP has made the same case over the past few years. It is just a shame that it has not found the time to take action to end automatic early release.</p><p>We believe that the SNP Government was wrong to abolish prison sentences of less than three months. Short-term prison sentences are not appropriate in all situations, but we should leave it to the courts to decide when a prison sentence is necessary. The fact that sheriffs and judges used short sentences highlights the fact that they had little confidence in the community sentences that were provided as an alternative. In some cases, custody is appropriate, as it can provide much-needed respite to a partner in an abusive relationship or can give a family the time to move on with their lives in relative peace.</p><p>More also needs to be done to toughen up community sentences, so that courts and the public have confidence in their effectiveness. Offenders should be carrying out meaningful work so that they are genuinely contributing to society rather than just costing taxpayers money.</p><p>Last, but by no means least, I want to mention drugs and alcohol. It is a sad fact that drugs and alcohol are involved in a large proportion of the crime that takes place in Scotland. If we want to tackle crime and make our streets safer, we need to tackle the blight of drug abuse in communities across Scotland. I am therefore pleased that the Scottish Government listened to our view and introduced a new national drugs strategy, placing an emphasis on abstinence, rehabilitation and recovery rather than dependence. However, a strategy in itself is not enough, and we will watch closely to see that the Government makes good on its promise to overhaul drugs treatment in Scotland. Quite simply, we cannot afford not to address the problem.</p><p>Tackling drugs effectively also means dealing with drug abuse in prison, which is a particularly worrying aspect of the problem. If prison is to be the secure environment that we need it to be to allow those prisoners with a drug problem to get clean, we need to be willing to tackle the issue head-on. The Government should consider introducing drug-free wings in every prison to ensure that those who want to beat their habit are given the best possible chance of doing so.</p><p>We also need to be tough on those who think that they can use prisons to carry on taking and dealing drugs. We remain of the view that the Government should introduce compulsory drug testing for all inmates on arrival and departure from prison. Not only would that prevent the spread of drugs from inmates on arrival, it would send out a message loud and clear that drugs will not be tolerated in our prisons.</p><p>In conclusion, this debate is a helpful opportunity to outline our priorities for improving Scotland&#8217;s justice system in the forthcoming parliamentary session. The decisions that this Parliament will take on the issues will have a direct impact&#8212;positive or negative&#8212;on the people whom we represent, and it is important that we get them right. Our constituents are also concerned about the manner in which decisions are taken. I hope that the Government will continue to consult all political parties from across the chamber to ensure that we come up with the best possible solutions and results for communities.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be able to speak in this important debate this afternoon.

I apologise to the Presiding Officer and other members for having to leave early.</p><p>As all members will be aware, sectarianism has reared its ugly head in parts of our society for hundreds of years. For far too long, it became an accepted part of footballing culture in parts of Scotland. There is no doubt that progress has been made in recent years, and there seems to be a growing determination to rid Scotland of sectarianism once and for all.</p><p>Although sectarianism is not confined to footballing communities in the west of Scotland, unfortunately it manifests itself most publicly there. Recent events both on and off the pitch have provided a terrifying reminder of the problems that the vast majority of responsible Scots who want to tackle the problem head on face. There is no place in a civilised society such as ours for the kind of behaviour that we have witnessed in recent months. However despicable those events have been, they have served to rally the decent majority into condemning what has gone on.</p><p>Too often in the past, discussions of sectarianism have been clouded by apportioning blame or claiming credit for initiatives and strategies. Bob Doris&#8217;s motion is helpful in that it provides a positive approach to how we can tackle sectarianism effectively. It also recognises that we need a long-term strategy to tackle the problem, rather than a short-term answer to the latest media headlines.</p><p>It is important to recognise the work of a number of organisations that have worked with football clubs and communities. They include the anti-sectarianism charity Nil by Mouth and the anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card, both of which have worked tirelessly among schools, football clubs and local communities to change attitudes towards racism and sectarianism. Neil Lennon, Walter Smith and Ally McCoist have also taken a brave stance in criticising the excesses of a minority of their supporters. They should be recognised for that.</p><p>It is right that the Scottish Government should look to strengthen laws on hatred in our football grounds and on the internet. I look forward to Parliament debating those proposals fully in the coming weeks. I welcome the broad thrust of the Government&#8217;s plans and look forward to working constructively as the legislation progresses in Parliament in the next few days. Although it is right for us to make progress, the priority must be to get the new laws right, not merely rushed through. We, like others, have expressed concerns about the lack of time that the Government is leaving for proper scrutiny and debate.</p><p>As my colleague Annabel Goldie has made clear in recent months, we will work constructively to help to create robust laws to help to rid Scotland of this vile problem. The legislation needs to crack down on disorderly and violent behaviour in and around football stadiums, but it is important that it also covers threatening communications that could incite serious violence or religious or racial hatred.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I again congratulate Bob Doris on securing this important debate and apologise to you and the chamber for having to leave early.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648581", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sectarianism and Anti-Irish Racism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

It has taken us some time to get to this point, but I am pleased that at decision time&#8212;the last decision time of this session&#8212;we will vote to enact one of the Scottish Conservatives&#8217; key manifesto pledges from 2007.</p><p>It is important that we record our gratitude to the Scottish Law Commission and the Justice Committee for their hard work in bringing us to where we are today on this subject. The Scottish Government also deserves credit for taking the first step in 2007 by inviting the Scottish Law Commission to review the law in this area.</p><p>There have been some disagreements during the passage of the bill, but the process has generally been marked by consensus and mature debate from all sides in the chamber.</p><p>At this point, I pay tribute to my colleague Bill Aitken; as Richard Baker pointed out, Bill will be standing down from Parliament and will be making his final contribution to Parliament later this morning. Bill Aitken has been a loyal servant to the people of the city of Glasgow for many decades and, more recently, he has been a formidable convener of the Justice Committee. On a personal level, I will certainly miss his advice and constant support and I am sure that everybody wishes him well for his retirement. [Applause.]</p><p>At stage 1, several members detailed the history of the double jeopardy principle. They highlighted the fact that it is not a technical term in Scots law but a principle or rule that has never been formally codified. The principle is good, as the finality of criminal verdicts allows the individuals who are involved in a trial to get on with their lives in the knowledge that the matter has been resolved. It also provides the more general benefit of retaining public confidence in the court system. The double jeopardy rule limits the state&#8217;s reach over individuals&#8217; lives and protects individuals from the stress of repeat trials.</p><p>However, as I said in the stage 1 debate, every good principle ought to have exceptions. Many people consider it to be common sense that, when compelling new evidence of guilt arises that was not available at the time of the original trial, the Crown should be able to bring a new trial. However, as such a step is serious, it is right that it should occur only in exceptional circumstances and for the most serious crimes; otherwise, we risk eroding the integrity of our courts and public confidence in the wider justice system.</p><p>The principles in the bill reflect the interests of not just the accused but the justice system and wider society. As we have seen, it is important for decisions of courts to be upheld and seen to be conclusive. However, it is clear that exceptional circumstances could arise, and our justice system must be capable of dealing with such exceptions.</p><p>We believe that the principle of double jeopardy is right and should continue. However, it should be reformed and restated in Scots law to allow exceptions when new evidence in the form of an admission of guilt or other new and compelling evidence emerges. When we allow exceptions to the principle, we must put safeguards in place. We are satisfied that the bill strikes the right balance between ensuring that we have a fair and effective justice system and protecting the rights of victims and of individuals who are accused of crime.

Too many people live in communities that are blighted by crime. The challenge for the next four years is to step up the fight against lawlessness, antisocial behaviour and violence so that our citizens can live free from crime and free from the fear of crime. The question that we must ask ourselves is this: how can we maintain the service that is provided by the police within the current financial parameters?

I, too, am pleased that consideration of the bill has fostered a constructive approach at all stages from members from all parties. That has continued to be evident during stage 3 proceedings this afternoon and in this final debate. There has been a strong consensus that the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976 should be reformed, but it has taken a great deal of work to arrive at where we are today. The bill was far from perfect at stage 1, but I am pleased that most of the issues have been addressed.</p><p>The present system for damages has a number of flaws, perhaps most notably the delays that families can experience in receiving compensation. One of the bill&#8217;s most important results is that, by and large, relatives who have recently been bereaved will not have to face lengthy court cases at a time when the last thing they need is further undue strain on their families. The bill, which I hope will be passed tonight, will help to speed up the process and allow individuals to rebuild their lives as quickly as possible.</p><p>Mr Butler&#8217;s bill largely implements the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s 2008 &#8220;Report on Damages for Wrongful Death&#8221;. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that a large number of organisations and individuals&#8212;not least the Justice Committee, the Scottish Law Commission and those who gave evidence to the committee at stage 2&#8212;have contributed to the progress of the bill. Although the bill predates my time on the Justice Committee, as the current convener of the committee, I thank my predecessor Bill Aitken, the other committee members and the clerking team for their hard work on it.</p><p>The aim of the bill is to modernise and simplify the law in this area and to ensure that people are entitled to fair compensation. A number of changes were made at stage 2. Generally, those changes make the bill better. The first relates to the provision for calculating an award for damages in relation to non-patrimonial loss. At stage 1, the bill proposed a fixed 25 per cent deduction of the amount that the victim could have been expected to earn or to receive in benefits over the lost period, to represent their living expenses during that time. Concerns were raised that the arbitrary nature of the figure might not allow individual circumstances to be taken into account. I am therefore pleased that a degree of flexibility has been applied to the figure.</p><p>In the stage 1 debate last year, a number of members expressed concerns about the definition of those entitled to a recovery. The bill as introduced would have removed the existing right of certain relatives, beyond those defined as &#8220;immediate family&#8221;, to claim for damages, if they could show that they had been supported by the victim. As was stated during the stage 1 debate, we recognise that a line needs to be drawn to ensure that compensation is directed towards family members, rather than family acquaintances. I am pleased that the definition has been widened to take into account the fact that the nuclear family is not necessarily the norm and that others, such as partners&#8217; children, are now included.</p><p>This has been an informed and mature debate. Again I congratulate Bill Butler on his work and the progress that he has made on the bill. I am pleased that the Scottish Conservatives will support the Damages (Scotland) Bill tonight at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645887", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I begin by stating that we should congratulate Bill Butler on his hard work and commitment and on bringing the bill to its final stages today.

Unfortunately, the then Scottish Executive was not quite ready to engage properly on the issue. I am pleased that we are now at a stage where there is sufficient common ground to allow the matter to be progressed.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge at the outset the work of the Scottish Law Commission in producing the report that underpins what we are considering today. Although the bill is not a carbon copy of the report, it is a product of the commissioners&#8217; hard work, expertise and knowledge, and we are in their debt for their efforts. The Justice Committee&#8217;s report adds further weight to the debate and we should also acknowledge the work that Bill Aitken and his colleagues have done on the bill.</p><p>Members will be aware that, although there has been an established principle for hundreds of years that an individual once tried and convicted or acquitted of an offence should not be subject to another prosecution for the same offence, the rule against double jeopardy has not been enshrined in statute before. We believe that the rule against double jeopardy is an important principle in the operation of our justice system and that it should be codified in statute. The finality of criminal verdicts allows individuals who are involved in a trial to get on with their lives in the knowledge that the matter has been resolved. It also provides a more general benefit in that public confidence in the court system is retained. The rule against double jeopardy also limits the reach of the state over individuals&#8217; lives and protects individuals from the stress of repeat trials. Indeed, the rule is considered so important in the protection of liberty that it is written into the constitutions of many countries including the United States, Japan, Pakistan and South Africa. It is for those reasons that we agree that there should be a general rule against double jeopardy.</p><p>As with every good principle, there should be a few significant exceptions, which are outlined in the Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s report. It seems to me common sense that, if there is compelling new evidence of guilt that was not available at the time of the original trial, the Crown should be able to bring forward a new trial. Given the seriousness of such a step, however, it is right that that should happen only in exceptional circumstances and for the most serious of crimes. It is worth noting that provisions already exist in law for an individual acquitted of an offence to be retried for contempt of court or even perjury if it is clear that their acquittal was based on false evidence.</p><p>There is disagreement over certain exceptions, including the use of evidence that emerges after the trial, the list of offences for which a retrial could be brought and the new law&#8217;s retrospective nature. I am sure that the Justice Committee will examine those details in more detail at stage 2, but there is a clear direction of travel in favour of the bill&#8217;s general principles, which I believe reflect the interests of not just the accused, but the justice system and wider society.</p><p>The Conservatives are particularly pleased to be able to vote for the bill at decision time, as it brings forward a commitment that the Scottish Conservatives set out in their 2007 election manifesto. Indeed, we were the only party to call for these changes at that election although, to its credit, the SNP Government was quick to invite the Scottish Law Commission to review the double jeopardy law in November 2007.</p><p>There are many examples over the centuries of other countries borrowing or copying the better attributes of our legal system. However, in the area that we are debating today, we seem to be following the example of changes that have already been made in other countries. As Richard Baker has already pointed out, in England, the Macpherson report on the investigation into the tragic murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 contained a damning assessment of the role of racism in the Metropolitan Police. However, in that report, Sir William Macpherson also recommended:</p><p>&#8220;That consideration should be given to the Court of Appeal being given power to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is presented.&#8221;</p><p>In 2001, the Law Commission in England and Wales recommended that, in murder cases only, the Court of Appeal should have the power to quash an acquittal if reliable and compelling new evidence of guilt emerged and if a retrial would be in the interests of justice; moreover, in 2003, the Criminal Justice Bill, which reformed the law on double jeopardy, was passed at Westminster. Of course, that is not to say that we should blindly mirror developments in the legal system of England and Wales, but there is an imperative to consider such a change to the law in Scotland, given the nature of the issue and changes in evidence and how it is gathered. I also suggest that victims in Scotland would find it unacceptable that they might be denied the entitlement to justice afforded to those in England and Wales.</p><p>We believe that, although the principle of not being subject to double jeopardy is right and should continue, it should be reformed and restated in Scots law to allow exceptions where new evidence emerges in the form of an admission of guilt or in other new and compelling forms. Clearly, in allowing exceptions to the principle we will have to ensure that there are certain safeguards, but we are satisfied that the bill strikes the right balance between ensuring that we have a fair and effective justice system and protecting the rights of victims and individuals accused of crime.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government introduced the bill.

However, the sad fact is that it has become an all-too-regular part of Scottish society. Indeed, the police currently record on average 142 incidents of domestic abuse each day, despite the efforts of many&#8212;including Government agencies and voluntary groups&#8212;to raise awareness of domestic abuse.</p><p>Because domestic abuse still pervades too much of our society, it is right that we support the main policy objectives of the bill: to increase access to justice for the victims of domestic abuse and to enable the police and prosecutors to provide a more robust response to breached civil protection orders, which, in turn, may deter abusers from further abusive action.</p><p>The Conservatives believe that much of the bill will provide additional protection to victims and send out a strong message that Scotland is taking strong action to address domestic abuse. Therefore, we support its general principles and will support it at decision time.</p><p>I will highlight one issue about which we have concerns: it is important that we state exactly what is meant by domestic abuse. Scotland&#8217;s national strategy to address domestic abuse recognises that domestic abuse can take the form of physical, sexual or mental and emotional abuse. That is important when we remember that we need to tackle not only domestic violence, but the various types of controlling behaviour that can have a terrible effect on relationships.</p><p>Section 4 provides a statutory definition of domestic abuse. There needs to be clarity in the definition, particularly as it might result in criminal sanctions. The Law Society of Scotland has expressed a number of concerns about the proposed definition, particularly in relation to the inclusion of the phrase:</p><p>&#8220;an established relationship of any length&#8221;.</p><p>We are sympathetic to the Law Society&#8217;s view that the definition should perhaps be removed altogether and, instead, the courts should use the broad definition contained in the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001 and the broader general dictionary definition.</p><p>Although figures show that there has been a 4 per cent decrease in incidents of domestic abuse in the past year, the scale of the problem is still staggering. The police recorded more than 50,000 incidents of domestic abuse in 2009-10.</p><p>Anyone can be a victim of domestic abuse, regardless of ethnic background, income, gender or age. However, the statistics tell us that the vast majority of domestic abuse incidents are perpetrated by men against women. As is often the case, such figures do not paint the full picture of the consequences of such behaviour. Each incident is harrowing for the victim and can ruin relationships. Domestic abuse also affects others&#8212;particularly children, who often witness the abuse and can be left with massive emotional and sometimes physical scars.</p><p>I hope that the debate signals that more action to tackle the problem of domestic abuse is required and that the Parliament is taking it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642717", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I pay tribute to Rhoda Grant for bringing this important bill before us.

Section 2 has also been highlighted by a number of members: we, too, have serious concerns about attempts to make legal aid available without means testing. At a time when difficult decisions must be made about the use of public resources, we do not think that that would be a sensible move. There is an argument that, if the financial eligibility test for legal aid in cases involving domestic abuse were removed for pursuers, that would contravene article 6 of the European convention on human rights and the principle of equality of arms. We are not persuaded by the arguments in favour of doing that and do not think that they have any substantial merit, especially as the additional cost to the legal aid account could be significant.</p><p>I have great sympathy with the view that people who need to take legal action to protect themselves from domestic abuse should be able to do so regardless of cost; however, with the legal aid budget coming under pressure in the current financial climate, it is important that we take a responsible view of the use of public funds.</p><p>We believe that passing a new act of Parliament is not the only answer to the problem of domestic abuse.

In order for prosecutions to be successfully brought, our courts need to have confidence in the disposals that are handed down.

Furthermore, the courts need to have access to short-term custodial sentences, which can often provide the respite that victims and families need. Those are, perhaps, arguments for another day, but it is important that we bear in mind the bigger picture, as we consider how best we can effectively tackle domestic abuse.</p><p>Despite some concerns, we will support the bill at decision time tonight.

No one in the chamber will question his good intentions in bringing the bill before us.</p><p>It has already been said many times this afternoon, but is worth repeating, that any form of abuse of those who work with the public is unacceptable. Our principal aim should be to ensure that the law is able to deal with such behaviour as effectively as possible. We will oppose the bill tonight, but not because of any disagreement with the principles behind it. The bill highlights a serious issue, as there are far too many attacks on people who are just doing their jobs, but we are not persuaded that the bill will provide a solution to the problem and believe that it will serve only to complicate the legal framework that already exists to protect people from violence and other abuse. I will expand on those points and consider some possible alternatives.</p><p>Many people in Scotland do jobs where they potentially face threatening or abusive behaviour. Cathy Jamieson and Marilyn Livingstone both highlighted their experiences, and various members have experienced or witnessed people being given a hard time when they are just doing their job. Staff in my constituency office were recently subjected to a horrific experience involving threatening behaviour while they were trying to help a constituent. The case, however, was dealt with by the local police and the matter was brought to court under existing law.</p><p>As in so many areas of the criminal justice system, it is not that we need more law&#8212;far from it. Rather, we need to be better able to enforce the existing legislation.</p><p>The police expressed concerns to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee on the need to prove motivation for aggravated offences. If the bill were enacted, rather than having to prove just the basic offence, the police would need to provide additional evidence to prove motivation. According to the police, that would make it harder, rather than easier, to secure convictions.</p><p>I also agree with the view of the Law Society of Scotland, that the existing common law provides sufficient protection to workers who provide a service to the public, as it takes account of aggravating circumstances. The principle of an independent judiciary means that sheriffs and judges have the flexibility to take various factors into account when deciding a sentence. We erode that principle at our peril.<place-holder colnum=\"31875\"/></p><p>Of course there are exceptions to that. For more than a century, aggravations have existed in our law. It has been generally accepted that police officers, more than any other occupation, get into physical confrontations in the course of their job, but when we continually add various groups to the list of people who are protected by aggravations, we exclude, by definition, other members of society from such protection. I cannot see why there should be any distinction between workers in different sectors. The bill could discriminate between victims of crime on account of their job; that would be a serious mistake for the Parliament to make.</p><p>Mr Henry continues to raise an important issue that we must consider carefully. We must also consider carefully whether the bill is the best tool to achieve the outcome that we all seek. Like the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, I do not believe that it is.

As a constituency member in the Borders, I have regular dealings with the team and know that it works extremely hard to do what it can to find solutions to local problems of antisocial behaviour.

Mike Pringle highlighted the need for reform but expressed the concern that the proposed approach&#8212;particularly in relation to the 25 per cent rule&#8212;might be too simplistic. I share those concerns and am therefore sympathetic to the rebuttable presumption. The Justice Committee's report stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If a rebuttable presumption could be drafted in such a way that it provides flexibility only when it is needed, without undermining the benefits of a fixed deduction in the majority of cases, it might still offer the best way forward.

Section 14 would remove the rights of certain relatives to claim for damages, even if they could show that they had been supported by the victim. Of those who would not be able to claim, the Justice Committee was given the example of a niece or nephew who was supported through university by their aunt or uncle.</p><p>Although we do not want to prevent those who have entitlement to claim from doing so, we also recognise that there is a finite amount of compensation. The Justice Committee report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"real injustice could result if too much were taken away from family members to compensate relatively casual acquaintances.\"</p><p>One way of addressing that problem would be to limit the right to claim to those who are able to establish a substantial loss of support. A definition of \"substantial\" would be required to ensure that the net was not cast too widely or not widely enough, as that could provide further difficulties.</p><p>I am pleased that Bill Butler has indicated a willingness to resolve difficulties with the Scottish Government and others to take matters forward, and I again congratulate him on bringing the bill to this stage.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21142676", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Scotland) Bill:Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a useful debate, and has highlighted the need to reform the way in which Scots law deals with damages.

It was dealt with through the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Act 2007 and the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Act 2009.</p><p>I, too, congratulate Bill Butler on ensuring that his bill has reached stage 1. I commend him for his hard work and the dedication that he has shown on the bill's journey thus far.</p><p>In Scots law, when an individual suffers an injury or contracts a disease as the result of an act or an omission by another person, or as the result of the acts or omissions of a legal entity such as a company, damages can be claimed from the wrongdoer. Damages that are awarded for personal injury are intended to restore the victim to the position that he or she was in before the wrongful act or omission took place, to the extent that a financial award can achieve that aim. It is important to remember that the damages that are awarded are not intended to penalise the wrongdoer.</p><p>The bill implements the Scottish Law Commission's recommendations, which were outlined in its \"Report on Damages for Wrongful Death\". Mr Butler's bill does not differ from the Law Commission's draft bill, which was produced alongside that report, except in one aspect.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives agree with the bill's general principles and will vote in favour of it at decision time. However, the bill is not without its problems, and I will focus on a couple of issues, the first of which is the provision for calculating an award of damages for patrimonial loss&#8212;in Scots law, the sum of money to be paid to the injured party by the responsible party that is over and above the compensation that is paid for injury to feelings or emotional distress. The bill proposes a fixed 25 per cent deduction from the amount that the victim could have been expected to earn or to receive in benefits during the lost period, to represent the victim's living expenses in that time.<place-holder colnum=\"31550\"/></p><p>The proposal is based on the view that a fixed reduction would reduce the need for intrusive questioning about family budgeting and speed up the settlement of claims. Although that is a noble aim, concerns have been raised over the arbitrary nature of a fixed 25 per cent reduction that takes no account of individual circumstances and which could lead to overcompensation in some cases and undercompensation in others. Indeed, it has been suggested that the proposal violates the fundamental principle that a victim should be compensated only for the loss suffered.</p><p>An option that the Justice Committee considered during its stage 1 evidence taking and which the Scottish Government brought forward in its consultation paper was to put the 25 per cent deduction into statute, but as a rebuttable presumption. That appears to be an attractive compromise if it ensures the avoidance of the distress caused when family accounts have to be gone through at a time when relatives feel particularly vulnerable. The proposal would also enable defenders to oppose settlements where the 25 per cent figure was thought not to be appropriate.</p><p>The definition of those entitled to a recovery is another difficult area. The proposal in the bill would remove the existing right of certain relatives, beyond those defined as members of the immediate family, to claim for damages if they could show that they had been supported by the victim. We recognise that a line needs to be drawn to prevent unfounded claims. The compensation is a finite amount of money; it should not be diluted or diverted from family members to compensate casual acquaintances. I believe that more work will need to be done to expand the definition without casting the net too widely.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21142676", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Scotland) Bill:Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The ability of a citizen to recover damages from another person because of an injury or a death that that other person caused involves a controversial area of our law that is certainly not without its failings.

When we hear the word \"veterans\", the common image is of those who have fought in the world wars and are now rather elderly, but in recent years the realities of our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan have meant that the image is changing. Indeed, many of those who are recovering in veterans respite homes across the country are in their early 20s.</p><p>Scotland has a proud military tradition. It is right that we collectively underline our appreciation and admiration for the bravery of our armed forces as a whole.</p><p>It is interesting to hear from other members about their experiences of veterans and veterans groups in different parts of Scotland. As a Borders MSP, I am particularly proud of the contribution that borderers have made, not only to our armed forces but to the cause of veterans. The strength of our armed forces is a result of the bravery of thousands of individuals, and I am proud that hundreds of those brave men and women have come from communities throughout the Borders. Among some of the better-known names from the Borders is the Earl Haig, who dedicated his later life to the welfare of ex-servicemen, travelling extensively throughout the world to promote their interests and to argue for improvements to their welfare. As the founder of the Earl Haig Fund, which is also known as Poppyscotland, he helped to start the tradition that, perhaps more than anything else in the past century, has focused attention on the issue.</p><p>It is clear that, even when not in combat, the military lifestyle is unique in the demands that it places on the lives of service personnel and their families. Whether because of the long periods of deployment, the unusual stresses of the environment in which they work or the risks involved, our service personnel have a unique occupation. Although many manage the transition smoothly, moving from that environment into regular civilian life undoubtedly presents real challenges for many others. That is why it is so important that adequate support is in place to help ex-servicemen and women to integrate back into normal civilian life. As we have heard, the issues affecting ex-servicemen and women are varied.</p><p>I commend Veterans Scotland for its work to promote issues regarding Scotland's veterans. It acts as a co-ordinating voice for the benefit of the ex-service community in Scotland, and it has been <place-holder colnum=\"30830\"/> instrumental in making the Scottish Government listen and learn about the fate of our veterans. It is important to recognise the role of the many local and voluntary organisations that provide daily support to veterans who need or ask for assistance. It is right that those services are provided by a mix of public bodies and charities. The Government cannot and should not try to do everything, and the charities and voluntary groups bring to the table expertise and experience that are invaluable in supporting veterans and their families.</p><p>Assisting those who return from active service has been a challenge to our society for centuries. We should recognise that not enough has been done to support such people in the past. I am pleased that that seems to be changing, perhaps as a result of the current realities of war and the tangible reminder of the debt that we owe to those brave men and women. However, we must not make that a reason for complacency. That is why the debate is important, as it keeps the issue in the public eye.</p><p>People who have put and continue to put their lives on the line for their country should expect the full support of members of the Parliament and our wider society.

That is good for the individual, but it is also good for wider society. Given the high reoffending rates in Scotland, we are probably not getting close to where we need to be on effective rehabilitation. We all acknowledge the need to understand why so many youths end up in the criminal justice system.</p><p>According to the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the environment in which people grow up can result in high levels of communication support needs. As the royal college says, offenders who have communication support needs are less receptive to the rehabilitation programmes that are on offer when they are in prison. That is clearly very concerning. We spend a significant amount of public funds on rehabilitation programmes, but if the royal college is correct they may be having a minimal impact because of the communication disabilities of some of the participants.</p><p>Funding is already tight and will get significantly tighter, so we must ensure that money is spent as wisely as possible. If there is any suggestion that rehabilitation schemes are not as effective as they might be because of other factors, it is important <place-holder colnum=\"29842\"/> that we reprioritise our funding to ensure that those factors are addressed.</p><p>I have visited many prisons in the past few months, including Polmont young offenders institution. It has been apparent to me during those visits that a lot of good work to rehabilitate prisoners is taking place in Scotland's prisons. However, given the high reoffending rates, we need to think carefully about the effectiveness of each scheme.</p><p>We welcomed the Scottish Government's announcement in July that it would improve help for offenders and those at risk of offending to meet their learning and skills needs. Intervening at an early stage to address patterns of offending behaviour must be a priority. We must ensure that young people are re-engaged with the education process and we must help those who are already in the criminal justice system to develop their learning and skills so that they lead a life away from crime when they leave prison.</p><p>We need to go further and faster. Breaking the cycle of crime begins with the children of criminals who are locked up in prison. They are deprived of a parent through no fault of their own and should be a concern to us all. Schools, social services, and voluntary and faith groups should work hard together to divert young and first offenders away from criminality.</p><p>We must do more to tackle crime, particularly with regard to the rehabilitation that we offer and its effectiveness, so that we reduce reoffending rates.

However, it would be wrong to suggest that it was the decision of some foreign court that was imposing its will on Scottish law. I detected more than a hint of that in some of the comments from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice during his various media interviews in the past 24 hours. I do not remember the Scottish National Party raising any of those concerns when the Scotland Act 1998 or the Human Rights Act 1998 were passing through Parliament. We should also remember that the leading judgments were given by Scottish law lords.</p><p>I would like to deal with two points in my speech. The first is the suggestion by some in the legal profession that the Supreme Court's decision is itself not compliant with the human rights convention in so far as it does not apply to all cases, even those that are subject to final determination.</p><p>In my view, that argument flies in the face of the long-established principle of the rule of law, the basic intuition of which is that the law must be capable of guiding those who are subject to it. It must provide certainty and predictability; after all, we must know what the law is if we are to plan our lives and organise our affairs, and that applies as much to public officials as to private individuals. In other words, judicial decisions must enable public officials to administer the criminal law and requiring all judicial decisions in criminal matters to apply to all prior decisions would be a radical departure from the simple truth that lies at the heart of the rule of law.</p><p>That truth is captured in paragraph 103 of Lord Rodger's opinion, in which he cites Chief Justice Murray's judgment in the Supreme Court of Ireland's decision in the Arbour Hill prison case. This useful analysis illustrates not only how the law can effectively operate retrospectively but, more important, how new judgments can affect previously closed cases. Chief Justice Murray said:<place-holder colnum=\"29564\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"No one has ever suggested that every time there is a judicial adjudication clarifying or interpreting the law in a particular manner which could have had some bearing on previous and finally decided cases, civil or criminal, that such cases be reopened or the decisions set aside.\"</p><p>The reason that it has not been suggested is that no legal system comprehends such an absolute or complete retroactive effect of judicial decisions. To do so would render a legal system uncertain, incoherent and dysfunctional, the consequences of which would cause widespread injustices. On that basis, I do not accept the view that the judgment itself should be retrospective in terms of reopening previous cases, and I hope that the legal profession does not use it as the basis for future challenges.</p><p>Of more concern, however, is the SCCRC's position. Does it have the power to reopen closed cases, as is perhaps suggested in the Supreme Court judgment?

The issues at stake in tribunals are important to citizens who rely on their services and the remedies that they offer, so the effective operation of the tribunal system should be important to us all. I will examine how we have arrived at the current situation, the strengths and weaknesses of the current system, and the possible road ahead for administrative justice.</p><p>We should acknowledge the work that has already been done in this policy area&#8212;work that has gone a long way towards informing our debate. In particular, the administrative justice steering group, chaired by Lord Philip, contributed greatly to where we are today. Its remit was to provide advice on the administrative justice framework in Scotland and, in particular, the likely impact of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement <place-holder colnum=\"29190\"/> Act 2007. In the steering group's report, administrative justice is defined as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"initial decision-making by public bodies affecting citizens' rights and interests ...;\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"systems for resolving disputes relating to such decisions and for considering citizens grievances.\"</p><p>We should keep that definition in mind, as it highlights just how significant the subject of our debate is to our society and the people whom we represent.</p><p>We should also acknowledge the role of voluntary groups, citizens advice bureaux and other independent advocates in representing people who have been unfairly dealt with. They are a valuable part of the administrative justice system and play an important role in our society.</p><p>The principle of tribunals is ancient. Indeed, Roman tribunes&#8212;from where the word \"tribunal\" originates&#8212;were elected to protect the rights of the people from arbitrary acts. The tribunal system as we know it grew up on an ad hoc basis during the 20th century. An important landmark was the 1957 Franks report into the abuse of executive authority and maladministration. Critically, it moved tribunals from an executive and administrative model towards a judicial footing, based on the three principles of openness, fairness and impartiality.</p><p>The Lord Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, has outlined plans to create a unified judiciary in England and Wales under the overall leadership of the Lord Chief Justice. That would mean bringing together the administration of the courts and tribunals in England and Wales and would involve primary legislation, which the Lord Chancellor has indicated he is willing to introduce. However, it would also have implications in Scotland, as the senior president of tribunals is a statutory role that has jurisdiction here. The Lord Chancellor has made it clear that any transfer of the senior president's tribunal responsibilities to the Lord President in Scotland should preserve the benefits of the existing arrangements here. I am pleased that constructive discussions have taken place between the UK Ministry of Justice and the Scottish Government, and I hope that ministers will continue to keep members informed of the progress of those discussions.</p><p>Members will be aware from their constituency case loads that public bodies do not always get it right in the delivery of services or the upholding of rights. Indeed, the redress of grievances has been and continues to be one of the main roles of a politician, whether an MP, an MSP, an MEP or a councillor. Having regularly to represent constituents in seeking to redress grievances gives us a good background when it comes to <place-holder colnum=\"29191\"/> legislating to ensure that our system works most effectively.</p><p>As the Philip report highlighted, there should be three aims to administrative justice. First, our focus should be on ensuring that decisions that affect people's rights are correct first time. Secondly, tribunals exist to ensure that, when decisions are incorrect or the treatment of citizens is otherwise defective, there are effective redress mechanisms. Thirdly, public bodies should learn from their mistakes, so as to increase the likelihood of getting it right first time.</p><p>As the Lord Chancellor has indicated, the priority in any transfer of responsibilities should be that we retain the benefits of our system, but we should also seek to improve any areas of it that have been identified as having weaknesses.</p><p>Measured against the aims of the administrative justice system, the Philip report concluded that incorrect initial decisions and other administrative failings are more frequent than they should be. Those decisions affect people's lives, and it is therefore extremely important that as many of those decisions as possible are correct in the first instance.</p><p>On the issue of effective redress, the report concluded that the current system was operating \"tolerably well\", although it had \"important deficiencies\". It identified difficulties in individuals being able to access the means of redress on grounds of cost, lack of expertise and other confusion over the process of some complaints mechanisms.</p><p>Thirdly, the report stated that many organisations are not effective in gathering or implementing feedback that might inform their drive to efficient and correct decision making. Some organisations generate large numbers of complaints every year over a long period with little sign of improvement. That is unacceptable.</p><p>This is a useful debate. I hope that it will inform the future course of action regarding administrative justice. By redressing grievances, tribunals play an important role in our society, and it is right that we should consider ways to ensure that they continue to do so in future. The issues at stake in tribunals are often of great importance to individuals, so ensuring that the system is operating as effectively as possible should be of paramount importance to us.</p><p>As it says in my amendment, when those powers are devolved, we need to ensure that the best possible model is achieved, capturing the best of the existing system while dealing with any existing problems.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-7116.1, to insert at end:<place-holder colnum=\"29192\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\", and further notes that the Lord Chancellor has emphasised that any transfer of powers should seek to preserve the benefits of existing arrangements.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21015188", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunal System Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although a debate on administrative justice and the future of tribunals may not be the most glamorous one that the chamber has ever witnessed, it is an important and timely topic.

It is all too easy to forget the difficult and challenging job that the people who are involved in the forensic service do and the role that they play in the investigation and prevention of crime.</p><p>For many people, their knowledge of forensic services will extend to what they have learned from occasionally tuning into episodes of \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" or watching the actors in white jump suits on \"Taggart\", but to the victims of crime, the role of forensic services is pivotal, as they are involved throughout the process, from the crime scene investigation through to the case being brought to court.</p><p>The passing of the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006 established the Scottish Police Services Authority, under the umbrella of which forensic services have fallen since 2007. The new structure brought together the existing forensic labs, fingerprint bureaux and scene-of-crime offices that were located across the country.</p><p>I have long argued in the Parliament that crime needs to be dealt with swiftly and in an efficient and effective manner. Forensic services play a massive part in ensuring that that happens; they are an imperative part of the process. They ensure that the facts are reliable and are produced in <place-holder colnum=\"28833\"/> time, they give victims the closure that they require, and they ensure that the police and the Crown Office have the information that they need to make appropriate decisions.</p><p>The services that are provided range from crime scene investigators, fingerprinting and DNA testing to drug analysis. Those are vital services that must continue to meet the demands that are put on them by service users. As the SPSA's modernisation paper sets out, demand for the services varies across the country. That variation is down to not just crime patterns and volume, but practices and policies in specific areas.</p><p>The current economic climate holds many challenges and will involve making tough decisions. It is against that backdrop that the SPSA presented its modernisation paper, in which it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We continue to face considerable challenges in the short to medium term at least with likely year-on-year real term reduction to our budget, rising cost (extra inflationary) of consumables and changes to demand that will place significant pressure on our ability to meet financial targets and customer expectations.\"</p><p>Four options are presented, three of which offer alternatives; the other is basically the status quo. Although we realise that spending must and will be reduced, we must strive to reduce it by achieving efficiencies that do little to take away from the vital services that continue to be required. It would be irresponsible simply to look towards the option that saves the most money, regardless of the consequences.</p><p>We accept that it would be wrong to continue with no change, even though that would offer the quickest savings&#8212;it would produce total efficiencies of around &#163;1 million in 2011-12, as opposed to the &#163;140,000 that the other three options would result in&#8212;and we recognise that short-term spend on the evidence management solution will allow for longer-term savings.</p><p>Option three has generated the majority of concerns, as it suggests the closure of facilities in both Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Grampian Police, Northern Constabulary and Lothian and Borders Police have all expressed their alarm at the potential impact that those closures would have on local service delivery. Further concerns have been raised about the loss of specialist jobs. Given that forensics play such a crucial role in the delivery of justice, I must ask what the full consequences of such closures would be, not just for the police, but for the running of courts and, of course, for the wider public's access to swift justice.</p><p>In July, my colleague Mary Scanlon, who will speak later in the debate, lodged a motion that recognised the importance of forensic services to policing and crime detection in the Highlands and <place-holder colnum=\"28834\"/> Islands and the Grampian area, and which highlighted what the closure of the Aberdeen facility would mean for jobs in that area.</p><p>The process that the SPSA has gone through in coming to its recommendation should be transparent, and I am more than a little disappointed that the responses that it received to its paper have not yet been published, although I understand that the SPSA is awaiting authorisation to do so from those who submitted evidence. Furthermore, it appears that we will not find out what recommendation the SPSA has made or how it came to make that decision until the future structure of forensic services in Scotland has been decided, which is also unfortunate.</p><p>A new structure is inevitable, but it must allow the forensic services to continue to provide a first-class service. In my opinion, option two appears to offer the best alternative, in that it would allow services to be maintained across Scotland, thereby protecting access to services for the police and, more widely, access to justice for all. That should be our principal aim.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-7045.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; acknowledges the concerns raised about the loss of specialist jobs, and further notes the concerns of local communities and the police about the proposed changes.\"<place-holder time=\"09:44:00\"/></p><p><a id=\"TOC_SPKR_992a7fe9-2997-43a5-a170-08edf5\" name=\"TOC_SPKR_992a7fe9-2997-43a5-a170-08edf5\"><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): </strong></a> >First, I apologise to members for having to leave before the end of the debate&#8212;I do not usually do that, but I have a long-standing engagement to fulfil this morning.</p><p>This is an important debate on a subject that has been characterised by fixed agendas, inadequate consultation and the wrong priorities. The Scottish Police Services Authority has had, to say the least, a chequered career since its inception, but its record on handling the debate on the future of the forensic services in Scotland must stand at the nadir of its fortunes.</p><p>The SPSA's plans to merge the units at Aberdeen and Dundee go back to 2007. At that time, neither Grampian Police, the Procurator Fiscal Service, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland nor the laboratory staff had been consulted. The users of the service and the people who provide it were left out of the loop. One might imagine that it would be difficult to progress plans in that way, and that any plans that were produced might be a trifle defective.</p><p>After huge local protest, the cabinet secretary&#8212;to his credit&#8212;asked the SPSA to re-examine the issues and engage in fresh consultation. The SPSA then constructed a consultation that merely <place-holder colnum=\"28835\"/> outlined and justified the closure of the Aberdeen laboratory; it did not even include an option for the service to remain in Aberdeen. The Minister for Community Safety described the paper as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a question and answer paper ... not a consultation\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-01-08.13920.1\">[Official Report, 8 January 2009; c 13920.]</citation></p><p>The common feature throughout was that the SPSA regarded the closure of the Aberdeen service as a foregone conclusion. Perhaps uniquely, that botched consultation attracted the condemnation of all parties, including even the Scottish National Party MSPs for the area.</p><p>To echo my earlier intervention on the cabinet secretary, it would be totally amazing if the end result of all that was that there were no forensic services north of Dundee. That is a different proposition to the non-event of services in Inverness, Wick or Dumfries: we do not have such services and nobody is proposing that we should, but that is not to say that we should not have suitable and reasonably accessible services throughout Scotland.</p><p>We eventually got the 2010 proposals, which presented four options, but a proposal to close the forensic unit in Edinburgh had appeared. That seemed to be a rather bizarre result of the way in which thought on the matter had moved forward, and it went against what seemed to be a categorical assurance from the cabinet secretary in answer to a parliamentary question from Mike Pringle in February 2009.</p><p>I say to the cabinet secretary that it is highly unsatisfactory that we do not have the recommendation&#8212;which is a different issue to the Government's response to the recommendation&#8212;today. I accept his assurance that he has not personally received it, although I bet that his officials have received it&#8212;which is not quite the same thing&#8212;and are awaiting the report going to the cabinet secretary.</p><p>Secret government is not the way forward. There is a major debate on the issue, and members must be properly informed about the proposal. It is hardly the full, frank and transparent consultation that the cabinet secretary promised in May 2008.</p><p>There are a number of specific considerations. The first is that a decision to end forensic services in Aberdeen or Edinburgh would be very costly to reverse in the event that the Government and the SPSA got it wrong and it led to the problems that staff have predicted&#8212;and perhaps some that have not been predicted. It has taken some years to build up both the facilities and the staff complement, so there is an element of irreversibility if the decision proceeds in the way that the SPSA appears to wish it to.<place-holder colnum=\"28836\"/></p><p>The second&#8212;and driving&#8212;consideration must be the effectiveness of the service, which is a point that Mike Rumbles has repeatedly made, not least during today's debate. It is clear that police forces have confidence in the current arrangements, but also that there are issues of varying demand and practice that reflect different practices and procedures throughout the country. Both option one and option two in the SPSA's paper progress that consideration with significant annual savings; I am not sure whether the two options are mutually exclusive, or if elements of both could be incorporated. The debate should take place, and the decision should be made, around that consideration.</p><p>The third consideration is the need for timely and local responses to need. Some procedures need to be turned around within hours, as I think Richard Baker said, and that will manifestly not be possible if samples have to be sent from Aberdeen to Dundee or from Edinburgh to Glasgow.</p><p>The fourth consideration is the question of scarce finance. Even in these days of financial pressure, decisions should not be dictated by that concern if the result is otherwise unsatisfactory. All four options&#8212;as has been pointed out in the debate&#8212;offer significant savings on top of the efficiencies that have been obtained in recent years.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat amendment brings out a further aspect, which is the mantra of centralisation that appears in many respects to drive things these days. We see it with the proposals to merge the Scottish police forces into a single Scottish police force, and we see its hidden hand too in the proposals to reduce the number of forensic science laboratories. I say to the cabinet secretary that although those issues cannot be approached dogmatically, Scotland does not suit a one-size-fits-all approach from Government. Centralisation can mean loss of local control and access, and it certainly means the removal of local jobs and services.</p><p>There has been a high-handedness and arbitrariness about the approach to the forensic science laboratories issue. There is a strong sense that people are going through the motions and that there is impatience with the troublesome concerns of democratically elected representatives of the relevant areas from all parties. Even now, as has been mentioned, we are in the ridiculous position of today's debate taking place in a vacuum, because we do not know&#8212;although we can guess&#8212;the recommendation that the SPSA has made to the Scottish Government.</p><p>Members have the opportunity to tell the Government today that that is no way to proceed, that the concerns are not just valid but persuasive, that the loss of local forensic services will damage <place-holder colnum=\"28837\"/> policing in Scotland and that the uncertainty that has dogged the issue for three years should be ended.</p><p>The debate has taken place with the cabinet secretary and members of the Government sitting off to one side, almost as arbiters. They are not: the SPSA is a Government agency that is responsible to the Government, and it is working to a Government agenda. In 2008, the SPSA's director of forensic services stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That's why the Cabinet Secretary has given a clear signal that 'doing nothing' around the existing lab infrastructure is not an option.\"</p><p>If that is not a direction of travel, I do not know what is.</p><p>If that agenda means modernisation, greater efficiency or improved standards, we are with the cabinet secretary. If, as it sounds, it means the closure of local services, the cabinet secretary should be for turning post haste. The debate gives him the opportunity to recognise a mistake in the direction of travel and to act to keep local services throughout Scotland.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-7045.3, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; believes that decisions on the future of the national forensic service should be driven by the quality of the services needed and provided; regrets the history of inadequate consultation and consideration by the SPSA over the structure of the service; deplores the way in which the SPSA regarded the closure of regional services as a foregone conclusion, and considers that the controversy surrounding the issue serves as a warning as to the dangers of dogmatic centralisation.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21005770", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forensic Science Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Labour Party for using its time to debate the future of forensic services in Scotland.

When the minister first introduced the strategy two years ago, he rightly said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there can be few more pressing issues ... than tackling problem drug abuse.\" &#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2008-05-29.9087.3\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 29 May 2008; c 9087.]</citation></p><p>Scotland had then, and has still, more problem drug users per head of population than any other part of the United Kingdom and more than most comparable western countries. Last year, Scotland had 545 drug-related deaths&#8212;more than 10 every week of the year&#8212;and almost 40,000 drug-related offences. Those sobering statistics underline the fact that literally thousands of families are being scarred by drug abuse and its consequences. Nor do those statistics take into account the wider costs to society, both economic and social. Put simply, this is a problem that we cannot afford to avoid any longer.</p><p>As I said, we support the Government's decision to adopt a new drugs strategy based on recovery and leading to abstinence&#8212;not least because we proposed it, and it is the right strategy&#8212;but as Churchill once pointed out,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results\".</p><p>For the drugs strategy, the results matter, given that we are dealing with hundreds of lives every year. So let us look at the results. Although drug deaths are down by 5 per cent, the total is still the second highest on record and is well in line with annual fluctuations.</p><p>It is difficult to paint an accurate picture of drug use across the country, given the illicit nature of the activity, but it is easier to identify trends among members of our prison population, who are subject to regular surveys. I was particularly worried when the cabinet secretary revealed, in a recent answer to a parliamentary question, that the number of prisoners being prescribed methadone has risen by 37 per cent over the past four years. Furthermore, the proportion of prisoners receiving methadone relative to the whole prison population continues to grow. That is a concern, as it suggests that efforts to move drug addicts towards abstinence are not working properly. Some people said that such an increase was a positive step, as <place-holder colnum=\"28530\"/> it might mean that more people are being taken off heroin but, although that might be true, the whole reason why we fought for a new national drugs strategy based on recovery was to use methadone as a stepping stone to abstinence. More recent figures show that 20 per cent of prisoners who are prescribed methadone are on a reducing dose, which means that 80 per cent of such individuals are in effect being parked on methadone and forgotten about. Clearly, more needs to be done to turn the strategy into results on the ground.</p><p>Scotland may have an unenviable reputation for drugs use, but it is certainly far from unique in that respect, so it is important that we learn lessons from other countries in which action has been taken to face up to drug problems. One such example, as my colleague Annabel Goldie has highlighted on previous occasions, is the approach that was adopted in Pennsylvania. The authorities in Pennsylvania recognised that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Eliminating drugs in prisons is a crucial aspect of ensuring that prison order and safety are maintained, but perhaps most important, eliminating the problem ensures that inmates abstain from drugs during the time they serve their sentences&#8212;a necessary first step on the road to long-term abstinence\".</p><p>Almost 10 years on from that brave new approach, Pennsylvania has reported that its prisons are virtually 99 per cent drug free. Imagine that. In Scotland today, the idea of an almost drug-free prison population is a dream. In 1999, Pennsylvania's prisons reported that the number of drug finds as a result of cell searches had dropped 41 per cent, assaults on staff had decreased by 57 per cent and inmate-on-inmate assaults had declined by 70 per cent.</p><p>We have proposed a number of measures that I believe would help us on our way to achieving similar results. All prisoners should be subjected to a drug test on their arrival in jail and subject to random drug testing thereafter. Testing must be comprehensive, robust and consistent. We also want drug-free wings in every institution, where prisoners who want to come off drugs can be removed from the availability and the temptation of drugs.</p><p>We must also recognise that the Government cannot solve the problem alone. The role that is played by voluntary and faith groups in helping the vulnerable is one of the greatest strengths of our society, and it should be recognised and encouraged.</p><p>The job of any responsible Opposition politician is to support the Government when there is common ground and to challenge it when improvement is needed. The Government should be given full credit for introducing the national drugs strategy, and we will support the strategy that we worked to deliver, but we would not be <place-holder colnum=\"28531\"/> doing our job properly and would be doing our country a disservice if we did not challenge the Government to do more to ensure that the strategy is the success that our country desperately needs it to be.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20995658", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome today's debate and the degree of consensus that I hope now surrounds this important issue.

Indeed, some would suggest that effective rehabilitation is not in place for any of our prisoners. It is bizarre to suggest that people can be rehabilitated in their communities based on a few hours of contact each week but that absolutely nothing can be achieved during a short-term sentence in prison. Simply because our prisons are not successfully rehabilitating people during short-term sentences does not mean that we should abolish such sentences completely.

We have supported the need for short-term sentences for many years, and the Government could have had our support today had it not insisted on reinstating the controversial proposals on sentencing.

I am glad that Sheriff Principal Bowen had the foresight to take account <place-holder colnum=\"27746\"/> of the likely stringencies imposed by potential public spending cuts.</p><p>Scotland's sheriff courts are greatly important to our judicial system and, given that business in them is increasing, it is imperative that they work well. The statistics in the review that show that the number of cases heard in sheriff courts has been increasing only underline further the need for a more efficient service.</p><p>We are pleased that the review recommends the introduction of compulsory business meetings to ensure that the Crown and the defence discuss cases at an early stage in proceedings, and I hope that such a move will result in parties being better prepared for court appearances and will lead to a higher number of guilty pleas being made at an earlier stage. I hope, too, that such meetings will ensure that those who are involved in the first diet meeting are focused on their purpose as a clearing house for cases going to trial.</p><p>Evidence from areas in which good communications already exist clearly suggests that early engagement and communication between the Crown and defence help to remove churn and adjournments at first diet and increase the number of section 76 pleas. Under the proposed procedure, parties must at the first diet meeting be in a position to reliably inform the court of their state of preparation for the trial, particularly in relation to the availability of witnesses.</p><p>As Sheriff Principal Bowen makes clear, although the Crown and defence state that they are willing to engage in early discussions, those discussions very often do not occur or are ineffective. I hope that the formal compulsory business meeting between the two parties will increase co-ordination, although I suggest that Sheriff Principal Bowen's claim that it will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"generate a culture of effective engagement beyond the CBM ... for the ... duration of the case\"</p><p>is somewhat optimistic. Similarly, the sheriff principal's stress on the need for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a fundamental change of mindset by the Crown and defence so that they appear for First Diets as fully prepared as possible and do not continue the current practice of seeking continuations to finalise their preparations\"</p><p>could be viewed as too idealistic or optimistic.</p><p>We welcome Sheriff Principal Bowen's analysis of and recommendations on the processing of witnesses, given that the current system in Scotland has been proven to be not particularly cost effective. Indeed, senior police officers have called for reform of the current process, which is based on an ineffective computer system that routinely calls officers to give evidence when they are not required, taking them off the beat and away from protecting communities.<place-holder colnum=\"27747\"/></p><p>The cost of such inefficiency has been millions of pounds of taxpayers' money. In May, Stephen House, the chief constable of Strathclyde Police, Scotland's largest force, revealed that last year his force spent &#163;4 million on extra wages for officers attending court on their days off. On 21 April 2010, an apparently typical day, 312 Strathclyde police witnesses were called to court, but just 10 gave evidence. Moreover, more than a quarter of those who were called were on leave. Chief Constable House then drew comparisons with a similar-sized force, Greater Manchester Police, which spent under &#163;100,000 bringing officers to court. We will all agree that we can learn from other forces about how to work more effectively with the Crown to avoid calling officers to give evidence on rest days and during annual leave. That should not be happening and the Scottish judicial system should be trying to operate as efficiently as possible and to be responsible in its spending and with its organisational structures.</p><p>In that light, we are glad that the review recommends that a witness be cited to give evidence only where it is known that the case will proceed to trial and we welcome the recommendation that greater use be made of stand-by arrangements for witnesses and of means to clarify which witnesses will be required for trial. Such a move will be successful in making Scottish courts more time efficient and cost effective.</p><p>Although issues regarding jurors fall between the scope of the review and the reforms that the Scottish Government is progressing, some of those issues directly affect the efficiency of court procedure. Jury service is an important public duty and, without the attendance of jurors, the justice system could not function. The review illustrates inefficiencies in the jury processes in Scotland, particularly concerning jurors who fail to attend. By not turning up to court after citation, jurors cause more inefficiency and hinder the judicial process. We therefore welcome Sheriff Principal Bowen's recommendation that sheriffs make greater use of the provisions of section 85(6) and 85(7) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, under which fines can be imposed on those who fail to attend court to perform their jury service.</p><p>The evidence that Sheriff Principal Bowen presents for that recommendation is an example of a more efficient judicial process under which such fines were imposed. Not only did that act as a punishment for those who failed to attend, but the resulting media coverage acted as a deterrent to those with similar plans in mind. We recently welcomed the measures in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill to extend the age limit for jurors from 65 to 70. However, we continue to press the Scottish Government to <place-holder colnum=\"27748\"/> extend to 70 the age limit for jurors serving in civil court proceedings.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives welcome the findings of the review and hope that the recommendations are implemented successfully. We believe that the people of Scotland deserve a modernised court system. I hope that we will find agreement that the implementation of the recommendations would result in a more time-efficient and cost-effective service to the people of Scotland.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-6636.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and further recognises that, with constraints on the public expenditure, it is vital to ensure that justice continues to be delivered swiftly and in a cost effective manner.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20862522", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive Question Time &#8212; Health and Wellbeing: \"Independent Review of Sheriff and Jury Procedure\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Conservatives welcome the review of sheriff and jury procedure and, like the Scottish Government, thank Sheriff Principal Bowen for preparing this important report.

We should question whether that is due partly to an increased feeling of confidence about reporting such events. If that is so, we should perhaps be relieved that people who are living in such abusive relationships feel able to come forward and seek help. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of males who have reported domestic abuse. If that is due to better reporting, that should perhaps be welcomed. I welcome it for two reasons: first, because of the bravery that is shown by these men and any victim who tries to break the vicious circle that they have found themselves in; and, secondly, because it shows <place-holder colnum=\"27245\"/> that stereotypes and stigmas are finally starting to be broken.</p><p>In 2008-09, 57 per cent of domestic abuse incidents that were recorded by the police involved a victim who had previously been abused. That is why it is vital that we do everything that we can to encourage victims to come forward, regardless of sex, and support them in making a change.</p><p>The other part of the debate concerns the fact that support has not been made available to male victims of domestic abuse in the same way that it has been for female victims. To follow that point through, does that mean that there has been inadequate provision for female domestic abuse offenders, compared with that which has been in place for males? That is a point that Mary Scanlon raised when the Public Petitions Committee considered this issue.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives are not calling for funding to be withdrawn from services that provide security and support for female victims of domestic abuse, but we can no longer ignore the prevalence of violence against men and not address it.</p><p>Much of the support that is available for domestic abuse victims is targeted at meeting the needs of female victims, because they are the majority and because those who are subjected to domestic abuse require a specific sort of help. However, that latter point also applies to males. The figures show that 43 per cent of men said that their most recent experience of physical domestic abuse was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"just something that happens\",</p><p>in comparison with 14 per cent of women who felt the same way. That percentage of women is far too high, but it is unacceptable, in a modern society, for 43 per cent of male victims to believe that.</p><p>I hope that I have gone some way towards dispelling the myth that seems to persist in some parts of this Parliament that, in supporting provisions that provide help for male victims of domestic abuse, we are in some way not supportive of the provision of support for female victims.

In that respect, the debate has been encouraging, because it has highlighted our consensus that we must face up to the problems and look for a way for society to address them.</p><p>As we have already heard from Murdo Fraser and Mary Scanlon, the Scottish Conservatives believe that many parts of the bill, however well intended, do not address the alcohol problem that we face. Murdo Fraser spoke in detail about the problems with the Scottish Government's proposals to introduce a minimum price per unit of alcohol. We all agree that the price of alcohol will <place-holder colnum=\"27189\"/> be a key part of addressing problem drinking. The difference is that Scottish Conservatives think that it should be targeted through the taxation system. Apart from the fact that the Government remains unwilling to specify the minimum price that it wants to introduce, its proposals would penalise moderate and responsible drinkers while ignoring the real issue of tackling the underlying problems that cause people to drink heavily in the first place. The minimum pricing proposals would punish rather than help those who decide to drink heavily.</p><p>Another key problem with the proposals, and one that would have a particular impact in my constituency in the Borders, is that they would create a new cross-border booze cruise culture. Individuals would be encouraged to buy more alcohol than they had planned if it was at a reduced price across the border. That comes into direct conflict with the initial intention of the bill to reduce the quantity of alcohol that is consumed irresponsibly.</p><p>The new coalition Government at Westminster has made it clear that it is opposed to a system that unfairly penalises responsible drinkers, pubs and important local industries. It would be bizarre for Scotland to introduce a system of minimum pricing that would encourage people to cross the border from Scotland to England, particularly from the Borders and central Scotland, to purchase alcohol. How would I explain to the owner of the local shop in Coldstream, where I live, why the Scottish Government has decided to drive its customers across the border to spend their money in off-licences in England? The minimum pricing proposals would encourage individuals who live in and around the Borders constituencies, such as my own, to make the short journey into English towns such as Cornhill and Berwick-upon-Tweed to purchase their alcohol.</p><p>There is considerable evidence from the Republic of Ireland that individuals are prepared to cross the border into Northern Ireland to make savings on their purchases and there are real concerns that the same behaviour could result in Scotland. Evidence from Ireland has also shown that one in four households have made the short journey across the border into Ulster to purchase alcohol from retailers to take advantage of reduced prices. As Helen Eadie highlighted, Asda's best performing store in the whole of the United Kingdom is in Enniskillen, where alcohol is about 25 per cent cheaper than it is in Dublin, from where many of the customers travel.

As members have heard, we oppose the social responsibility levy, which seems to be an arbitrary punishment on retailers, whether or not they act responsibly&#8212;I was particularly taken by the point that Mr Brown made in his closing remarks. The vast majority of retailers take a keen interest in preventing irresponsible behaviour by their customers; after all, they are often integral parts of the communities that they serve. Such a levy would also threaten to undermine much of the good work that many retailers do in supporting local sports clubs, charities and other organisations. That is another example of where the legislation imposes a blanket penalty, even for those who have a responsible relationship with alcohol&#8212;in this instance, responsible retailers.</p><p>As I said, there are areas of considerable agreement on the way forward. We agree that the practice of selling alcohol at below cost price should end. We also agree that better education on the dangers of binge drinking may be effective. However, it is clear that we really need better enforcement of the existing regulations. For the small number of retailers who flout the law, there should be tougher penalties and a crackdown on breaches of licensing rules.</p><p>Other members have highlighted the bill's intention to allow licensing boards to increase the legal age for buying alcohol in particular areas.

It is wrong that anyone should feel intimidated just for doing his or her job. It is estimated that 38 per cent of people working in a public-facing occupation in Scotland have suffered verbal abuse from a member of the public in the past 12 months. The number of assaults reported against people who are working in local government rose from 9,121 to 9,910 in 2009 alone. The campaigns that have been undertaken by the unions have done much to highlight the fact that antisocial behaviour towards such employees is not only unacceptable but against the law&#8212;and that is the key point: it is already against the law.<place-holder colnum=\"26390\"/></p><p>During the debate on Hugh Henry's motion on the freedom from fear campaign, it was rightly highlighted that the origin of most attacks is connected to the sale of alcohol. The conflict that arises from shopkeepers and shop workers policing the sale of age-restricted products is frequently the starting point of the abuse that they receive.</p><p>Looking at the proposal to introduce a bill to make such attacks an aggravating factor, we need to know how that would fit with other aggravated offences. It is important to say that the courts can and do take account of a wide range of factors, in addition to the type of offence committed, when determining the appropriate sentence for a particular offender. Any previous convictions that the offender may have, their age and their motivation are just some of the factors that the court will consider. The courts might regard some of those as mitigating factors, possibly leading to a lesser sentence, while others might be treated as aggravating factors, possibly leading to a greater sentence. However, we as legislators might decide that to send out a clear message, to courts and to society more generally, a particular factor should be considered as aggravating an offence.</p><p>The concept of creating statutory aggravation for offences committed out of prejudice towards a specific group in our society is not new. We already have legislation for crimes motivated by racial hatred in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. More recently, in section 74 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003, the Scottish Parliament created an aggravation for crimes motivated by religious prejudice. More recently still, we have passed the Offences (Aggravated by Prejudice) (Scotland) Act 2009, which introduced new statutory aggravations that may be applied in cases in which there is evidence that a crime has been motivated by malice or ill will based on the victim's actual or presumed sexual orientation.</p><p>As we have heard from others, the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 created the specific offence of attacking an emergency worker, or someone who is assisting them, who is responding to emergency circumstances. Hugh Henry's proposal would extend the tougher protections in the 2005 act to workers who provide a service to the public and, in so doing, come into face-to-face contact with them.</p><p>My concern is that I do not know where all this will end. To quote from a recent article in <em>The Herald</em>:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If you are white, heterosexual, not religious, don't work for the emergency services and are not disabled, you've just become a minority group in Scotland. In the eyes of the Scottish Parliament, if you belong to the above grouping and you are the victim of an assault - verbal or physical - the courts don't have to treat your attacker as harshly as they would otherwise.\"<place-holder colnum=\"26391\"/></p><p>Like the <em>Herald </em>journalist who wrote that, I am baffled by the approach that we are taking. The victim feels the same pain regardless of whether they fall into any of the categories of aggravation. No group is entitled to any less protection and that means that no group should be entitled to any extra. Indeed, no one, regardless of how we categorise them in society, should have a crime committed against them. The removal of crime from our communities should surely be our objective, rather than the constant addition of aggravating factors.</p><p>Of course, at certain points in history, we need to send out powerful messages that certain behaviour is not acceptable. Clearly, there can be an important role for any legislator in sending out that message. As a general rule, however, we should not use legislation simply as a tool to send out a message. As we said when the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Bill was debated, it would have been much more logical to allow the common law to do what it does best&#8212;providing flexibility of application according to the severity of the offence. The independence of our courts is one of the fundamental principles of our justice system, so we need to be careful not to be seen to be micromanaging the role of judges and sheriffs.</p><p>While I have concerns about the principles behind Hugh Henry's proposed bill, I also foresee serious concerns about some of the specific details of the bill and how it would work in practice. Those concerns might be dealt with when we see the draft bill, but we need to consider carefully how they will be dealt with. In particular, some of the definitions in the bill might be unclear. It is important that legislation is precise enough not to lead to confusion in its interpretation. For example, how would we define a worker who provides a face-to-face service to the public? Would someone who works in a call centre be covered? How about a teacher who is teaching a class of young people? In the age of internet shopping, are we sure that the definitions will be wide enough to cover that and the developments that might happen in future? Is the protection only for those who work in the public sector, or would it extend to those in the private sector?</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20808795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protection for Workers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I commend Hugh Henry for putting this issue on the political agenda, and for the work that he has undertaken to get his bill this far.

I doubt that many of those from mainstream society who like to snort the occasional line think about their actions as helping to fund the drug cartels in Columbia or consider which groups own the poppy fields in Afghanistan.</p><p>There are an estimated 52,000 problem drug users in Scotland and the wider economic and social costs of drug abuse are &#163;2.6 billion. The cost of dealing with drug-related crime is &#163;684 million. We are talking about huge figures. Serious organised crime makes victims out of every single one of us. I am not talking about those who buy the occasional dodgy DVD or a fake handbag&#8212;even those who are not directly involved feel the impact. The cost of fraud to every man, woman and child in Scotland is estimated to be &#163;330 per year so, thus far, in my lifetime, it has cost me just under &#163;11,000. There is therefore a responsibility on everyone, at every level, to ensure that they do not involve themselves in such criminality.</p><p>The Conservative amendment recognises that there is a need continually to adapt the methods that we use to attack serious and organised crime, just as the criminals adapt their methods. The area is constantly evolving, changing and growing and our deterrents and monitoring must do likewise.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives welcome the strategy that was produced by the serious organised crime task force, and of course we welcome the continued co-operation between the different agencies involved. Serious organised crime is a much more sophisticated type of criminality and it takes many guises. We cannot rely on the police or the SCDEA alone to tackle it; a lot of different agencies need to work together, with a joined-up approach, sharing information and having a common goal. Only when we take a more sophisticated attitude to tackling this type of crime can we hope to make progress.</p><p>It is vital that crime is not seen to pay. The problem with serious organised crime is not only that it appears to pay if someone gets away with it, but it pays big bucks. It can be a very tempting road to go down, especially in the current economic climate. We must therefore ensure that people do not see criminality as a viable alternative in order to make ends meet.</p><p>Our young people must be at the forefront of our minds when we think about that challenge, because they are the most vulnerable to being influenced when they see known criminals&#8212;the Mr Bigs&#8212;rolling around in expensive cars, owning a massive home or taking several holidays a year. <place-holder colnum=\"24581\"/></p><p>Our young people need to see healthy, proper role models who have worked hard and legitimately for their outcomes.

Part of our efforts to tackle serious organised crime should be to deter people from getting involved in crime in the first place. The SNP Government, aided and abetted by its friends in the Liberal Democrats, falls short in that regard, especially in the area of sentencing. An end to automatic early release and a return to honesty in sentencing are vital to reinforce the message that crime does not pay. Only then will we send would-be criminals that consistent message.</p><p>It is all well and good to educate people about why crime and serious organised crime is wrong, to share information, to work together and, as the strategy puts it, to divert, disrupt, deter and detect, but unless these people feel the heavy force of the law and are not released on home detention curfew less than halfway through their sentence to continue their activities, I fear that we will not address properly the underlying concerns.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20683362", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious and Organised Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are under no illusion about the damaging effects that serious organised crime has on our society.

I will concentrate on the key role that the post office network plays in rural communities such as those in the Scottish Borders and on what we can do to maintain a sustainable network for future generations.</p><p>I am especially pleased that the motion recognises that post offices are of particular importance in rural areas such as mine in the Borders. Although the figures for the usage of branches in urban areas might be higher than those for rural communities, post office branches in rural towns and villages are often the hub of the local community. That became increasingly apparent during the consultation on the network change programme in 2008. I was contacted by thousands of constituents who were concerned <place-holder colnum=\"23174\"/> about losing their post office branch. Hundreds of residents attended public meetings that were organised in the communities that were affected by the proposed closures. The representatives from the Post Office Ltd were left in no doubt as to the extent to which local residents value the service that they receive at their local post office branch.</p><p>Many people were frustrated that those closure proposals could have left them without local access to services such as benefits and pensions, road tax renewals and general postal services. However, there were also specific situations that were unique to individual communities that highlighted the value of having a local post office. For example, in one town, a large number of small businesses relied on a local and reliable postal service to send out mail orders to customers. In another village, it was clear that the proposals would lead not only to the closure of the post office but to the loss of the local shop, which had become the community hub such was the high regard in which the sub-postmistress was held. Across my constituency, there was a feeling that the proposed changes were another example of the decline in rural communities.</p><p>As is recognised in the recent report by the National Federation of SubPostmasters, the potential for diversification by using the post office network to deliver existing services&#8212;whether from the United Kingdom Government, the Scottish Government or local councils&#8212;is huge. Despite the recent closure of branches, the post office network's unrivalled reach over all parts of the country is a tremendous resource that should be used to its full potential. As the recession forces Governments and local authorities to reassess the way in which services are delivered, the post office network is in a prime position to help to deliver those services.</p><p>Like Christine Grahame, I want to highlight the experience in Wales, where for several years now a post office diversification fund has made available grants of up to &#163;50,000 to branches in the most deprived or most isolated areas. Introducing a similar model in Scotland could encourage enterprise and help to create businesses that are more diverse and, therefore, more resilient to fluctuating trends in the economic cycle.</p><p>To conclude, I am pleased that we have had an opportunity to debate this important topic.

Aberdeen prison is one such establishment. The Scottish Government must find the best and most cost-effective way of improving and potentially expanding the prison estate without compromising safety, security and rehabilitation.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, we do not believe in locking up criminals and throwing away the key. In an ideal world, prisons would not be needed, as there would be no crime, but we are discovering that ideals are not and cannot always be met. As long as there is crime, there will be a need for the disposal of custodial sentences&#8212;even sentences of six months or less, I say to the cabinet secretary. We must ensure that, once people have been sentenced to such punishments, everything is done to attempt to rehabilitate them and give them positive options and choices in life.</p><p>The creation of HMP Grampian at Peterhead may not be ideal. Several MSPs across the <place-holder colnum=\"22688\"/> chamber have highlighted many problems that the move is likely to result in, and we share many of the concerns that have been expressed. The Scottish Government will need to demonstrate how it plans to address those concerns.</p><p>Evidence to the Public Petitions Committee on the petition stated that approximately 80 per cent of those who are serving custodial sentences in HMP Aberdeen are from the Aberdeen area. The cabinet secretary has pointed out that only around 50 per cent of those from the Aberdeen area who are serving a custodial sentence currently do so at HMP Aberdeen. A 70-mile round trip to visit a partner or parent is not an easy journey, especially where public transport links are not great. I know from the prison visits that I have made throughout the country and from talking to prison governors and staff that sometimes the only thing that can pull a person out of the vicious circle of reoffending and a life of crime is their family, particularly their children.</p><p>We recognise all the issues and problems that are raised with relocating the prison at Peterhead. However, the planned prison will allow better access visits for female prisoners and young offenders who are currently held in Cornton Vale, Polmont and Glenochil. The new arrangements will be considerably more convenient for their families. However, I look for an assurance from the Scottish Government that the specialists who are required to deal with such offenders will still be available at HMP Grampian.</p><p>There cannot be a prison in every town and every city, and there will always be difficulties in ensuring that every prisoner's needs are met. It is a question of striking the right balance. I have great sympathy for those who will find it difficult to visit a relative in HMP Grampian and for prisoners who will not have as much access to their families as others, but there is no ideal solution.

The debate has addressed the range of domestic abuse that happens every day and how it affects the women who are the victims and the children and families. It is a distressing fact that in 2009, domestic abuse remains a <place-holder colnum=\"21758\"/> problem that faces a significant number of our population: it is estimated that one in five women in Scotland has experienced domestic abuse at some stage in her life, although&#8212;as Mary Scanlon pointed out&#8212;it is not just women who suffer domestic abuse.</p><p>I pay tribute to the many organisations that work with women, children and men who experience domestic abuse and offer them support, help and hope at what must be the scariest and darkest point of their lives. Despite the efforts that are made by Government agencies and by numerous voluntary organisations, there seems still to be a sector of society in which domestic abuse persists.</p><p>We need therefore to continue to keep the safety of victims&#8212;principally, women and children&#8212;central in our fight against crime. Domestic violence is an atrocious and unjustifiable crime. It is unacceptable and it is a violation of basic human rights. Victims experience not only physical torment; there are psychological and emotional costs, not just directly to the victim but to the children who have to listen to the damaging way in which their father speaks to their mother, or who are terrified to upset their dad because it might result in a beating for their mum.</p><p>As was pointed out by Marlyn Glen and Margaret Mitchell, we need also to be aware of the financial implications for the criminal and civil justice system, the health service, social services and housing. Domestic violence is a heinous crime that impacts on all areas of society. It is therefore especially important that we continue our commitment to ending domestic violence. Everyone deserves a life that is free from fear.</p><p>As we heard from Johann Lamont and Cathy Peattie, domestic abuse affects people regardless of their social background, job, age, ethnic group and ability. Five per cent of victims of domestic abuse are under 18, and 2 per cent are 61 or over. As the minister pointed out, recent statistics show an 8 per cent increase in reported domestic violence over the past year. That figure undoubtedly creates mixed feelings. It is good that more people are reporting domestic abuse and trying to retake control of their lives, but does that figure also mean that domestic abuse is happening more frequently? Taking into consideration that many incidents are never reported, that is a truly saddening figure. On average, women are likely to experience 35 assaults before seeking help. According to statistics that were published last week, 13 per cent of those who recorded incidents of domestic abuse with the police had done so at least 11 times previously. Each day, 147 incidents of domestic abuse are recorded by the police and in 57 per cent&#8212;more than 30,000&#8212;of the cases that <place-holder colnum=\"21759\"/> were recorded last year, the victim had previously recorded incidents of domestic abuse.</p><p>We should, in fighting domestic violence, therefore continue to promote the four Ps&#8212;prevention, protection, provision and participation&#8212;so that we and other groups that are involved in the fight can help those women escape the vicious circle of domestic violence. That is of paramount importance, because women who have experienced abuse are five times more likely to attempt to commit suicide, three times more likely to be diagnosed as being depressed or psychotic, 15 times more likely to abuse alcohol and nine times more likely to abuse drugs.</p><p>As we heard from a number of members, including my colleagues Bill Aitken and Mary Scanlon, the effects on children who live in situations of domestic abuse are profound. In nine out of 10 cases the child is in the same room or the next room when domestic violence takes place, but children do not have to see it to be affected by it. Children who live with domestic violence are at increased risk of behavioural problems and emotional trauma, as well as of mental health difficulties in adult life.</p><p>We need to look more closely at prevention education in relation to domestic violence. A recent Scottish study involving more than 1,300 young people aged 14 to 18 found that one third of young men and a sixth of young women think that the use of violence in intimate relationships is acceptable in certain circumstances. The same study found that 17 per cent of young women had experienced violence or abuse in their relationships with boyfriends. We must therefore continue our efforts to teach boys and girls alike that violence is never acceptable. We must remedy that cultural aberration and end the harmful cycle.</p><p>The work that is done by the domestic abuse courts in Glasgow has brought benefits not only to victims but to families, so the Scottish Conservatives call on the Scottish Government to consider how that can be replicated throughout Scotland.</p><p>I fear that among all our efforts to end domestic violence, the Government's decision to axe short sentences in its Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill will have a negative impact on domestic abuse sufferers. As David McLetchie explained during the stage 1 debate last week, that is an important point. Only 12 per cent of the 5,000 people who were convicted of domestic violence in 2007-08 received custodial sentences, 19 per cent received community sentences, 39 per cent were fined and 29 per cent were merely admonished. As Mr McLetchie noted, if there was ever an argument for short-term sentences, those figures surely provide it. The perpetrators who do <place-holder colnum=\"21760\"/> receive custodial sentences are more often than not repeat offenders. A custodial sentence can provide a much-needed respite for the victims and an opportunity to escape their violent environment. Many women are trapped in a vicious circle of abuse, and it is our duty to provide a criminal justice system that will protect them by not putting their abusers back in their homes.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives believe that domestic abuse is a deplorable and inexcusable crime that continues to have a negative impact on children and families across Scotland. Although legislation definitely has its place in the fight against domestic abuse, the answer does not rest solely in our powers to legislate. We must encourage a cultural shift concerning domestic violence. We must continue to spread the message that domestic abuse&#8212;whether against women, children or men&#8212;is an intolerable violation of human rights that should not be accepted in Scottish society today.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20429456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by apologising to Parliament for my having briefly to leave after the opening speeches in order to meet constituents.

For example, we welcome the moves to crack down on the use in prison of personal <place-holder colnum=\"21589\"/> communication devices, such as mobile phones. I recently visited several prisons and I was struck by the problems that communication devices present to our Scottish Prison Service. Prisoners share the hand-held phone device but have their own SIM cards, which makes detection harder. The use of communication devices in prison enables prisoners to continue their criminal activities as before. My colleague Ted Brocklebank will consider that in detail later.</p><p>We warmly welcome the extension of the upper age limit for jurors. That will bring the law of Scotland into line with that of the rest of the United Kingdom and will create a bigger pool of jurors on which the Scottish Court Service can draw. I anticipate that David McLetchie, who has campaigned hard on the issue since 2005, will have something to say on the matter in his speech.</p><p>I will spend some time focusing on the sentencing provisions in part 1, particularly the creation of community payback orders, and the presumption against short periods of imprisonment or detention. We welcome the creation of CPOs, which will help to simplify the current range of community sentences, but the Government must ensure that CPOs are not only adequately resourced, as the Justice Committee pointed out, but properly enforced.</p><p>Last year, 35 per cent of community service orders were not completed successfully and 35 per cent resulted in a breach application. With statistics like that it is not unsurprising that the public do not have much faith in community sentences, let alone the criminal justice system. The Scottish Conservatives are not anti community sentencing. Believe it or not, we do not want to see more people locked up in prison. We want to stop offending and, more particularly, reoffending. We believe that community sentences can play an important part in our sentencing regime. However, if they are to work, they must be rigorously enforced and complied with.</p><p>We have called for the creation of a community court in Glasgow. Such a court would ensure that justice was served and was seen to be done, and it would give offenders every opportunity to make positive choices, change their lives for the better and get out of the vicious cycle of persistent offending.

The Justice Committee convener mentioned that point. Recently, like other members, I received an e-mail from the Church of Scotland Guild voicing its concerns about the effect that the bill would have on their events and activities. Many local groups run small fairs, coffee mornings and other events at which they invite local businesses to display goods. They also run rallies and ask local bookshops to provide a bookstall during the event. Although the group does not make a profit on many of these occasions, the new licensing <place-holder colnum=\"21591\"/> measures will require the procurement of a licence. Local authorities will have discretion over charging, but there are concerns that groups in different parts of the country may be treated differently&#8212;which could lead to inequality and unfairness&#8212;and that having to get a licence may mean that they will not put on such events in the future. That would be unfortunate for not only the groups, but the local, mostly independent shops, which may suffer a negative impact.</p><p>In addition, the Scottish Sports Association voiced concerns about the impact that the bill would have on its ability to promote sport throughout Scotland. The SSA noted that the bill would make it unviable for sport clubs that work on a not-for-profit basis to continue to promote their activities or raise funds. Many of the funds that clubs receive from the sale of goods to the public are accrued in relatively small amounts. If they are required to obtain a market operators' licence for such fundraising activities, it is clear that the situation may become unviable. We should encourage and not punish clubs that are being proactive in the pursuit of additional funds. The SSA also believes that the measure will act as a deterrent to volunteering. Without the work of many thousands of volunteers, many sports clubs would not survive. Those sports clubs provide coaching, competition and youth development opportunities to local communities. We should help to facilitate such community involvement.</p><p>In September, the Scottish Government published \"On your marks... Get set... Go: A games legacy for Scotland\", in which it stated its ambitions for Scottish sport in the preparation for and years beyond the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. It speaks of a partnership between the Government and groups such as the SSA in delivering those sporting objectives in the community. How can the Government truly support such statements if it then places additional controls and financial burdens on clubs that are working to promote sport throughout Scotland?</p><p>We must recognise the effect that the bill could have on charities and community groups in the hope that we will not hinder their ability to continue to do good work in their local communities.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives will vote for the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill tonight at decision time, but we look forward to seeing the amendments at stage 2 that I am sure will be lodged and which we hope to support.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20410761", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hear members querying my reference to respite.

In that debate I paid tribute&#8212;as did members from all political parties&#8212;to the immensely courageous and selfless devotion of our firefighters. We can never say too much about the job that those brave men and women do every day, or about their ability to take on the changes and the challenges that the service and society have thrown at them in recent years. We should not forget that fire crews risk their lives to save the lives of others.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives welcome the \"Scotland Together\" community fire safety study. The most striking statistic in Her Majesty's fire service inspectorate for Scotland's annual report for 2007-08 was the 62 per cent increase in deaths over the previous year. That figure is shocking and placed Scotland near the bottom of the league tables on fire statistics in Europe. If there is a way in which we can identify a pattern in fire deaths, we should use it to target people in that group with better education and preventive measures. That is not to say that deaths from fires will be completely eradicated. Accidents will always happen, but we should try to reduce risks wherever possible.</p><p>The 62 per cent rise in fire deaths cannot and should not be considered in isolation. Over the past 18 years, the number of fire deaths as a <place-holder colnum=\"21193\"/> whole has decreased. The study states that Scotland's fire and rescue service</p><p class=\"indent\">\"must be commended on their significant progress in reducing these events over many years.\"</p><p>That is undoubtedly true. It also states that a single event can have a high impact on the fire death figures because of the relatively low numbers that are involved. It is therefore correct to suggest&#8212;as the study does&#8212;that we should in the future consider the figures as part of an overall package of statistics.</p><p>It is also worth pointing out that comparisons between Scotland and the rest of Europe are not as black and white as might at first be thought. The report gives the example of the Netherlands, which highlights the considerable inconsistencies in how countries in Europe record the data.</p><p>That said, the report highlights certain fire trends, which can allow our services to focus on problem areas that are within their control, and consider how best to move forward and establish best practice in working with other authorities, agencies and the third sector. To understand fire trends, we must look more widely than fire safety. Health and social factors are identified as key indicators in identifying individuals or groups that may be at risk from fire. For instance, the study concludes that alcohol consumption, smoking, mental health and issues to do with mobility and being older play significant roles in determining the number of people who die as a result of fires each year in Scotland.</p><p>Issues to do with the number of people who live in areas of severe deprivation are shown to impact directly on the number of fire incidents. Given the projected increase in the number of people who live alone and the ageing population, it is likely that Scotland's fire and rescue services will require to direct future strategies, resources and initiatives towards those groups. That said, although the report highlights those issues, it does not say how those factors have impacted on the rise in the number of fire deaths since 2005.</p><p>It is also worth noting from the study that Scotland has a higher rate of secondary fires than the rest of the United Kingdom. The estimated cost in 2004 of each fire and rescue service response for a secondary fire is &#163;2,000, which equates to &#163;61 million per year for the Scottish fire service, based on the service attending an average 30,000 incidents per year. Furthermore, that total does not include any other costs that may be incurred&#8212;not only financial costs, but the costs to communities and the environment. Although we rightly focus on the need to save lives, we should not forget the financial costs involved.<place-holder colnum=\"21194\"/></p><p>I will focus on a couple of points. The Scottish Conservatives welcome the study's recommendation for more formal data sharing across agencies in order to identify better those who are at risk, and for measures to create better fire prevention education and to put in place any initiatives that might be needed. In September, when debating the \"Fire and Rescue Framework for Scotland\", I welcomed the fact that the Scottish Government had committed not to micromanage all the services. I highlighted the differences between fire brigades in city centres such as Maryhill in Glasgow and those in my rural constituency in the Borders. However, I went on to say that the report \"In the Line of Duty\" stated that due to the differences in definitions and recording across the United Kingdom, it is near impossible to create an accurate account of on-duty firefighter fatalities. That, in turn, has meant that there has been very little analysis of the figures or attempts to understand or evaluate the causes.</p><p>The \"Scotland Together\" study has also emphasised the need to create better standardisation and ensure that all the services are discussing best practice, not only in recording statistics from firefighting but across all the areas in which they are now involved.</p><p>The need to work with other agencies on fire safety should be given greater emphasis in strategic planning. The study talks about areas where joint working arrangements and local partnerships have worked and are working extremely well. If we have to look at a way of prescribing standards or creating a framework or strategy to work within, let us first look at where these relationships are well developed, what they are doing right and how it can be further rolled out to suit local needs in other areas of Scotland. We should also not forget the possible role of the third sector in this important area.</p><p>As time appears to be on our side today, I will raise two additional points. I again raise the issue of the impact that the fire safety regulations are having on bed and breakfasts and self-catering accommodation providers throughout Scotland, but particularly in the Borders and in Dumfries and Galloway. I have raised the issue with the minister in the past. The Presiding Officer, Alex Fergusson, has also raised the matter on behalf of a number of his constituents. The concerns centre around the guidance notes on which compliance and enforcement are based and which are resulting, in some cases, in expensive and unnecessary fire safety measures being put in place that are not proportionate to the risks.</p><p>I acknowledge that the regulations were introduced by the previous Liberal-Labour Administration and that the minister has recognised the difficulties that the regulations are <place-holder colnum=\"21195\"/> creating for people who are operating in the sector. However, it would be useful to have an indication from the minister about the direction of travel on those regulations as the industry needs some clarity.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20376086", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Fire Safety"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In September, I spoke in the parliamentary debate on the fire and rescue framework.

It is important that we discuss and give time to these issues, and address how we will continue to support the family unit.</p><p>For the vast majority of us, the family is where we learn fundamental skills for life. Physically, emotionally and socially, it is the context from which the rest of life flows. However, family stability in Scotland, and throughout Britain, has been in continuous decline for many years. Increasingly, adults and children face the challenges of families that are fractured, fatherless and dysfunctional.</p><p>Today, families in Scotland face a range of pressures: unemployment, debt, substance abuse, crime and relationship breakdowns, to name just a few. One in four children in Scotland is growing up without a father and some 200,000 Scottish children are growing up in poverty. Between 40,000 and 60,000 children in Scotland are affected by their parents' drug use and, according to a new report out this week, 137,000 Scots children now have no parent in work.</p><p>As my colleague Liz Smith stated at the start of the debate, we believe that the family is the most important building block in society. We can no longer stand by and do nothing while that important institution is allowed to be undermined. Governments should not dictate to people how they should lead their lives or tell them what to do, but they should encourage what is good for society, address what is negative and support what is positive.</p><p>Today's debate has been about considering what needs to be done to support the stable family formation. Where do we go from today? What is the state of the family unit, particularly in Scotland but also throughout the United Kingdom? Scotland is not alone in having to tackle this problem, but we seem to be alone in western Europe in believing somehow that marriage is just another <place-holder colnum=\"20883\"/> family formation and that it is not relevant or important. Everybody else out there thinks that it is important enough to recognise and celebrate, so we are unique in our approach.</p><p>Also unique to this country is the incredibly high level of family break-ups&#8212;it is way beyond the level anywhere else in western Europe. We have more families breaking up, more lone parents and more teenage pregnancies. If we are doing something right, I would love to know what it is, because nobody else wants to copy what we are doing. I do not believe that anyone here wants to promote that record. It is clear that something is going very wrong.</p><p>The Labour members and others in this chamber might not want to think that it is their problem. However, we are not alone in highlighting these concerns. Tom Harris, the Labour MP for Glasgow South, recently stated on his blog:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I can no longer pretend that the army of teenage mothers living off the state is anything other than a national catastrophe ... Such young women see parenthood as one way of achieving a level of independence and self-worth. And they're right, because that's more or less what they get: a flat and therefore some privacy, an income for the first time in their lives.\"</p><p>We all know that the problem has been getting steadily worse during the past decade, yet Governments here in the Scottish Parliament&#8212;and the Westminster Labour Government in particular&#8212;have failed to stand up and take the action that is required to address it. In fact, Labour has the proud record of making the poorest poorer, of creating greater inequalities and of raising youth unemployment.</p><p>So, what would we do about it and what should the Government, both here and at Westminster, do about it? My colleague Liz Smith has spoken about the importance of improving the parenting skills of parents who need help, and of the need to support the voluntary sector in its work in that area. Believe it or not, some things are better done by the third sector than by the state. She also spoke about the need to improve people's chances of getting back to work by re-energising the jobs market and the economy.</p><p>We heard from Jackson Carlaw about the importance of universal health visitors.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important ways we can help the family unit is by recognising marriage and civil partnerships in the tax system. When people make a public commitment to support each other for better or worse, it is right for the tax system to recognise it. The family structure and process matters. A lifetime commitment can make a significant difference to the behaviours, attitudes and lives of our children, but our tax system does not recognise that or the importance of interdependence between family members and the <place-holder colnum=\"20884\"/> way in which it, in turn, benefits wider society. The couple penalty in tax credits discourages low-income couples from making the move from simply living together to making the commitment of marriage, thus implicating the welfare state in the rise of family breakdown. Indeed, comparative European research indicates that welfare benefits can drive up the number of lone-parent families and encourage solo living. Some countries treat people only as individuals for income tax purposes but most advanced western countries&#8212;such as Germany, France and the United States&#8212;recognise the benefit that marriage brings and reward it in their income tax system. This country should be no different.</p><p>We continue to let down each new generation by not ensuring that those values are carried forward. Our job as politicians is to ensure that we allow our society to respect and encourage the family unit. If we do that, our society will be better off as a result.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20354169", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate on supporting families has allowed us to explore the issues and challenges that impact on almost all of us who live in Scotland today.

People from Poland who have made Scotland their home have shown genuine willingness to integrate into Scottish society&#8212;and have done so with marked success&#8212;while at the same time celebrating their own culture. Their presence has been hugely beneficial to Scotland's economy; they have provided additional skills to the labour market while making an impact on Scotland's culture. Polish restaurants are dotted throughout the country and several areas have Polish festivals. Many football players from Poland play for Scottish clubs. Polish has become the second most spoken language among Scottish schoolchildren. Scotland is an attractive destination for Polish students who want to study abroad, because of our enduring ties with Poland and our strong academic reputation. I am told that there is even a Polish tartan.</p><p>Several Scottish towns and cities are twinned with towns in Poland. Edinburgh is twinned with Krak&#243;w, and Duns in my constituency is twinned with &#379;aga&#324; in the west of Poland. There is a special relationship, which is steeped in history, and we should continue to commemorate and cultivate it.</p><p>As the motion says, on 1 September 1939 three Polish destroyers of the Polish destroyer squadron sailed into Leith. Their presence was one of many Polish presences in Scotland during the second world war. The Polish army made a significant contribution and thousands of its soldiers were stationed in Scotland&#8212;indeed, the majority of Polish soldiers in the United Kingdom were stationed in Scotland. The Polish 1<sup>st</sup> Armoured Division, which was formed by General Maczek, was stationed in the Borders, near Kelso and Duns in my constituency. The division quickly gained a reputation for smartness and efficiency and made a valuable contribution to allied efforts. The Polish Military Staff College, near Peebles, ran air force studies, and an operational training unit for Polish pilots was formed in Grangemouth. Polish pilots fought with the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain and the Polish navy aided the Royal Navy in the battle of the Atlantic&#8212;a plaque that commemorates the Polish sailors who died in the endeavour is on a monument in Prestwick.<place-holder colnum=\"20594\"/></p><p>The presence of Polish people during the second world war not only provided a significant military contribution but introduced many skilled professionals to Scotland, many of whom chose to stay here after the war. As the Soviet Union began to expand its sphere of influence into Poland, Polish people sought refuge in Scotland.</p><p>There is a strong Polish presence in our education establishments. In 1941, the Polish school of medicine was established in Edinburgh to train students from the Polish forces in British methods of medicine. The school closed in 1949, but aspiring medical students from Poland can still benefit from the Polish school of medicine memorial fund, which was established at the University of Edinburgh in 1986. Numerous students at the University of the West of Scotland in Paisley can study at Polish universities in towns such as Warsaw and Krak&#243;w, as a result of links that were cultivated by Professor George Blazyca, who came from Hawick. Examples of such co-operation can be found throughout Scotland, for example at the Glasgow School of Art, the University of Strathclyde and the University of Stirling.</p><p>As a result of the relaxation of EU movement restrictions, at least 60,000 Poles have moved to Scotland during the past four years. Some chose to live in cities but many decided to make their home in more rural parts of Scotland, such as Duns, Kelso, Melrose and Galashiels, in the Borders. Regardless of where they settle, they are often noted for their admirable work ethic and dedication. They have supplied workers to the building and construction and tourism and hospitality industries and to the health services, especially in dentistry&#8212;an area in which their help was much needed. Many young Poles come to Scotland for education. They want to learn English, acquire new skills and gain experience before they return home. That illustrates the evolving nature of the relationship between the two countries.</p><p>The Polish community in Scotland is an important presence. Our relationship with the nation itself is also important. Poland is an important trading partner for Scotland and we should support the nation as it grows and continues to strengthen its economy and democracy. Poland is often our ally in the European Parliament and we should aim to continue such an important relationship.</p><p>From Bonnie Prince Charlie, whose mother was Polish, to Voytek the bear, who was adopted by the Polish soldiers who were living in Scotland, to Polish contributions to medicine, education and business, Scotland's connection with Poland is well established. It is a relationship that we should seek to preserve as both nations benefit from the <place-holder colnum=\"20595\"/> exchange. It is therefore appropriate that the Scottish Parliament should celebrate that connection tonight, and I again commend Shirley-Anne Somerville for securing the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20269526", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish-Polish Connection"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Shirley-Anne Somerville on securing this important debate.

Many changes have been made to the responsibilities of our fire and rescue services since publication of the first framework in 2005 by the previous Government, not least because of the events that unfolded at Glasgow airport in June 2007, when we suddenly became aware of how vulnerable we all can be in the face of a terrorist attack. The way our fire and rescue services responded to that situation was testament not only to the bravery and selfless commitment of their workers, but to the efficiency and adaptability of those services.</p><p>Not long after my election to the Scottish Parliament, I spent a day with firefighters in Hawick in my constituency. It is a day that I will not forget, partly because I was able to fulfil a long-standing ambition to wear a fireman's hat. More important, I was able to experience first hand the dedication of the men and women who are concerned to do their job. Their work involves daily risking their own lives to save others, and it is both physically and emotionally demanding.</p><p>Alongside the stories of the people who are directly involved in the fire and rescue services are those of their families and the impact that working shifts or responding to pagers can have on family life. A friend of mine whose father was a firefighter in Glasgow spoke of how, as a young child, she would wake up in the night worried about her dad on night shift. As she got older, she would check the news each morning to find out whether there had been any big fires that he might have had to respond to. As we thank and pay tribute to all the men and women who work in the fire and rescue services, we should not forget their families.</p><p>Each of the eight Scottish fire and rescue services has its local needs, so I welcome the Scottish Government's commitment not to micromanage all the services. It is easy for me to compare the differences between the fire and rescue services in my more rural constituency with those in the city centre of Glasgow. If I remember correctly from my student days&#8212;which were not all that long ago&#8212;no Saturday night was complete without a 4 am call-out by Maryhill fire brigade to Murano Street halls because a student had decided to have toast after a night out. Each of the 388 fire stations or volunteer units in Scotland, which range from city centre multipump stations to remote rural volunteer units where equipment may be stored in a small garage, needs to have flexibility. It is important that we do not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach.<place-holder colnum=\"19449\"/></p><p>As I have already said, the roles and responsibilities of the fire and rescue services are constantly evolving. No longer do firefighters' duties amount to responding to fires and occasionally getting a cat out of a tree. Fire-raising is an area of recorded crime that continues to rise&#8212;it has risen by 88 per cent over the past 10 years. Fire and rescue services now have to deal with fire-related crimes and antisocial behaviour, so we welcome the Scottish Government's continued emphasis on community safety education and awareness campaigns, and its development of a range of initiatives to help the public understand not only the dangers but the consequences of fire-setting behaviour.</p><p>Another way in which our fire and rescue services have had to evolve is that they must be ready to deal with major incidents that result from terrorism or extreme weather. I am reassured to see that a review of existing resilience capabilities is being undertaken, with a view to enabling the Scottish fire and rescue advisory unit to assess regularly the total level of resilience capability.</p><p>Although I have emphasised the importance of flexibility and of local services being adjusted to local needs, there are some matters in which it is important that we take a national approach. We must be assured that if another major incident were ever to take place in Scotland, the eight authorities would have a consistent and joined-up approach. Eight fire and rescue authorities doing things in eight different ways could create major difficulties and compromise safety.</p><p>We welcome the Scottish Government's commitment to ensuring that high-quality training and support are provided, but those training opportunities must be rolled out across Scotland and must not be focused only on particular authorities. We need to be sure that when new recruits begin their work, their training and development is continued and supported to the same standards, regardless of where they are located.</p><p>In March this year, I lodged a motion on the FBU's report \"In the Line of Duty\". I am pleased to say that it rightly received cross-party support. The safety of our fire and rescue services is an issue that should bypass party politics. The report said that because different definitions and recording methods are used across the UK, it is nearly impossible to create an accurate record of on-duty firefighter fatalities. That has meant that very little analysis has been done of the figures, and that there has been little by way of an attempt to understand or evaluate the causes of those fatalities. Standardisation in recording and investigation of fatalities and injuries to firefighters could prevent future deaths. It is important that our fire and rescue service authorities communicate <place-holder colnum=\"19450\"/> with one another, not just across Scotland but across the UK.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives will support the Scottish Government's motion. We agree with the principles of reducing risk, responding effectively and improving the safety of communities, which can be done more effectively by giving fire and rescue services the freedom to address local needs and by looking at where the services can work together and learn from each other.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire and Rescue Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I endorse the comments of the minister and others on the tragic loss of Ewan Williamson.

I will certainly not forget being told by my father, as he <place-holder colnum=\"19068\"/> collected me and my brothers from the school Christmas disco, that a plane had come down in the small Borders town of Lockerbie. When we arrived home, the television news showed the flames licking around the homes on Sherwood Crescent.</p><p>As a 12-year-old, I could not have imagined the horror of what happened to those poor souls as they fell from the sky. Although the passengers would have lost consciousness through lack of oxygen, forensic examiners believe that some of them might have regained consciousness as they fell to lower altitudes. One forensic scientist told Scottish police that he believed that the flight crew, some of the flight attendants and 147 other passengers survived the bomb blast and might have been alive on impact. None of those people showed signs of injury from the explosion itself or from the decompression and disintegration of the aircraft. For many days, Lockerbie residents lived with the sight of bodies in their gardens and streets as forensic workers photographed and tagged the location of each body, to help to determine the exact position and force of the on-board explosion.</p><p>Mr al-Megrahi was convicted of that horrific crime on 31 January 2001 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. We should not forget that fact.</p><p>The Scottish Government and others, most notably in the BBC, have stated that most of the Scottish families affected were in favour of Mr al-Megrahi's release on compassionate grounds. While it is correct to say that the small number of family members who have chosen to speak out are indeed in favour, it is important to record that most people in Lockerbie would prefer to keep their counsel and say nothing. It is therefore wrong to misrepresent the views of those who were so horrifically affected by the events of 1988. Saying nothing is not the same as agreeing with the release of Mr al-Megrahi.</p><p>The debate has been useful in that it has allowed members to explore ideas in depth. That was not possible during the questions that followed the ministerial statement last week. More questions have been raised since the statement was made, particularly in light of information in the documents that were released yesterday. I hope that the First Minister will use his closing remarks to answer some of the many key points that remain unanswered. For example, why did Mr MacAskill reject the option of keeping Mr al-Megrahi in Scotland, when the police had indicated that they would deal with him if required to do so, and given that Mr MacAskill said that cost was not a consideration? Did the Scottish Government know that a UK Government minister had suggested that the Prime Minister did not want Mr al-Megrahi to die in prison? Did the <place-holder colnum=\"19069\"/> cabinet secretary or his officials leak to the <em>Sunday Post</em> or the BBC the story that Mr al-Megrahi was to be released several days before the official announcements?</p><p>I find it bizarre that Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been unable to say what he thinks about the ruling on Mr al-Megrahi, when so many people in other countries have commented on the Scottish Government's decision. He can find time to write a glowing eulogy for an American senator, he can comment on the death of reality TV celebrity Jade Goody and he can take time out to appear on \"American Idol\", but he cannot find time to comment on the release of the only man to be convicted of the worst terrorist attack on British soil. The decision has international ramifications and Gordon Brown should be more forthright and honest about what he thinks.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has made much of the fact that it was for him to decide whether to allow Mr al-Megrahi to go free. He has said on numerous occasions during the past two weeks that the decision was his alone. Of course it was legally the decision of the cabinet secretary; I do not dispute that he was the man who was permitted in law to make the decision. However, we need to know more about the motivation behind Mr MacAskill's final decision. I think that most members think that the decision was wrong and that Mr al-Megrahi should not have been released. For that reason, the Salmond Government has not done enough to prove that its decision to release that mass murderer was based on sound evidence and advice.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173555", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi (Decision)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members have said, it is important that we do not forget the horror that unfolded on the night of Wednesday 21 December 1988.

Social workers throughout Scotland provide much-needed care to the more vulnerable members of our society. They are the people working day in, day out with the elderly, dysfunctional families, substance misusers, vulnerable children and others who are in need of professional support. Statistics show that one in eight people have used social work services, which proves that social work affects many more lives than is often assumed. Nevertheless, the public image and perception of social workers often fails to reflect the importance of their role. I am therefore pleased that more is being done to address that important issue.</p><p>Media coverage of tragedies in recent years, such as the cases of Baby P or, in my area of the Borders, Miss X, has created an atmosphere of terror among many social workers. It has instilled a fear that they might be wrongly blamed when something bad happens. Media speculation and inaccuracies&#8212;even storylines in television programmes&#8212;generate myths about the profession. The increasing blame that is placed at the door of social workers reduces morale and the number of people who apply for jobs in this very necessary field. We heard today that 7 per cent of social work posts in Scotland are vacant.</p><p>Of course, when a tragedy occurs, it is only right to hold an inquiry into what went wrong, so that we can learn from the mistakes and make the appropriate changes. However, social workers do not stand and operate alone; they co-operate daily with the police, health services and local authorities, so responsibility for cases that go wrong must be shared.</p><p>Occasionally, we hear a hero story about the police, doctors, nurses or teachers, amid negative coverage. Social workers seem to feature in the news only when things go wrong. Incidents are reported with such ferocity that the whole profession is tarred. However, for every one bad news story, social workers ensure that thousands of children are helped, thousands of families are <place-holder colnum=\"18825\"/> supported and thousands of lives are improved. The social work changes lives campaign highlights the unsung heroes in our society who work constantly and quietly for our benefit, to make Scotland safer, healthier and better. The campaign challenges a deep-rooted attitude that will take some time to shift.</p><p>The social welfare system in Scotland is among the best in the world. The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and the decision in 2002 to give free personal care to older people are examples of that.

I acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of a number of residents of Berwickshire, together with one of the Chirnside general practitioners. However, I know that the debate has much wider significance and involves many communities throughout Scotland.</p><p>The focus of the debate and the point of concern is the suitability and robustness of the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995, which provide the framework against which NHS boards consider pharmacy applications. The issue is not whether community pharmacists should be allowed to operate at all, or whether in every case a dispensing GP practice is better than a community pharmacy. The question is how the regulations operate and their ability to produce the best outcome for each individual community.</p><p>It is important to understand how we have arrived at the present situation. Changes to the pharmacy contract in 2006 allowed community pharmacies to provide additional services over and above the traditional dispensing activities. In general, that has made community pharmacies much more profitable as businesses. The result is that more pharmacy applications are being made in smaller communities such as Chirnside that were not previously a viable business location and in which patients are currently served by a dispensing practice. Under the current regulations, dispensing practices are not allowed to offer the same breadth of services as pharmacies can. The regulations, which control the pharmacy application process, were to be updated with the introduction of the new pharmacy contract in 2006, <place-holder colnum=\"18500\"/> but so far they have not been altered since 1995, despite the considerable changes that have been introduced by the new contract. A review of the regulations is therefore long overdue. I will return to that point later.</p><p>One of the greatest failures of the regulations is that dispensing practices are excluded from the NHS boards' pharmaceutical care services planning process. A GP's right to dispense has no legislative protection and can be withdrawn by the NHS board at any time. When a pharmacy application is accepted, the dispensing practice can lose its right to dispense with immediate effect. That sudden impact on income can have a considerable effect on the practice and its patients.</p><p>When a practice loses its right to dispense, the patients in the community will gain access to a community pharmacy service, but that could come at the cost of losing valuable GP services or, in some cases, a branch surgery, leaving the population without a comprehensive GP service. The Minister for Public Health and Sport has disputed that point in the past. However, I have spoken to a pharmacist who is also a GP, and she is clear that if the dispensing income goes, it is very likely that staff will lose their jobs and the practice infrastructure could be in danger. At a time when many rural communities have already lost many services, such as their local post office, it is important that other vital services are not lost.</p><p>What needs to be done to address the concerns that exist? The Scottish Government has announced that it intends to review the regulations. I welcome that, but a number of points need to be addressed in that review. I am sure that other members will deal with that matter, so I will deal with three principal issues in the limited time that is available to me.</p><p>First, it is essential that patients and dispensing doctors are allowed to participate in the pharmacy applications process. In Chirnside, there was great frustration that the views of local residents were not actively considered. More than 1,100 people signed a petition and more than 600 people wrote letters to NHS Borders about the application. The failure to address those concerns adequately completely undermined the decision-making process. The Government has acknowledged that problem in the consolidated regulations by putting a duty on NHS boards to take reasonable steps to consult on applications, but more needs to be done.</p><p>Secondly, the regulations must more clearly dictate the applications process. I will not dwell too much on that point in relation to Chirnside because of the possibility of a judicial review, but it was clear to me that there was considerable uncertainty throughout the process at the highest <place-holder colnum=\"18501\"/> levels in the health board about how the process was to be managed. For example, why can only one application be considered at any one time when nothing in the regulations requires that? That approach was adopted in the Borders. When that point was tested, the GPs were told that it was due to custom and practice. With so few applications under the regulations, it is hard to know what custom and practice were being relied on. Surely there is no reason why competing applications cannot be considered at the same time. Indeed, in 1995, NHS Borders heard two pharmacy applications on the same day in respect of Greenlaw, which is also in my constituency. However, that precedent was not followed.</p><p>Thirdly, there is confusion about whether the regulations prevent the dispensing GPs from continuing to dispense even once a community pharmacy application has been successful. The British Medical Association has recommended that once a practice has lost its right to dispense, there should be a transition process to allow practices to plan for future service provision. However, in correspondence with me, the minister stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the decision to allow a pharmacy to open does not of itself require the dispensing practice to cease dispensing\".</p><p>It would be useful if the minister were to clarify that point in her closing remarks. It would also be useful to know why the market for pharmacy services needs to be restricted in the way that the regulations anticipate. In the Chirnside case, which I know most about, why cannot the GPs continue to dispense either as dispensing GPs or with their own community pharmacy in competition with the new operator? Why should the market be restricted by the way in which the 1995 regulations are being interpreted?</p><p>Although any review may not be able to unpick the questionable decisions that have already been made, a review can deal with some of the on-going issues that face GPs in my constituency to ensure their long-term survival and the continuation of the tremendous medical services that are provided in the district of Chirnside.

The quality of evidence throughout and the measured and reasonable contributions from witnesses during the bill's earlier stages are to be commended.</p><p>The bill provides important clarification in a number of complex and delicate areas relating to sexual offences and the law of rape. The law on rape and other sexual offences has been long overdue for clarification and updating. As Nigel <place-holder colnum=\"18215\"/> Don said, academics and petitioners have been critical of the Scots law on rape for many years.</p><p>The bill undoubtedly modernises the law on rape and sexual offences. Creating a non-gendered approach to rape and widening its definition will, we hope, create a more supportive environment in which victims can come forward. The inclusion in the bill of other forms of sexual penetration, including the use of an implement, is appropriate, and that will be seen as an important step in the evolution of the law on rape and sexual offences.</p><p>By addressing offences committed on mentally disordered persons and children and offences committed by people who are deemed to be in a position of trust, the bill provides a voice for vulnerable sections of society who are less able to speak out for themselves. Although we acknowledge that children are maturing earlier, it is right that the age of consent has been kept at 16 and that there will be legal consequences for those who do not abide by that law. That view is supported by church groups and others, and it was appropriate for the Scottish Government to retain in the bill the option of criminal prosecution for consensual penetrative sexual conduct between older children.</p><p>Once it is enacted, the bill will go a long way to addressing and changing the blame culture that surrounds rape and sexual offences in our society. The view that women might invite rape by wearing revealing clothes or by being flirtatious, or if they are drunk, must be completely rejected&#8212;a point that was made by Johann Lamont.</p><p>Some problems in this area of law will remain harder to solve. For example, the definition of consent as \"free agreement\" does not eliminate the issue that the line between true consent and submission is still somewhat elusive. It is likely that problems will always occur in this complex area of the law. The bill is a step in the right direction, clarifying definitions and providing support for a wider range of victims, but it is important to acknowledge that more is to be done outside the legal arena to tackle attitudes towards the victims of rape.

One of the most striking features of hate crime is its ability to affect not only an individual but an entire community of people who find themselves turned into victims because of another's intolerance. A culture of fear is created in a community&#8212;a fear because a part of someone's identity that is beyond their control is hated by another. Behaviour of that sort is unacceptable.</p><p>We already have statutory aggravations for offences that are motivated out of prejudice of some kind. The offence of racial hatred was created in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 at Westminster, and the offence of religious prejudice was created in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003, which my colleague David McLetchie talked about eloquently during the stage 1 debate on this bill.</p><p>As Robert Brown and others have said, the flexibility of the common law allows aggravating factors to be taken into account. Why, then, do we need to create statutory aggravations for sexual orientation, transgender identity and disability?</p><p>The first reason is that, although the common law exists, it is not being enforced. Evidence that was presented to the Justice Committee demonstrated that, although the law was available to deal with aggravations, it was very rarely used, and few people who were subjected to hate crimes had experienced its use. The creation of aggravated offences sends out a clear message that society will not tolerate such an expression of hatred. Hatred itself is not criminal. We cannot police people's thoughts, and we should not limit freedom of expression, but we can target and highlight criminal conduct that is motivated by such hatred. The legislation will give specific recognition to victims who are targeted as a result of hatred of their actual or presumed disability, transgender identity or sexual orientation. It will also bring our law into line with that of the rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p>As Patrick Harvie stated, the bill will also ensure the accurate recording of aggravated offences of the types that are mentioned in the bill. Until now, that has not been particularly robust, as those offences have been recorded as breaches of the peace or assaults. We cannot deal with a problem effectively until we know its full extent. The recording of this kind of information will give those who deal with crime far more insight into the motivation behind the crimes and will place them in a more powerful position to tackle them.<place-holder colnum=\"18121\"/></p><p>Attitudes may be constrained by laws and sometimes led by them but, ultimately, it is only by fostering a shared feeling of responsibility that we can promote a tolerant society where people are considerate towards others and their feelings, and where they exercise judgment in what they say and do. However, as Michael McMahon pointed out, we should not believe that laws are a panacea. We will never outlaw hate, any more than we can outlaw anger, but we can set a careful framework to outlaw hatred that does harm, while protecting fundamental liberties.</p><p>We are happy to confirm that we will be supporting the bill tonight.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15023911", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I congratulate Patrick Harvie on bringing this bill to stage 3.

Criminals must learn that crime does not pay, but taking that lesson and turning it into a positive venture for our young people is very powerful indeed.</p><p>It is important that we encourage our children and young people and direct them to take part in positive community activities. All too often, the lifestyles of those who are involved in criminal activities can look tempting to our young people: nice house, big car, money to burn and what is perceived to be the respect of the community but is much more often fear. In times of economic hardship, what may appear to be a quick and easy way to make money will be all too tempting to many.</p><p>Our young people have energy to burn, and the different activities and schemes that are on offer allow them to focus that energy in rewarding and positive ways. In the Borders, for example, cashback for communities money is helping to fund Selkirk Dry Bar Association's drop-in youth centre for 12 to 18-year-olds, which has games, computers and music, and provides other activities such as dance and movement workshops, visits to other places and a cookery course that covers everything from cooking to shopping and budgeting. The cashback for communities programme is also providing the &#163;2 million that has been invested in sports facilities in and around deprived areas and the &#163;1.4 million that has been invested to deliver free rugby playing and coaching opportunities.</p><p>As Bob Doris has pointed out, with the London Olympics looming and the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth games only five years away, cashback for communities money gives us a great chance to engage with our future athletes, to educate them about healthy lifestyle choices and to help to develop their sporting abilities.</p><p>An important by-product of the scheme is that it brings positive role models to the attention of children and places them at the forefront of their minds. Many of our children are brought up in areas where, as I have said, fear is mistaken for respect and the local gang leaders or Mr Bigs are the only ones with money and commodities. In those areas, crime becomes a viable employment choice and is run like a business. When there are no other obvious options, why would a child aspire to anything else?</p><p>Crime does not pay&#8212;that is the message that the Government needs to send out. Last year, the Crown Office reported that it had recovered almost &#163;23.5 million since the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 came into force. We congratulate the Crown Office on that, and on the important work that it <place-holder colnum=\"18032\"/> and the Procurator Fiscal Service do in recovering ill-gotten gains. However, we must go further.</p><p>Serious organised crime is a major problem in Scotland. Our police and the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency do a great job in tracking down people who attempt to shroud themselves in legitimate business ventures and hide behind layers of criminals, thinking themselves untouchable. The best lesson that we can teach our children is that such people are not untouchable and that they cannot be protected by their assets.</p><p>Those people deal in human misery, exposing children to drugs and exploiting vulnerable people through prostitution or trafficking, and we need to launch a fresh offensive. As members, such as Margaret Curran and Michael Matheson, have said, we need to consider what is being done in other countries, such as Canada, and particularly Ireland, where the Criminal Assets Bureau uses a multi-agency, multi-disciplinary approach and, most important, the onus is on the criminal to prove that their assets were got through legitimate means, rather than the burden of proof being on the prosecuting authority, which is the situation that our Crown Office is in.</p><p>The cashback scheme is a worthwhile venture and it is making a difference, showing young people that crime and antisocial behaviour are not the way forward and opening up a range of options and vocations and a different kind of future for many of our young people.

However, it is important to remember that Gerry and Kate McCann are not the only parents who have been left inconsolable by the disappearance of a child.</p><p>I know that Gerry and Kate McCann have studied best practice in the United States, which is internationally acknowledged to be the world leader in recovering missing children. Since 2003, nearly 400 abducted children in America have been recovered, and Belgium and France have now adopted the American approach. Some 80 per cent of abducted children in the US are recovered within the crucial first 72 hours. Early intervention is the key.</p><p>We welcome the European Parliament's April resolution to adopt the written Declaration of the European Parliament on Emergency Cooperation in Recovering Missing Children. We should record that it was my colleague Struan Stevenson MEP who initially proposed the written declaration in the European Parliament, before it was jointly sponsored by Edward McMillan-Scott, who is a Conservative, Diana Wallis, who is a Liberal Democrat, and Labour's Glenys Kinnock. Having spoken to Edward McMillan-Scott this morning, I know that he is particularly appreciative of the <place-holder colnum=\"17914\"/> support that Glenys Kinnock provided in her capacity as chairman of the all-party rights of the child group.</p><p>However, more must be done, particularly in relation to the setting up of a missing child hotline, the Amber alert system and a European child resource and policy unit. The Amber alert system in the United States is named after a nine-year-old who was killed by her abductor. It operates like a severe weather warning, with an alert bulletin that is issued following the suspected abduction of a child. The alerts are distributed by the emergency alert system via commercial radio stations, satellite radio stations, television stations and cable TV, as well as e-mail, electronic traffic-condition signs, LED billboards and wireless device short messaging systems text messages.</p><p>In France, a similar system has been adopted. In the handful of cases in which it has been used, it has been 100 per cent successful. Once the local police decide to issue an alert, a centre in the Ministry of Justice in Paris activates it within 30 minutes. Belgium has a similar system.</p><p>It is important to note that, in the US, there is growing concern among advocates for missing children that the public are becoming desensitised to Amber alerts as a result of the high number of false alarms. A false alarm is defined as the issuing by the police of an Amber alert without strict adherence to the US Department of Justice's activation guidelines. Any similar system that is adopted in Europe or, indeed, in Scotland will have to ensure that alerts are issued in the correct circumstances.</p><p>Children go missing for many reasons. The Children's Society estimates that 130,000 children run away, are ejected from home, are abducted or&#8212;worse&#8212;are injured or killed in the UK each year. Unfortunately, we have no agreed definition of a missing child. The police make no distinction between missing adults and missing children. Also, despite a guidance note that was issued in 2005, each police force operates a different system. Although not mentioned in the motion, that is another issue that must be addressed.</p><p>The European Commission is responsible for the establishment of an emergency number for missing children&#8212;the 116 000 number. However, only four countries, which do not include the UK, have adopted it thus far. The McCanns want to see a European children's centre, similar to the centre in Washington, bringing together Governments, the police and the voluntary sector in a united front to progress work on, for example, the elimination of layers of frustrating bureaucracy and duplication of work. Such a centre would provide a single focal point for data collection, drafting of policies and public communication on all aspects of policy.<place-holder colnum=\"17915\"/></p><p>The Children Act 1989, which was introduced by Margaret Thatcher and was probably the most far-reaching and progressive legislation in Europe, made the interests of the child paramount and gave them the right to be heard in the UK courts and to have independent legal representation.

Last week, Mr McArthur and I had the opportunity to meet many <place-holder colnum=\"17902\"/> of the sheep that will be affected by the proposals as we crossed the southern upland way during the Poppyscotland hearts and heroes challenge. I was certainly reminded of the importance of sheep to the Borders' rural economy.</p><p>The compulsory electronic identification of sheep has been raised with me a number of times by representatives of my local NFU and individual farmers in my Borders constituency. As members have pointed out, the proposals will be costly and impractical for the farmers who will be forced to comply with them.</p><p>We should recognise that there is cross-party support in the UK for the view that the EU proposals should be voluntary at most and certainly not compulsory. With nearly 33 million sheep&#8212;and 90,000 producers&#8212;the UK accounts for one third of the entire EU sheep flock; Scotland has more than 7 million sheep and the nation's sheep farming sector is worth an estimated &#163;150 million to the economy. As a result, the industry plays a vital role in maintaining the landscape and economy of Scotland's hills and uplands.</p><p>We should acknowledge the pressures that the industry has faced in recent years. In the past 12 months alone, sheep numbers in Scotland have dropped by 368,000 and, in the past nine years, there has been a 24.5 per cent decline in the number of breeding ewes. With that backdrop, it is clear to me that the regulations make no sense and might actually decimate the sheep industry, devastating the environment and the rural economy.</p><p>The additional costs that are involved in the scheme, coupled with the recording requirements, will force many producers out of business while having absolutely no cost benefit. Indeed, much of the cost will fall on the farmers, with the benefits being delivered further down the chain to the markets and processors. Farmers throughout Britain will be expected to cover 92 per cent of the estimated &#163;65 million costs, while markets and collection centres will contribute 5 per cent and slaughterhouses 3 per cent.</p><p>The NFU has expressed concern about the standard of the current equipment, which a number of members have mentioned; the available training; and the scheme's workability on farms, which will be a particular challenge to maintaining individual identities within large flocks. Some of those concerns will be resolved as the technology develops and as volume production reduces costs, but some concerns about the regulations are so fundamental that it is hard to see how they can be overcome.</p><p>I will not repeat what other members have said, but I would be grateful if the minister would respond to the following points. First, like Liam <place-holder colnum=\"17903\"/> McArthur and other members, I am interested in finding out what discussions the Scottish Government has had with the UK Government and other member states as they attempt to persuade their politicians of the dangers of the regulations. Secondly&#8212;perhaps more important&#8212;I understand from correspondence with the Scottish Government that the intention is to introduce the regulations in a negative instrument. Does the Government intend to impose the regulations? If not, can the minister explain the Government's strategy in that respect?</p><p>Again, I thank Liam McArthur for securing this important debate, which has provided a useful opportunity for us to air the concerns of sheep farmers throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15014550", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sheep (Electronic Identification)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Liam McArthur on securing this important debate.

Of course we want to prevent antisocial behaviour in the first place. Of course we want better integration of agencies, to ensure that they are better at sharing information and resources. Of course we want our communities to be made more aware of, and involved in, the process. It goes without saying that better communication through the media and the ending of stereotyping are needed, and that we must make the public more aware of antisocial behaviour and share success stories so that best practice can be copied, where it is needed.</p><p>However, the Scottish Government has failed to consider aspects of the antisocial behaviour legislation that are not working, and to re-examine the process in order to ascertain how it can be improved. For example, we know that by March 2008 no parenting orders had been issued. I had hoped that the report would explore why. Do authorities think that parenting orders are not suitable disposals? If so, why? What can be done to improve parenting orders, or should they be scrapped? I do not understand the Labour Party's obsession with parenting orders, given that there is no evidence that they are successful.</p><p>Of course we need to focus on preventing antisocial behaviour&#8212;we welcome that approach&#8212;but we should be addressing the causes of crime and antisocial behaviour in an attempt to prevent people from ending up on a one-way street to pain and misery.

Despite Paul Martin's right-wing rhetoric, which would have made many a Tory proud, Labour in Government was soft on crime and soft on the causes of crime. If, during eight years in office, Labour had effectively addressed the problems that cause antisocial <place-holder colnum=\"16548\"/> behaviour and crime, we would not be debating the matter today.

The Scottish Government's plans for a minimum price for alcoholic drinks will adversely affect many of the communities and local economies that we represent. What is more, the proposal sends out confusing messages and fundamentally fails to target the problem drinks that contribute so significantly to Scotland's alcohol problem. Retailers have suggested that the cost of problem drinks such as alcopops and high-strength spirits, which are often used as shooters, would not be affected by a minimum price.</p><p>J D Wetherspoon was recently criticised for selling a pint for &#163;1, but if minimum pricing were applied to the on-sales trade, that pint could be sold at no profit for as little as 70p.

I am concerned that the Scottish Government's proposals would create a booze-trip culture in the south of Scotland, which could hit traders in my constituency in the Borders. A trend could be started whereby responsible drinkers travelled across the border to places such as Berwick and Wooler to purchase cheaper alcohol, which would have a clear effect on traders in the Borders.

We cannot trust Labour and the Liberal Democrats when it comes to making our communities safer.</p><p>I turn to the Scottish Government. In its 2007 manifesto, the SNP proposed 1,000 more police officers. However, by the end of 2007 it had changed its mind and decided that the 1,000 new officers would be made up not only by extra recruitment but by the creation of equivalent police officers&#8212;not new additional police officers but equivalent police officers.

It is the SNP's job now to ensure that those 1,000 extra officers are delivered by 2011. That is the minimum that the SNP must achieve if it is to justify the trust that it was given when its first budget was passed. We secured the additional funding to recruit those extra officers; the SNP must now deliver them.</p><p>However, the SNP Government should not stop there. It must do more to ensure that our police force is freed up from paperwork to allow officers to get on to our streets and serve our communities.</p><p>Thanks to eight years of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, an increasing burden of administrative and procedural bureaucracy has come to consume more and more of police officers' time, keeping them away from the front line of crime fighting. That situation is not of the SNP's making, but it must do more to set our police free to do their job, rather than setting criminals free from our jails. We need to take the handcuffs off the police and put them on to the criminals.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives are clear that more police out in our communities are needed to provide a visible deterrent and to boost public confidence.

Traditionally, communities in Scotland would have had the reassurance of a local police officer who was an integral part of their neighbourhood, building up relationships and reducing the fear of crime. In many areas, it is clear that that model does not bear much resemblance to what is happening on the ground, which is why it is important to develop a vision of what community policing means in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>Like the Justice Committee, the Conservatives are reluctant for the Scottish Government to provide a strict definition of community policing. I therefore welcome the cabinet secretary's statement that he does not intend to micromanage what individual police forces are doing. It is important to recognise that in each police force, division, community and street, there will be a <place-holder colnum=\"15154\"/> different approach to community policing that should be adapted to meet the particular challenges and needs of that community. The needs of Glasgow are different to the needs of Shetland; equally, the needs of Hawick in my constituency are different from the needs of Gavinton, which is also in my constituency.</p><p>The role of community wardens was touched on in the committee report. The Scottish Conservatives have never denied that community wardens could have a role, but they should never be used as substitutes for real police officers. I spent a shift with the community wardens in Kelso several months ago and was able to see at first hand the valuable work that they do alongside the police. The community safety wardens in the Borders, like those in many other parts of Scotland, target specifically low-level crime and antisocial behaviour such as vandalism, graffiti and littering. It undoubtedly frees up police time to deal with more serious matters that require police powers.</p><p>Such has been the success of the community warden scheme in the Borders that the Conservative-led Scottish Borders Council has recently announced additional funding to extend the scheme to other parts of the Borders. However, we should be clear that our priority has always been to have more police officers walking the streets of Scotland. Although community wardens have an important role to play in making communities safer, they are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes or an alternative to recruiting additional police officers.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives campaigned hard for additional police officers in Scotland and we won. We do not want to see officers sitting behind desks, dealing with paperwork; we want them out in our neighbourhoods making our communities safer. We cannot start to talk about the effectiveness of community policing unless police officers are on the ground to perform the duties that we expect of them.</p><p>We agree with the Scottish Government that we need to retain serving officers, ensure that their time is used productively and free them up from needless paperwork, and we agree that we need to help police forces to work smarter. On top of that, we fought for additional new officers.</p><p>The Scottish Government has not always been as committed to the policy as we have been. It has twice U-turned on police recruitment. The SNP originally promised 1,000 more police in its 2007 election manifesto but, by the end of 2007, it had changed its mind and decided that the 1,000 new officers would be provided not only by additional recruitment, but by the creation of the ridiculous concept of equivalent police officers. We are pleased to have influenced the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"15155\"/> Government's policy and we are happy to work with it to achieve yet another Scottish Conservative election manifesto commitment.</p><p>The other parties do not have much credibility on the issue.

The Scottish Conservatives agree with the general principles of the bill and will vote for the motion.</p><p>The bill deals with an extremely complex area of the law. I acknowledge the Justice Committee's hard work on the bill. I am sure that the debate will be as well informed and constructive as was our previous debate on the subject.</p><p>In the short time that is available for my speech, I will touch on several aspects of the bill. First, there is no doubt that reform of the law of rape is long overdue&#8212;indeed, academics and practitioners have criticised the Scots law on rape for many years. The non-gendered approach that will be taken towards rape is particularly to be welcomed. It is also important to modernise the law of rape. The old common law related the offence of rape to the possibility of conception. Changing the law to take a gender-neutral approach and to include other forms of sexual penetration is entirely appropriate. I welcome the cabinet secretary's comments on that at the start of the debate.</p><p>The bill will create a new definition of consent, which has created many difficulties in the past&#8212;the McKearney case in 2004 demonstrated some of those. The bill provides a general definition of consent as free agreement and supplements that with a non-exhaustive list of factual circumstances in which free agreement is not present.</p><p>In the debate on the Scottish Law Commission's report on rape and other sexual offences, I made the point that introducing a statutory definition of consent would not necessarily solve all the concerns and problems with regard to rape cases. For example, questions about whether the victim gave his or her true or valid consent will remain, because the line between true consent and mere submission is not always easy to draw. It has been suggested that it might be preferable to avoid using the word \"consent\" altogether and to focus instead on whether the accused had sexual intercourse with a person who did not have the <place-holder colnum=\"15058\"/> freedom or capacity to choose in the circumstances.</p><p>The Justice Committee resisted the pressure to lower the age of consent from 16 and we support its approach. That view is supported by church groups and I am sure that members have received a number of representations along those lines. We must recognise that children are maturing earlier, but there is certainly no case for permitting full penetrative sex between people who are 15 or younger.</p><p>It is right that the law should state clearly that sex below the age of consent is wrong and that those who do not abide by the law face legal consequences. We must continue to support the use of the children's hearings system to address offending behaviour by children in most cases. The Scottish Government's decision to retain in the bill the option of criminal prosecution for consensual penetrative sex between older children, at the Lord Advocate's discretion, is appropriate. We as legislators must ensure that nothing is done to water down that important principle or give the impression that the age of consent has been lowered or can be ignored.</p><p>The Scottish Government is right to seek to amend the bill's provisions in relation to oral sex between older children who are aged between 13 and 15, to ensure that that sexual act is not legalised for that age group. The risk of sexually transmitted diseases must be borne in mind. We therefore welcome the Scottish Government's moves to address the issue.</p><p>I will briefly consider the law of evidence. In the circumstances of a sexual offence or rape, it is inevitable that only two people might have been present&#8212;the complainer and the accused. Scots law has long recognised that difficulty and has departed from the standard of corroboration that is normal in serious criminal cases. That is entirely appropriate, but we do not support any change in the law of evidence to specify that corroboration is not required. It is necessary for an accused person to have a defence.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14708427", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The bill will update the law on rape and other sexual offences.

Greenlaw is one example, but the motion could have mentioned Morebattle, Bonchester Bridge, Clovenfords or Hutton, which are all communities that have been adversely affected by decisions to close their local post office.</p><p>During the consultation process, I hosted several public meetings throughout my constituency so that people could voice their concerns about the proposals. The meetings at Greenlaw and Morebattle were particularly well attended, with more than 150 residents attending each meeting. For the benefit of members who were not present at those meetings, I say that it was clear to me that the overwhelming majority of residents did not want the proposed changes. Despite that, the Post Office announced in the autumn its decision to go ahead with the closure of the Greenlaw post office and several other post offices in the Borders, despite our local campaign against the closure plans. It appears to me that the consultation process was a complete sham, in which no weight whatever was given to the views of local people.</p><p>From the hundreds of people who signed the petition, wrote in individually or came to the public meeting, it was clear that the local post office branches were enormously valued and that people did not want the proposed new outreach services. However, all that weight of opinion was set aside in the name of achieving the Labour Government's <place-holder colnum=\"13992\"/> targets for closures. During the process, local people and their representatives treated the Post Office and its consultation process with respect. Unforgivably, however, the Post Office has treated them with contempt. I feel particularly sorry for the staff who are so well regarded in their communities. It is a great injustice that the post offices have been taken away from them.</p><p>The Westminster and Scottish Governments need to do more. In particular, more must be done to allow the post office network to provide additional services, such as road tax and currency, in order to allow the Post Office to compete with other providers. Rather than simply close post offices, the Labour Government needs to expand the services that they can offer. Postmasters need to be free to compete in the marketplace, rather than have more and more services withdrawn from them.</p><p>As Christine Grahame pointed out, the impact of the closures will be far-reaching. We should not underestimate the social impact of the changes. Post offices in rural communities are often the community's focal point, where people meet and talk. That is particularly the case for post offices that are connected to the local shop.

The first is the Government's desire to scrap sentences of six months or less and the proposed interference with judicial independence. That is likely to have a limited impact on the total prison population. The average daily prison population in 2007-08 was 7,375, of which 570&#8212;just 8 per cent&#8212;were serving sentences of six months or less. It is therefore questionable what impact the ending of short sentences will have on the prison population. Further, it would be wrong to assume that, under the Government's proposals, all those prisoners would automatically escape prison altogether, as some might end up serving longer jail terms if the sentencing judge believed that prison was the right disposal for that offender.</p><p>I believe that the Government has thought of that, which is why it intends to interfere with sentencing policy by creating a body called the Scottish sentencing council, which we are told would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"develop and oversee a national system of sentencing guidelines\".</p><p>That is nothing more than an attempt by the Government to force the courts to comply with its ridiculous prison population target. The Government's role should be not to decide sentencing policy, but to support the courts in their sentencing policy and to ensure that adequate provision exists to allow disposals to be carried out. It is a judge's job to take into account all the circumstances of a case and to pass a suitable sentence. The Government's job is to provide sufficient resources to allow the sentence to be enforced. The independence of the judiciary must be maintained, with judges and sheriffs left in charge of sentences.</p><p>That leads me to my second point, which is about how little attention is given to the victims of crime. Nothing dismays victims more or brings the <place-holder colnum=\"13883\"/> entire criminal justice system into greater disrepute than the fact that criminals almost never serve the sentence that is handed down by the court. The Government's proposals will do nothing to help deal with that perception. In the list of the Scottish Government's proposals at the back of its policy document, \"Protecting Scotland's Communities\", victims are mentioned only once. What does that say about the focus of the Scottish Government's policy? The Government is clearly more interested in emptying our jails than it is in protecting the public.

However, I do not believe that reducing the permitted alcohol limit for drink driving would necessarily encourage people to change their drinking habits. Rather than extend the heavy hand of government, we should instead promote the culture of responsible drinking. As Cathie Craigie said, drinkers need to be made more aware of what constitutes a measure of alcohol, particularly in light of the size of glasses that many pubs and bars now use.

As the association points out, the 80mg limit was chosen in the 1960s because 80mg to 90mg per 100ml accurately marks the point at which the accident risk starts to increase. Furthermore, previous Government consultations showed that drivers in the 50mg to 80mg per 100ml range are not overrepresented in the figures for fatalities or serious injuries.

The crucial point is about consent&#8212;or, in the case of forced marriages, the lack of consent that makes them so objectionable. A study by the Home Office's working group on forced marriages clearly illustrated the devastating consequences for individuals who are forced into marriage. Many young women in such a situation become estranged from their families and suffer years of domestic violence. Even more frightening, some evidence has suggested a link between forced marriage and the particularly high self-harm and suicide rates for Asian women.

Fortunately, Scots law states clearly the requirements for marriage and leaves no room for marriages that fail to satisfy them. The minimum age at which a person can marry is 16&#8212;parental consent is not required. It is important to note the requirement for both parties to understand the nature of a marriage ceremony and to consent to marrying. In Scotland, a marriage is deemed void if either party was <place-holder colnum=\"13149\"/> forced to marry against their will. Marriage as a result of duress, force or fear does not satisfy the requirement of consent by both parties. If a marriage is deemed void, it is regarded as never having taken place. However, a decree of nullity may be required from the Court of Session in order for the marriage to be treated as void. An important characteristic of Scots law is that a Scottish court can take jurisdiction to decide whether a marriage is void on the basis of lack of consent regardless of where the marriage was performed.

However, I am disappointed that Ofcom did not do more to champion the interests of the consumer during the review of local news services in the Border TV area. Although we agree with Ofcom's view that ITV should focus on programmes that have been made in the UK, network news, and national and regional news services, the proposed merger between Border TV and Tyne Tees is ill-suited to delivering those objectives and to achieving the most benefit for the Border TV area. Although Ofcom has given the green light to the proposals for Border TV and Tyne Tees, it is critical that Ofcom keeps a watching brief over the PSB commitment to the Borders to ensure that PSB is not further diluted and that ITV is held to its promises on the local opt-outs.</p><p>Experience in the Borders demonstrates the challenges that broadcasters, including STV, face in providing PSB. Despite being relatively successful, the continued existence of the local Borders news service could not be justified, given the economic challenges facing ITV. Border TV has provided local news and programming to the Scottish Borders, south-west Scotland, Cumbria and the Isle of Man for almost 50 years, and has the second largest geographical region in the ITV network. Despite the difficulties of catering for such a wide and diverse audience, the flagship daily news programme \"Lookaround\" has some of the highest ratings of any BBC or ITV regional news programme in the UK.</p><p>In March 2005, a Sunday newspaper highlighted those exceptionally high ratings when it reported that while \"Scotland Today\" and \"North Tonight\" drew a 26 per cent audience share, and \"London Tonight\" took a 28 per cent share, \"Lookaround\" was watched by a whopping 42 per cent of the Border TV region's population at 6pm on weekday evenings. Although I acknowledge that those ratings might have slipped in recent years, Border TV news continues to have some of the highest ratings in the UK.</p><p>Why does it have such a success rate? Why does it score so much better than the STV regions? The <em>Sunday Herald</em> put that question to <place-holder colnum=\"13041\"/> the then managing director of ITV Border, Paddy Merrall, who said that ITV Border news was \"more relevant to people\". That goes to the heart of the matter: TV should be relevant to the communities that it serves. We only need to look at the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001 to see the valuable public information service that the channel provided by giving people the latest, up-to-date news and public information on the problems as they unfolded. Similarly, in the past few hours, Border TV news has been providing a critical service to my constituents in Kelso during the gas network failure. That will be unlikely to happen when the news is coming from the north-east, with a local news opt-out. The loss of our local news service would be another example of people in rural communities being marginalised.</p><p>I fully acknowledge that the broadcasting market is developing, with a wealth of new platforms and services, including digital and multi-channel television. With broadband, there is also greater use of the internet to access news services. That might be the norm 10 or 20 years from now, but for many rural parts of Scotland there is no access to adequate broadband coverage&#8212;many have no access to broadband services at all. Furthermore, many people, particularly the elderly, still do not have access to computers and so cannot hope to gain access to alternative forms of news coverage if local news disappears completely. They depend on the local television services that are currently provided by ITV Border.</p><p>Ofcom must resist the agenda of urbanisation and centralisation. It must consider all the PSB options that are being proposed, and bear in mind the rural and diverse nature of parts of Scotland. The Scottish Conservatives believe that broadcasters have struggled to keep pace with the changing political environment. There has been a decline in Scottish programming and funding for Scottish programmes, which has damaged the creative industry in Scotland. Public service broadcasting must be reformed before the licences run out in 2014.

It has also shown us, from the way in which he has carried on this afternoon, the contempt in which Lord George Foulkes holds this Parliament.</p><p>The national identity card scheme will do nothing to provide real help in Scotland as we face the economic crisis. The scheme will create a system that results in excessive amounts of information on British citizens being held. The whole scheme distracts from the important issues that we should be discussing. That is not the fault of the Scottish Parliament; it is the fault of the Labour Government at Westminster.</p><p>With the Westminster Government's recent backtracking on the plan, it is clear that, even within the Labour Party, support is wavering. If the UK Government shifts policy and remains hesitant <place-holder colnum=\"12526\"/> on its own proposals, why should the people of Scotland be convinced that the policy is the right one to follow?</p><p>I want to focus on a couple of aspects of the proposals that have been discussed during the debate by a number of members&#8212;their cost, and their ability to keep our country safe. There is no doubt that ID cards would come at a great cost to the entire country. The Identity Cards Act 2006 requires that the UK Government update Parliament at least every six months on the estimated public expenditure likely to be incurred to introduce the ID cards. As the minister pointed out, the latest cost estimates have been published by the UK Government. In the publication, it was revealed that the cost had risen by millions of pounds. That increase was combined with another substantial increase in providing ID cards to foreign nationals, making the total increase &#163;60 million over the past six months. Those figures are startling. The taxpayer will forfeit huge sums of money to finance a scheme of questionable value.</p><p>As Bill Aitken said, a study that was carried out independently by the London School of Economics found that, although the UK Government estimated a &#163;4.8 billion cost for ID cards, a more accurate figure would be something closer to &#163;20 billion. With discrepancies such as those, it is understandable why many people are worried about the implementation of such a plan. Who knows how much the cost will really be?</p><p>Why pursue such an expensive scheme? Well, the UK Government is implementing its plans in the hope of creating better security for the British people against the threats of terrorism. However, the creation of ID cards will not prevent terrorist attacks&#8212;several public figures have acknowledged that fact. In an article by a consultant at GCHQ, claims that ID cards would help the fight against terrorism were completely dismissed. Even the former Home Secretary, Charles Clarke MP, admitted that the ID card scheme would not have prevented the bombings on 7 July 2005 in London. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I doubt if it would have made a difference.\"</p><p>We witnessed that in Spain, where ID cards are compulsory but did not stop the Madrid bombings in March 2004.</p><p>The proposals by the UK Government will not prevent the work of terrorists. Regardless, the UK Government&#8212;with the help of Lord George Foulkes, it seems&#8212;continues with its praise and support of ID cards, despite the evidence to the contrary. Although the scheme would give the UK Government massive amounts of control over our personal information, the Government has admitted that it cannot be trusted with our data, making a security breach all the more likely with ID <place-holder colnum=\"12527\"/> cards. What is more, the agency that is to be responsible for running the ID card scheme has had its own security breached four times already. With a track record such as that, it is no wonder that people are sceptical about giving the Government even more access to such information.</p><p>What is more, ID cards will not prevent identity fraud or human trafficking. In fact, it has been suggested that ID cards could</p><p class=\"indent\">\"trigger massive identity fraud on a scale beyond anything we have seen before.\"</p><p>If the purpose of ID cards is to help the British population, they certainly are far from doing their job. In fact, they increase the susceptibility of UK citizens. Furthermore, the ID cards will not prevent human trafficking, because nothing can substitute for having a proper border police force and proper checks on people entering and leaving the country.</p><p>These ID cards are&#8212;put simply&#8212;an invasion of privacy. The UK Government could have almost 30 separate pieces of information on every citizen, all of which will be stored on a massive Home Office ID card database called the national register. The creation of such a register will allow anyone who can break into the system to obtain our personal information; it will also allow the Government to monitor us as it pleases.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives know that these ID cards will do nothing to improve the security of our country and that they could make it worse. The costs that would be incurred by the Scottish people are outrageous and unnecessary, and it is ludicrous of the UK Government to think that the people should pay such a ridiculous amount of money. Instead of using taxpayers' money to finance a defective scheme, the UK Government should direct the funding at more worthwhile endeavours. We would scrap the UK Government's proposals and instead call for extra police and the creation of a new border police force. Those simple measures would provide much more for the people of Scotland than anything that an ID cards scheme could possibly achieve.</p><p>We are happy to support the amendment in Robert Brown's name and the amendment in Bill Aitken's name.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14240766", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Identity Cards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been useful in reminding us all what a complete waste of time and money ID cards will be.

However, rather than being a proud moment for the region, it could well be one of embarrassment, because reception in the Borders is among the worst in the UK. As Jeremy Purvis said, Ofcom has reported that the Border TV region has the lowest percentage of households that can currently receive digital television through an aerial, with a figure of just 51 per cent. Nearly half of the Borders population will not know whether their preparation for the switchover has been successful until the changeover happens tomorrow. That could create further complications when the switchover occurs, with confusion among the electorate muddling the switchover even more.</p><p>The changeover to digital television has been heralded as providing a wide viewing selection, with more than 40 channels available to the audience. One would think that all areas would be able to reap the benefits of such an improvement. However, although Ofcom reports that an average of 90 per cent of households in the UK will be able to receive the 40 channels after switchover, that figure does not hold true for the Borders, where barely more than 50 per cent of the population will <place-holder colnum=\"12072\"/> be able to receive the 40 channels. The figure is significantly lower than that in the second-worst-served area, Wales, where 73 per cent of households will be able to watch all 40 digital channels. The reason for the discrepancy is that main transmitters, such as the one at Selkirk in the Borders, carry all six multiplexes, whereas relay transmitters, of which there are 11 in the Borders, carry only three multiplexes. That is disappointing for the Borders region and entirely unfair to the residents in my constituency and Mr Purvis's constituency of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. Yet again, the Borders is being short-changed.</p><p>As well as there being the obvious discrepancy in availability throughout the Borders, many unanswered questions remain about the digital switchover. For example, why can we not have local BBC Radio Selkirk news bulletins via digital audio broadcasting&#8212;DAB&#8212;radio after the switchover? That is yet another blow to the local news service. Furthermore, what is being done to protect the old bandwidth from being auctioned off to a commercial operator? I hope that Scottish Borders Council will fight for that valuable resource for the Borders&#8212;which will give more opportunity for local broadcasting, particularly local news&#8212;and will not allow the bandwidth to be sold to a large multinational company with no local interest in the Borders. The confusion from the digital switchover raises many questions that should have been answered long before now. I hope that the uncertainties will be resolved in the coming days and weeks.</p><p>As the Borders is one of the first UK areas to move to digital television, we should serve as the leader for the rest of the country. However, the example for the rest of the country will be one of what to avoid and will demonstrate how necessary it is to prepare a whole region properly for such an important change. At a time when the Borders could have been at the forefront of technology for the entire United Kingdom, we find ourselves a rather ill-prepared test case and a lesson for the country in the importance of organisation and preparation before such drastic changes are implemented.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14206733", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Digital Switchover"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Jeremy Purvis on securing this timely debate.

As we have heard from a number of members, the bill's purpose is to deal with whether someone who has been negligently exposed to asbestos in the course of his employment can sue his employer for damages on the ground that he has developed pleural plaques.</p><p>We have heard from a number of members about the awful effects that asbestos-related illnesses can cause&#8212;in particular, I note the personal experiences of Cathy Peattie's husband, which she mentioned in her speech. I do not think that any of us would dispute the distressing and disturbing effects of such diseases, but I have some concerns about what the bill might do from a legal perspective and about the considerable uncertainty surrounding its financial impact.</p><p>We can say that the bill simply attempts to replicate the practice from 1980 to 2005, when damages were awarded to claimants who had developed pleural plaques. We can also say that those people who go on to develop serious illness as a result of their exposure to asbestos should have a claim in law for damages. However, like Nigel Don, I believe that we should move cautiously to overrule what the House of Lords determined in the Johnston case. The law lords gave careful consideration to the law of damages, and their judgment reversed more than 20 years of practice. I am sure that they did not take that decision lightly. They ruled that, as pleural plaques cause no symptoms, do not cause or lead to other asbestos-related diseases and do not shorten life expectancy in themselves, their mere presence in a claimant's lungs is not a material injury capable of giving rise to a claim for damages.<place-holder colnum=\"12051\"/></p><p>Mr Don asked whether the issue could be dealt with under contract law rather than under the law of delict&#8212;or tort, as it is in England. I suspect that claimants always pursue the route of tort or delict because of the level of damages available under that area of law compared with that which is available under contract law.</p><p>I read with some interest the medical opinions that were submitted to the Justice Committee that pleural plaques do not, in themselves, cause any symptoms in sufferers. However, once diagnosed, they are likely to cause anxiety that something more serious may develop in future. The question is whether that should be sufficient in itself to entitle the sufferer to compensation.</p><p>There were two clear views in the evidence that was submitted to the committee on that point. In the debate, members have focused predominantly on only one. Witnesses such as those from Clydeside Action on Asbestos took the view that the bill was an opportunity for sufferers to get some form of redress against those who had negligently exposed them to asbestos. The alternative view of the insurance industry and some lawyers is that compensation should not be available simply because someone has come into contact with asbestos. There was concern about the impact that the bill would have on the law of Scotland, in that it would open up the opportunity for other people who became aware that they were at a greater risk of an injury in the future to make claims.</p><p>Other members focused on the reasons why we should support the bill. As devil's advocate, if nothing else, I will focus on the alternative view. I have a lot of sympathy for the view that making compensation available for pleural plaques when they have no negative effect on health runs counter to the Scots law of delict and could open the way for more widespread challenges to other longstanding legal principles on which we have relied in the past.

That issue was raised by a number of members, but not by them all. The Justice Committee noted considerable differences in the estimates that were provided by the Scottish Government and by the insurance industry regarding the number of pleural plaques claims that were likely to arise in Scotland in any given year. The insurance industry and the Government&#8212;if the latter is being honest&#8212;have great difficulty in accurately predicting the number of future pleural plaques claims. There is uncertainty regarding how many people have been exposed to asbestos; of those who have been exposed, there is uncertainty regarding how many will develop pleural plaques; of those who have developed pleural plaques, there is uncertainty regarding how many will be identified as having pleural plaques; and of those so identified, it is uncertain how many would make a compensation claim. There is also uncertainty over the value of a claim, with the claim's inflation being a particular issue for the insurance industry.</p><p>I agree that it will always be difficult to predict accurately the costs that are involved in implementing such bills.

A pilot should be much longer before the Government can use it as the basis for legislative changes. Thirdly, the trial took place on only two days per week, between 5 pm and 10 pm on Friday and Saturday nights.

Results in one specific area are unlikely to be representative of how the scheme might work if it were to be rolled out throughout Scotland, and the Government is wrong to try to suggest that.</p><p>Not only does the evidence fail to stack up, but the plans will create unnecessary inconsistencies in the legislation. Young people and parents rightly look to Government for leadership, but the proposals send out mixed messages to young people on where and when it is acceptable to drink alcohol. The rationale behind the plans is confusing and illogical, and they would penalise the vast majority of 18 to 21-year-olds who drink alcohol responsibly. Perhaps the Government does not understand that alcohol misuse is not a young persons' disease: adults of all ages misuse alcohol. In any case, all the plans would achieve is a messy and complicated set of rules for the purchase of alcohol.</p><p>The proposals unnecessarily discriminate against certain members of our society. As a society, we recognise that young people gain additional responsibilities when they reach a certain age. By 18, they can vote, get married, drive, pay tax and even serve in the Army, but the SNP still does not trust them to buy a couple of cans of lager to take home. Those who are under 21 and live in rural areas will also be discriminated against if they want to enjoy a drink because they will no longer be able to do so in their own homes and are increasingly unlikely to have a local pub.</p><p>The proposals are not necessary. Proper enforcement of the existing legislation would go a long way towards reducing the problems of underage drinking. In 2005-06, only seven people under 18 were prosecuted for buying alcohol or consuming alcohol in a bar. Either underage drinking is not a problem in Scotland or the current legislation is not properly enforced.

However, until someone steps forward with a plan <place-holder colnum=\"10801\"/> to make crime history, prisons are here to stay. The challenge is to create prisons with a purpose.</p><p>It is obvious that overcrowded prisons that are awash with drugs and a system that gives short-term prisoners limited or no supervision and support on release are almost certain to fail. However, that could be used to argue, as we do, that the prison regime should be completely transformed and a system of support put in place for offenders when they are released from jail. It is daft to argue that because short-term prison sentences are not working currently, we should stop using them altogether.</p><p>That leads me to the second worrying aspect of the report and the suggestions from the Government that it intends to interfere with sentencing policy. The role of Government should not be to decide sentencing policy but to support the courts in sentencing disposals and ensure that adequate provision exists to allow the disposals to be carried out. The judiciary must be allowed to maintain its independence, with judges and sheriffs left in charge of sentencing.</p><p>The view that the current prison crisis is somehow caused by the volume of people receiving short sentences or failing first-time offenders is simply wrong. Prison is largely the preserve of serious, violent and persistent offenders. Contrary to popular myth, our prisons simply do not contain vast numbers of non-violent, first-time offenders doing time for licence-fee evasion and motoring offences.</p><p>The case for community sentences must not be driven simply by a desire to deal with prison overcrowding, and a preference for community sentences cannot be an act of faith. In their current form, they are usually unsuitable alternatives to imprisonment, not least because they are insufficiently robust.</p><p>How do we make community sentences more robust? They should have a sufficiently punitive element to command public confidence&#8212;for example, they should be made more visible. That was mentioned by several speakers and it is something that the Government and others have spoken about repeatedly but which has yet to be delivered. New technology might allow more robust semi-custodial sentences to be developed in the future, but they should be a supplement to the sentencing options available to the courts and not a substitute for custodial sentences that a court would otherwise wish to impose. In the absence of robust community punishment, prison is and will remain the only option for most of the offenders who are currently sent there.</p><p>In addition, the Government should focus on how prisons are run, with far greater emphasis on education, training and work to reduce <place-holder colnum=\"10802\"/> reconviction rates. The role of community, faith and voluntary organisations in the prison system should be considered, and the scope and quality of drug, alcohol and mental health service provision in custody should be investigated. Furthermore, the Government should analyse ways of improving the support networks for released prisoners, to enhance their ability to choose productive lives after release.</p><p>In reality, the commission's report is nothing more than a distraction from the pressing need to reform our prisons, which are not working. The prime duty of Government is to protect the public. The SNP is guilty of dereliction of that duty. Today, we have the tragic final proof that we are living in the SNP's soft-touch Scotland.

While we must focus on the programmes that are already in place, such as parenting orders, we must also focus on and find ways to reverse the effects of social breakdown. We must focus on the family, on the environment and on the communities where our children are growing up. That point was made by a number of members, including Nigel Don and Mike Pringle.</p><p>I remind the Parliament of David Cameron's recent speech on youth crime. In it, Mr Cameron stated that we must fight youth crime on three fronts: the response of the courts; the response of the police; and the response of society. We need to act lower down the scale and focus on the family. We need to curb crime and target criminals <place-holder colnum=\"9975\"/> before they start to commit crimes that deserve prison sentences. We need to focus on creating a strong family and community atmosphere in order to target at-risk youth and curb crime before it starts. That can happen only if we give the courts and children's panels the ability to punish youths in a way that will leave the biggest mark and effectively deter them from committing crimes in future.</p><p>In 2000, the Westminster Government gave judges the power to disqualify youth offenders from holding or obtaining a driver's licence. That is a good example of a non-traditional sanction, and we should consider it.</p><p>We must also focus on the effectiveness of our police. Robert Peel once said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with it.\"</p><p>Like Mike Pringle, I draw the Parliament's attention to the experience of New York. Between 1992 and 1996, New York city halved its murder rate by focusing on more minor crimes. When the communities saw minor crimes being prosecuted, there was a noticeable reduction in crime overall. A focus on stopping youth crime at an earlier stage will help the citizens of Scotland to feel safer in their everyday lives. Bill Butler and Mary Mulligan also made that point.</p><p>We have consistently argued for more resources and disposals to be given to children's panels, enabling them to intervene more effectively&#8212;and, crucially, at the earliest possible opportunity. Those disposals could include the introduction of weekend and evening detention, community service, supervised attendance orders and drug treatment and testing orders.</p><p>Restoring the family is an important step in reducing youth crime. We need to give families the necessary support and help to allow them to feel more responsible for the actions of their children. We need to continue to focus on stopping social breakdown both through social enterprise and by making it easier for voluntary organisations to obtain funding to use to help young people in the way that is needed.</p><p>I believe that the youth of Scotland are a valuable asset. We want to hear what the youth have to say, but we also see the need to curb the youth crime that is caused by a very small minority. We need to focus on making Scotland a better place to raise children, ensuring that they reach their full potential. Curbing youth crime will make Scotland safer for all its citizens.

Governments, especially the most recent Scottish Executive, have failed to provide many people who live in remote and rural communities with the same quality of health care that is delivered to people in urban areas. That must change. My constituency in the Scottish Borders is an area where health services have come under severe pressure, and I will again bring some of the issues to the attention of the Parliament and the Government.</p><p>The recent announcement of the closure of ward 14 at Borders general hospital has come as a shock to patients, staff and constituents alike. Although Borders general hospital is not in my constituency, it is an important resource that provides a valuable service to a large number of my constituents.</p><p>On top of that news, we have been told that there will be a reduction in bed capacity in the local community hospitals. It was announced only last month that there will be summer cuts of four beds at each community hospital in my constituency, which will be implemented in the coming weeks. Yesterday, I spent time with a senior Hawick doctor who has responsibility for Hawick community hospital, so I know that there is widespread concern among staff about how quickly the decision has been taken and about the lack of consultation.</p><p>There is a concern that, without the additional beds, the professionals will not have the flexibility to decide which patients need hospital treatment. <place-holder colnum=\"9375\"/></p><p>In effect, there will be a waiting list for available beds at the community hospitals. The health board wants more patients to be treated at home but, as any doctor will say, that is not always practical or feasible for patients.</p><p>I will tell Parliament of the scenario that the Hawick doctor described to me yesterday. Let us imagine the case of a very elderly patient in Hawick who is in her dying days. Nothing more can be done to help her other than to make her last days as comfortable as possible. She has lived in the town all her life and her final wish is to die in the town where she was born with her family around her. It will simply not be an option for her to go to Borders general hospital, which is 20 miles away. I am told by the doctors and professionals that the proposed bed cuts will mean that such patients might well have to wait two or three weeks to get the bed that they need for their last days. Unfortunately for the lady in question, time is against her and she does not have two or three weeks to wait.</p><p>Staff are also concerned that, although the proposed service reductions are described as short-term summer cuts, on numerous occasions in the past short-term cuts have turned into permanent measures. They no longer believe what they are told. Who would blame them, when it transpires that the summer cuts will continue until December? Since when has December been a summer month in Scotland?</p><p>Parliament should be aware that those cuts come on the back of a number of hospital closures in the Borders. Thanks to the health policies of the previous Government, we lost Jedburgh and Coldstream hospitals, together with 40 other community hospitals across Scotland. Even though they received overwhelming support from their local communities, the Minister for Health and Community Care, Andy Kerr, and the Liberal-Labour Administration failed to support them and allowed them to be closed, so I find Mr Purvis's crocodile tears, which he has shed both in the debate and in the local press, a little rich, given his Government's record on rural health services in the Borders.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13727236", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Remote and Rural Health Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on such an important topic.

Borders farmers and Berwickshire fishermen, and hauliers and many other sectors in rural areas have found it increasingly difficult to maintain the viability of their businesses.</p><p>It is becoming clear that public transportation, on which rural areas depend heavily, has been hit hard by rising fuel prices. It has been widely reported, even in the national newspapers, that the bus company Munro's of Jedburgh, in my constituency, has terminated a number of local bus routes. Munro's hopes to be successful when it retenders, but the company's drastic action is a reflection of the difficult times that it faces. I am most worried about what will happen if the company is not successful or if the uncertainty about fuel prices becomes so great that some routes become unviable and are simply dropped, which would have huge implications for people in the area. Since fuel prices skyrocketed, it has become difficult for local bus companies and other transport providers to stay in the black. Munro's of Jedburgh is the latest victim of rising fuel prices, but more bus companies will be forced to take difficult decisions and more routes will be put under pressure.</p><p>Pressure on bus routes is not the only problem caused by rising fuel prices. The transportation of fuel has become increasingly expensive and has led to the closure of petrol stations. Newcastleton in my constituency recently lost its last and only petrol station because it had become too expensive to transport fuel to it. The closure has forced residents to drive many miles to fill up their cars and has put pressure on industry as well as on everyday life. I am working to establish a community-based service, but the current state of affairs is doing nothing to promote the area's attempt to become a centre for tourism. The community's problem is not just high fuel prices but access to fuel at all.</p><p>The examples that I have given are not the only negative effects of rising fuel prices. It is important that we look beyond the obvious effects&#8212;the difficulties of getting around and the inconvenience of having to travel to fill up our cars&#8212;and consider the strain on the wider community. The termination of bus routes and the closure of petrol stations could lead to significant job losses and have a devastating effect on local employment, with the <place-holder colnum=\"9072\"/> loss of drivers, engineers and support staff.

Without help from Government in Scotland and at Westminster, bus routes will continue to be terminated, petrol stations will continue to close and farmers and fishermen will continue to go out of business.

The eagle was a female and was part of the only breeding pair of golden eagles in the area. That came as a huge blow to many of my constituents.</p><p>Wildlife crime takes many forms. Habitat destruction, poaching, egg collecting, badger baiting and poisoning are a few examples. The most common form, and arguably the one with the highest profile, is the persecution of birds of prey by poisoning. During the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the practices of some shooting estates led to many birds of prey being wiped out in Scotland. Since then, some birds of prey have been reintroduced to the areas where they were wiped <place-holder colnum=\"8961\"/> out but with limited success. Wildlife protection is crucial to the survival of those birds, as well as to all other forms of wildlife. Birds of prey are especially vulnerable because they are long lived and slow breeding. Golden eagles, for example, will raise only one chick a year and do not start breeding until they are at least three years old.</p><p>Wildlife is an important part of Scotland's economy. Thanks to television shows such as \"Springwatch\", visitors have been attracted to Scotland to see wildlife and its habitats. That has generated millions of pounds for Scotland. For example, the Galloway red kite trial contributes around &#163;700,000 to the local economy, and the white-tailed eagle viewing project in Mull generates &#163;1.4 million to &#163;1.6 million locally. That is why I welcome any modification to the current policy that could protect birds of prey and all other threatened wildlife. My party believes that the current legislation regarding wildlife crime may need to be tightened, but we would emphasise that the enforcement of the existing legislation is the real problem when it comes to wildlife crime.</p><p>RSPB Scotland said recently:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Parliament is to be commended for enacting some of the strongest wildlife protection laws in Europe. However, these laws are not being used as effectively as possible to deter those who seek to destroy protected species.\"</p><p>The problem seems to be the varying levels of enforcement in the regions of Scotland.

I am pleased to contribute to the debate, because I believe that the bill will solve some of the problems with the current judicial system.<place-holder colnum=\"8560\"/></p><p>The Scottish Conservative party&#8212;and, I am sure, everyone in the Parliament&#8212;welcomes any proposals that promote judicial independence, because it is of the utmost importance that the judiciary of Scotland remains independent. As we have heard from the convener of the Justice Committee, the principal issue surrounding the bill is judicial independence.</p><p>Historically, by ensuring that the pay of judges was not within the whim of the Crown and by providing security of tenure for holders of judicial office, a degree of judicial independence from the Government has always been provided. A number of other conventions within the common law have protected the independence of the judiciary. However, in more recent times, there has been a trend within the United Kingdom to provide statutory guarantees of judicial independence. The bill will continue that trend in Scotland by focusing on four main policy areas: judicial independence itself, the appointment process, the courts and the arrangements for the Scottish Court Service. I will briefly touch on each of those.</p><p>Part 1 of the bill sets out the requirements to guarantee that the judiciary remains independent. It will be the duty of the First Minister, the Lord Advocate, the Scottish ministers and any other persons who have responsibility for matters that pertain to the judiciary to uphold its independence. They should not try to influence judicial decisions. They are to support the judiciary and to have regard to its needs to carry out its functions efficiently.</p><p>Part 1 also provides a statutory guarantee of judicial independence. The Scottish Government concluded that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a statutory statement underlining its commitment would be a powerful and obvious reminder of the constitutional significance of judicial independence.\"</p><p>That is to be welcomed. The guarantee is much like the guarantees in section 3 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and section 1 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 that ensured judicial independence for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p><p>Part 2 establishes the Lord President as the head of the Scottish judiciary, and places many responsibilities on him. Those responsibilities may be too much. We fear that they will slow down the judicial process for many cases, and will require the Lord President to dedicate much more of his time to administrative work. We therefore welcome the Cabinet Secretary for Justice's announcement that that will be looked into.</p><p>More important, part 2 sets out the model for the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland. The board is another important way to ensure that the judicial bench remains independent, and the <place-holder colnum=\"8561\"/> convener of the Justice Committee has commented already that it is a vast improvement on the current system. The board is to be completely independent of the Scottish Executive, thereby ensuring that the judiciary will remain independent. I hope that the new selection process that the bill anticipates will be made more transparent, and that judges will be selected based solely on merit, taking into account interpersonal skills and whether they are of good character. That must be welcomed.</p><p>Part 2 also outlines provisions on the fitness of judges and on giving the public a means of voicing complaints of misconduct regarding the behaviour of judges and sheriffs. Although we agree that there is a need for a form of complaint, that may not be the best way to proceed. The general public might view the process in the bill as another appeal process, which it most certainly is not. The public should have the ability to complain and should easily be able to understand the complaints process and feel comfortable using it, but we share the Justice Committee convener's concern that we should not take a sledgehammer to crack a nut on that issue.</p><p>Part 3 places yet more responsibilities on the Lord President&#8212;responsibilities that have so far been within the remit of judges and sheriffs. Although increasing the efficiency of the court system is an important step towards judicial freedom, the increased burdens on the Lord President could detract from the speed with which some cases are dealt. Overall, however, streamlining the court system will make it easier for the public to access it and make the judiciary more independent.</p><p>The Scottish Court Service will become an entirely new body under the bill, and part 4 outlines how that will be achieved. The new SCS will be under the Scottish Administration, but it will not be part of the Scottish Government or under ministerial control, which will ensure the independence of the judiciary and should be welcomed. The new SCS will provide administrative support to the courts, the judiciary of those courts and other specified people. Its principal function will be running the court service in Scotland. However, we are concerned about such a dramatic shift of power. The switch will move all the authority away from the Scottish ministers and give it to the SCS. I urge the cabinet secretary to think carefully about such a move. Part 4 places yet more responsibilities on the Lord President.</p><p>In conclusion, the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Bill will ensure that the judiciary in Scotland remains independent. Independence within the judicial process is essential for a free and democratic society to operate. I and my party <place-holder colnum=\"8562\"/> welcome any proposal that furthers judicial independence, and we are happy to support the Government's motion.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13658477", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Justice Committee for its work in connection with the bill and its preparation of the stage 1 report.

It also concluded that the Government's plans to retain or redeploy a further 500 officers would be very challenging to deliver. The committee, like the Scottish Conservatives, recommended that more money should be allocated for policing&#8212;enough to raise the level of recruitment to 1,000 officers.</p><p>Although I appreciate the fact that the SNP Administration has inherited the problem of an underfunded police force in Scotland, that does not get the Government off the hook entirely. This was, after all, the first big U-turn by the SNP Government&#8212;in fact, it was a double U-turn by the Government on the recruitment of police. First, this time last year, during the April heat of the election campaign, it promised 1,000 new and extra police <place-holder colnum=\"7565\"/> officers in its manifesto&#8212;no ifs, no buts, no maybes. However, by the end of 2007, it made its first U-turn when it changed its mind and decided that those 1,000 new officers were to be made up not only through recruitment but by preventing early retirement and by redeploying officers. The SNP back-tracked and U-turned in a betrayal of the public and of the police.</p><p>Then, in the early days of 2008, during the budget process, the Government saw the error of its ways. It was persuaded by the arguments that were put forward by the Scottish Conservatives and it amended its budget to allow the recruitment of 1,000 additional police officers. Scotland needs those extra police officers not just to put right the wrongs of eight years of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but to deal with the SNP's soft-touch Scotland in which more and more criminals are being let out of prison even earlier.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have fought throughout the budget process to increase the levels of police recruitment, starting from this year, and we have succeeded. Without the Scottish Conservatives, Scotland would have only 500 new police officers over the next four years. There is only one party in the Parliament with any credibility on the issue and&#8212;guess what&#8212;it is the Scottish Conservatives.</p><p>We welcome the report and its findings.

It is appropriate that it should be reviewed now, so that it continues to be fit for purpose in the light of changes to other parts of the justice system. It is also important to note that, despite the fact that about 50 to 70 fatal accident inquiries are held each year, there is still a backlog of cases to be processed. Let us briefly consider the importance of such inquiries.</p><p>Fatal accident inquiries are important because they consider the circumstances of deaths that have caused serious public concern. They are held in the public interest. The main function of an FAI is to address public concern and, if appropriate, make recommendations that might prevent such accidents from occurring in the future. However, there are a number of weaknesses in the current system that Christine Grahame, Karen Gillon and others have highlighted.</p><p>The first weakness is the status of the recommendations that the sheriff makes at the end of the inquiry. As we have heard, the purpose of a fatal accident inquiry is to establish the time, place and cause of a death when there is public concern about the circumstances of the death. Such inquiries do not attribute blame or guilt in a criminal or a civil sense. The procurator fiscal leads evidence at the inquiry, which is held in the sheriff court. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the sheriff issues a determination that contains findings about the circumstances of the death. The sheriff may make recommendations as to how such deaths may be avoided in the future. Sheriffs make recommendations in about one third of all fatal accident inquiries.</p><p>As Margaret Smith, Bill Aitken and others said, a sheriff's recommendations are not legally binding&#8212;on the basis, as I understand it, that the circumstances of a particular death may be unique and it may not be appropriate to spread the conclusions across the board. It will be interesting to see what the Cullen review decides on that <place-holder colnum=\"7506\"/> point, as I know that many people would like inquiry recommendations to be given a stronger standing in law. I was particularly interested to hear Nigel Don's views on the matter.</p><p>The second weakness is the backlog. Making the current system more efficient would, I hope, reduce the backlog. One possibility would be to require inquiries to be completed within a specific time. There can be no doubt that delays are especially difficult for the families of victims. There is also an argument for enabling families to get legal support and representation if it is needed. At the very least, that would give families a better understanding of the process. That point was well made by Pauline McNeill and Michael Matheson. However, I am not sure whether it would make the system any more efficient. Indeed, the process might not be any quicker and I suspect that it would be considerably more expensive.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401894", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fatal Accident Inquiries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate and the review of the law on fatal accident inquiries are welcome.

Margaret Smith and Keith Brown articulated that point well. The current provisions do not allow fatal accident inquiries to be held into the deaths of Scottish soldiers who are killed abroad, even if their bodies are returned directly to Scotland. Scottish soldiers who are killed in action are currently flown back to an airbase in England, which gives rise to a coroner's inquest under the different jurisdictional rules that apply there.

From their introduction in July 2006 until March 2007, almost 1,300 criminals were released on HDC licences, but more than 200&#8212;almost 20 per cent&#8212;needed to be recalled to custody because they had breached the term of their licence. Let us consider the longer experience in England, where HDC has been in existence since 1998. Under that scheme, tens of thousands of criminals have been released early from prison, including dozens of sex offenders and criminals who have been convicted of cruelty to children and thousands of drug dealers. According to Home Office figures, those criminals went on to commit more than 1,000 offences, including drug offences, assaults, including on police officers, and rapes. There is no doubt in my mind that those crimes would not have happened if the criminals who committed them had remained in prison and served the entirety of their sentences.</p><p>The current system is failing and clearly does not work to cut crime&#8212;we need only consider the crime figures to realise that.

I also welcome the clarification that the Lord Advocate has given this morning of her position, given the reports in yesterday's press that many people have expressed concern about her intervention.</p><p>There is no doubt that reform in this area of law is long overdue and, given that academics and practitioners have been critical of the Scots law on rape for many years, we welcome the Scottish Law Commission's report and its conclusions.</p><p>The crime figures speak for themselves; indeed, it was partly the publication of the Scottish crime statistics in 2003 that led the previous Scottish Government to order the review. In contrast with recorded crime generally, which had fallen by 5 per cent over the same period, cases of rape and attempted rape had increased by 8 per cent. Moreover, only 10 per cent of reported rapes made it as far as court and, as a number of members have pointed out, the conviction rate in such cases has been extremely low. A series of court cases at about the same time that came in for criticism from legal commentators and the media was another factor in the drive for reform.</p><p>The Conservatives therefore agree that the law on sexual offences, particularly rape, needs to be examined to ensure that it is clear, gender-neutral and&#8212;to quote the Law Society of Scotland&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"free of the various historical and other anomalies which have characterised this area of the law, for the benefit of both the public and those, such as lawyers, judges and juries, applying the law.\"<place-holder colnum=\"6692\"/></p><p>I want to pick up on a few issues, particularly consent, that have arisen out of the proposals and this debate. The fact is that redefining this crime, important though it is, will not be sufficient to tackle all the issues that have been raised about the law on, and prosecution of, sexual offences. We need to consider other factors, such as the procedures that are adopted at trial, the law of evidence and the pre-trial procedures. I would be interested to hear the Cabinet Secretary for Justice's views when he winds up.</p><p>The essential element of a sexual assault, such as rape, is lack of consent. Under the current law, the consent element of the offence can either be considered as part of the actus rea of rape or as the mens rea, since the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the complainer was not consenting or was reckless about whether or not she consented.</p><p>As the McKearney case in 2004 illustrated, the fact that, unfortunately, there has been no legal definition of consent in the context of rape has created a number of problems. The draft criminal code provides that any consent that has been given by a person is to be disregarded if, when consent was given, it was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"induced by force or fear or was otherwise not freely given.\"</p><p>In England, section 74 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 defines consent such that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a person consents if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice.\"</p><p>Under the Law Commission's proposals, the concept of consent in rape cases would be clearly defined in statute in two parts. First, there would be a general description of the meaning of consent, or what is called \"free agreement\". Secondly, there would be a non-exhaustive list of situations, described by the Law Commission as \"indicators\", in which consent would not exist. I will not rehearse all the situations in which the complainer will not have had the freedom to choose whether to agree to intercourse, but they are broadly similar to those that operate in England and Wales. However, the commission says that they are not so much part of the law of evidence as illustrations of the key element of the offence itself. The list is to be welcomed.</p><p>However, I am not convinced that the introduction of the statutory definition of consent will solve all the concerns and problems with regard to rape cases. For example, questions whether the victim has given his or her \"true\" or \"valid\" consent will remain, because the line between true consent and mere submission is not always easy to draw.</p><p>It has been suggested that it might be preferable to avoid the use of the word \"consent\" altogether and to focus instead on whether the accused has <place-holder colnum=\"6693\"/> had sexual intercourse with a person who did not have the freedom or capacity to choose, in the circumstances. Such wording would be similar to section 74 of the 2003 act. Commentators also believe that that would shift the focus of the trial from analysis of the complainer's behaviour to the accused's behaviour.</p><p>Discussion is also taking place on whether the legal burden of proof should be moved on to the accused. I am not sure whether that is the intention of the Law Commission's proposals and the issue will certainly require further thought. I am also not sure how such a proposal would fit with the European convention on human rights. Given the complexity of the problems, I welcome Pauline McNeill's amendment, which notes the need for Parliament to properly scrutinise the proposed bill.</p><p>I will conclude with a few remarks about the need for better education, about which the Lord Advocate, Bill Aitken, Margaret Smith and several other members talked. The figures from a study by Rape Crisis Scotland of 700 potential rape trial jurors are startling. Forty per cent of the potential jurors felt that women contribute to an attack if they put themselves in a risky situation, such as willingly going home with a man, and 20 per cent believe that women contribute to rape by wearing revealing clothes.</p><p>Given such attitudes, it is important that we support the police and anti-rape campaigners, who want to end the blame culture in which many members of the public believe that victims bring on attacks by being drunk, wearing revealing clothing or flirting. Everyone&#8212;men and women&#8212;must take on more responsibility for understanding what defines consent.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399879", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rape and Sexual Offences"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate has been very interesting and informative, and the wider debate, particularly on the law of rape, has also been very well informed.

However, when I watched the television earlier this week, I realised that the constitutional battle for this week would not be justice related but would instead be about the Scottish Government's&#8212;or, more particularly, Alex Salmond's&#8212;territorial claims to the great border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. Although I would always warmly welcome the people of Berwick to my Berwickshire constituency, I remind the Government that it should be getting on with the job of governing Scotland rather than picking constitutional fights, seeking to push Scotland's border southwards and <place-holder colnum=\"6205\"/> promoting the First Minister's empire-building agenda.</p><p>The debate has been useful for a number of reasons, not least because it has given us the opportunity to consider the failure of the previous Administration's policy on prisons and to highlight the issues that the new Government must tackle.</p><p>We believe that prison should serve four functions in our society: to protect the public; to deter; to punish; and to reform criminals. I am sure that most members&#8212;at least, those of us who are Conservatives&#8212;agree that the most important of those four functions is protection of the public from the crimes that are committed by the minority.</p><p>However, as Pauline McNeill, Margaret Smith and others have pointed out, the role of the Scottish Government should be not to decide sentencing policy but to support the courts in making sentencing disposals and to ensure that adequate provision exists to allow those disposals to be implemented. The judiciary must be allowed to maintain its independence, and judges and sheriffs should be left in charge of sentencing.</p><p>I am concerned that that view is not necessarily shared by the SNP Government. For example, the SNP and others have stated that women do not belong in prison, but we must face up to the fact that half of the prisoners in Cornton Vale are there because they committed a violent crime. As David McLetchie said, to single them out for special, kid-glove treatment just because they are women is wrong.

The SCDEA fosters and continually builds closer working relationships with Scottish and other domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies. Indeed, as we heard from a number of members today, the increased ease and speed of international travel and trade means that it is likely that large numbers of organised crime groups in Scotland will continue to work with foreign criminals and operate on an international level.</p><p>The loss of Graeme Pearson was disappointing; all the members who mentioned him would agree with that. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the situation is the reasons that he gave for his departure. In that regard, I want to expand on the point that Pauline McNeill touched on during her speech. At the time of his departure, Mr Pearson was quoted in the press as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The agency has never been fully staffed and I would say, on average, is about 10% down on what it should be.\"</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"some of the forces find it difficult to release staff to us because the pressures, at force level, encourage forces to keep them there.\"</p><p>That is yet more evidence of the lack of investment in law enforcement by the previous Administration. The current Administration must address that.</p><p>As we heard from Bill Aitken, the agency can no longer be viewed as a secondary part of Scottish law enforcement. It must be given the powers, finance and freedom that it requires to enable it to tackle serious crime in the way that we expect it to. The SCDEA must be put on an equal footing with Scotland's eight regional police forces. That is the only way in which we can build on its earlier successes.</p><p>We agree that serious organised crime is a major problem across Scotland. It is important to bring together all agencies to share information and work together to provide the best possible results in relation to tackling that problem. However, once criminals are caught and charged, we must ensure that the punishment fits the crime. Like Margaret Smith, we believe that a much more rigorous approach is needed to confiscation orders and the seizure of assets. It might be necessary to change the law so that, where there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that the assets <place-holder colnum=\"4835\"/> of a convicted drug dealer were obtained by criminal activity, he or she should be required to prove that they have not been so obtained. In other words, in that situation, the onus of proof would be on the convicted criminal, not the Crown.</p><p>The debate has been useful.

A number of members have expressed an interest in the issue and I hope that as many of them as possible will contribute to the debate. I note the presence of the Presiding Officer, whose constituency of Galloway and Upper Nithsdale would be affected by the proposal to abolish Border television news.</p><p>I will set the scene. ITV Border has provided local news and programming to the Scottish Borders, south-west Scotland, Cumbria and the Isle of Man for almost 50 years. It has the second largest geographical region in the ITV network. Despite the difficulties with catering for such a wide and diverse audience, the flagship daily newsround programme, \"Lookaround\", has one of the highest ratings of any BBC or ITV regional news programme in the United Kingdom. In March 2005, the <em>Sunday Herald </em>highlighted those exceptionally high ratings when it reported that while \"Scotland Today/North Tonight\" drew a 26 per cent audience share, and \"London Tonight\" took a 28 per cent share, Border's \"Lookaround\" was watched by a whopping 42 per cent of the population at 6 pm on weekday evenings. I acknowledge that those ratings may have slipped in recent years, but Border TV news continues to have one of the highest ratings in the UK.</p><p>Why does the service have such a success rate? Why, in particular, does it score much better than any of the Scottish Media Group's ITV regions? In response to that question from the <em>Sunday Herald</em>, the managing director of ITV <place-holder colnum=\"4612\"/></p><p>Border, Mr Paddy Merrall, stated that Border news was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"more relevant to the people\".</p><p>He went on to say that Border TV benefits from there being no dedicated BBC television studio in the region&#8212;the nearest are in Newcastle and central Scotland.</p><p>The large area that Border TV has to cover has one of the lowest populations. That said, the audience is one of the most loyal. In the recent people's millions competition for the allocation of lottery funding to local projects, the Border TV region attracted the highest number of votes&#8212;almost 52,000. That compares with 19,650 for STV Central, and perhaps most surprising of all, just less than 20,000 for London.</p><p>With that background, one would have thought that the future of Border TV news would be secure. Unfortunately, the chief executive of ITV, Michael Grade, thinks differently. Shortly after his appointment, Mr Grade stated that his first priority for ITV would be to improve its programming. However, in September this year he announced a controversial five-year restructuring plan, which included a major overhaul of the regional structure of ITV. The proposals would see a consolidation of the ITV regional news programmes across the country, but for the Border region, it would involve a full merger between ITV Border and ITV Tyne Tees. What would that mean for our local news? The bulk of the local news&#8212;which is currently covered in the nightly half-hour programme&#8212;would be reduced to a 10-minute opt-out that would be expected to cover the entire Border region. That reduction in service would undoubtedly have an impact on the quality and amount of news programming for the Border region.</p><p>Let us look at some of the figures, and the stories that Border TV news has been covering in the past year. Since the start of 2007, there have been more than 300 stories on Border TV from the Scottish Borders, including 35 stories from Hawick, 17 from Eyemouth and 19 from Peebles. For Dumfries and Galloway, there have been more than 500 stories on Border TV, including 109 from Dumfries and 69 from Gretna. What hope will those local news stories have in the new enlarged ITV region? What hope can our local communities, community groups, campaign groups and sports teams have of getting on to the news agenda when they will be competing with stories and issues from Newcastle, Gateshead, Middlesbrough, Sunderland and north-east England?</p><p>Although I am assured that there will still be a news-gathering capacity in the Border TV region, by definition, the stories that come from the more <place-holder colnum=\"4613\"/> populated parts of the new ITV region will be of greater interest to more people and the news agenda will be adjusted accordingly. A 10-minute opt-out is simply not sufficient. The same arguments could also be made on the danger of losing out to Glasgow, Edinburgh and other major cities in the south central belt in any proposed merger with STV.</p><p>In passing, it is interesting to note that there is no campaign by the staff at Tyne Tees Television against the proposals, which is perhaps an indication of how they think that they will work in practice. They clearly do not regard their news coverage as being put under threat by the proposals.</p><p>Michael Grade states that he wants to reconstruct the ITV regional layout and that the existence of Border TV \"no longer makes sense\". Further, we are told that the move is expected to give ITV plc \"greater value for money\". Well, it might not make sense to a London-based metropolitan journalist like Mr Grade, but the service has, in the past, provided a crucial lifeline for thousands of people living in communities throughout the region. We need only consider the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001 to see the valuable public information service that the channel provided by giving people the latest news and public information on the problems as they unfolded. It is unlikely that that would have been the case if the news had come from the north-east of England with a 10-minute opt-out. The loss of our local news services would be another example of the marginalisation of people in rural communities.</p><p>What happens now? Following my meeting with the Office of Communications in Glasgow yesterday, I can confirm that it is still waiting for formal notification from Michael Grade of what ITV proposes to do with Border TV. Once notification has been received, it will be for Ofcom to decide on the process of consultation that it will undertake to consider the proposals.</p><p>My advice to Ofcom is to consult as widely as possible so that everybody in the Borders has the opportunity to express their views. The news that ITV has already appointed someone to head up news services in the Border and Tyne Tees region has given rise to a feeling that there is a done deal. People do not want a rubber-stamping exercise; they want to be engaged in the process and they want to know that Ofcom can and will say no to ITV's proposals. I intend to host a number of consultation meetings throughout my constituency so that local residents' voices can be heard. I urge other members to carry out similar exercises in their constituencies.</p><p>Developing technology may well mean that people will be able to access news through their <place-holder colnum=\"4614\"/> computers in the future, but it is important to acknowledge that many people in the Borders do not have access to computer networks or adequate broadband services, so the option is not necessarily open to them. Ofcom must resist the agenda of urbanisation and centralisation. It must examine and consider all the options that ITV proposes, bearing in mind the rural and diverse area that Border TV currently serves.</p><p>I look forward to hearing other MSPs' speeches. I hope that the debate will move forward across the region and that a strong argument for the retention of our local news services in the Borders and the South of Scotland will be presented to Ofcom and ITV.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395037", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Border Television News"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to debate an issue that will have a severe impact on local news coverage not only in my constituency of Roxburgh and Berwickshire, but throughout the South of Scotland region.

In the past nine years, there have been four separate security breaches at that agency. All it takes is one such occurrence, and all our national identity data could be released into the wrong hands. Such a breach of the national registry of security would have massive consequences for the British people. The Conservatives believe that, instead of spending inordinate amounts of money on a scheme for which there is no evidence that it will be a success, the ID card scheme should be scrapped and the funding reallocated to bring about four different things: the creation of more prisons, more prison drug rehabilitation facilities, more police officers and better border controls. Using those funds to build more prison facilities will greatly <place-holder colnum=\"4415\"/> reduce the overcrowding in our current prisons and improve the drug rehabilitation services. The funds could be used to create new UK border police officers to prevent and detect illegal immigration, which ID cards are supposed to do.

As we have said many times before in Parliament, increasing local police forces in Scotland would act as a powerful deterrent and would help to reduce the fear of crime.</p><p>ID cards are a bad idea.

As Margaret Mitchell pointed out, statistics have shown that 125 incidents of domestic abuse occur every day in Scotland. The fact that 55 per cent of those occurrences concern victims who have previously been involved in recorded incidents suggests that there is a repetitive pattern in domestic violence. If we keep in mind the minister's point that three out of four crimes are never reported, we must surely find the figures concerning. Given that the rise in the number of incidents of domestic abuse has been mirrored by an increase in the incidence of serious crime, that is surely representative of a wider culture of crime that can be addressed only <place-holder colnum=\"3766\"/> through enhanced law enforcement and tougher court sanctions.</p><p>As a number of members have already said, domestic abuse encompasses a wide range of victims, including children, families and males and females, and consists of various forms of violence, such as rape, indecent assault and lewd and indecent behaviour. The effects of domestic violence on children, which are the focus of the motion, are particularly concerning.</p><p>According to the British Medical Association's report on domestic abuse, each year 750,000 British children and young people are witnesses to domestic abuse. On nine out of 10 occasions, the child is in the same room, or the room next door, when events of domestic violence take place. A significant amount of evidence has been gathered on the horrific toll that violence against women has taken on the physical health, emotional well-being and education of children.</p><p>According to police figures, 659 incidents of domestic abuse were reported in my constituency in the Scottish Borders in 2006-07. Those alarming statistics have led to the Scottish Borders Council participating in the white ribbon campaign, which, as other members have said, is part of the largest campaign to end men's violence against women to have been developed and run by men. In the space of two weeks, the Scottish Borders community safety partnership and the domestic abuse working group aim to collect 2007 pledges from men in the Borders. The pledge includes a promise</p><p class=\"indent\">\"never to condone, commit or remain silent about violence against women\".</p><p>As Jim Tolson said, I am sure that all members would support that, and I am pleased that a number of male members are sporting white ribbons.</p><p>In recent years, various Government initiatives in Scotland have attempted to remedy the growing problem of domestic abuse. As members such as Margaret Smith and Cathy Jamieson have said, the pilot domestic abuse court in Glasgow that was launched in October 2004 had administrative success, but victims' safety remained a problem. The 1998 domestic abuse campaign sought to use the press to spread knowledge of domestic violence and to gain public opposition to such behaviour. Bill Aitken told us about the success of a particular campaign. The domestic abuse hotline that was created in June 2000 as part of the national strategy to address domestic abuse in Scotland offered support to victims of domestic abuse and provided them with the information that they needed for their recovery. Those initiatives have proven to be successful in educating the public about the widespread effects of domestic <place-holder colnum=\"3767\"/> abuse, but there remain concerns about the safety of victims and preventing repetition of incidents of domestic violence.</p><p>We believe that domestic abuse is an appalling and unjustifiable crime that impacts on children and families all over Scotland. Legislation is not and cannot be the only answer to the problem; there needs to be culture shift on domestic abuse, which can be achieved by increasing public confidence in the criminal justice system. We believe in stricter enforcement of legislation and sanctions, in conjunction with the creation of a stronger criminal justice system to battle the growing problem of domestic abuse in today's society.

I was a practising solicitor with Brodies until June 2007.</p><p>Like many others who have taken part in the debate, the Scottish Conservatives congratulate the Law Society of Scotland on recognising the need for change in an increasingly competitive environment. We&#8212;as is the Government&#8212;are attracted by the idea that Scotland could market its legal services on the world stage. Scots law and Scottish lawyers have a sound international reputation, so there are definite grounds for thinking that such moves would be successful.</p><p>However, we must recognise that the existing business structures would not necessarily be conducive to that in all cases. It has also been noted that smaller and, in many cases, well-established practices have no desire to go down that particular route. Any legislation would need to recognise that a one-cap-fits-all approach would be doomed to failure.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives support the existence of an independent Scottish legal profession that is effectively regulated and which provides good-quality and effective services to clients throughout Scotland. As Rhoda Grant and others do, we support the principle that a free democratic society can flourish only if its members have access to independent legal advice, especially on issues involving Government or that require Government procedures or decisions to be <place-holder colnum=\"3445\"/> challenged. That will not happen if people have restricted access to such advice or if the providers of the advice are under the control of the Government.</p><p>As we heard from Bill Aitken, the legal sector is an important part of the Scottish economy&#8212;it contributes &#163;1.2 billion to the national economy. There is also great variation in the characteristics of the legal market: for example, some areas&#8212;financial services and tax sectors, residential conveyancing and commercial law, for example&#8212;demonstrate a high level of competition, while other areas, such as family law, welfare debt and housing matters, demonstrate a low level of competition.</p><p>The focus of today's debate has been on alternative business structures as a means of freeing up the Scottish legal market. However, there are other controls that restrict the legal market in Scotland, notably the restrictions on individuals who want to enter the profession on which I will touch briefly. As Clementi noted in his report on the regulatory framework in England and Wales, setting of entry standards requires a careful judgement between setting the standard too high and restricting entry and setting the standard too low and not maintaining proper levels of competency. That is the challenge to the legal profession and the Government, and it must be a concern with the prospect of Tesco law.</p><p>In Scotland, as in England, the legal profession has grown substantially in recent decades. That has been most evident in the dramatic rise in the number of law school places. The normal route to becoming a Scottish solicitor is to complete a bachelor of law degree, followed by a diploma in legal practice. There is then a two-year training contract that includes further competency courses. Advocates go through a similar process, requiring the diploma, a five-week foundation course and a six-month pupillage. Minimum standards of quality are enforced during that training process, but there are no specific statutory or other regulatory barriers to entry. However, as anyone who has been through the system will know, there are bottlenecks in the system that work in a similar way to barriers to entry. Whether it be in gaining a place at university, a place on the diploma course or a training contract, at every stage potential solicitors and advocates have difficulty in getting into the profession.</p><p>Another barrier that I have come across is that which restricts the ability of solicitors who are not qualified in Scots law to come to Scotland to practise. Despite the fact that I held a University of Glasgow law degree and qualified in London, I had to sit several meaty examinations to become a qualified solicitor in Scotland. It felt as though it would have been easier for me to become <place-holder colnum=\"3446\"/> qualified in New York state than in my home country. That differs greatly from the situation in England, where Scots-law qualified solicitors do not face the same barriers to becoming qualified as English solicitors. I urge the Government, as part of its reform package and review, to examine such barriers to entry to the Scottish legal profession. Unless our legal profession can be accessed by the most able lawyers from throughout Scotland and around the world, we will not fulfil our ambition to enable our legal profession to compete on the international stage.</p><p>A number of members, including Aileen Campbell, talked about business structures. There are several restrictions on the ways in which Scottish legal firms can organise themselves. Advocates must be sole practitioners: they cannot form partnerships with anyone, not even other advocates. The justification for that&#8212;a point that was made by Nigel Don&#8212;is that it allows advocates to focus entirely on the work of advocacy and frees them from other demands. However, there could surely be significant advantages, through economies of scale, if that restriction were relaxed. Removal of the restriction would enable advocates to spread risks more efficiently and, potentially, to take advantage of economies of scale by meeting a range of clients' legal needs within one firm.</p><p>In relation to solicitors' practices, non-lawyers are not allowed to own legal firms and employed solicitors are not allowed to act for any third party. That is justified on the ground that it avoids any conflict of interests, maintains lawyers' independence and continues to respect client confidentiality. Although reform is required in that area, there must be some concern&#8212;as we heard from Paul Martin&#8212;that big businesses would muscle their way on to our high streets and cherry pick the most profitable legal work. We have heard throughout the debate that smaller local law firms that offer a wide range of services are vital in many communities.</p><p>In the light of recent initiatives, the Scottish Conservatives acknowledge the need for a change in the legal services profession in an increasingly competitive environment&#8212;the idea of marketing Scotland's legal services internationally, for example, is definitely appealing. In addition, although Scots law and Scottish lawyers have a respectable international reputation, it is important to note that existing business structures are not in all cases conducive to that. In order for Scotland to maintain its international reputation, the legal services market must recognise that a one-cap-fits-all approach will not be attractive. The Scottish Conservatives support the existence of an independent Scottish legal profession that is effectively regulated and which provides quality services to all clients throughout Scotland.

It can resolve minor conflicts&#8212;especially relating to family problems&#8212;personal injury cases, problems at work and <place-holder colnum=\"2957\"/> disagreements between companies and trade associations. One important point, which has not really come through in the debate, is that such schemes are not intended to take the function of the court system. However, use of the schemes as an initial means of sorting out differences should be encouraged. Another important point is that this is about civil justice and not criminal justice. That is certainly my understanding of the area at which the motion is aimed.</p><p>In November 2005, the Scottish Consumer Council investigated the civil justice system in Scotland. Its findings became the foundation for the civil justice reform debate in the Scottish Parliament in April 2006. I am pleased to hear that the cabinet secretary has restated his belief in Scotland's international reputation in finance and law. That reputation places Scotland in an ideal position to offer world-class arbitration services to its citizens.</p><p>My party has always supported the view that some issues might be better resolved by mediation or ADR without resorting to court. In such cases, skilled advice will still be required, but a court may not necessarily be the appropriate forum.</p><p>Alternative dispute resolution offers various methods of mediation and negotiation as a primary level of reconciling differences. We have heard about a number of them during today's debate. Alternative dispute resolution can, depending on the situations of the parties to the dispute, have various advantages over going to court, including greater flexibility, faster solving of problems and less stress, and it can potentially cost less.</p><p>However, it is also important to remember and emphasise that alternative dispute resolution schemes are not meant to replace the courts in all cases. Whether a case should attempt to settle via an alternative dispute resolution mechanism is completely dependent on the result that the parties to it want to achieve, the importance of the dilemma, how a party wants to go about solving it and how willing the other party is to seek an agreement.</p><p>The desired outcome is often what drives a party to pursue ADR rather than the traditional court route. If the party wanted an order that something be done or stopped, compensation or a judgment from a court about what is right and who is wrong, they would take the matter through the civil courts system. If what is wanted, however, is a result such as a change in how a person or organisation behaves, a promise that a person or company will not do something, an apology or explanation, a mistake to be corrected, money that is owed to be paid or something to be fixed or replaced, parties will benefit from ADR.<place-holder colnum=\"2958\"/></p><p>An all-encompassing review of Scotland's civil courts system is under way&#8212;we can expect it to report in 2009. Although I do not suggest that we copy wholesale the recent reforms to the civil courts system in England following Lord Woolf's recommendations, I am pleased that the cabinet secretary has said that the Government is willing at least to consider those reforms, about which I know a little. Lord Woolf's approach to reform in England and Wales was to encourage early settlement of disputes through a combination of pre-action protocols, active case management by the courts and cost penalties for parties who unreasonably refused attempts to negotiate or to consider ADR. Evidence indicates that the Woolf reforms are working to the extent that pre-action protocols are promoting settlement before applications are made to court, most cases are being heard earlier and fewer cases are settling at the door of the court. In fact, most cases are now settled without a hearing ever taking place. However, costs have increased or have at least been front-loaded. In particular, costs are clearly higher for the parties involved in cases in which mediation has been attempted but agreement has not been reached.</p><p>Despite the encouragement of pre-action protocols, civil procedure rules and the funding code, the use of ADR in England has not increased as much as was anticipated. The voluntary pilot mediation scheme at central London county court had a take-up rate of around only 4 per cent before 1999. Between 1999 and 2003, when the effects of the Woolf reforms were beginning to be felt, there was an increase in the take-up rate for the scheme but a decrease in the settlement rates from 62 per cent to 40 per cent. It has been suggested that the Woolf reforms have led parties to mediate to avoid the cost penalties and to appear to co-operate with judicial direction but be half-hearted in their attempts to negotiate settlements. The reasons that are given by lawyers and parties involved support that theory.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives support the view that there are methods to resolve disputes that involve the use of skilled advice but not necessarily in a court environment. We would be considerably interested if the Scottish Government were to extend the system of alternative dispute resolution schemes to cover commercial matters. People who are confronted with an issue on which they need advice should be able to access that advice as locally as possible. One method of ensuring such local access is to provide advice through the CABx, which advise on a range of topics, such as financial problems, family disputes, individual guidance and protecting consumers against incompetence by companies and other groups.<place-holder colnum=\"2959\"/></p><p>The Scottish Conservatives believe that what is most important is improvement in delivery of civil justice in Scotland.

It was reported in 2001 that one in six road accident deaths in Scotland was due to drunk driving, and that one in three accidents in which adult pedestrians were killed on the road was due to a drunk driver. In addition, alcohol is a factor in over half the deaths caused by fire in Scotland.</p><p>A recent survey reported that 93 per cent of those surveyed believed that crime was a problem in Scotland; the only issue that was considered more problematic was drug and alcohol abuse. The survey also reported that, among respondents who were able to say anything about the person or people who had committed a crime, 45 per cent said that the person or at least one of the people was under the influence of alcohol at the time.</p><p>The increase in the abusing of alcohol consumption has also proven to have severe effects on health. It has contributed to a number of liver diseases and other alcohol-related diseases. The national health service alcohol briefing in 2003 reported that 42,000 people had visited their GP with an alcohol-related problem. In addition, one in 10 accident and emergency admissions in Scotland can be attributed to alcohol. The number of patients discharged from hospital with alcohol-related liver disease has more than doubled in the past 10 years.</p><p>The growing problem of the abusing of alcohol consumption has had the most shocking effects on children. A significant part of the problem of the increased consumption of alcohol by children in recent years&#8212;which also adds to underage drinking&#8212;is the alcohol obtained in off-sales. According to the \"Alcohol Statistics Scotland 2007\" survey, between 1990 and 2004 there was an increase in the percentage of alcohol sales made through off-trade premises and a decline in on-trade sales. The second most common way for children to buy alcohol was through an off-licence shop, with 7 per cent of 13-year-olds and 19 per <place-holder colnum=\"2769\"/> cent of 15-year-olds obtaining alcohol in that manner.</p><p>The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 introduced measures to simplify the licensing regime, but it failed to introduce any measures to curb underage drinking. Instead, it targeted the majority of Scots who use alcohol sensibly, and it passed the costs of policing on to premises that are not responsible for bad behaviour.</p><p>Although Scotland's problem of excessive alcohol consumption has grown significantly in recent years, it is a problem that can be resolved with increased awareness of the harmful effects of alcohol and with more effective legislation. Education on those harmful effects is imperative, especially for young children. Policing of licensed premises is necessary, and stricter enforcement will involve co-operation between the police and, importantly, the licensing boards. Businesses that conduct themselves irresponsibly should lose their licences, but responsible sections of the trade should not be penalised.</p><p>We welcomed the recent partnership announcement between the previous Scottish Executive and the alcohol industry&#8212;especially the suggestion that there should be a crackdown on owners of licensed premises that sell alcohol to underage drinkers. Scottish Conservatives have called for that before; we have also called for businesses to become more involved with those initiatives.</p><p>Excessive alcohol consumption is a problem that not only can be prevented from growing but can be eliminated.

The process is time consuming and should begin immediately if we are to solve the urgent and pressing problem.</p><p>A report prepared for the Scottish Police Federation by Professor Arthur Midwinter compares police spending in Scotland with that in the rest of the United Kingdom and with spending on other major public services in Scotland. The report reveals that police expenditure per capita is significantly lower in Scotland than it is in the rest of the United Kingdom&#8212;the expenditure is 20 per cent higher in England and 12 per cent higher in Wales. With other major public spending, Scottish spending levels are much higher than the UK spending average, which reflects Scotland's higher levels of social need, as shown in the measures of poverty, deprivation and poor health. The report shows that the need factors drive police expenditure, which begs the question why Scotland has such a low level of funding for its police forces. In addition, the report notes that funding is not dependent on the comprehensive spending review or the budget. Professor Midwinter concludes that that is a direct result of the Government's decisions. Police funding in local budgets has grown in line with other services, but the rate of growth is below the average, because of the Scottish Government's political priorities.</p><p>As we heard from Bill Aitken, in the SNP election campaign in April, at the Scottish Police Federation conference, Alex Salmond promised to allocate an SNP Government's funds to health, education and policing and said that, if need be, more funds would be allocated to achieve the commitment to increase police numbers. He went further by adding that &#163;78 million would be allocated specifically for the addition of the promised 1,000 police officers. In May 2007, Alex Salmond again promised the additional officers and compared the SNP's approach favourably with Conservative party strategy.</p><p>The Conservative party is the only party that has any credibility on the issue.

I was able to see at first hand what the police encounter every day and to discuss their concerns about how we can improve general policing and safety records in the Borders. It is clear&#8212;as it is throughout the United Kingdom&#8212;that drug abuse and crimes connected to drug use take up a lot of police time.</p><p>It is often assumed that drug abuse is a problem of the big cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. However, as Christine Grahame stated earlier, it is as much a blight on the streets of the towns and villages across the Borders as it is elsewhere. Indeed, in some league tables on drug crime, the Scottish Borders area comes ahead of West Lothian and Falkirk and is on a par with Edinburgh.</p><p>The drug dependency figures for young people in the Scottish Borders show a worrying trend. In a recent survey, a staggering 20 per cent of 15-year-olds had used drugs, which is higher than the average for Scotland. What is more, the number of drug-related deaths of people in their early 20s is disproportionately higher in the Scottish Borders. Drug use is clearly becoming a problem at an earlier age in the Scottish Borders, and there is no clear evidence as to why.</p><p>The decision of the previous Scottish Government to replace the just say no campaign with the much weaker know the score programme was perhaps not the wisest decision. We need to make children much more aware of the dangers of drugs from an earlier age.</p><p>I note the SNP's election pledge to ensure &#163;10 million investment in classroom-based drug education. I hope that the new Administration can fulfil that election promise.</p><p>We must consider the provision of services to tackle drugs misuse from a rural perspective. The health service has been increasingly centralised in the big towns and cities. In rural areas a home visit can sometimes take up most of the day. For safety reasons, such visits often have to be carried out by more than one person. Such issues have to be given greater consideration. An extra &#163;15,000 of funding might go a long way in Glasgow or <place-holder colnum=\"1471\"/> Dundee, but it will not even pay the cost of an extra member of staff in somewhere like the Borders. The downgrading of the Borders local treatment centres has had an adverse consequence. It is only right that the Government should reflect on that in future funding plans.</p><p>Social responsibility and social entrepreneurs have an important role to play in dealing with social problems. It is therefore important not to forget the role that the voluntary and charitable sectors, as well as social entrepreneurs, can play in tackling problems. I would like that to be recognised more, and those sectors to be included in public policy reviews to a much greater extent. Government does not always know best and it does not always have the right answers&#8212;sometimes it is better for it to stand aside and let others take over. I am waiting eagerly to see how the new Administration will approach that aspect of the drugs challenge.</p><p>I am proud of the work that my Conservative party colleagues have done in pursuing drug abuse. Annabel Goldie has highlighted the issue consistently, often when it was not fashionable to do so. The damage that drug abuse does to our communities is immeasurable. Annabel Goldie and the Scottish Conservatives should be congratulated on the work that they did in the previous session to push the issue to the top of the agenda. My Conservative colleagues and I intend in this session to ensure that that work continues.</p><p>I am pleased that so far the new Administration has been prepared to co-operate on the matter. I am sure that there are many areas on which we will disagree, but there is great potential for us to work together on drug abuse to bring about positive change.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13386762", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A couple of weeks ago, I served a night shift with the local police force down in my constituency in the Borders.

We must not be afraid to embrace any technology that will help us to protect the most vulnerable group of people in our communities.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have taken a strong lead in this debate over many months and I look forward to our contributing fully to future policy direction in this area with the new Administration.</p><p>The Angelika Kluk murder case highlighted flaws in the existing system. Peter Tobin, the convicted, had previously disappeared and could not be traced for 11 months. He failed to meet his statutory obligation to register with the police following his conviction on two charges of rape. When police called to interview him after an incident in Paisley involving another young woman, he effectively went underground. He broke his registration requirements and reoffended in Glasgow, only a few miles away. I therefore fully understand why the fear of predatory sex offenders is growing in Scotland. We just have to look at the recent events in Portugal to see the strength of public feeling.</p><p>For every step that we consider, it is essential that we ask whether it will increase the level of protection for society. Some have called for a Sarah's law to be introduced in Scotland. Giving parents the right to know details of the sex offenders living in their areas might provide some comfort, but I echo Jeremy Purvis's concern that that comfort might be false. In America, where there is such a law, the level of registration among sex offenders is 17 per cent lower than it is in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, such a scheme only has the effect of allowing individuals to drop out of the monitoring system altogether. I want to ensure that the greatest number of sex offenders remains under scrutiny, and a Sarah's law would not achieve that.</p><p>As Margaret Mitchell said, we will clearly have to ensure that a strong tracking and monitoring scheme is put in place; that has been a key theme of Scottish Conservative policy over recent years. First, we agree with the minister that we will have to make use of polygraph tests to monitor sex offenders. That idea has been supported by the leading children's charity, Barnardo's. Secondly, if released offenders abscond from the system, it is important that we take immediate action. Alarm <place-holder colnum=\"579\"/> bells should ring at that point, but that does not seem to happen at present. Lastly&#8212;and here I disagree with Gil Paterson&#8212;names and photos should be published when sex offenders have broken their registration requirements. There needs to be greater communication between different authorities, and global positioning satellite tracking should be put in place to track those people down.</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the monitoring of sex offenders. Some individuals will not pose a continued threat and can be monitored perfectly effectively under the current system. Others pose a greater risk to the community and should be treated differently. Too many people are slipping through the net, and the safety and security of society must not be allowed to be threatened continually.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384622", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sex Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo Roseanna Cunningham's remarks.

According to the Government's own figures, for every &#163;1 that is spent on drug treatment, almost &#163;10 is saved on criminal justice and health costs. The proposals to increase spending on drug rehabilitation should therefore be welcomed, although we do not accept that that should be tied to having more community-based punishments. We would like there to be more investment in drug rehabilitation schemes.</p><p>The SNP's manifesto contained a commitment to reinstate the Airborne Initiative, which the Liberal Democrats and Labour voted to abolish. We will support any proposals by the new Government to reintroduce the scheme. We strongly believe that early intervention schemes play an important part in the wider battle against antisocial behaviour. That point was made by Michael Matheson.</p><p> The first duty of a Government is to protect society from those who seek to destroy it. Contrary to the views of Labour members, there was an erosion of our criminal justice system under the Lib-Lab pact, with fewer police on the beat, easier access to bail, ineffective community sentences, a cancer of repeat offences&#8212;which caused mayhem and misery&#8212;an increase in crime and offences and an increase in the number of methadone prescriptions.</p><p>We were pleased to hear that the SNP wants an increase in the number of police officers, which Margaret Smith also mentioned. As there are only 147 police officers on the beat at any one time&#8212;again thanks to the Labour-Liberal Administration of the past eight years&#8212;the Conservatives can support that priority, but we would like more to be done to cut the red tape and bureaucracy that keep our police officers sitting behind desks, to allow them to get out on the streets so that they <place-holder colnum=\"434\"/> can act as a visible deterrent to crime and disorder.</p><p> Several members have mentioned prison and early release. Prisons serve four functions in society: first, to protect the public; secondly, to rehabilitate; thirdly, to punish; and, lastly, to deter. The most important of those is the protection of the public. The SNP proposes to use more community sentences. Although they may have a role, they must never be a soft option; nor should they be favoured because of a lack of space in our jails.</p><p>The challenge to the SNP Government is clear. It must tidy up Scotland's justice system so that people feel safe in their homes and are not in constant fear of crime.

It is an honour and a privilege to be elected to represent the historic constituency of Roxburgh and Berwickshire, which I and other members often refer to as R and B. However, I must say that the abbreviation can give rise to some confusion among some of my younger constituents, who think that I represent American soul or hip-hop music in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>My constituency is as diverse as it is beautiful, stretching from the North sea coast, where the Berwickshire fishing industry is based, down through the Berwickshire merse and the historic Borders towns of Duns, Coldstream, Kelso and Jedburgh, through the central Borders villages around St Boswells and southwards to Hawick and Newcastleton. I am proud to be the standard-bearer for my home area in the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"230\"/> Parliament and I will work as hard as I can to represent the views of all my constituents, however they voted.</p><p>I also thank my predecessor, Euan Robson, for his service in the Scottish Parliament on behalf of the constituency. I wish him and his family well for the future.</p><p>The Borders has a fine tradition of parliamentary representation and political upset. At Westminster, we were represented for many years by Lord Steel of Aikwood, who became the first Presiding Officer of this Parliament, and latterly by Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope. As members will no doubt know, neither of these noble men is of my political persuasion. To find someone who is, we need to go back to 1974, when Michael Ancram was briefly the Conservative MP for Berwickshire, and then further back, to 1965&#8212;42 years ago&#8212;to when Commander Donaldson was the last Conservative MP for the county of Roxburghshire. I am sure that some of my Liberal MSP colleagues sitting on my left hope that I will not last 42 years, but as I am the third youngest member of this Parliament and the youngest in the Conservative group, I think that time might be on my side.</p><p>I want to discuss the issue under debate&#8212;the creation of wealth&#8212;in the context of the rural economy, which is, of course, relevant to my constituency. In today's relatively comfortable urban world, it is all too easy to forget that nearly 90 per cent of Scotland's land mass is rural. Indeed, it is particularly easy to do so if one works in the central belt, where the increasing absence of green fields gives the opposite impression. However, if we think carefully about it, we can clearly see that the famous symbols of Scotland&#8212;our whisky, our salmon, Scotch beef, our tartans and wool, bagpipes and haggis&#8212;have a strong identity with traditional rural areas. Whole communities have grown up behind the celebrated status of such products and, if we do not support them, we are in danger of destroying rural communities and livelihoods.</p><p>In the Borders, the traditional industries of farming and textiles have been in decline for many years. The wages are among the lowest in Scotland, there are empty shops on every high street and economic growth is lower than average. We have been unable to attract and retain new businesses and investment. As many rural communities, including the Borders, have poor trunk roads, inadequate bus services and no direct rail links to the major financial and industrial centres of Scotland, I look forward to hearing that the new Administration will prioritise plans to upgrade the A7, the A68 and the A1, all of which are major routes through my constituency.</p><p>We also need to offer young families the services that they would expect in urban Scotland: <place-holder colnum=\"231\"/> good schools, dentists, hospitals and local shops. That is why it is unacceptable that so many people in the Borders have been unable to find a national health service dentist and that so many of our cottage and community hospitals were closed by the previous Administration. It is also why we must oppose the Westminster Government's plans to close more rural post offices.</p><p>Without proper infrastructure investment in roads, schools, hospitals, post offices and water resources&#8212;and without thinking of the basics that communities need in order to flourish&#8212;we are in danger of breaking rural communities so that they have no sense of community at all.</p><p>Overall, we need a business environment that encourages new enterprise and productivity. We welcome the SNP's manifesto commitment to improve the business environment in Scotland. We welcome especially the proposals to work with us in cutting business rates. I was pleased to hear that the new Executive will follow through on its manifesto commitments to reduce regulations and conduct a thorough review of Scottish Enterprise. My constituents and I hope that the new SNP Administration will put the rural economy at the top of its agenda for the next four years.</p><p>Again I express my thanks and gratitude to my constituents for sending me here.
