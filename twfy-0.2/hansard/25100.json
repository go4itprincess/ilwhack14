As a result, I ask the Scottish Government to present the exercise&#8217;s findings to Parliament this spring along with an action plan for tackling FGM and details of the resources that will be dedicated to it.

There are cuts in Dundee to Dundee Women&#8217;s Aid, Barnardo&#8217;s and countless other organisations that do work with people in our communities who are struggling.</p><p>Today&#8217;s budget has no clear link to poverty reduction. With anti-poverty budgets being slashed since the SNP came to power, that priority has all but vanished. The use of food banks in Scotland continues to soar, but we have no discernible plan for those who need and use them.</p><p>What of Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets, which the First Minister heralded as the most ambitious in the world but which were missed again last year? The policies that the Government has put in place to tackle climate change have been openly criticised by Scotland&#8217;s two largest local authorities because there is no clear funding line to pay for them. Targets without funding and action become merely empty rhetoric.</p><p>That is why I have been pleased to hear in the debate and during the Finance Committee debate before Christmas consensus that the Government&#8217;s budget must be linked to its own priorities&#8212;the national performance framework. Michael McMahon made the case for that well. I hope that the cabinet secretary will take the point on board in his next budget. Brave and bold Governments look to reassess priorities, to be strategic with their money and to be focused on economic growth and creating a new and better Scotland now.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s key ask in the budget is familiar to the cabinet secretary. We have discussed publicly and privately that we want &#163;50&#160;million to mitigate the bedroom tax. The SNP&#8217;s answer to that, as we have heard many times in the chamber over the past couple of years and today, is to get rid of Westminster, but that is overly simplistic and counterproductive. While Parliament remains within the economic strength of the United Kingdom, its duty is to enhance or mitigate policies and factors that affect people&#8217;s lives in Scotland.</p><p>In every jurisdiction, Governments will pass policies that are iniquitous. That is why Labour members campaign for progressive policies and Governments throughout these islands. It is our duty to do all that is in our power to mitigate the bedroom tax.</p><p>The cabinet secretary and countless SNP speakers said that they did not have the mechanism to do that. I expect that the cabinet secretary might be able to find the money if he did, as I have heard SNP members say many times in the chamber that they want rid of the bedroom tax, so I assume that they are also committed to mitigating its effects in full and have already found the &#163;20&#160;million for that purpose. What the cabinet secretary and his officials say they cannot yet find is the mechanism to mitigate the full effects.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary whether he and his officials have exhausted the local authorities&#8217; powers of wellbeing.

That suggestion has been made. It is a power that was given to local authorities across the United Kingdom by the Labour Government in 2003. It allows local authorities to enhance wellbeing and to address certain needs in their communities. Some of the Government&#8217;s stated aims in legislation are to tackle poverty and deprivation and to reduce inequalities. A cursory reading of the provisions in the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 gives me confidence that it could be used to find the mechanism that John Swinney is looking for.

So, at stage 1, when we examined the central component of this bill&#8212;namely the new powers for Scottish ministers over regulations and the bodies that fulfil regulatory functions&#8212;we made it clear that we could not vote in favour of the bill unless we were satisfied first, that there was proper scrutiny to complement the Scottish Government&#8217;s new functions; secondly, that those new functions did not adversely impact on the ability of local authorities to adapt and adjust to local circumstances; and, thirdly, that the duty called &#8220;sustainable economic growth&#8221; would not have unintended consequences for regulators that would result in their prioritising one consideration over all other essential functions.</p><p>I turn first to our third concern. Today, Labour voted again with Alison Johnstone&#8217;s amendments seeking either to remove any reference to sustainable economic growth from the bill or to change that duty to sustainable development.

I agree with Mr Fraser that it was a bit of a surprise when the Government amendment came out of the blue at stage 2, and I share his concern about the lack of consultation on the amendment, which was not discussed at all during stage 1. It is a shame that we were not able to take evidence and give the policy more consideration at that point.</p><p>I will recap some of the points that have been raised today. I put on the record again our continued unease about the section on sustainable economic growth and the insertion of a sustainable economic growth duty in the bill, and our support for Alison Johnstone&#8217;s amendments. I accept the Government&#8217;s assurances that it will do its utmost to ensure that regulators are not forced to compromise on their other, equally important, duties.</p><p>I again welcome the minister&#8217;s drive towards greater transparency in the bill with the amendments that he lodged at stage 2. However, I remain disappointed that he did not see the value, as COSLA and others did, of accepting the amendments from my colleague Margaret McDougall, which in our opinion would have bolstered the planning process in Scotland.</p><p>As I argued earlier, the fact that the bill exempts local authorities from the need to pursue sustainable economic growth is a welcome step, and I think that members know why. COSLA and Unison gave evidence to the committee that made the case for maintaining the status quo in that regard. We need to ensure that our local authorities are empowered to adapt to local situations, which can vary widely throughout Scotland. If COSLA and others tell us that it is happening now, we should listen, and I am glad that the minister chose to do so at stage 2.</p><p>Because of the focus on part 1, an issue that has been a little lost in the debate is that of the powers that the bill gives to SEPA. The steps to ensure better safety measures for SEPA officers are of course welcome. The bill widens SEPA&#8217;s remit extensively, and I am confident that the organisation will take on its new responsibilities with vigour.

I will not go into an explanation of burdens, because I do not think that I could do it better than the committee convener did. The problem is that enforcement rights can be found to exist where no one intended them. Professor Robert Rennie, who has already been quoted in this debate and is one of Scotland&#8217;s leading property lawyers, said that the effect of section 53 could be to create rights where none existed before feudal abolition and that people who were not subject to conditions before 2004 suddenly become subject to burdens without their consent.</p><p>We were told that section 53 is causing uncertainty. With the provision on &#8220;related properties&#8221;, it is difficult for people to work out who might have a right to enforce a burden against their property in the future, and it is costly for prospective property owners to instruct lawyers to work out who might have that right of enforcement against them&#8212;say, if they decide to build an extension to their property. Often, solicitors cannot identify an exhaustive list of who may or may not have enforcement rights against their clients. There is uncertainty in a field of law in which it is highly desirable for people to have as much certainty as possible, especially when they are buying a property.</p><p>Several law firms explained the problem. Biggart Baillie described it in its written submission, and Brodies LLP and Pinsent Masons raised similar concerns and frustrations. In the light of the uncertainty, which affects property sales, and the evidence that section 53 was inserted by a stage 2 amendment to the bill, as Roderick Campbell said, with the intentions and consequences perhaps not being properly scrutinised or foreseen at the time, I agree with the Justice Committee&#8217;s recommendation that section 53 be referred to the Scottish Law Commission for review, and I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s acceptance of that recommendation.</p><p>I note that the review will most likely commence in 2015 as part of the ninth programme of law reform, but I ask the minister for guidance on when she anticipates that we will see a change in the law as a result of the review. The review of section 53 is a satisfactory outcome of the Justice Committee&#8217;s inquiry, and I thank the clerks, the convener and those who gave evidence.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830498", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A critical function of this Parliament&#8212;and one that, as I know many colleagues agree, we do not do enough of&#8212;is post-legislative scrutiny to review our laws and check whether they are serving people properly.

The committee called for development of the tool to enable us to understand better how the money that the Government spends on delivering core policies is contributing to the outcomes that it wants for Scotland.</p><p>There is an opportunity here for the Scottish Government to be smarter and better at delivering a budget that engages the key challenges that face Scotland&#8212;as members have said throughout the debate. This is about the public&#8217;s understanding of what their Government is doing for them, because government is about choices, which are never mutually exclusive, so the need for policies that follow priorities and are linked to performance indicators is important&#8212;not least when several indicators show that there is room for improvement.</p><p>That was evidenced in the committee&#8217;s scrutiny of the Government&#8217;s prioritisation of preventative spend. In assessing the change funds, for example, the committee welcomed the additional money for the early years fund, but noted a lack of investment at local level. As the Local Government and Regeneration Committee found, part of the reason for that is the difficulty that local authorities have in reprioritising their spend to target appropriate preventative policies in extremely difficult circumstances. That point was made throughout the debate&#8212;we heard it from Kenny Gibson in his opening speech on behalf of the committee, from Iain Gray on behalf of Labour and from Anne McTaggart and Bob Doris during the open debate.</p><p>As Neil Bibby said, there are levers that the Government can pull now to strengthen its preventative spend agenda significantly in relation to the early years. Labour&#8217;s proposal to use the money and powers that we have to deliver childcare to 50 per cent of two-year-olds would benefit nearly 300,000 children through investment in their wellbeing and education from an early age, and by providing parents with opportunities to get back to work at a time when our economic recovery needs them. The policy embodies effective preventative spend, and delivery now is within our gift, given the powers of Parliament and the autumn statement Barnett consequentials.</p><p>The Finance Committee considered the impact of welfare reforms on local authorities and communities.

I hope that that answers Sandra White&#8217;s question. We simply do not know how much higher the figure is. The Scottish Government has not tried to scope the extent of this human rights abuse in Scotland, much less to challenge it. Why? It is because it involves little girls, their genitals, race and where they come from. It involves challenging a culture in which many women who have undergone FGM themselves still believe that it is an acceptable practice.

The common fisheries policy was set up to address the simple collective action problem that, if each member state were to fish unfettered, collectively we would decimate our stocks, permanently harm the biodiversity of our waters and undermine the long-term economic interests of the coastal communities that depend on our fishing industry.</p><p>Co-operation is therefore the key to success. In recent years in Scotland, we have taken great leaps to demonstrate our commitment to co-operate within the UK and across Europe and to fulfil our role as a responsible nation in the common fisheries policy. From real-time closures to closed-circuit television pilots, we have shaped Europe&#8217;s approach to a sustainable fisheries policy. Those measures must continue to be developed, as they are a proportional and effective means for Scotland to continue to lead the way on responsible fisheries management.</p><p>However, in the interests of fairness, it is vital that the restrictions that we place on our industry are backed by robust and reliable scientific data. One of the most significant opportunities that regionalisation gives us is the opportunity to collaborate better and build on the science that underpins the decisions that we make. That is because good scientific data has the ability to build consensus on what our collective interest looks like.

Through the bill, we have the opportunity to enshrine in law the expectations, practices, relationships and penalties for the many bodies that carry out regulatory functions. Sadly, however, the bill falls short of such expectations.</p><p>Labour member&#8217;s speeches today will cover different sections of the bill. My colleague Margaret McDougall will focus on part 1 and Claudia Beamish will examine some of the environmental aspects in part 2. That leaves me to introduce the main areas that we feel need to be addressed. Central to our concerns, and reflected in a wide range of evidence to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, is the loss of local accountability when regulations are made, changed or removed.</p><p>The bill will give the Government a great deal of power over future regulatory reform, but there is little in the way of scrutiny of how that power will be used. Indeed, the committee report states that it heard from many witnesses who had difficulty understanding the implications of the proposed enabling power because of the lack of detail on the circumstances in which it would be used, or to whom it would apply. The Scottish Council for Development and Industry and the Law Society of Scotland both expressed concern that there is no clarity around the duty, which makes it difficult to interpret what the bill will achieve in practice. The Law Society urged Parliament to clarify the approach that the Scottish Government is taking.</p><p>My fear is that the approach that the Government is taking is to centralise the power to set, change and create new regulations that will fulfil the more modest policy intention of providing national standards in regulation. In the process, we are losing transparency and accountability, because the bill will not allow Parliament to scrutinise those powers, although they are being centralised, or to scrutinise the changes to the regulatory frameworks that they will bring.</p><p>Given that a number of businesses and stakeholders are voicing similar concerns, we need to know what action the Scottish Government is taking to ensure that changes will be made democratically and transparently. In particular, I urge the Government to reconsider whether the super-affirmative procedure is a more democratic way of exercising its powers.</p><p>With regard to the national standards themselves, I appreciate that there is a need to eradicate duplication and inconsistency. However, must that come through the sacrifice of local decision making? Unison and the Scottish Trades Union Congress have both questioned whether the legislation strikes the right balance. Unison stated:</p><p>&#8220;Authorities must be able to set their own standards and respond to local situations.&#8221;</p><p>Although I am glad that the minister is working with COSLA, I urge the Government to consider whether the bill needs to be amended to reflect the memorandum of understanding that has been agreed. As Andrew Fraser of North Ayrshire Council said:</p><p>&#8220;It is unusual for legislation to require a non&#8211;statutory memorandum of understanding to make it acceptable and workable.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 5 June 2013; c 2946]</p><p>I agree. We need legislation that is sustainable on its own. If the Government is to introduce national standards, it has a responsibility to balance those standards with the duty on local authorities to respond to local needs.</p><p>In turning from a provision that is not in the bill to one that should not be in it, I will touch on the duty to promote sustainable economic growth. Just 29 per cent of those who were consulted agreed that that duty should be in the bill; there are serious concerns about how it will work in practice, which have already been aired. The STUC, in its submission to the committee, argued strongly that a mandatory duty on regulators to pursue economic growth could create a conflict of interests in relation to their function to regulate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the Federation of Small Businesses has pointed out, regulation is necessary to protect our environment and communities from harm.

Regulations keep us safe, they contribute to sustainability and they make the everyday easier. For regulatory reform to work, it must be built by Government, yes, but also by the communities that benefit directly from it.</p><p>Under the bill as it stands, I fear that we will lose the democratic element to our regulation, lose the input of the representatives who are closest to people and, therefore, risk suffering from regulation that works against our local communities and businesses rather than with and for them. I completely agree with Bruce Crawford that regulation is about creating the conditions for business to flourish while protecting people. I completely agree with that assertion, which the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism challenged me on in my opening speech. We want to see the ideal conditions for business, but we need the balance that Bruce Crawford talked about. I do not think that the bill goes to the heart of striking that balance properly.</p><p>I am not opposed to national standards, but the bill must do the responsible thing by telling us unequivocally how national standards will work with our local authorities, whose duty is to serve the needs of the community.</p><p>Principles in a memorandum of understanding offer small comfort compared to the clarity of the law, but I fear that the Government is not prepared to clarify its law because it does not yet know the impact of the changes that it proposes. What good is a duty to promote sustainable economic growth to a regulator whose function is to penalise businesses when they flout environmental standards? How will that balance be struck and who will make that decision? The experts&#8212;the Law Society of Scotland, which regulates and represents its members&#8212;tell us that it might be the courts, which are already overburdened, yet we are being asked to take comfort in a code of practice that has not yet been thought of.</p><p>I ask the minister to seriously consider the issue. The cart is being put before the horse. All that we really know is that power will come to Edinburgh, but we do not know how it will be used. The bill will give the Government the power to introduce, amend and delete regulations without proper oversight by the Parliament. That is the stuff of a Government that is more concerned about where power lies than about how the power is used and that is not why we fought for this Parliament.</p><p>I urge the Scottish Government to seriously consider the remarks of the Law Society with regard to section 4, &#8220;Regulators&#8217; duty in respect of sustainable economic growth&#8221;. The guidance that Fergus Ewing relied on earlier in his intervention has not yet been thought of or drafted, but it is what the lawyers would refer to in deciding on such cases. It is worth reiterating the Law Society&#8217;s concerns. In written evidence, it said of the duty:</p><p>&#8220;The underlying question in relation to the avoidance of burdens on commerce must be whether the imposition of this new duty actually contributes to better regulation or merely adds a further complication to process. If the duty is imposed, the failure to write it into decisions, difficult, as it is to apply, may only result in generating a further ground for appeal of the decision.&#8221;</p><p>I ask the minister in his closing remarks to address that concern about section 4. Concerns have been voiced from across the chamber. The duty will cause problems in local authorities and in the courts, so I ask the Government to review the issue before stage 2.</p><p>I want better regulation for Scotland, but I do not believe that the bill guarantees that in any way. My colleague Claudia Beamish made a good case for including a provision on sustainable development in the bill; that was echoed eloquently by Alison Johnstone. I ask the Government to make that one of its considerations.</p><p>We have made clear our view that the principles of the bill are currently unsupportable, although I hope that the Government is listening carefully and will come back with alternative proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I began the debate by talking about the importance of regulation to our communities and to our environment.

I believe it to be a first in the United Kingdom. Everyone had their say on what they want Dundee to celebrate in 2017&#8212;a special year for them. The bid is a community bid, made up of the voices of Dundonians singing proudly for their city.</p><p>Feats of engineering, computing, a history of jute&#8212;weaving and spinning, hard work</p><p>&#8220;shifting bobbins coarse and fine&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>and our tough experiences in the mills and the factories make up our stories and our struggles, all of which encouraged Dundee to seize cultural opportunities when they reappeared in our city, when the RRS Discovery sailed home in 1986.</p><p>Culture, music, art and drama are nothing without a story and a struggle. They are about the art of making the everyday beautiful. That is why our cultural renaissance has been so successful, so inclusive and so pervasive in the city. Our city is not divided when it comes to embracing culture. Music rings out from venues throughout the city, and art galleries are successful&#8212;especially the newly refurbished McManus galleries, which the culture secretary mentioned.</p><p>In Dundee, we are united in the love of our home city and the culture that it boasts. However, our city is divided in terms of the share of wealth and opportunities. That is why the greatest challenge of the 2017 bid is to ensure that the year of celebration reaps benefits for all our communities. Our greatest challenge in Dundee is to create wealth and opportunity in communities that suffer the blights of unemployment, drugs, shorter lives and the desolation that wrecks dreams.</p><p>That is at the core of why Dundee is bidding for the important city of culture status. We know the transformative effects of culture. We have witnessed Dundee&#8217;s transformation over the past 40 years from a post-industrial city to an exciting hub of scientific research, with some of the finest engineering minds in the world staying in the city and creating new companies and opportunities in the life sciences, medicine, technology, computing and gaming.</p><p>We witnessed the deluge of Dundonians into the Dundee Contemporary Arts centre when Donald Dewar opened its doors in 1999. We remember the fun of the Dundee 800 and the community spirit of &#8220;Witch&#8217;s Blood&#8221;. We know that with a well thought-out bid, as our bid is, and a well-funded plan for 2017, city of culture status for Dundee will make a difference to the lives of many of our citizens. It will raise our aspirations further and give us shared and individual memories of the beautiful everyday, centred around our prized V&amp;amp;A at Dundee on the waterfront.</p><p>That is why I am delighted that there is cross-party support in Parliament for the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion, which clearly indicates the unequivocal support of the First Minister and the Scottish Government and its agencies, who stand four-square behind the bid. That is what we need, if we are to win. Our competitors are fierce, and rightly have aspirations for their communities that are similar to our aspirations for Dundee. Our bid needs unequivocal commitment from all levels of government in Scotland if it is to be a success for Dundee and the whole of Scotland. That is why I am delighted that the culture secretary has given such a commitment tonight. We will vote for the Government&#8217;s motion at decision time, with pride and with hope.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740380", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dundee City of Culture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In Dundee, I would like to see &#8220;Urban meadows like the New York Highline&#8221;; &#8220;An old boat parade with lighting and music&#8221;; &#8220;sculptures of Broons characters throughout the city&#8221;; &#8220;the Tay bridge lit at night&#8221;; &#8220;A massive river pageant in the Tay&#8221;.

As the Finance Committee and many of its witnesses have stated, the lack of detail that we have on how the policy will work in practice is impairing a fuller analysis of the bill and its impact. Clarity is needed most notably on what future tax rates will look like. Although the financial memorandum assumes that tax rates will not be lower than current rates at the point of transfer, we must wait until 2014 to know that for sure. Why is that? The Finance Committee report says that that has caused concern among businesses, local authorities and even SEPA, which will be in charge of collecting the tax.</p><p>Iain Gray called for an early indication of what level taxes will be set at, how the Government will use the tax rate to reduce landfill, and how to have a more progressive regime to meet the environmental objectives that I have mentioned.

Our youth unemployment rate in Scotland is persistently around 20 per cent&#8212;we can all agree on that figure, which is unacceptable by any standard and demands a swift and bold response from Government.</p><p>I come to this debate with experience of youth unemployment in my region. In Dundee, the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming jobseekers allowance for longer than six months is 250 per cent higher than it was in August 2007. When I speak to young people who have been out of work for long periods, I hear the same desire to work&#8212;the same aspiration to succeed&#8212;as I see in those who have found work straight from education. Yet, when I speak to employers in key sectors such as engineering, I hear the same story again and again from business: that our young people do not have the right skills to fill the vacancies that they have.</p><p>Clearly there is a gap here, which we all need to work together to bridge. The Wood commission&#8217;s proposals are very useful in that regard. One engineering company in Dundee has developed its own training facility, because young people in college are not being taught the skills that the company needs. It is clear that we must be smarter in how we match opportunities for young people with business demands in key sectors such as engineering and technology.</p><p>As the Wood commission interim report makes clear, that will not happen without a shift in how the Government delivers the skills that are required for young people to thrive in those sectors. The report states:</p><p>&#8220;we must move on from our ingrained and frankly ill-informed culture that somehow vocational education is an inferior option.&#8221;</p><p>We agree with that on the Labour benches and I was very pleased to hear the minister agree with that in her opening remarks.</p><p>National Union of Students Scotland argues:</p><p>&#8220;For too long, going straight from university into work has been the accepted route into a career in Scotland, with ... vocational education seen as&#8221;</p><p>an &#8220;inferior or less prestigious&#8221; option. Like the Wood commission, it argues that we need to move towards parity of esteem for vocational education.</p><p>There are a number of steps in the commission&#8217;s report that the Government can take to help reach that parity. Starting with schools, the report states that we should offer training and education relevant to the modern apprenticeship framework, provide work experience opportunities and give young people the opportunity to study for a national certificate.</p><p>The report also states&#8212;this is critical&#8212;that careers advice must be available earlier than secondary 4. Whether that advice is accessed through the my world of work website, one-to-one interviews, exposure to business and industry presentations, or perhaps workplace visits, the reality is that some routes might be&#8212;if not closed off&#8212;not immediately accessible from S4 if pupils do not already have the qualifications in subjects that they needed to take in S3 and S4.</p><p>Pupils might have the option of picking up such qualifications at college but, if guidance and advice were available earlier so that, when they made decisions in S2, they kept their options as wide open as possible for the careers that they were interested in, we might have more productive outcomes for our system and, more important, for the young people who move through school and college.</p><p>Perhaps the most important and wide-ranging recommendations in the report revolve around our colleges. As we move to the regional model, the commission argues that regional outcome agreements must commit to</p><p>&#8220;ongoing quality improvement in the delivery of vocational education&#8221;.</p><p>It says that we must strengthen the role that colleges play in the modern apprenticeship programme and that we must strengthen the link between schools and colleges as vocational education begins to be integrated into the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>The commission argues that colleges must be more vocationally focused and that they must work with local businesses to determine the skills that are needed, which should be delivered throughout the courses that they offer. It also argues that work experience should form a core part of college courses when that is appropriate.</p><p>The Wood report makes it clear that, to make the necessary changes that are contained in the report, our colleges must be empowered with resources from the Government. Labour&#8217;s amendment reiterates that. On the need to resource change in our colleges, Colleges Scotland has said that the Scottish Government&#8217;s flat cash settlement in 2014-15 and the proposed small increase in 2015-16 will allow the college sector</p><p>&#8220;to broadly continue what it is providing currently ... but it also means that new activity can only be done at the expense of current activity.&#8221;</p><p>I am delighted that the Government has indicated that it will support our amendment. I invite the minister to reflect on the amount of money that the Government will provide to resource the changes in our colleges that the Wood commission&#8217;s recommendations envisage. For example, I draw attention to the fact that providing careers advice and guidance early in the school curriculum will take investment in Skills Development Scotland, but John Swinney&#8217;s draft budget cuts SDS&#8217;s budget. How will that be addressed in the next couple of years? I expect some of the proposals to be costed in the next draft of the budget, on which we will hear from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth.</p><p>The interim report contains many more recommendations that are worthy of discussion and I look forward to hearing about them this afternoon&#8212;a number of my Labour colleagues will address them. Labour will support the Government&#8217;s motion, as we welcome the thrust of the report. We will of course work together with the Government at the summit and with industry leaders in taking forward the Wood commission&#8217;s recommendations. However, we believe that words must be backed by action. I look forward to hearing how the Government will resource the recommendations in the next draft of the budget.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-07939.1, to insert after &#8220;future policy decisions&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;; notes the resource implications for colleges of the report&#8217;s recommendations&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commission for Developing Scotland&#8217;s Young Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will check my statistics, but I am quite confident that the figures that I am using are correct.

I will pick up on a couple of the points that Christine Grahame raised&#8212;I am sorry that she is no longer in the chamber. I congratulate her on the bill that she introduced in 2009 on dog control notices, which became the Control of Dogs (Scotland) Act 2010, but I wonder if it is perhaps now time to review that legislation. Kenny Gibson called the dog control notice process &#8220;lengthy and fruitless&#8221;. Community safety wardens are responsible for issuing dog control notices&#8212;that is in the power of local authorities&#8212;but the evidence from the ones I have spoken to in my communities in Dundee is that they are not aware that dog control is within their power, and they think that it is within police power.</p><p>I am about to address something awful, to which I think Nanette Milne alluded, which happened in Angus this summer. It is my understanding that Angus Council has issued no dog control notices whatever, despite the fact that there was a terrible attack. I say respectfully to the minister that, although I know that the 2010 legislation was very well intended and a thorough consultation was done, we need to consider the act&#8217;s effectiveness.</p><p>I come to this issue because some of the communities that I represent, and especially the most deprived communities in our country, have real issues with dangerous dogs, in particular some breeds of very dangerous dogs that are let out, roam the streets and attack children. It was in August this year that 13-year-old Amy Adams was in a park in Arbroath when she was attacked by a stray Staffordshire bull terrier. The experience was terrifying in itself, but Amy sustained a puncture wound to her hand, which became infected. She was in surgery for four hours. She was first treated at Arbroath royal infirmary, but the infection travelled up her arm and she was rushed to Ninewells hospital in Dundee to see the specialist plastic surgery team.</p><p>Amy&#8217;s story is by no means unique. In May this year, a 13-year-old boy was rushed to hospital after being attacked by a dog in a home in my home city of Dundee. It is also very difficult to forget the story of 10-year-old Rhianna Kidd, who was attacked by two Rottweilers as she played on her bike in Dryburgh in my home city in 2010.</p><p>Irresponsible dog owners are a threat to our communities. The psychological consequences of a dog attack, as Malcolm Chisholm said, can last long after physical recovery, especially for young children. I am supporting Claire Baker&#8217;s motion today because I believe that compulsory microchipping could help to tackle dangerous dog attacks by creating a culture of more responsible dog ownership. By providing a clear line of accountability from dog to owner, it could help to reduce the number of dogs that go stray, like the dog that attacked Amy. It could also help the police to trace those dogs that become dangerous back to their owners.</p><p>Microchipping is, of course, not an answer in itself, and it will not stop dangerous dog attacks, but it could help by encouraging responsible behaviour and keeping children safe from harm. I support the motion, and I ask the minister whether he will consider examining the 2010 act and perhaps applying post-legislative scrutiny to it&#8212;and whether he will look into how many dog control orders are being issued and how effective they are.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dogs (Compulsory Microchipping)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank my colleague Claire Baker for bringing this important topic to the chamber for debate.

Mr Johnstone made particular reference to my comments about gender, but I must draw to his attention the fact that they were based on evidence from the EHRC. The commission did not say that Scottish Enterprise should invest in businesses just to put more women into work but, according to its evidence, 0.5 per cent of modern apprenticeships are being taken up by disabled people in Scotland, despite the fact that 8 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds have a disability, and less than 2 per cent are being taken up by ethnic minorities, despite the fact that 4 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds are from an ethnic minority. That evidence shows that opportunities are not equal across our society, which is certainly a point to bear in mind.</p><p>The evaluation that was published on Monday goes some way to demonstrating that Scottish Enterprise adds to our economy and that it gives high levels of support to business. However, as I said, the evaluation also provides an opportunity to take a pulse check on how agencies interact with one another, with local and national Government and with business. Since 2007, when the economy was buoyant, no substantial Government-led review of our enterprise agencies has taken place, despite a rapidly changing Scottish economy and a rapidly changing economic landscape that could&#8212;although not necessarily&#8212;need new solutions. The position is worth reviewing.</p><p>As Ken Macintosh said, the long-term youth unemployment figure remains high. We heard this morning that an additional 32,000 16 to 24-year-olds in Scotland came out of work over the summer. The unemployment rate among women is rising, and workers increasingly face little choice but to take part-time or temporary work or a contract that means that they must wait for the phone to ring&#8212;a zero hours contract. Our shared aim is to get more young Scots into jobs, to support women in Scotland and to offer every person and every business the support that they need.</p><p>I will touch on some of the speeches. Margaret McDougall made a pertinent point about the plight of some small businesses that want to secure bank loans and about how Scottish Enterprise can work with them to help them in that process. Is the minister willing to address that point in closing or in a letter later?</p><p>Kevin Stewart spent time on listing Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s achievements and congratulating it on them. I agree with much of that but, as I have said in the chamber before, robust and successful institutions should not fear review, scrutiny and more suggestions on how they could operate better. Healthy organisations welcome a review process and, particularly in the changed economy since 2007, such scrutiny should be welcomed.</p><p>Tavish Scott said that, at a difficult economic time, we should not commission reviews that could be expensive. The point is well made, but I contend that it is particularly appropriate to review, assess and scrutinise an agency that is tasked with driving our economy at such a difficult economic time. We need to check that the precious public funds that are set aside for economic growth have the most impact and that we are getting the highest return for every pound that we spend.</p><p>Tavish Scott suggested that committees of the Parliament could step up and do the job. I know that the Conservatives will not support our amendment and that Murdo Fraser is sceptical about a review, but much of what he said in opening agreed with the purposes of a review.

I sincerely hope that the minister, Fergus Ewing, will produce a bill that will help, and not penalise, the financially marginalised in our communities.

He doubled the bankruptcy fees for people with low incomes and low assets from &#163;100 to &#163;200 despite warnings from Labour and from Citizens Advice Scotland that those people would turn to payday lenders to find their bankruptcy fees. Maybe the finance secretary did not get the acronym and did not realise that LILA stood for low income, low assets. I really hope that the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill will be a bit more progressive.</p><p>There is absolutely nothing in the programme for government on the scandal of payday loans in our communities.

However, in a letter to Kezia Dugdale, the minister called payday loans &#8220;legal, fair and transparent&#8221;. I will give him the fact that they are legal, but debt is devolved into his hands and he holds the cards on it: are they fair and transparent?

In 2010, Helen&#8217;s sister was murdered in her Angus home, which turned the lives of Helen and her family upside down.</p><p>During her powerful speech at the conference, Helen Richardson detailed her frustration as she moved through disjointed, confusing and protracted processes in the justice system at a time of great anxiety and grief. We cannot escape the need for people such as Helen to assist in the disposal of justice but, while recognising her duty to the justice system, we must also recognise our responsibility to provide victims and witnesses with the knowledge and support that they need.</p><p>We agree with the underpinning principles of the bill, but it does not go far enough in practice to offer the required level of support. For example, let us look at the measures to supply more information to victims and witnesses.</p><p>The bill seeks to improve the flow of information to victims and witnesses by placing a duty on the procurator fiscal, the Scottish Court Service and Police Scotland to disclose case-specific information. We acknowledge that those measures will make more information available, but the Crown Office has made it clear that information will be useful only if the victim or witness who receives it can understand it. Furthermore, changes such as those relating to victim statements in court or to victim and witness representations to the Parole Board will, while giving greater flexibility, inevitably demand more answers and decisions from victims and witnesses.</p><p>For that reason, Scottish Labour&#8217;s proposal for case companions is compelling.

They would be a central point of information and guidance, whether they were appointed as a third-party provider or internally in the justice system.</p><p>We believe that the provision of case companions would best embody the letter and spirit of the European Union directive that has brought us to the chamber today.

In that context, I will consider the bill&#8217;s provision for a national confidential forum for survivors of historical abuse.</p><p>Since 2004, successive Governments have sought to account for the abuse that children have suffered in residential care in Scotland. The forum represents the latest development in that journey, as Duncan McNeil said, and stems from the time to be heard pilot, which listened to the stories of 98 survivors of abuse at Quarriers residential care homes alone. We recognise the need for survivors to be heard in a confidential forum and fully support the approach. Many people&#8217;s suffering can be eased by acknowledgment of the abuse, which is hugely beneficial.</p><p>In her response to a parliamentary question in April from Neil Bibby, the Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs said that a consultation on the time bar in relation to historical abuse had just closed and that responses were being analysed. She noted that the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill was going through Parliament and suggested that the member keep tabs on the bill in relation to the time-bar issue. When the minister sums up, will she tell us what progress has been made in analysing the consultation responses and say whether we will have the opportunity to consider altering the time bar during the passage of the bill, as her answer to Neil Bibby suggested? I understand that there have been no proposals so far from the Government to amend the bill in that regard, but I am interested to know whether the Government intends to propose changes to the time bar at stage 2 or stage 3.</p><p>We would like the bill to provide for additional protection for families who are affected by fatal road accidents. The committee heard evidence from Scotland&#8217;s Campaign against Irresponsible Drivers, which is campaigning for a statutory right to access investigation materials on request. The &#8220;on request&#8221; element is an important part of the proposal. I listened carefully to Colin Keir&#8217;s personal account and am convinced that it would be extremely harrowing for a family to be given such documents when they do not want them. That should not happen.

Many families who gave evidence to the committee had not been given access to documents&#8212;documents that they really wanted because they did not know the circumstances under which their loved ones had lost their lives. We need improvements in that regard. Many families would like a statutory right to access information on request, so I hope that the Government will consider amending the bill at stage 2 to provide for such a right. I note that there is support for the proposal among the Government&#8217;s back benchers, as Mr Allard articulated.</p><p>Sandra White commented on the need for better provision in the bill for victims of human trafficking, and the organisation CARE, which works with victims of trafficking, has made specific suggestions in that regard. CARE&#8217;s proposals stem from provisions in the European Union anti-trafficking directive, which came into force in Scotland on 6 April this year. The directive requires three steps to be taken to protect victims of human trafficking that are not included in the bill&#8212;to avoid unnecessary repetition of interviews during investigation, prosecution and trial; to avoid visual contact between victims and defendants while they are giving evidence in interviews and cross-examination; and to avoid unnecessary questioning about the victim&#8217;s private life, which I touched on more widely in relation to sexual offences in my opening remarks.</p><p>The directive also outlines a range of measures&#8212;in article 15.3&#8212;specifically to protect child victims. Given that the date for implementing the directive has passed&#8212;it was 6 April&#8212;I would like to know whether the Government intends to use the bill as an opportunity to put those protections in place, because victims of human trafficking are particularly vulnerable. I understand from correspondence between the cabinet secretary and me that the Scottish Government believes that it is compliant with that directive. Perhaps the minister will tell us in her closing speech whether the Scottish Government believes that the protections for victims of human trafficking that I outlined exist in other legislation and do not, therefore, need to be put in the bill.</p><p>Although we back the principles of the bill, it is clear that many improvements could be made. Labour&#8217;s proposals for case companions and a victims commissioner would improve how we interact with victims and witnesses as well as how we keep the system under constant review. We have made suggestions in areas such as fatal road accidents, sexual offences and human trafficking, and we would like to hear the Government&#8217;s proposals for any alteration to the time bar on cases of historical sexual abuse, which the minister mentioned to my colleague previously.</p><p>All those suggestions warrant further consideration, and I hope to see progress on them as the bill proceeds to stage 2 and beyond.

It is backed by everyone whom I speak to in the city&#8212;I am sure that the Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport would agree that she would struggle to find someone in our city who does not want the football academy to be located there. Six thousand people have taken the time to sign up to the campaign, and there is cross-party support from Labour and the Scottish National Party.</p><p>The campaign and bid have come from our community&#8212;sports clubs all over the city have asked for sign-up sheets for players, coaches, grans, granddads, aunties and uncles.

Those people who do the work know how to get the results, so it is important that we inform ourselves of their opinions.</p><p>If we are to transform lives, to drive down the cost of reoffending and to avoid incarceration rates growing in the way that has been predicted, we must build a system that is more integrated than ever before with health, social work and education systems, not least in our poorest communities.</p><p>The economic and social cost of reoffending cannot be overestimated, nor can it be teased apart from the wider social problems that are faced in our most deprived areas. It is not coincidence that 40 per cent of prisoners come from the very poorest communities of Scotland. We can be in no doubt that the staggering &#163;3 billion cost of reoffending will affect those areas the most.</p><p>To tackle reoffending is to build a system that creates not just meaningful second chances, but meaningful first chances. To ask how we tackle reoffending is to ask why the first person whom a released prisoner meets outside the prison gates is the same drug dealer who helped them end up in jail in the first place. To ask how we tackle reoffending is also to ask how we overcome childhoods that have been blighted by the trauma of neglect, abuse and substance misuse; how we build an education system that empowers every child with the ability to learn not just the facts of the world around them, but how they can shape their own world; and how we build a health service that not only treats illness and addiction but teaches us how to make healthy choices.

If we opt for a local authority model, how can we be sure that funding will be targeted to the areas that need it most? I raised that issue with the cabinet secretary in my intervention during his opening speech. How can we ensure, under that model, that innovative programs are shared between local authorities? How can we ensure that they will be sustained under a funding arrangement that is devolved to local authorities when, currently, 83 per cent of cuts are at a local authority level? The cabinet secretary assured me that he would answer all those questions. If the Government&#8217;s preference is to centralise the system, which is implied in the motion, how can we ensure that central control does not stifle local expertise?

For the first time in more than three decades, the Lord President was considering opening courts on a Saturday, to ease their case loads.</p><p>The reason was Cadder. In the Lord President&#8217;s eyes, that one judgment was enough to necessitate the weekend opening of our courts, because there was no indication of how much the case load would increase. We are still in a period of reflection on the Cadder judgment.

I ask why the cabinet secretary persists in issuing fines if they are not collectable in a devolved Scotland and it is only under independence that they will be collectable. That is a preposterous suggestion.</p><p>These are the policy choices of the SNP Government. Instead of prosecuting cases through our courts, it is giving up on our communities in failing to try unacceptable behaviour and hold people accountable in front of their peers. The Government is content to see fines issued with little hope of seeing them paid. Fines mean fewer court cases, and fewer court cases mean fewer courts. It is a cynical mindset that completely ignores the value of accessible local justice&#8212;that is the point that we are arguing today.</p><p>The cabinet secretary&#8217;s proposal is built on a false premise. When we look at some of the Government&#8217;s forthcoming legislation, we see that the SNP is introducing measures that will increase the number of cases going through our courts. One consultation response stated:</p><p>&#8220;An increase in the jurisdiction of sheriff courts to one hundred and fifty thousand pounds in civil affairs ... could cause an overload to civil business in Dundee such that the closure of Cupar sheriff court would seem ill advised&#8221;.</p><p>Those are not my words but those of Rod Campbell, the SNP MSP for North East Fife. He is right. The upcoming courts reform (Scotland) bill, which was published in draft form in January, will see many more cases transferred from sheriff courts, and personal injury cases will come from the Court of Session down to the sheriff courts, increasing business. I invite the cabinet secretary to deny that that is the intended consequence of the bill. With no intention to add to the number of courts in Dundee sheriff court, how is it meant to handle the extra case load? We have also heard today of all the other cases that will come to Dundee from the courts that the cabinet secretary is closing.</p><p>What of proposals such as the proposal to abolish corroboration? Has the Government made any assessment of how that would impact on the number of cases that come to court? The Lord President was concerned about the increase in the number of cases as a result of the Cadder case, and such a significant law reform as the abolition of corroboration would probably have a similar effect. The simple truth is that a narrow view of court demand cannot predict future need, particularly when the Government is legislating to increase that demand rather than decrease it.</p><p>Labour recognises the role that courts play in our communities. They are essential not just to justice being done, but to justice being seen to be done. They instil public confidence in the safety of our communities and, as we have heard today, they support local economies directly through jobs and indirectly through surrounding law firms that support shops and restaurants. Many of these courts have been part of our towns and cities for hundreds of years.</p><p>It is of little surprise that 95 per cent of consultation responses were against the proposals. I will tell the chamber what some of the respondents said. Graeme Dey, SNP MSP for Angus South, said:</p><p>&#8220;the limited nature of public transport could give rise to situations where the accused, the victim and or the witnesses involved in a case would be making their way ... on the same bus ... posing very obvious potential problems.&#8221;</p><p>Paul Wheelhouse, SNP MSP for South Scotland, said:</p><p>&#8220;Aside from the inconvenience and added expense to legal professionals ... moving business ... would inevitably have a negative economic impact&#8221;.</p><p>Nigel Don, MSP for Angus North and Mearns, said:</p><p>&#8220;I see no evidence that cases could not continue to be heard in Stonehaven ... It is just as easy to travel to Stonehaven as from it ... Overall, I suggest the case for closing Stonehaven court has not yet been made.&#8221;</p><p>I turn briefly to some of the excellent speeches that were made in the debate. Alison McInnes made a powerful point about the difficulty with the proposed closure of Cupar sheriff court and cases being shifted to Dundee. Decisions are being taken out of the local authority&#8217;s control, away from the social workers, the police, the NHS and the offender management provision in that community.

Professor von Prondzynski produced 17 far-reaching recommendations, which the cabinet secretary has repeatedly accepted since February last year. For governing bodies, the report advocates greater student participation, majority lay representation and the introduction of gender quotas, which is an issue that he knows that I have brought to the chamber before and which we on the Labour benches have been arguing for. The professor suggests greater inclusion in the selection process of university principals, training for governors and a distinct Scottish code of conduct, to name but a few recommendations.</p><p>When we look at the bill, we see that not one of the 17 recommendations has been introduced. I know that Joan McAlpine and, I think, the cabinet secretary, contested that point so to check, in preparing for the debate at the weekend, I tweeted Professor Prondzynski and asked him directly whether any of his recommendations are contained in the bill. He tweeted back:</p><p>&#8220;Not directly, no. But I believe there will be legislation later in the parliament.&#8221;</p><p>I suggest that the cabinet secretary commissioned the report knowing that the bill was to come forward. I am not quite sure why he wants to delay the implementation of Professor Prondzynski&#8217;s recommendations, given that he has accepted all of them since February last year. He might want to clarify that in his closing remarks.</p><p>Despite the fact that the cabinet secretary commissioned the professor&#8217;s report and has accepted it, all that the bill does is provide for the Scottish ministers to withhold funding from a university that does not comply with their vague idea of good governance. As was pointed out in the committee&#8217;s evidence session last month, the provision in question is too vague to scrutinise without a clear definition of good governance alongside it. In the absence of a proper definition of good governance in the bill, it is not clear when and how sanctions will be used.</p><p>To his credit, the cabinet secretary has sought to reassure the committee by commissioning a code of good governance, but I understand that that code will not be available to scrutinise until after the bill has passed through the Education and Culture Committee, on the understanding that a further bill will be produced in 18 months&#8217; to two years&#8217; time. It seems to me that the calls for a delay seem very sensible in view of the fact that the code of governance will not be produced soon and things will not be ready in time.</p><p>As a result, concerns have been voiced across the sector. Alan Simpson from the University of Stirling said:</p><p>&#8220;we envisage a future minister being able to impose things that may not relate to the new code ... because there is no reference to a particular code in the bill.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 19 February 2013; c 2015.]</p><p>That sentiment has been echoed by Ferdinand von Prondzynski, who said:</p><p>&#8220;it is not yet clear what particular principles of good governance might be enforced by the legislation. Moreover, the fear has arisen that the provision could be used to apply some other unspecified set of principles of good governance, or might even at some future date be used to apply the views of particular politicians or officials.&#8221;</p><p>As I have put to the cabinet secretary previously, I would like to see gender quotas provided for in primary legislation. I would like us to enshrine in statute a student&#8217;s right to choose their governing body, and I believe that it would be progressive to enshrine the election of academic boards in our law. I think that the bill that is before us represents a good opportunity to do that.</p><p>As many of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s front-bench colleagues have told us, there is a great deal of pressure on the legislative programme in the current parliamentary session, so there might not be room for his second bill. Why does he not take the opportunity to legislate on those matters now?</p><p>Even if the cabinet secretary is unwilling to take those steps, I urge him to consider the concerns of the committee and stakeholders, and those that have been expressed during the debate, and to give us some clarity on what governance reforms he will commit to.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687947", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with Mary Scanlon&#8217;s remarks on the impact of the bill on mature students&#8212;especially female mature students&#8212;because concerns about that have been represented strongly to me by colleges in my region.

Time after time, Labour has told him what Unison and Audit Scotland have also told him, which is that those officers are not on our streets but are filling backroom posts in police stations. His own figures show a drop of 907 police staff since 2010.</p><p>We know from the chief constable, and from leaked documents from the police reform group in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s department, that the 1,000-officer commitment will be unsustainable in the single service as more staff jobs are cut.</p><p>Why is the commitment to 1,000 extra police officers a matter for the cabinet secretary but, according to the answer that I was given earlier, police station closures are not and are, instead, an operational matter? The truth is that bad news is an operational matter and good news is a political commitment by this bountiful Government.</p><p>The gulf between what the cabinet secretary says and the reality of what is happening in police stations across Scotland is astounding. In his own constituency, police custody officers are being replaced by police officers. The people of his constituency and the rest of Scotland are looking to the cabinet secretary to make the decisions that will keep their communities safe, and they are being let down time and again by his lack of leadership on police reform.</p><p>Nowhere is that more demonstrable than in his handling of the power struggle at the top of the single service. Yet again, the cabinet secretary has told us that responsibilities are clear between the SPA and the chief constable, but that is in deep contrast to the views of the chief constable himself.</p><p>As Lewis Macdonald said in his opening speech, that uncertainty could have been avoided if the cabinet secretary had accepted many of the amendments from across the chamber, including Labour&#8217;s amendments to increase accountability and transparency in the SPA and the police service of Scotland. However, those amendments were rejected out of hand and, as Alison McInnes said, we still need meaningful action. It is because of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s refusal to commit to greater accountability from the outset, and his sustained denial of the power struggle between Mr House and Mr Emery, that we believe that the Government should urgently consider the way in which the legislation is being interpreted.</p><p>With the single service starting in just over two weeks, we share the concerns of police staff, unions and the public that the cabinet secretary&#8217;s lack of leadership is posing a risk to its success. People need to know that their jobs are secure and that cuts will not creep in through the back door as &#8220;operational decisions&#8221;, and they need to be clear about who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the service.

Clement Attlee&#8217;s Government was one of the first signatories to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and it ratified the European convention on human rights in 1951. As one of its first actions in 1997, the Labour Government incorporated the European convention into UK law. Every act of this Parliament is required to be compliant with the convention or it is nullified.</p><p>Since the coming into effect of the Human Rights Act 1998, citizens the length and breadth of this country and throughout the United Kingdom have enjoyed the protection of the convention. Of course, the Human Rights Act 1998 is still in its formative years, with its effect taking shape in our courts every day, but it has already resulted in some of the biggest changes to our law in recent times. For instance, the Cadder case established the right to legal representation for people who are held for questioning in Scotland.</p><p>Labour believes that the important task is to get on with that job of making human rights a reality in all our lives by ensuring that they are daily afforded to people. Each and every day, we need to protect the rights of those who are affected by welfare reform. We need to protect the rights of vulnerable children in this country. We need to weave human rights into the fabric of our communities through the laws that we pass and the policies that we advance in the chamber now. We can do that using the immense powers that we have.</p><p>Our amendment&#8212;I thank the Government for indicating that it will support it&#8212;seeks to advance that cause specifically in relation to human trafficking, which is a human rights abuse that is happening in our towns and cities today. Human trafficking happens under our noses but is, unfortunately, largely undetected. Here in the Parliament we have the power to take concerted action against that trafficking. The victims of trafficking in Scotland cannot wait for a written constitution that would enshrine their rights, nor do they need to do so. The Government in power in Scotland, sitting over there to my right, already has the power that it needs to make a big impact on that human rights abuse today&#8212;now.</p><p>If I were to stop any Scot on the street outside the Parliament building and ask whether there are people who have been sold into this country, who are living in our towns against their will, to work in the sex industry or in forced labour, most likely I would not be believed.

People would be further shocked if I were to tell them that there are young people incarcerated in our prisons tonight, having been convicted of drug offences, who we believe were trafficked into this country to work on drug farms. Young people are being incarcerated in Scotland who have been convicted of crimes as a result of coercion and deception by others.

I encourage him to reflect further today.</p><p>Amendment 17 seeks to ensure that the gender balance of the council is equitable. I have heard no good reason why we should not take action to rectify a legal system whose decision-making bodies are intrinsically skewed in their gender balance. As I stated at stage 2, the Scottish Law Commission board comprises 80 per cent men, the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland comprises 70 per cent men, and the Scottish Court Service board is 68 per cent male. It simply is not good enough to pay lip service to the need for greater gender parity and then sit back in the face of such facts without doing what we can&#8212;and what we can do quite simply&#8212;to rectify the situation.</p><p>In many instances, our courts and justice system have a wider and more disproportionate impact on women.

Presiding Officer, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</p><p>To host the Commonwealth games is a huge privilege for Scotland and for Glasgow. We have the chance to show the world the best of our great country: the generosity of our people; the beauty of our landscapes and our cities; and the power of our communities to welcome, through unmatched tolerance and acceptance, those from around the Commonwealth and beyond. However, I think that we all agree that the games are about more than sport. We have the opportunity to play a leading role in a community of nations to promote common aims, values, rights and obligations. Nowhere can we do more to play our part in that than by showing our commitment to tackling modern-day slavery.</p><p>The United Kingdom&#8212;and Scotland&#8212;as one of the world&#8217;s largest destination countries for human trafficking, continues to be a nation where the promise of a better life can end in misery and modern-day human slavery. It is our moral duty in this Parliament&#8212;and there is a duty on the minister and the Scottish Government&#8212;to recognise the part that we must play when the world&#8217;s spotlight is on us by righting this wrong in our country.</p><p>In an answer to a parliamentary question earlier this year, the sports minister Shona Robison said:</p><p>&#8220;There is currently no intelligence to indicate that human trafficking will be an issue for Scotland for either games.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 31 January 2012; S4W-05138.]</p><p>That may seem a reason not to act but, as Gordon Meldrum of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency has made clear, solid intelligence is a luxury that we can rarely depend upon in preventing human trafficking. Gordon Meldrum said:</p><p>&#8220;Knowing whether you are one of ten victims or one of a hundred doesn&#8217;t change the hell you have been through.&#8221;</p><p>Speaking for the police and other agencies, he continued:</p><p>&#8220;So collectively we need to move on from looking to &#8216;prove&#8217; that this is an issue, to one in which we accept it is an issue&#8221;</p><p>and act.</p><p>For the Olympic games, the early figures show that human trafficking to London occurred where intelligence had failed. Like Ms Robison, UK ministers did not recognise any specific threat of human trafficking during the London games, but the early figures show that there was a 35 per cent increase in referrals for human trafficking in London during this Olympic year of 2012. Therefore, lack of prior intelligence is no reason not to act, because human trafficking happens when intelligence is not available to our agencies&#8212;there is enough evidence of that.</p><p>The Olympic anti-trafficking group attributes that 35 per cent increase in referrals to the robust awareness-raising measures in London, which I think Scotland can learn from in advance of the Commonwealth games.</p><p>This year in London, in partnership with the United Nations, 23 life-sized art installations were set up throughout the city. They carried the stories of trafficking victims and information on how to identify trafficked people, and were manned by volunteers to raise public awareness. The installations did not take much time or money to set up, but their impact is evident in the 35 per cent increase in referrals that I mentioned.</p><p>Other anti-trafficking measures that have been used at sporting events in Athens, Berlin and Vancouver are awareness-raising information cards that were included in packs given to visitors, the provision of shelters and training for front-line staff. I have raised the issue of training previously in the chamber and asked the Scottish Government to consider anti-trafficking awareness training for police, ambulance staff and firefighters. I know that awareness training is taking place for police officers at Tulliallan&#8212;I have asked to go there and see that&#8212;but I ask the minister, in his summing up speech, to update the Parliament on how far the Scottish Government has got with putting in place anti-trafficking awareness training for ambulance staff and firefighters.</p><p>It is not only the Labour Party that wants more to be done. There is a UK-wide interdepartmental ministerial group on human trafficking, which comprises Kenny MacAskill and ministers from London, Wales and Northern Ireland, and which acts as our UK national rapporteur on human trafficking, as demanded by the European Union. That multi-minister group has asked the Scottish Government to do more to raise awareness of human trafficking ahead of the Commonwealth games in Glasgow in 2014. The group recognises that the Scottish Government needs to do more, so I ask the ministers to give a commitment to do so. It is the obligation of the Scottish Government and Parliament to heed the call of that ministerial group to learn the lessons from London 2012&#8212;where there was a 35 per cent increase in referrals&#8212;and to do more to tackle human trafficking during the Commonwealth games.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I can tell Stewart Stevenson that my Wimbledon socks singularly fail to improve my tennis game every time that I wear them, but I will keep on trying.

Nowhere is clarity more necessary than in the single police force&#8217;s leadership.

It is for the simple reason that music and sport give children options. On a recent visit to my old high school in Dundee, I was told by one teacher that it is music and sport that our kids need. For some who will not achieve academically and for those who do not want to, sport and music provide the chance to find a path, and they open up a myriad of opportunities.</p><p>Anyone who has played in a band, orchestra or sports team will know how much of a leveller music&#8212;or sport&#8212;can be. People who were born with privilege and wealth occupy a level playing field with those who were born without, because as soon as they lift their bow to their fiddle or have the ball at their feet, all that matters is what they do with it&#8212;the sound that they produce or the pass that they make. Everything else pales.</p><p>That is why such chances are so important and why, in a time of recession when 100,000 young Scots of working age are sitting at home today, wise investment would be to equip children with the skills that they will use to forge their own paths, make their own money and create new and different careers for themselves. The Government should consider that as much an economic argument as a cultural one.</p><p>As Iain Gray said, our education is for equipping children with the skills that they need to go out and make their way in the world. From the young Dundonian who paid for his trip round Venezuela by beating old men at chess for money in pavement cafes, having learned chess in his Dundee primary school, to the inimitable Gary Clark, the lead singer of the Dundee band Danny Wilson, who learned music in his community of Douglas, in Dundee, and is now a songwriter in Los Angeles for the likes of Natalie Imbruglia, the economic and life opportunities that are offered by those so-called extracurricular activities know no bounds.</p><p>When our children&#8217;s commissioner conducted his &#8220;right blether&#8221; throughout Scotland recently, he heard the same message from children the length and breadth of the country. They said that chances always go to children from families with money. That came from the mouths of under-10-year-olds. it is enough to make you weep. They know that educational opportunities are not blind. In Dundee, in Sidlaw View primary school in Kirkton, four children are learning to play musical instruments. Down the road, in the affluent area of Broughty Ferry, 83 children in Forthill primary school are learning to play instruments. In other areas of deprivation, the story is the same; in Charleston primary school, six children get instrumental tuition and in Lochee primary school, the number is eight.</p><p>The cost of lessons is not the only barrier, although it is a significant one. In Dundee, the council charges pupils &#163;132 per year for lessons and another &#163;83 to hire their instrument. Children who qualify for free school meals or a clothing grant are exempt from those charges but face other barriers. At a time when an increasing number of school children in Dundee are turning up at school without having been fed, when the number of people seeking help from food banks is on the rise and as fuel bills go up and people are having to make the choice between heating and eating, instrumental fees are about the last thing that families can afford to pay.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, we had a debate about universalism. Labour argued that a mixture of universalism and targeted benefits or spending priorities should be based on evidence. Here, the evidence is overwhelming and has been very well articulated by the Scotland on Sunday campaign. The Scottish Government has accepted the evidence of the big noise intense music instruction programme in Stirling&#8217;s Raploch to the extent that it has given more than &#163;1&#160;million to another big noise project in Govanhill.</p><p>For music tuition in all our schools to resemble a map of deprivation, as it does in Dundee, is not good enough for an ambitious, cultured and civilised Scotland.

In doing so, they were creating more opportunities and better lives for themselves and their families.

Women are being hit the hardest.</p><p>At that graduation ceremony in Arbroath, Damien Yeates, the head of Skills Development Scotland, said that people in Scotland are now expected to have approximately eight different jobs in their lifetime, so where are the opportunities for reskilling? I will take the example of the renewables industry that Dundee and Angus are waiting for a share of. Should our Government not be harnessing the skills of engineers who lost their jobs when firms such as NCR moved production from Dundee? Those people have immensely transferable skills that could be used in the renewables industry. Letting those over-25-year-olds take a short course would provide a strongly skilled and varied workforce to attract international renewables companies to our region.</p><p>Opportunities for retraining must be supported by a Government that takes our economy seriously and wants to support a strong and flexible economy and workforce, but second chances are going under this education secretary. That is not what I say; it is what our colleges say. At a time of recession, retraining should be one of the highest political priorities, but how can we have confidence that an education secretary who cannot get his bottom-line figures correct will realise the impact&#8212;which I have just outlined&#8212;that the cut to the teaching grant is having?</p><p>Dundee and Angus trade unions said this week that they have no confidence in the education secretary.

Universal benefits were first introduced by the reforming liberals in 1908. Campbell-Bannerman laid the foundations for the welfare state&#8212;the safety net that would catch people when they fell. The great Labour Government of 1945 went on to create the modern welfare state, with our finest achievement: the NHS.</p><p>It is disingenuous today to call the spending decisions that Labour has challenged &#8220;benefits&#8221;. To take the Government&#8217;s motion to its logical conclusion, every spending decision made by this Government would become a benefit. The decision to fund rehabilitation programmes&#8212;a benefit. The decision to fund Scotland&#8217;s new football academy&#8212;a benefit. They would be pledges never to be challenged or questioned because they had been enshrined in the immortal language of universal benefit, which no man should put asunder.</p><p>Can we not have a more mature debate? Are we seriously saying that every spending pledge made by this Government&#8212;or by this Parliament over the past 14 years&#8212;should become unchallengeable and not open to scrutiny or tested against the evidence of achievement because it is paid for from the public purse? Do all spending decisions become sacrosanct universal benefits and, if they do, is this really the kind of country that we want to run? Is that really the sign of a robust, thoughtful, efficient and effective Government? Does it not actually reek of stagnation of thought, imagination and ambition?</p><p>The spending priorities of this Government and this Parliament are only enablers for work, creativity, business and enterprise, which we want to flourish in our country. We want a health service that focuses its resources on showing people how to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing and how to be fit, productive and maintain good mental health; not a health service that sees fit to pay for my prescription, which I can well afford. We want an education system that is available to everyone who wants to learn; from people who want to undertake blue-sky biomedical research to boys who just desperately want to work outside and build houses. However, that is not the reality in today&#8217;s Scotland.</p><p>In Scotland this summer, some school pupils who tried to get on to university courses through the clearing system could not&#8212;because they were Scottish. The same courses listed places available to students from the rest of United Kingdom or international students. For Scottish and European Union students there was no room at the inn, because the protection of free tuition fees for Scottish and EU students in effect acted as a cap on places for home students. Who did those home student places go to? They went to the first people to qualify and get the grades to get through the university gates. The first entrants will always come from the more affluent backgrounds&#8212;those with more support and resources to get qualifying grades at the first sitting. They take up the funded places. What of those who have been in a disrupted classroom, have had little support at home to encourage attainment and have taken two years to get their qualifications? They go into the clearing system and are refused entry.</p><p>The sickening but inevitable finding from Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People&#8217;s recent big blether across Scotland was that children at a young age in our communities say that opportunities go to children from richer families. Those were the words that came from our young children&#8217;s mouths, and that is borne out across our system.</p><p>Let us consider music tuition in Dundee and the campaign that one of our national newspapers has recently run. In Sidlaw View primary school, which is in a deprived area of my home city, four children are learning to play a musical instrument. In a similar primary school in the richest area, 83 children have taken up the same opportunity. Educational opportunity is not blind, and children know it, but I do not see the SNP jumping up to make music tuition a universal benefit. Making it a spending priority would be enough for me.</p><p>Unfortunately for the children in question, that inequality is replicated throughout the system. Those who did not get a university place through clearing might look to wider access schemes, but the Scottish Government pulled the &#163;1 million funding for the award-winning wider access programme at the University of Dundee just this year. It would be better to spend that money paying the tuition fees of those who can afford to make a contribution&#8212;that is where the spurious benefits argument leaves us. Down the road, thousands of young people were on the waiting list for a college place this summer. I checked today; more than 500 young people are still waiting for a college place in Dundee. Education is not a universal benefit for them, because they cannot get in to take advantage of it.</p><p>Is not now, when 25 per cent of young people in Scotland are sitting at home without a job, the best time to consider how we can redeploy our increasingly limited resources to unlock the potential of those young people and get them into the job market, by hook or by crook?</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676463", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Universal Benefits"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Government motion is spurious in the extreme.

David Stewart brought to our attention some of the best practice in this area across Europe. As we come to the end of this afternoon&#8217;s debate, it is worth remembering what he said about the fact that the places with the lowest drink-driving figures in Europe have three things in common: the legal limit that we are debating this afternoon; mass-media support for enforcement; and the high risk of detection.</p><p>On the subject of the high risk of detection, I hope that the cabinet secretary will appreciate my drawing his attention to our amendment, which highlights the need to ensure that our police are properly on our streets, not doing civilian jobs, if we are to maximise the risk of detection.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drink-driving"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with the member that he is being a little picky.

He looked to Australia, where the reduction in the blood alcohol limit has reduced road fatalities. He also looked to Sweden, where I understand drink-drivers are given a mandatory custodial sentence. He also gave a very pertinent and interesting example of local powers when he talked about how, when he was young, the local sheriff in Perth gave custodial sentences for drink-driving&#8212;something that the cabinet secretary may wish to reflect on. He also drew our attention both to the other side of the Atlantic, where the United States of America maintains its 80mg limit, and to the Czech Republic and Hungary, which are on the other side of the debate in that they take a zero-tolerance approach. I was convinced by the arguments that that approach is not the way to go, and there was consensus about that across the chamber.</p><p>I was interested in the points that were made about the three-year 10mg limit for some new drivers in European countries and the idea of graduated conditions when people gain their licence.

However, in Labour&#8217;s view, the bill would be strengthened if certain points were taken on board by the Scottish Government.</p><p>I want to address the issue of civil justice policy in part 1 of the bill&#8212;I have already raised the issue in interventions. The bill mandates the council to recommend changes in civil justice policy to the Lord President, but no similar obligation exists to recommend the changes to ministers. It is our belief that policy is the preserve of the democratically accountable Government and Parliament, and should not be weakened by placing a policy obligation on an unelected body. That is a concern that is shared by some of the most eminent public law professors in Scotland. Governments are accountable to the electorate for their policy choices and, through the parliamentary system, MSPs and stakeholders should have every opportunity to scrutinise those decisions.</p><p>When I questioned the Lord President in the Justice Committee on the policy scope, he assured me categorically that the policy remit would merely be the policy of the rules and would not extend beyond that. I ask the cabinet secretary, therefore, to address the issue in his closing remarks. Would it not be better to include in the bill a much clearer explanation of the extent of the policy remit in order to avoid any creep into the jurisdiction of ministers and the Parliament, as has been discussed this afternoon?</p><p>A second concern with part 1 relates to the request by several organisations for transparency in the council&#8217;s functioning. I have heard persuasive arguments from those representing court users for greater transparency when court rules or civil justice procedures are being reviewed. They state that the publication of potential changes or an obligation to consult would be valuable to their work. I would be interested to hear the minister&#8217;s opinion of those suggestions.</p><p>Another concern with part 1 that has been well rehearsed today concerns the composition of the council. We have heard many arguments that special committees will allow for more specialist representation, but I think that Malcolm Chisholm summed it up well when he said that it is quite possible that only two laypeople will be on the council. If there is a feeling across the chamber that we should increase that representation, it is important to put that in the bill so that we can ensure that it can happen.</p><p>I was reminded by Mary Fee&#8217;s speech of a debate that we have had in this chamber regarding gender balance. As Labour has said in Parliament before, 80 per cent of people on Scottish public bodies are male, and I understand that the composition of the current council is one female and 12 males. I would be interested in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response in looking for a better gender balance&#8212;perhaps the 40:40:20 model that Labour has recommended in the chamber before. We know the impact of our justice system on women and of, as Baroness Helena Kennedy has often eloquently put it, the inherent bias against women in our justice system.</p><p>Turning to part 2, I will reiterate some of the concerns with the proposed level of contributions. The Government has chosen a lower limit of &#163;68 because that is the weekly equivalent of the civil legal aid amount. It has sought justification for that in the fact that it is higher than the level in England and Wales. However, I have heard persuasive arguments to suggest that that method of calculation is flawed and that the level may be too low. The first rests on the fact that contributions for legal aid in England and Wales exist only for Crown Court cases, which account for a much lower proportion of cases than the bill provides for. The second is based on the differences between civil and criminal cases. Similarly, there are differences between the eligibility criteria for civil legal aid and the proposed undue hardship test, and the rate for civil legal aid contributions has not increased.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we have heard this afternoon, the principles that underlie the bill are broadly agreed across the chamber.

The committee heard from witnesses that the act probably works quite well for broadcast media and newspapers but is completely unsuitable for controlling social media and the internet. We cannot expect everyone who uses blogs and Twitter to be experts in contempt of court legislation in the way that the print and broadcast media must be. We have heard from members that it is crucial that we find the right balance between freedom of speech, an open press and the rights of the victims and witnesses of crime to their privacy.</p><p>The witnesses at the Justice Committee were divided on whether the televising of criminal trials was a positive development in opening up scrutiny and assisting in the administration of justice or whether it was unwelcome and would lead to the sensationalising of criminal trials and potentially even put the accused, the acquitted, victims or witnesses at risk.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of the Media in Criminal Trials"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to close this debate on the role of the media in criminal trials on behalf of the Justice Committee.

We would have to look very carefully at that if we were going to expand the legal provisions.</p><p>We heard today that any further consideration of the role of the media in trials must be balanced against the needs of those who unwittingly find themselves involved in the justice system, who are often very vulnerable members of our communities. Victim Support Scotland expressed concern&#8212;as Bob Doris eloquently did today&#8212;that trials are already traumatic events for victims and witnesses and that any further media involvement could affect the quality of the evidence that they supply or even their willingness to supply evidence in the first place. That concern was backed by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.</p><p>As my colleague Mary Fee said eloquently, we must avoid the prospect of a Jerry Springer or Judge Judy scenario, in which real and traumatic experiences are broadcast in the name of entertainment. In Scotland, we pride ourselves on having a civilised justice system that would not allow voyeurism. We must remember that in the debate.</p><p>In announcing a fundamental review of the policy on the use of television cameras in court, the Lord President has recognised the challenges in televising criminal trials beyond specific aspects such as sentencing. We await further details of the review, and the committee will consider its outcome.</p><p>I will sum up some of the very good speeches that have been made. Graeme Pearson reminded us that it is difficult to encourage witnesses to come forward to give evidence in court. If their image was to be transmitted back into their community, we would have to consider that carefully.</p><p>Roderick Campbell made an excellent speech. He drew our attention to the Anders Breivik trial in Norway and he certainly made me think again about the role of television in such big trials. He advised us to proceed with caution but not with closed minds, given how useful that televised trial was to the people of Norway earlier in the year. He also asked for a review of the legislation that regulates what the media can print about court proceedings, which would be timely.</p><p>Joan McAlpine made a number of interesting suggestions, including that of having accredited bloggers, as the minister said. The committee will certainly want to look at that idea, which draws on the experience of James Doleman in the Sheridan trial. I was also interested in her suggestion of a verbatim report of court proceedings, similar to that in Parliament. That is worth considering.</p><p>Mary Fee reminded us that, often, some of the most vulnerable people in our communities are in our courts. She warned us against the voyeurism to which televising trials might lead us. She drew our attention to the evidence from Steve Raeburn, the editor of The Firm, that televising trials would elucidate the changes in the law on double jeopardy and the possible forthcoming changes to corroboration. Having sat through several criminal trials in the High Court and the sheriff court, I was confused by the evidence that sitting all day to watch such trials could possibly elucidate those changes in the law. We need to scrutinise that evidence properly before making any decisions.</p><p>Colin Keir raised the important question whether the television restriction should be relaxed in appeals. The committee will certainly want to consider that. He made an astute and empathetic observation on the demeanour of accused people in court&#8212;guilt could be inferred across the medium of television, as being in our courts is a traumatic experience for many people.</p><p>This is an appropriate place at which to close the debate for the committee.

The voice of children is often drowned out in debates on Scots law, but she advocates powerfully for children&#8217;s rights in the legal system, and under these proposals.</p><p>I am glad that the cabinet secretary took the time to bring the motion to Parliament, because it is important to debate the proposals often and well. We have heard in the debate that many questions remain to be answered on the Carloway review and how it is to be implemented. Although I generally support many of Lord Carloway&#8217;s recommendations, it strikes me as a little curious that the cabinet secretary should bring the debate to the chamber before the consultation on the proposals has even closed and therefore without the evidence that has been offered by legal experts. Nonetheless, the debate is a good opportunity.</p><p>It is clear to me from the speeches made today that we need further detailed consideration of and debate about how we can effectively implement Carloway&#8217;s recommendations. Full engagement with stakeholders is a necessary part of that debate. The end of the requirement for corroboration in Scots law would be a major shift, not only in the way that verdicts are reached in our courts, but in the number of cases that will reach our courts in the first instance. It is vital that we have the foresight to envisage the impact that the removal of corroboration would have on our legal system.</p><p>We have heard that the pressure that is being put on our court services through budget cuts and the proposed closures of sheriff courts throughout the country would undoubtedly have a bearing on the courts&#8217; ability to undertake a much bigger case load. From that perspective, I ask the cabinet secretary to consider fully the consultation on the future of our courts, not just through the lens of the challenging financial situation that he faces, but through the lens of promoting effective and speedy justice for victims of crime, as Carloway recommends. I am in no doubt that limiting the number of jury trials too much and closing too many courts could have an adverse effect when the Carloway recommendations are implemented.</p><p>We have heard about the complexities that surround the proposal to make any change to the corroboration rule retrospective in its application. Not least of those is the potential to put our police service and Procurator Fiscal Service under considerable strain as a result of dealing with an increased case load and the reopening of cases that did not originally come to trial. As has been mentioned, in 58.5 per cent of cases in 2010 that did not go to trial because of insufficient evidence there would be a reasonable chance of conviction if the need for corroboration were removed.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reforming Scots Criminal Law and Practice (Public Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I am not suggesting that.

The debate is perhaps the only way that we will get a proper airing of this issue, because it falls between two of the Government&#8217;s portfolio areas&#8212;education and legal affairs. I believe that it is an issue for justice and legal affairs, because the new funding structure for the legal profession will lead to creeping elitism in the profession. At present, a student who is studying for the legal diploma can take a loan to cover half the &#163;9,000 fees. However, they are not entitled to apply for a student loan to cover maintenance costs and the only option is a career development loan at commercial rates.</p><p>I will explain why that is a problem. A fifth-year student at school, from a low-income family, having gained good grades in her highers, will be looking at options to study at university. She will have worked hard and gained good enough grades to study law. She will be investigating the total cost of such studies up to the point at which she will be able to begin working. As my colleagues have said, a law graduate cannot start practising law without the legal diploma, so the pupil factors those costs into her calculations.</p><p>The cost of the legal diploma is prohibitive. My pupil in question eliminates law from her considerations. A student from a richer family, who will be able to rely on their parents to see them through the more expensive diploma, presses on with their law application, in the knowledge that it will be more expensive but that their private circumstances will see them through.</p><p>Apart from the inequality that that situation creates for students, it results in a more homogeneous and more privileged legal profession. Why is that a problem? If we have an increasingly privileged legal profession that has no experience of, limited appreciation of and limited empathy with some of the difficult and chaotic circumstances in which people find themselves, the profession&#8217;s ability to properly represent its clients and society&#8217;s interests will be weakened. Like the Parliament, the legal profession needs a range of people who have different stories, privileges, testing times and financial circumstances to produce balanced and sensible remedies and judgments to benefit everyone in society.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has dismissed concerns that I have raised about the subject in the chamber before, but I tell the minister that there are law professors and practising lawyers working in Scotland today who are very concerned about the new funding arrangements and who have made representations to me and my colleagues.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has drawn an arbitrary line between undergraduate and postgraduate study. That is far too simplistic and has consequences&#8212;they are perhaps unintended, but they are consequences nonetheless.

There is a lot of support for it in Dundee.</p><p>This summer the national football academy project was described as Dundee&#8217;s sporting V&amp;amp;A, which is a sign that people are keen to make it happen. The working group, which is supported by the minister&#8217;s Scottish National Party council colleagues in Dundee, is now at an advanced stage and has taken trips down to the centre in England to put our bid together. I am delighted that the minister outlined the timetable for the bidding process just a couple of weeks ago. Dundee is united in wanting to bring the football academy to our city.</p><p>I want, though, to ask the minister a couple of questions about the budget commitments to the national football academy. Can she clarify in her closing remarks whether the funding will be available for the national performance centre? I have just totted up expenditure in the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget for the young Scots fund, which amounts to &#163;24.7&#160;million over three years. However, if I understand it clearly, the Scottish Government promised &#163;25&#160;million to the national performance centre, so the commitment to the young Scots fund already falls slightly short. In addition, when giving evidence to the Education and Culture Committee last year, Fiona Hyslop committed other moneys to the tune of about &#163;8&#160;million from the young Scots fund for other cultural projects.</p><p>Those commitments are in excess of &#163;32&#160;million, but there is only &#163;24.7&#160;million in the budget over the next three years. I would be grateful if the minister could clarify in her closing remarks how much will be spent on the national performance centre, whether it will all come from the young Scots fund, which seems to be a bit elastic, and whether additional funds might be made available to fund it from the sports budget.</p><p>I was very excited this summer by our tennis success, so much so that when Andy Murray took on Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final, I decided to survey our tennis facilities in Dundee. I spent a day going round with a video camera&#8212;the video is online if anyone wants to see the state of our facilities. We had a lot of interest after posting it. For example, Judy Murray tweeted me and made the powerful comment, which Tennis Scotland representatives agreed with when I met them, that we need good facilities if we are not just to encourage children to try sport, but to maintain their interest and keep them coming back to sport.</p><p>I do not know whether the minister has had a chance to see the video, but it is clear from it that the facilities across our city are different in different communities.

In our manifesto last year, we made it clear that single services would be delivered nationally but would function locally. Our proposal stemmed from the knowledge that emergency services are most effective when they operate in the heart of our communities and when they are accountable to those whom they serve. Today, half of that ambition has been fulfilled.</p><p>Although the Government has delivered single police and fire services, it has not delivered services with the local accountability that modern services should have or with the transparency that the public demand. Today, provisions that would have provided accountability and scrutiny have been offered in good faith in many amendments but, to the detriment of the bill, those amendments have fallen on the deaf ears of the cabinet secretary and the SNP.</p><p>At their core, those amendments sought to redress the bill&#8217;s insistence on tipping the balance of policing towards the state at the expense of local communities. Labour&#8217;s amendments were a package to deliver a national police force and a national fire service that would work within local communities. We advocated a police force in which local authorities would have a say in the appointment of a local police commander, would have an insight into the funding for their area, and would be able to raise concerns about local policing issues directly with the chief constable. We envisaged a fire service in which local knowledge would be given due regard by the Scottish ministers. We envisaged that a minimum of a third of the members of the board of that service would be local authority representatives and that local authorities would be consulted before the appointment of local senior officers.</p><p>To oversee all those functions, Labour advocated an independent commission that would have been tasked specifically with scrutinising the services to ensure that they acted in the most effective and efficient way possible.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s amendments also sought to bring community benefit. For example, our amendment to empower people in supported workplaces would have given them preference in just one contract every three years. What kind of Government does not wilfully use the power that it already has to save our supported workplaces? This SNP Government.</p><p>Labour also lodged an amendment that would have provided a gender balance on the boards of our police and fire services, which deal daily with gender-based justice issues. In responding to that amendment, Roseanna Cunningham said that she could not support it because it did not account for all other minorities. I ask Roseanna Cunningham whether she thinks that Emily Davison, before throwing herself under the king&#8217;s horse, ever stopped to think that she should not pursue gender equality because making a difference in one area was unfair to others.</p><p>Is it not the truth that Roseanna Cunningham&#8217;s argument, like the SNP&#8217;s arguments on our amendments for greater transparency and accountability, is merely a fig leaf to cover the real reason for the Government&#8217;s regressive stance? The ideas are progressive, fair and correct but they were put forward by Labour. It is telling that one of the only Labour amendments to be accepted by the SNP was an amendment in the Government&#8217;s own words, which it remains convinced would solve the VAT issue.</p><p>We support the bill as a foundation&#8212;as a first step towards the police and fire services that Scotland deserves. However, we support the principle of the bill in the face of our grave disappointment at the SNP&#8217;s conduct throughout the bill process. We give a stark warning against the SNP&#8217;s ethos of dragging our vital local public services closer to the state. The reality is that the SNP, through its stubbornness and its failure from day 1 to listen to Opposition parties in the chamber, to stakeholders and to the Treasury, which has provided clear guidelines, has risked costing the Scottish people millions in VAT. The SNP has nobody to blame but itself, and the Scottish people will blame nobody but it.</p><p>Labour members are clear that we will hold the Government to account for the decisions that it has made in the Parliament today and that we will fight for democratic scrutiny and local accountability.

Part 1 addresses an anomaly in the law, which is that offenders serving non-mandatory life sentences are eligible to be considered for release by the Parole Board for Scotland earlier than those serving a comparable determinate sentence. Part 2 enhances transparency by allowing the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to publish reports on cases that are abandoned subsequent to being brought to the appeal court.

As I argued at stage 1, any other outcome could risk doing a great deal of damage to the integrity of our justice system. It is for that reason that I urge the Government to monitor closely part 1 as it comes into effect and to ensure that it not only addresses the anomaly that it seeks to address, but does so in a way that is seen to be fair and right.</p><p>As the Government is currently undertaking consultation to improve our justice system for victims of and witnesses to crime, I know that it is as keen as Labour is to ensure that sentencing laws are considered fair and right by those who have suffered at the hands of violent and dangerous offenders.</p><p>The exact function that part 2 will have in practice remains to be seen. Just before the stage 1 debate on the bill, a Sunday newspaper printed a redacted version of the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission&#8217;s statement of reasons in the Megrahi case. The publication of the statement of reasons seemed essentially to remove the need for part 2. It also appeared to answer many of the questions surrounding the impediment caused by existing data protection law.</p><p>Part 2 was devised in response to the Megrahi case. Although the power of publication will be on the statute book after the bill is passed, it is difficult to imagine a similar scenario to which it will be applicable. In the Megrahi case, widespread public and political interest pushed a desire for the publication of the statement of reasons in an appeal that was subsequently abandoned. The legislative process to provide transparency was overtaken by the actions of the media. Now the power will rest in law if circumstances arise in which it is needed again.</p><p>Although Labour is happy to support the passing of the bill, it is a difficult and complex piece of law that is still to prove its utility in practice.

Now, more than ever, European nations that the Scottish Government seeks to emulate are taking action to make boardroom equality a standard practice in their businesses, public bodies and Parliaments. It can be done.</p><p>It has been almost 10 years since the Norwegian male Conservative Minister of Trade and Industry, Ansgar Gabrielsen, completed Norway&#8217;s transition from a state that operates a 40 per cent quota on public boards to one that includes the private sector in that quota system. It took just two years for Norway to reach its quota of 40 per cent female representation on its public limited company boards. Its boardrooms have equalised, both in the private sector and in its public bodies.</p><p>It took Finland six years, from 2005, to bring all of its public boardrooms from 30 per cent representation of women to up to 44 per cent. Iceland&#8217;s target of 50 per cent was achieved in just one year.</p><p>Gender quotas for public boards are in place in Denmark, South Africa, Israel, Quebec, Berlin and&#8212;at a local level&#8212;Nuremberg, and have been proposed in Belgium, Canada and Italy. They are becoming a more and more attractive choice for nations where, as is the case in Scotland, diversity strategies, leaflets, DVDs and the mentors that the Scottish Government proposes are simply not working. The attraction of quotas has grown so much that, just last week, the majority right-wing European Parliament backed a European Commission recommendation to bring gender quotas into the boardrooms of all of Europe&#8217;s companies by 2020.</p><p>Angela Merkel has called the gender composition on Germany&#8217;s boards scandalous, and even David Cameron has said he will not rule out quotas for gender representation. However, two days ago in committee, the Scottish Government rejected the amendments to the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill that would have introduced quotas. In light of all the evidence and all the progress that is being made around us, I ask the chamber this: when did the Scottish Government become less progressive on equality than a Conservative Prime Minister in London?</p><p>Labour&#8217;s motion suggests that Scotland would benefit by learning from progressive policies in other European countries that have successfully balanced their boards&#8212;a course of action that all sides of this chamber should agree upon.</p><p>At the heart of the matter is the fact that, as all sides of this chamber agree, gender should not matter, and board appointments should be made on merit and merit alone. However, what the Scottish National Party Government and the Tories fail to realise, but the Scottish Labour Party always has, is that no matter how much we will it to be irrelevant, the reality of the culture for those seeking positions at Scotland&#8217;s boardroom level is that gender matters, and that the situation is usually to the detriment of women.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women&#8217;s Representation (Public Sector Boards)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to be able to open a debate on equality in the Scottish Parliament in this, the United Nations year of empowering women.

Let me explain it. Boards would require 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men, with flexibility of 20 per cent for boards with an uneven number of members, or in cases where there was an insufficient number of either gender. The model is taken from the highly successful Finnish equality act and it has been proven to work. For as long as we agree that the merit of a man is equal to that of a woman, we should not object to each having an entitlement to a minority 40 per cent representation on the boards that govern all our public services.</p><p>I lodged two amendments to the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill that would have introduced a 40 per cent quota on the boards of Scotland&#8217;s new police and fire service.

Furthermore, when asked why Dundee&#8217;s young people had been overlooked, a Scottish Government spokesperson replied that money had been earmarked for areas that have particular youth unemployment problems.</p><p>Let me tell the minister about the extent of youth unemployment in Dundee, so that next time she will not do us the disservice of sharing a platform with the Tories in Dundee and telling us how concerned she is, but will instead addresses the problem with hard investment. In Dundee today, 1,705 16 to 24-year-olds are claiming unemployment benefit while Dundee has 674 modern apprenticeships, so it is clear that that number should be multiplied by three. The Scottish Government&#8217;s statistics show that during the past year the number of 16 to 24-year-olds in Dundee who have been claiming unemployment benefit for six months or more rose by a staggering 109 per cent, and the number who have been claiming for a year or more soared by 642 per cent. I would like to think that the Scottish Government simply did not know the true extent of the problem in Dundee before its spokesperson told our young people that they are not a priority for the Government.</p><p>For too long, the Government has used its flagship policy on modern apprenticeships as an excuse for ignoring the problem. The Government has claimed countless times that 25,000 modern apprenticeships have been created. We now know, as a result of Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s assiduous research, that the claim is spurious and that the reality is that the Government cannot even administer a modern apprenticeships scheme effectively, let alone transform apprenticeships into sustainable jobs for unemployed youngsters.</p><p>When I think of Dundee, I think of our potential. I think of our life sciences and technology sectors and our future as a renewables hub. I think of our proud manufacturing history&#8212;NCR, Timex and Kestrel&#8212;I think of all the young people I meet who tell me that they desperately want to work, and I think of the young men and women who want to work in construction and engineering, who want to work with their hands and make things.</p><p>Some people stopped me in the street in Dundee last week to ask me when the renewables jobs will come. So far, the Government has failed to deliver on those jobs, despite our city&#8217;s promise. The investment from Gamesa did not come to Dundee, and although it is almost six months to the day since the First Minister came to Dundee to sign a memorandum of understanding with Scottish and Southern Energy, we still wait to hear the outcome. We still do not know how much our portion will be of the national renewables infrastructure fund or when it will come to Dundee.

In our manifesto last year, Scottish Labour made a substantial commitment to create a safer, fairer way for victims and witnesses of crime to navigate our justice system. I am glad that Scottish Labour&#8217;s vision has been partly shared by the Government. However, substantial improvements can still be made. Our amendment, which I am glad that the Government has accepted, looks to the Government to give the Parliament a timeline for when those changes will be rolled out, so that we can build upon its commitments together.</p><p>Our manifesto commitment was to do better for victims of some of Scotland&#8217;s most prolific and serious crimes through a series of innovative and far-reaching policies. One such policy was to create a dedicated victims commissioner to help victims navigate the legal system and champion their rights within it. Having a dedicated position, as my colleague Dave Stewart&#8212;who put forward the idea and the bill a couple of years ago&#8212;eloquently put in his speech, would ensure that standards are constantly being enforced, innovated and complied with. Many members across the chamber have raised the idea of a victims commissioner, or at least a point of contact or focus for victims. Although the SNP&#8217;s pledge to create duties on relevant public agencies serves part of that purpose, I urge the minister to outline how those standards will be enforced and monitored in the way that a dedicated commissioner could have done. Without ensuring that those duties are sufficient, or adhered to correctly, the effectiveness could be seriously reduced.</p><p>Labour also committed to rolling out specialist domestic abuse courts such as the one that we set up in 2004 in Glasgow. It has been highly effective in bringing persistent offenders swiftly to justice. Such courts are efficient&#8212;they are tailored to focus on domestic abuse specifically and have victims at their centre.</p><p>Although I welcome the SNP&#8217;s commitment to introduce rights to television links for victims testifying in court, I urge the Government to consider the value of having swift convictions in local specially tailored courts as well.</p><p>I also urge the Government to consider fully the impact on victims and witnesses of a reduction in the number of courts in Scotland, on which it is consulting, and which would remove the vital link between justice and the community.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Improving Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Proper treatment of and protection for victims and witnesses of crime are critical features of our justice system if we are to do better at securing convictions for those who have committed serious offences.

Examples such as the Glasgow domestic abuse court show that there is significant value in local justice. The SNP has before it a successful blueprint for the creation of specialist courts that are tailored towards victims of domestic abuse and other crimes. With the right amount of investment and political will, such courts could make a difference to the women, children and men across Scotland who suffer through the horrors of domestic violence every day.</p><p>Along with creating a victims commissioner and rolling out specialist domestic abuse courts, Scottish Labour pledged to create a victims fund from a levy on offenders, which would help to fund victim support services. I am glad that the Government has made that pledge a reality. Support for victims organisations such as Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid is a critical link in the chain to break the cycle of violent and sexual crime, and the announcement is warmly welcomed by members on the Labour benches.</p><p>However, across Scotland, funding to victims organisations is being cut. In Dundee, the Government has withdrawn funding from the Women&#8217;s Aid children&#8217;s service, despite its having been funded for years previously, and in Aberdeen, Rape and Abuse Support has had &#163;50,000-worth of investment pulled by the Scottish Government. Those organisations work round the clock to look after vulnerable people, many of whom use them as a place of last resort. I ask the minister, in closing, to reflect on the SNP&#8217;s failure to fund those organisations. I seek a reassurance that the victim surcharge will not exist simply to plug the gaps in spending that the SNP has created.

In many areas of our law, victims are left without any reparation for the damages done to them, and a further emphasis on redressing that imbalance is a welcome development. As cuts to the criminal injuries compensation scheme are biting down on victims&#8217; rights to compensation, Scottish Labour is keen to ensure that the Government makes sufficient provision for those who are losing out. Duncan McNeil pointed out the 28-week period of no compensation for victims, which is a stark reminder of the disadvantage that victims face in the compensation scheme.</p><p>When it was in government, Labour embarked on the most ambitious programme of reforms for victims and witnesses in 30 years, and we are keen to ensure that that legacy is continued. To that end, this consultation is a welcome, if overdue development. Although the measures within the consultation do not in our opinion go far enough, there are many aims that we support, and we will contribute fully towards their development.

The last time we debated the CFP, I talked about a range of issues that the cabinet secretary has covered in his speech today. Although I am happy to support his motion and I agree with many of the sentiments in his speech, I refer him back to the overarching theme in Labour&#8217;s amendment: the need for effective co-operation in the UK and Europe to achieve a more effective and efficient fisheries policy.</p><p>At the heart of the CFP is an acknowledgement that common waters require a shared management system if they are to be both sustainable and profitable, not only for those who depend on the fishing industry for their income but for all of us who have a stake in preserving a healthy ecosystem in our seas. If we do not embrace the need for collective action as a fair and necessary way of managing Europe&#8217;s fishing grounds, we risk doing a great deal of damage to the sustainability of our fishing industry and the biodiversity of our waters.</p><p>I strongly believe that only by accepting the same obligations as all other partners in Europe can we move the CFP forward. In Scotland, we can be proud of the part that we have played in contributing to a more effective common management system for Europe&#8217;s shared fishing grounds. We have piloted innovative and creative mechanisms, such as real-time closures and the use of closed-circuit television in our fleet, which have been lauded and replicated throughout Europe.</p><p>Along with our successful conservation credits scheme, Scotland has been at the forefront of implementing policies that have helped to remedy some of the challenges presented in fisheries management throughout Europe. It is crucial that we continue to innovate policies, improve our scientific advice and share our ideas throughout the EU to achieve our commonly agreed aims, which are reflected in the latest round of CFP reform.</p><p>On the key principles of regionalisation, conservation and ending discards, which the minister mentioned, there is broad agreement in the UK and Europe that changes must be made. I believe that that presents us with an obligation to work together in partnership in the UK and Europe to find the best plan to achieve those aims.</p><p>As I said the last time we debated the issue, the principle of regionalisation presents us with an unprecedented opportunity to get fisheries management right for Scotland. A good example of how greater co-operation through regionalisation would work is the area of scientific advice.</p><p>A recent study that was conducted by the marine centre of the University of the Highlands and Islands found that more than half of the main species landed by Scottish white-fish vessels came from stocks that are data deficient. That means that the data needed to carry out scientific assessment of the stocks was not available or was not sufficient. That finding typifies the significant lack of understanding about our waters and the stock within them, which is a serious concern in relation to the sustainability of our fishing industry and fishing grounds.</p><p>Under a regionalised model, we would have the opportunity to increase our capacity to carry out more targeted research of common fishing areas to help to develop a fisheries management system that is based on sound scientific evidence. Both policy makers and industry have been calling for that for years and it is something else that can be achieved only through co-operation in the UK and with our partners in the European Union. Better and more targeted scientific advice would help to enhance our policies on conservation, as it would allow us to identify stocks that require protection or areas that are being overfished. It would also allow us to assess the full impact of any such ban or plan as the cabinet secretary calls for to end the appalling practice of discarding. Those matters concern all of us and a mutual approach to tackling them is necessary to change them.</p><p>I agree with the cabinet secretary on many of the concerns that he outlined, and nobody is in any doubt that the common fisheries policy needs major reform. However, the Labour amendment makes the vital point that the common fisheries policy is exactly that&#8212;a policy in which all stakeholders in Europe share the rights and responsibilities of a common, shared fishing ground. Only by working together on shared concerns through commonly agreed principles such as regionalisation can we contribute fully to a better fisheries management system for Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668727", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the common fisheries policy.

In my role as convener of the cross-party group on deafness I have seen at first hand the commitment of many groups and their determination to make a difference to the lives of Scotland&#8217;s deaf and hard-of-hearing people.</p><p>During deaf awareness week this year there were a number of initiatives throughout Scotland, and there were some great ideas for raising awareness. In Edinburgh, for example, volunteers set up so-called doc squads and handed out communication tips to local general practitioner surgeries and health centres. Members might think that doctors would be among the last groups of people in need of such guidance, but the evidence shows that even professionals can benefit from it. Currently, only 45 per cent of people who report hearing loss to their GP are referred on for further support and intervention.</p><p>Unaddressed hearing loss continues to be a systemic problem in Scotland. It is estimated that 500,000 people could benefit from a hearing aid, but only 160,000 people have one. That leaves around 340,000 people suffering from hearing loss without a hearing aid to help them. Evidence has also shown that there is a 10-year delay in people seeking help for their hearing loss. It is clear that we can make things better.</p><p>That leads me to the most critical part of deaf awareness week and the reason why I lodged the motion. It is imperative that we, as policy makers, continue to tackle the barriers that face deaf and hard-of-hearing people in accessing the help and support that they need to live a life that is free of limits and to gain the ability to reach their full potential. Barriers exist for the deaf and hard of hearing in all areas of life in Scotland. Whether at work, school or home or in doing the weekly shop, what are everyday tasks for most will unnecessarily turn into difficulties for some. A recent survey of 500 shops in Scotland showed that 80 per cent did not have the necessary equipment to make them accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing people. Some 45 per cent of people have said that they have missed their name being called in doctors&#8217; and dentists&#8217; waiting rooms, and there is a 38-point gap in attainment between deaf and non-deaf pupils in secondary 4 in this country.</p><p>We can do quite a lot to address those issues. In relation to educational requirements, the National Deaf Children&#8217;s Society has stated that deafness itself does not represent a complex additional support need&#8212;the complexity arises as a result of the ability or otherwise of local education provision to deliver the appropriate quality, quantity and scope of support to allow a deaf child to flourish.</p><p>What is therefore required is greater political awareness in the Scottish Parliament and our local authorities of the issues that deaf and hard-of-hearing people face, coupled with greater political will to invest the resources and create the policy that will help to alleviate the problems. I have heard that claim many times in meetings of the cross-party group on deafness over the past year. In those meetings, many members of the cross-party group have argued that better guidance for and education of public and private bodies would make a great difference in overcoming some of the obstacles that deaf and hard-of-hearing people face.</p><p>There is still no guidance from the Scottish Government on what constitutes effective early intervention for deaf children and their families, for example. That means that the families of many newly diagnosed children&#8212;90 per cent of whom are born to parents who have little or no prior knowledge of deafness&#8212;have little direction on where to turn for support or, indeed, little knowledge of the support to which those children are entitled. As a result, deaf children are immensely disadvantaged from the start of their lives, as the communication between them and their parents becomes increasingly difficult. As the attainment gap between pupils shows, that can prove to be a major impediment to children achieving as they progress through the school system.</p><p>Some good work has been done in the Parliament to improve the guidance on specific issues in order to tackle some of the problems that are faced by those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Very recently, for example, my colleague Neil Findlay sought to address the lack of guidance on minimum acoustic standards in classrooms by lodging a motion for debate that encouraged the Government to address those standards. Without minimum acoustic standards in schools, the attainment of hard-of-hearing children can suffer unnecessarily, as they struggle even further to take in vital information and, given all the social pressures involved, have all the barriers that children face in admitting that they have such difficulties.</p><p>As Neil Findlay&#8217;s motion highlights, guidance on minimum acoustic standards already exists in England and Wales, but not in Scotland. That is a good example of where just a little political will could make a significant difference for deaf and hard-of-hearing children in Scotland. I urge members to support that motion, and I ask the minister to address the issue in his closing remarks.</p><p>Another positive development in Parliament, which has been closely monitored by the cross-party group, is my colleague Mark Griffin&#8217;s proposal for a British Sign Language bill. The bill would seek to tackle the fundamental problems of low awareness among the general public and in public bodies of the needs of those who are deaf or hard of hearing, and the shortage of BSL interpreters, which, if addressed, would significantly increase access to information and services for many people. On that note, I warmly welcome Paul Belmonte, who I believe is somewhere behind me in the public gallery providing BSL interpretation.</p><p>Those two developments&#8212;Neil Findlay&#8217;s motion and Mark Griffin&#8217;s proposal for a member&#8217;s bill&#8212;are positive steps in tackling what I believe are surmountable barriers that exist for deaf and hard-of-hearing people in Scotland. The challenge that lies ahead for us as we leave the chamber today, as deaf awareness week has passed for another year, is to harness the political will and make available the resources to ensure that we can make those achievable changes and make Scotland an entirely accessible place for those who are deaf and hard of hearing.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667498", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Deaf Awareness Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, thank you for allowing me to bring this debate to the chamber.

I will let the cabinet secretary add up how much more that costs. Moreover, four police constables transferred into Tayside&#8217;s force control room to backfill a civilian dispatcher.

We were appointed as the lead committee for consideration of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill at stage 1, with the Local Government and Regeneration Committee as the secondary committee. I thank that committee for its report on the parts of the bill that relate to arrangements for local authorities and implementation of local police and fire and rescue services. We are grateful to the Finance Committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee, which also reported on the bill, helping us to gain a wider understanding of the financial and technical issues. Finally, I thank all the witnesses and those who provided written submissions, some of whom found themselves in front of two or three committees within a matter of weeks.</p><p>I will begin by making clear the committee&#8217;s position on the general principles of the bill and then explain how we arrived at some of our main conclusions and recommendations. In our view, the general principles are to merge the current police and fire and rescue services into two single services, transferring the governance and oversight responsibilities from local authorities to new national boards. The key issue for the committee in considering the general principles was whether the new national structures could deliver the single services effectively throughout Scotland.</p><p>Some witnesses argued that the bill will erode the local authority role in policing and fire and rescue services, while others said that reform will not be detrimental to local policing or local fire and rescue services. The majority of committee members agreed with the latter view. We believe that reform presents an opportunity to enhance service delivery across communities in Scotland. The majority of the committee therefore supports the general principles of the bill. However, we raised a number of concerns about implementation of the reform, which I intend to discuss briefly.</p><p>We heard overwhelming evidence from police and fire bodies that the chief constable and chief fire officer should be appointed sooner than in December, as originally planned. We recommended that both positions should be filled as early as possible to ensure that there is enough preparation time to be ready on day 1, which is 1 April 2013. I am delighted that the Government has listened to the views of the committee and witnesses on the issue and has agreed to start the appointments process in the summer rather than the autumn. I hope that the Government is as supportive of the other recommendations in our stage 1 report.</p><p>The committee heard evidence that there might be difficulties in achieving within the expected timescales the projected savings that are set out in the outline business cases for reform, which were used to inform the financial memorandum. We also heard that there is, understandably, concern among civilian staff, in particular about projected redundancies. We heard that 2,000 or more civilian posts could go in the police service alone. Therefore, we asked the Government to clarify the impact of those redundancies and to set out how they might affect the front line.</p><p>Another issue that arises from reform is that, unlike the current police and fire authorities and the joint boards, the new services may not be able to recover VAT. Regardless of whether that money will need to come from the police and fire and rescue budgets or elsewhere, we are concerned that the loss of the VAT exemption will result in an annual recurrent loss of millions of pounds from the Scottish budget. Therefore, we have urged the Government to pursue with the Treasury all available options to ensure that, like the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the new services qualify for a VAT exemption.</p><p>Leaving aside implementation issues, I turn to another theme that arose from the evidence. More robust accountability mechanisms are needed for the police service than are proposed in the bill, particularly as the police authorities and joint boards, which historically have provided the main democratic oversight of the police service, are to be abolished.</p><p>Some witnesses argued that there could be more accountability to the Parliament and that it could undertake more scrutiny, and the committee agreed that there is a strong case to be made for securing in the bill parliamentary oversight of the police. We noted that there were different ways of achieving that. For example, the role could be carried out by the Justice Committee itself, by an ad hoc committee or by a new parliamentary body along similar lines to the Scottish Commission for Public Audit. We have called for those and other options to be explored further by the Government. In any event, we think that we need to find a new way of ensuring that the principle of the police carrying out their duties with the consent of the public is, and is seen by the people of Scotland to be, upheld under the new arrangements.</p><p>The boards of the Scottish police authority and the Scottish fire and rescue service provoked much discussion among witnesses, and we received a variety of views&#8212;in particular, on their optimum size. Some witnesses argued that the boards should focus on scrutiny and have a larger membership, with councillors being their foundation. Others took the view that the boards should be governing bodies and that the skills and expertise of the members was more important than the boards&#8217; size. The committee agreed with the latter view that the main function of the boards is to govern the new services and to hold the chief constable and the chief fire officer to account. We were reluctant to stipulate the size of the boards, but we leaned towards the view that a board of fewer than 11 members would not provide the breadth of knowledge and expertise that is required. We also agreed with witnesses that the boards must be as transparent as possible, to demonstrate accountability and to gain public trust.</p><p>There are a few other issues that I would like to touch on, the first of which is local budgets. With reform, it is intended that funding for the new services will be provided entirely by the Scottish Government. Some stakeholders suggested that budgets should be devolved to local authorities and local commanders, so that there is some form of accountability to the local authority for policing in an area. We believe that, in the interests of transparency, it would be helpful for local authorities to be given a snapshot of resource allocation in their area as of 1 April 2013, so that they can measure any future changes, such as the transfer of funds, assets and human resources. In addition, we have asked for clarification of whether, in practice, local authorities will have any influence over police resources.</p><p>Finally, the committee has urged the Government to put in place arrangements to ensure that the police investigations and review commissioner and his team are appointed as early as possible, so that the public can have confidence in how investigations of complaints against the police are conducted from day 1.</p><p>I reiterate that the majority of the committee supports the general principles of the bill, and I ask the cabinet secretary to consider fully our constructive suggestions on how it might be improved. I look forward to hearing other members&#8217; contributions to the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666435", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on behalf of the Justice Committee.

Not only do they allow Scots of all ages to experience the very best in theatre, dance, opera, ballet and music that Scotland and the rest of the world have to offer, they have the ability to inspire our youngsters to have a future in the arts. I will direct my remarks to opportunities for children and young people.</p><p>One of the most impressive achievements of the national performing arts companies has been the number of youngsters whom they have given the opportunity to experience and participate in the performances that they offer. In June last year, pupils from Dundee&#8217;s Craigowl school took part in a fantastic project that the National Theatre of Scotland organised. They collaborated with pupils from nearby schools in Perth and Glenrothes to put on a 24-hour online theatre marathon.</p><p>That example is just one of a number of creative youth initiatives that are under way in Dundee at the moment. Just next week, youngsters from Dundee will participate in an evening of short performances at the Dundee Rep theatre, showcasing the best new talent that we have in the performing arts. Indeed, Dundee Rep has excelled under its inspirational artistic director, James Brining. I pay tribute to James, who is shortly to leave us to take up a post in York. He did a remarkable job at Dundee Rep, which is reflected not just in the critical acclaim that Dundee Rep has received during his tenure, but in its exemplary creative learning department, which seeks to develop the confidence and abilities of Dundee&#8217;s youth in the performing arts. I wish James the best of luck and thank him, on behalf of everyone, for the work that he has done for Dundee and for the performing arts in Scotland.</p><p>I appreciated the minister&#8217;s comments, during Sandra White&#8217;s speech, on children&#8217;s attendance at performances. That is critical, as the minister said. A recent study was undertaken by Caishlan Sweeney at Dundee Rep on behalf of the Northeast Performing Arts Group, which surveyed schoolteachers in the region. Ninety-six per cent of the teachers who responded said that funding bus transport to theatre or other performances was the primary and major existing barrier to getting pupils to performances. All of us in the chamber know how parent teacher associations raise money, and we know that money to fund transport to performances is more readily raised by schools in more prosperous areas in our cities and towns than by those in more deprived communities. I have a copy of Ms Sweeney&#8217;s report, which I am happy to share with the cabinet secretary so that she can see the evidence. Indeed, I invite the cabinet secretary to meet Caishlan Sweeney to see whether a collaborative solution across the arts can be found to solve that very real problem of access to performances.</p><p>As Patricia Ferguson suggested in Labour&#8217;s opening speech, giving the national youth performing arts companies the same status as the national performing arts companies will give us the opportunity to educate our young people and to inspire and encourage them to learn valuable skills through participating more fully in all areas of the arts. The education of youngsters is one of the primary functions of our national youth performing companies. As well as developing their own programmes, they work alongside existing initiatives that make a huge impact on the lives of children in Scotland.</p><p>One such educational initiative, which I have talked about in the chamber before, is the El Sistema project&#8212;a project that I believe is worthy of further discussion in the chamber. By providing intensive music tuition to some of the most disadvantaged children in Scotland and across the world, El Sistema provides the opportunity for children to learn new skills, increase their confidence and achieve where they would otherwise not have been able to achieve. I know that the cabinet secretary is currently considering evidence from the Raploch project. The project is doing fantastic work in the Raploch&#8212;I visited it a few weeks ago and was delighted to see the looks on some of the children&#8217;s faces as they rehearsed in their small groups and then came together in bigger groups. Recently, alongside the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, they performed on stage at the Clyde auditorium in the BBC&#8217;s music nation event. I visited them three days before they took to the stage, and their excitement was palpable.</p><p>Opportunities such as that foster aspiration and a sense of achievement in children. They teach children skills that they will maintain for life, and they offer children the chance to break out of a cycle of poverty that denies them the opportunity to learn in an extra-curricular setting. As some members will know, I have been campaigning for El Sistema to come to Dundee because I believe that it could benefit a great number of children in our city. The instrumental tuition figures in Dundee back that up. In Fort Hill community school&#8212;a school in one of Dundee&#8217;s most affluent areas&#8212;the number of children who are being taught music privately is 83. That contrasts starkly with the figure for Sidlaw View primary school, which is in one of the poorer areas of the city, where only four children are learning an instrument.</p><p>By extending the status of our national performing arts companies to our national youth performing arts companies, we have the chance to develop a successful working relationship between youth performing companies and projects such as El Sistema, so that projects can be expanded into areas such as Dundee, where they will benefit children immensely. The recommendation is worthy of further exploration and I hope that the cabinet secretary will consider it in her closing speech.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666257", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Performing Companies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we have heard, the national performing arts companies have an important role.

I pay tribute to her for all her work with families who are affected by imprisonment. I am sure that she will continue to press the cabinet secretary for those important needs assessments.</p><p>My colleague Richard Simpson called on the Government to agree a set of targets. We have talked about the issues for a long time, and I will go through them again for the cabinet secretary. They include an appointment on the Scottish Prison Service board to deal with female offenders; a visitors centre in Cornton Vale; a successor to the prison visiting committees with a good monitoring function; early intervention services relating to drugs and alcohol; and good continuity in management. I hope that the minister will refer to those calls in her closing speech.</p><p>The report proposes radical change in how we deal with women offenders and reiterates a common view that, to tackle offending, we must do more than simply incarcerate. Labour asks the Government to harness the growing body of opinion and act on our mutual support for Angiolini&#8217;s recommendations.</p><p>Labour strongly welcomes the commission&#8217;s focus on the need to tackle the underlying causes that lead women to offend and subsequently reoffend by introducing a package of measures such as community justice programmes, multidisciplinary teams and supported accommodation. We believe that space will always be reserved in prison for any person who presents a threat to the public, but that prison simply does not work for a large proportion of women offenders.</p><p>Like many of my Labour colleagues, I went to Cornton Vale in February this year. I spoke to the prisoners and staff, and I have seen for myself the damage that has been done to women and their families through the manifestation of a culture that ignores the complex needs of women offenders.</p><p>In the context of our discussion of Angiolini&#8217;s recommendations, it is useful that Hugh Monro&#8217;s follow-up report on Cornton Vale has been published this week. It gives us further evidence against which to consider the commission&#8217;s proposals. For example, despite progress having been made on working with prisoners with complex mental health needs, Hugh Monro stated:</p><p>&#8220;Some of these women might be better located in alternative specialist facilities.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to urge that a long-term solution for prisoners with complex mental health issues be found.</p><p>We very much welcome the key focus on mental health in the commission&#8217;s report. Dame Elish has made a series of recommendations to improve the harrowing and stark reality of the lives of the hundreds of women who find themselves incarcerated. With that evidence, it is inconceivable that the Government should not act. The cabinet secretary has said that he will act on the report, and I very much welcome that.</p><p>As my colleague Lewis Macdonald pointed out, the Government already has blueprints that it can use to take immediate action on the commission&#8217;s recommendations. For example, community justice projects created by Labour, such as the 218 centre in Glasgow, are proving to be hugely successful in reducing reoffending rates. When, at last week&#8217;s First Minister&#8217;s questions, I asked the First Minister whether he would consider expanding those centres throughout Scotland, he replied that &#8220;good ideas&#8221; would be accepted. The report contains many good ideas, and Labour believes that the Scottish Government should take action now and set the wheels in motion on initiatives that are set out in the report to ensure that in June&#8212;and in six months&#8217; time, when the cabinet secretary has to come back to the chamber&#8212;we can see real progress.</p><p>For too long now, we have known about but not dealt with the harrowing underbelly of female offending.

I want to take some time to reflect on not just the principles of the bill, but its substance. A great range of views have been expressed on what is a complex bill, as the Justice Committee convener has set out. It is important that those views are aired in the chamber from the outset.</p><p>The most important thing in the scrutiny process is that we take the time to get the bill right, which means right for the victims of crime, for the courts and their procedures and for those who are sentenced in our courts. Our justice system is built on the foundations of justice, compassion and integrity, which are the benchmarks against which we as lawmakers should measure any bill that comes before the Parliament. On justice, does the bill get it right for the victims of crime? On compassion, will the bill ensure that justice is proportionate? On integrity, will the bill work effectively in our justice system?</p><p>In analysing the reasons behind the bill, we find that its principles go hand in hand with those that underpin our system. Part 1 seeks to rectify an anomaly in the law that has led to a method of sentencing that has been seen to jeopardise the principles of integrity and justice. As we have heard, through the case of Petch and Foye, sentencing in non-mandatory life sentences, including orders for lifelong restriction, have been subject to interpretation that has resulted in sentences being reduced to a point at which offenders will be considered by the Parole Board for Scotland earlier than they might otherwise have been. As a result, there is an element of doubt and confusion, not only among victims and the wider public, but among the legal profession, as the convener pointed out.</p><p>Put simply, the bill seeks to address the anomaly by reinstating to judges discretion to hand down sentences that are deemed appropriate in each case. In doing so, the bill seeks to restore integrity in the system as well as a sense of fairness and confidence in the eyes of victims and their families that offenders are being sentenced correctly for the crimes that they commit. Introducing legislation that ensures that courts can sentence dangerous and violent offenders appropriately and in compliance with human rights can only be a good thing. However, we can act on that principle only if the bill that is drafted to rectify the problem is clear, coherent and effective.</p><p>As the convener explained, the evidence sessions in the Justice Committee on part 1 of the bill were mired in uncertainty among committee members and witnesses. Most important, there is no consensus that the bill will build confidence in our justice system. There is still an opinion that people who come to the court to be sentenced as well as victims and their families are still confused by the sentencing rules in this country, and there is further confusion not just among committee members, but among qualified and experienced legal professionals.</p><p>I will give just one example. Back in January, when the committee first took evidence on the bill, James Wolffe QC stated:</p><p>&#8220;The approach that is taken in the amendments to existing legislation that are in the bill is to take an already complex piece of legislation and make it even more complex.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;sentencing judges are expected to explain sentences in a way that will be intelligible not only to the accused who is being punished and sentenced, but to the victims of the crime, the public at large and, ultimately, the appeal court. It is open to question, at least, whether provisions of such complexity will be helpful to sentencing judges in the task that they must carry out&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 31 January 2012; c 864-5.]</p><p>I share the concerns of Mr Wolffe and others who have given evidence on the bill and who have noted the wider implications for victims, the public and the appeal court, making a complex process even more so. At this stage of the parliamentary process on the bill, I urge the cabinet secretary to take evidence from other European countries on how they manage to integrate the ECHR compliance in this form of sentence. Perhaps Scotland can learn lessons from other jurisdictions where there is more clarity.</p><p>There are similar concerns about part 2. While noting the good intention behind the bill, contributors to the Justice Committee&#8217;s evidence sessions have aired very different opinions on how effective part 2 will be in addressing the issues that it seeks to rectify. Len Murray from the Justice for Megrahi group described the bill as</p><p>&#8220;a sledgehammer to crack a fairly small walnut.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 7 February 2012; c 900.]</p><p>That appears to have been substantiated by the publication in a well-known Sunday newspaper of the statement of reasons a couple of weeks ago. Although the convener of the Justice Committee and indeed the First Minister himself appeared on television to welcome its publication, questions were undoubtedly raised about the competence and necessity of part 2.</p><p>It is integral to public confidence that the Government should produce legislation that is necessary and effective.

Each year, many more Scots attend tribunals than attend court hearings, so we have an important responsibility to get the reform correct.</p><p>Unlike court hearings, tribunals are designed to bring about resolutions to disputes in an informal and less adversarial fashion, which makes them unique in form and function. However, much like the decisions that are taken in court, tribunal hearings have a significant impact on people&#8217;s lives. That is the case not least with mental health tribunals, which have the ability to restrict the fundamental freedoms of our citizens.</p><p>With that in mind, it is essential that any restructuring of the tribunal system be focused and centred on the citizen. The three principles of accessibility, accountability and transparency must be at the core of the reform. We must aim to create a structure that is not only clear from the outside looking in but coherent from the perspective of the citizens who use it.</p><p>During the previous debate on tribunal reform, the Scottish Parliament was united behind the need to restructure the fragmented and complex tribunal system in Scotland. Expert reports and evidence all agree that the system is too often inaccessible and costly to people. We have more than 40 tribunals, which handle a case load of more than 500,000 a year, and stakeholders were clear that we could do better to simplify the system for Scottish citizens.</p><p>The consultation that was launched last week contains far-reaching proposals for reform, and I am certain that, as it unfolds, we shall receive the same thorough and informative feedback from stakeholders as we did in 2010. I broadly welcome the proposals and agree with their main objective of creating a more coherent system, which will provide better clarity for people. Bringing each tribunal into one, streamlined system gives us the opportunity to offer Scots an enhanced level of accessibility to the justice system, as well as clear accountability for the decisions that tribunals make.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the new system will be adaptable in that it will be able to integrate further tribunals if and when that is deemed necessary. That aspect of the proposals will allow the Scottish system to respond efficiently to changes in United Kingdom legislation and will offer sustainability and clarity.</p><p>Many aspects of the consultation proposals require careful consideration, and I look forward to receiving stakeholder responses on them. For example, on matters such as appointments and the regulation of the system, we must act as far as possible in the spirit of the Leggatt report and recognise that the independence of tribunals is critical to their users&#8217; confidence in them. I welcome the Government&#8217;s stated commitment to that principle and look forward to it underpinning any statutory provisions that are introduced. As we move to the new tribunal system, I urge the Government to listen to stakeholders and assess carefully its proposals on sharing services with courts in a drive for efficiencies.</p><p>As I said at the start of my speech, the tribunals&#8217; separateness from the courts is an integral part of their less adversarial and more informal approach to resolving disputes between the citizen and the state. Although there is a case to be made for sharing services where practicable, any such move must not amount to a fundamental deviation in the nature of tribunals.</p><p>Similarly, in this drive for efficiencies, I look to the Government to protect the expertise and specialist resources that will continue to benefit each tribunal in its new format. As we know, each tribunal deals with a unique and usually highly technical aspect of law and we must not undo the good work that has been done up to now to build and maintain the appropriate resources for undertaking robust and comprehensive tribunal hearings. We need to carefully consider the types of services to be shared and the extent to which efficiencies take precedence as the system unfolds.</p><p>These and other issues will undoubtedly arise as the consultation goes forward and I am confident that, in its drive to get this aspect of civil justice right for the thousands of Scots who use it every year, the Government will be keen to work together with all parties in the Parliament to take forward stakeholders&#8217; views. Labour wants a system that not only is streamlined and efficient but is accountable and transparent and puts people at its centre.

If they had been here last week, they might have seen me, the minister and Chic Brodie locking horns over other issues. However, the matter that we have discussed today is of no less importance.</p><p>It has been a good debate, with interesting speeches from members throughout the chamber. I thank David McLetchie for his speech. I always enjoy listening to him, and I particularly enjoyed his reference to the origins of tribunals in Roman law. I hoped that he would spend a bit more of his time elaborating on that, but perhaps my penchant for the intricacies of Roman law is not shared by everyone in the chamber or indeed anyone who is watching the debate. Nevertheless, I thank him for that.</p><p>David McLetchie also called for clarification on the pace of change and integration. We would like to echo that point, which is important.</p><p>During the open debate, several members made significant contributions. My colleague John Pentland said that the standardisation and streamlining of practices should not come at the cost of specialisation in the tribunals. Mr Pentland made a convincing case; he said that we should guard against a one-size-fits-all system. That is worth noting.</p><p>Chic Brodie raised the issue of more arbitration and dispute resolution and pointed out how that is also important for preventative spend. We need to be most efficient and use such measures. My colleague James Kelly echoed that point. There is general agreement in the chamber that more arbitration and dispute resolution should be at the heart of the proposals.</p><p>James Kelly highlighted the crucial point that lies at the centre of Labour&#8217;s amendment by talking about the impact of tribunals on people&#8217;s lives. People often go to tribunals in stressful situations, whether it be because of private disputes or disputes with a public body, and it can be a worrying time for them. It is important that the proposals make that time easier.</p><p>During the debate, the minister handed me the easy-read guide on the consultation. It is a useful piece of work by the Scottish Government. It makes the issue a bit more accessible and transparent, as mentioned in our amendment. Perhaps the minister and the cabinet secretary will consider producing some easy-read guides for other areas of justice policy. It might be useful to have one on sentencing, an issue that the Justice Committee has recently grappled with.</p><p>I also apologise to the chamber for making a mistake about the number of tribunal hearings. I think that I underestimated the number at 50,000, when in fact it stands at 80,000, as many of my colleagues have pointed out.</p><p>The consultation marks the next step in a series of incremental reforms of the tribunal system, which is in need of change, as we have heard this afternoon. On the whole, the proposals are positive. By bringing each of the tribunals that operate independently of one another into a coherent and streamlined system, we can offer Scots a greatly improved service. Throughout the process, it is vital to put people at the centre of the reform by consulting widely, incorporating people&#8217;s views into any statutory measures and making a system that puts their interests at its centre.</p><p>Confidence in the civil justice system is a cornerstone of modern democratic states. Labour&#8217;s amendment stresses the importance of the three principles of transparency, accountability and accessibility. Most Scots who interact with the civil justice system in Scotland will do so through tribunals, which is why we must get the reform right.</p><p>In the spirit in which the debate has been conducted, I hope that the minister and the Government will support my amendment. The tribunal system must be transparent and accountable in all aspects of its decision-making process, from judicial appointments to the implementation of its governing rules. We should seek to make the process one that enhances the ability of Scots to access justice that they might not have had previously. We need a system that, through its clarity and accessibility, has the will to seek justice where injustice has been done. In that vein, we have heard a number of things to consider, such as the drive for efficiencies.

I also thank the cabinet secretary for his speech on this very important issue and for the tone of his speech. When I was preparing for the debate this morning, I was mindful that the debate would be a missed opportunity if we spent the whole of it telling each other what a horrendous crime human trafficking is. We all agree that it is horrendous, despicable and inhumane. No person should be forced to do something or sold against their will for someone else&#8217;s profit or gain. We agree on that, so we must move to take action. The cabinet secretary expressed willingness to do that, for which I thank him.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, we cannot be under the illusion that human trafficking is not happening in Scotland. I was glad about the tone of his speech, because he told us in the chamber only last year that there was not enough evidence of human trafficking in Scotland to warrant action. I note that he has noted the reports that have been published this year and I note from his speech that he has paid special attention to a report that I thought was very instructive from his own Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency director, Gordon Meldrum. Gordon Meldrum believes that ignorance of the problem is not an excuse to ignore it but an incentive to tackle it. I will quote part of Mr Meldrum&#8217;s report, because I believe that his words, as head of the SCDEA, are very instructive. It states:</p><p>&#8220;There has been an understandable desire to put a scale on the size of the human trafficking problem we face. Our assessment is that the information currently available from existing sources does not present an accurate picture of what is truly taking place ... Knowing whether you are one of 10 victims or one of a hundred doesn&#8217;t change the hell you have been through. So collectively, we need to move on from looking to &#8216;prove&#8217; that this is an issue to one in which we accept that it is an issue and concentrate on developing our knowledge where it will count. Count for the victims, and count against the traffickers.&#8221;</p><p>I point those who still need proof on the figures to the SCCYP&#8217;s report last year. It reported that social workers in Scotland had concerns that 249 children whom they had seen had been trafficked. Those 249 children are in Scotland today. If we compare that with the number of referrals of children that the UK Border Agency received, which was only 14, we can see that something is far wrong.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, we can no longer afford to wash our hands of the problem and put it at the door of the UK Border Agency, because it is primarily concerned with immigration. Trafficking is a different problem, as victims are forced against their will. Trafficking raises child protection issues, domestic abuse issues and forced marriage issues. It also involves criminal gangs and proceeds of crime. There are myriad problems that we in this Parliament have devolved competence to legislate on and tackle, so why wait?</p><p>Labour is today asking the Government to show leadership on the issue and introduce, as the cabinet secretary suggested, a statutory aggravation and also introduce a Scottish national referral mechanism and a statutory obligation for agencies to work together under a Scottish Government strategy with targets, which would be set by the cabinet secretary and approved by the Parliament.</p><p>First, the cabinet secretary will be aware that the Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, has publicly backed the introduction of a statutory aggravation. He thinks that it is a very good idea. Some people who traffic other human beings can be brought into court on other charges, such as benefit fraud, assault and child abuse. Making trafficking an aggravation is a simple legal measure that the Government could take to show the courts and the police the severity of the crime and increase the number of perpetrators who are brought to justice for it.</p><p>In considering a statutory aggravation, the Government may also want to consider having a lesser burden of proof. That suggestion was made by Baroness Helena Kennedy in her report, which was published in November last year following her inquiry. The justification for the lesser burden of proof is the intrinsic difficulties in identifying victims, because victims fear for themselves and for their families if they speak out. The nature of the lives that they lead here keeps them concealed; it keeps them out of the eyes of witnesses and the authorities.</p><p>I will give you an example that Women&#8217;s Aid gave me yesterday here in Parliament. There are women in Edinburgh today who are living in forced domestic servitude. They came to this country on a false promise of a better life and marriage. When they arrived, they were coerced into a marriage, which often develops into domestic abuse, and forced to provide permanent care for relatives. They have no money, no freedom and no life. They are not allowed to go out alone. The testimony that I heard yesterday from Women&#8217;s Aid is just one example that shows the difficulties in identifying victims and indicates why a lesser burden of proof could be considered for the statutory aggravation.</p><p>What else can be done? A Scottish national referral mechanism could be introduced. Given that victim care, policing, criminal justice and criminal compensation are all devolved matters, the Scottish Government could consider establishing a Scottish national referral mechanism. Any immigration issues should be referred to the UK Border Agency, but a Scottish national referral mechanism should be established to provide a multi-agency identification and referral mechanism. The system would be closer to victims and could build on existing successful multi-agency models. As decisions can have a significant impact on an individual&#8217;s rights, a swift and effective process to appeal negative decisions could also be introduced.</p><p>Thirdly, we call for leadership from the Scottish Government and a statutory obligation for all relevant agencies to work together to ensure that traffickers cannot disappear between the cracks as they do at the moment. One point on which all the major reports agree is that the Scottish Government is the prime body with the power to convene, provide a platform for and set priorities for those agencies. The forum that the Government suggests in the motion is good, but it does not go far enough to put in place the comprehensive channels of communication that are necessary to allow the agencies to co-ordinate, share information and protect the victims of trafficking.</p><p>If, by supporting our amendment, the Government could commit to putting in place a statutory obligation, there would be more confidence in its commitment to tackling trafficking, which is becoming an even more realistic threat in Scotland.</p><p>In December, in a debate on the legacy of the Commonwealth games, I expressed to the Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport, Shona Robison, the concern of Baroness Helena Kennedy that the Commonwealth games pose a stark risk of an increase in persons trafficked into Scotland. I called on the Scottish Government to provide anti-trafficking training to front-line, emergency service workers in the greater Glasgow area to mitigate that risk. Indeed, some of the games contractors are already undergoing anti-trafficking training that has been organised by Glasgow City Council.</p><p>Unfortunately, Shona Robison said that there was not enough evidence of trafficking to justify that training. I hope that she will reconsider that response after the debate, and I urge the minister to reflect in her closing speech on whether she believes that the risk of human trafficking is still insufficient to provide such training and, if not, whether the Government will reconsider the idea.</p><p>It is also critical that we raise awareness among the rest of the population, because the victims are difficult to identify. I have lodged a motion that has attracted cross-party support and urges the Government to introduce legislation similar to that in England that recognises anti-slavery day on 18 October with the purpose of raising public awareness of human trafficking, which is the modern form of slavery. Anti-slavery day has proven to be a successful means of capturing public attention in England, and I ask the minister again whether she will set the ball rolling for Scotland to recognise it this year and in years to come.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662015", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Trafficking"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Scottish Government for the opportunity to debate human trafficking.

I would like to make a brief representation of some of the problems that constituents have highlighted to me in the wake of the proposal for court closures in North East Scotland.</p><p>First, there is the impact on the victims of crime. A longer journey to the court, for example from Forfar, where the sheriff court is under threat, to Dundee, presents problems for the victims. The risk is that the victim will end up on the same bus as the accused, causing them extreme upset and distress, and potentially affecting the quality of their evidence. The concern is not to be taken lightly, because reduced frequencies of bus services will result in that happening. It is a reality. The court hearing is a particularly anxious time for victims of crime, and the last thing that a victim wants is to be on the same bus as the accused when they travel to court. Victim Support in Dundee knows that that will happen. It already occurs, sometimes, as people travel to the High Court. Victims have many different methods of getting to the court if it is in their community, including walking, a shorter and more affordable taxi journey, or more frequent short-distance buses. As the victims of crime must be the focus of any changes to our court system, I ask the minister to take Victim Support&#8217;s testimony seriously in her deliberations.</p><p>Secondly, I ask the Government to scrutinise carefully the data that is available to it on jury trials that are held in a different sheriffdom from the locus of the crime. Anecdotal evidence that is available to me shows that trials for crimes committed in Dundee that are heard by juries in Perth are failing every time to secure prosecutions. It might be because the juries were not persuaded of the guilt of the accused&#8212;I say to the minister that this is a serious point&#8212;but there is also a logical possibility that juries in Perth are not so concerned about summary crimes that take place in Dundee, outwith their own community.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662066", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank my colleague Iain Gray for bringing this important debate to the chamber.

Well, in that case why does he want to reinvent the wheel? It is clear from the evidence that the committees are doing an effective and invaluable job, so he should promote them more in our prisons.</p><p>The cabinet secretary said that an advocacy service has to be fit for 21st century prisons. There is a role for more advocacy in our prisons, but the cabinet secretary is not replacing like with like and the need for an advocacy service does not override the need for independent scrutiny.</p><p>The cabinet secretary also doubts the principle of visiting committees because they were established in 1877. I am of the opinion that many principles of law do not become irrelevant with the passage of time. Indeed, principles such as independent scrutiny, backed up by European law and international protocols on torture, should never become outdated just because the cabinet secretary wants to reduce the number of public bodies.</p><p>He also cites Sacro as one of the two supporters of his proposals.

I met the chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service at Polmont prison on Monday afternoon: I can assure Mr McMillan that the chief executive is a busy man. There are 8,000 prisoners in the Scottish prison estate&#8212;that is one of the highest proportions of any country in the world.

The SNP is telling primary 4 children that they cannot start learning to play a musical instrument now, but must wait until primary 5. Perhaps that is delayed preventative spend. I do not know whether the Government would like to clarify that, but I know that it agrees that El Sistema is a perfect example of preventative spend. That is one of my suggestions for the money that the Deputy First Minister might have available for Dundee.</p><p>Yesterday, I wrote to Dundee City Council asking it to go Dutch. In Holland, local authorities bulk buy energy on behalf of local residents. When Ed Miliband was Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, he changed the law to allow communities to bargain collectively for their energy prices. Local authorities in Manchester are doing that with the Energy Saving Trust. I have asked Dundee City Council to set up such a scheme, which would result in the fuel bills in Dundee&#8217;s 14,000 council properties falling by 20 per cent each. That is Government action that people would like. I ask the Deputy First Minister to consider similar schemes for all Scottish cities in her strategy. That is a project of low cost but with high results for which the Scottish people would thank her.</p><p>More than 2,000 Dundonians have signed up to my campaign to bring the national football academy to Dundee. Dundee is ideally placed at the centre of Scotland and is accessible for elite athletes from all parts of the country to come to train. It is the only major city in Scotland without an indoor football facility. The Deputy First Minister&#8217;s colleagues on Dundee City Council have backed Labour&#8217;s campaign and have pulled together a working group to put our bid together. We expected an announcement from the Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport on the national football academy before Christmas, but we are sure that it will come soon.</p><p>For years, visitors and commuters who use the trains in and out of Dundee have been baffled by how expensive it is. It is cheaper to buy a single ticket from Dundee to Perth and another from Perth to Glasgow than it is to buy a direct ticket. That is because Dundee falls outwith the subsidised zone, which is designed to boost local economies and encourage business. I ask the Deputy First Minister, as part of the strategy and at no cost, to liaise with ScotRail and Transport Scotland to consider whether Dundee can be included in the subsidised zone.</p><p>Last but by no means least, Dundee&#8217;s Labour group and I have jointly called for a high-level jobs task force for Dundee. The group, which should be chaired by a prominent local businessperson, would pull together all the initiatives and resources to make the case for jobs in Dundee to national and international companies. Dundee&#8217;s allocation of the cities strategy money could go towards levering in investment, either by bolstering our economic development department or seed funding for the jobs task force.

I will miss the commitment of my colleagues on the Education and Culture Committee to issues such as this.</p><p>In Dundee today, 708 looked-after children are in the local authority&#8217;s care. The average number of looked-after children in the care of local authorities across the country is 500, and there are 16,000 looked-after children in Scotland. Members will note that Dundee has well above the national average of children who are looked after by a local authority. The figure is proportionally even more above the national average when we consider that our council area has a small local authority population of 140,000 people, including 25,000 children.</p><p>When I was elected to the Parliament in May last year, 693 children were looked after in Dundee; 15 more children have been taken into care since then. There are no signs that the number will not continue to increase. I know that members across the chamber are sympathetic to the fact that we can talk about the statistics but, behind them, as Alison Johnstone clearly articulated, and behind each of the further 15 children who have been taken into care in Dundee, is a story of chaotic lives and empty bellies in the morning. The committee heard evidence of children who, if they leave for school in the morning, find dog faeces in the hall as they leave their homes. I know that all members in the chamber are alive to the tragedy that we are talking about.</p><p>The numbers of looked-after children in Dundee has led Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland to issue an appeal this morning for more foster carers in Dundee, because it thinks that the situation has reached crisis point. Barnardo&#8217;s highlighted the worrying fact that the number of children in care in Dundee has reached an all-time high. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the foster carers in Dundee, many of whom I know, for the time, commitment and love that they give to the children.

A new athletes village facility in Dundee will be a major boost to the city council&#8217;s bid for the national football academy. I therefore welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement this morning and thank her for it.</p><p>I turn to a darker side of the debate, which it is my responsibility to address in my new role in Labour&#8217;s justice team. It is something that I know that the Government will want to do early work to prevent&#8212;I refer to the risk that people will be trafficked to Scotland for the sex trade for the Commonwealth games. In an answer to a parliamentary question on 14 March, Kenny MacAskill reported to Parliament that, so far, no trafficking issues had been identified surrounding the Commonwealth games. However, Baroness Helena Kennedy states in her report on trafficking in Scotland, which was published just last month, that Scotland&#8217;s police service acknowledges that it lacks intelligence on human trafficking.</p><p>Baroness Kennedy argues that intelligence on human trafficking in Scotland is insufficient to uncover the true nature and extent of the problem. That means that the Scottish police admit that they are often unable to identify in houses that they raid women and children who have been trafficked for sex or domestic servitude. I therefore believe that, when the Cabinet Secretary for Justice gave his answer to Parliament in March, he was probably unaware of the risks that are out there.</p><p>In her report&#8212;which I recommend that all members read&#8212;Baroness Kennedy recommends that all first responders and relevant front-line professionals, who include paramedics and police officers, should undergo anti-trafficking training before the Commonwealth games. Such training has been provided&#8212;the minister gave an answer about that in the chamber earlier this year&#8212;to contractors that are involved in constructing the national sports arena. Will the minister work with the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy to commit to providing that training to all police officers, paramedics and perhaps other relevant staff whom she identifies who are working in greater Glasgow, given that construction has started and the issues are&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;all too alive?</p><p>Baroness Kennedy recommends resourcing a dedicated multi-agency law enforcement group to work together in greater co-operation with victims&#8217; groups to ensure prompt investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Scotland. Another step is to ensure that police services and victims&#8217; groups are fully resourced to overcome the lack of intelligence that has led to only one conviction for human trafficking ever having taken place in Scotland, compared with more than 150 such convictions in England.</p><p>Another of Baroness Kennedy&#8217;s recommendations is to raise awareness of human trafficking in Scotland among the public as well as in public services. No such initiative currently exists. As I explained, professionals who might come into contact with human trafficking are unlikely to recognise it. Against the backdrop of the 2014 games, an awareness-raising campaign could help the police and the public to identify victims of human trafficking more quickly and more successfully.</p><p>I recognise the work of the former MSP Trish Godman and of Glasgow City Council on the issue. I ask the minister to address when she sums up my request for anti-trafficking training for front-line staff, in the light of Baroness Kennedy&#8217;s findings. I pledge Labour members&#8217; support for doing everything that we can to assist the Government in preventing human trafficking for the Commonwealth games.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657777", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Delivery and Legacy)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Sandra White for invoking memories of the Glasgow garden festival.

As the economic downturn has unfolded it has become increasingly clear that Scotland&#8217;s youth are being hardest hit in the fight to find work, training or access to further education. I want to talk a bit about the structural problems of the economic downturn that are affecting the choices of the young people in those of our communities that are most decimated by unemployment, such as an increasingly competitive job market that keeps them shut out, and a further education system that will see fewer opportunities for them after the SNP has made its debilitating cuts to colleges.</p><p>In a recent study, Professor David Bell of the University of Stirling talks of a &#8220;trade-down&#8221; generation, with today&#8217;s graduates, who are faced with an increasingly difficult job market, taking on jobs in retail or services at minimum wage&#8212;jobs that would otherwise usually have been done by those who had not been to university. The burden of the economic squeeze has landed on the shoulders of young people who are on the first rung on the employability ladder. They have left school early without many qualifications or any work experience and have entered a job market where they are now competing for jobs against more highly qualified candidates&#8212;and they cannot compete. Little wonder, then, that unemployment among young people in Scotland is rising at a rate that is double that for 25 to 49-year-olds.</p><p>Traditionally, for those who have left school early and want to boost their employability, there has always been the option of studying or training at college, but demand for college places has soared and the Educational Institute of Scotland reports that college courses are increasingly difficult to find.

The rate of pupils staying on at school past the age of 16 has jumped from a relatively stable rate of between 77 and 79 per cent between 2000 and 2008 to 83 per cent last year&#8212;the highest figure on record.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Unemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am angry.

Without the confidence that Scotland as a developed nation is serious about reducing our emissions targets, there is little incentive for developing nations to address their demand for finite natural resources as they, too, seek to industrialise.</p><p>This year&#8217;s conference in Durban offers the opportunity for Scotland to showcase to the world what action it is taking to fulfil its ambitious commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 42 per cent by 2020.

Preliminary figures show that instead of having locked in emissions savings from 2009, emissions in Scotland rose again in 2010.

This year, however, that funding stands at just &#163;48 million. That means that more, not fewer, of Scotland&#8217;s homes will run inefficiently, adding significantly to energy demand and our carbon footprint.</p><p>Nearly 20 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s carbon emissions stem from transport, yet this Government has moved away from funding policies that will help to meet emissions targets and towards policies that actively undermine them.

I am just about to explain that. Many of the people who have lost their jobs provided essential backroom services. A situation has arisen in which those functions are now being performed by police officers who are ordinarily on the beat. Not only does that remove police from our streets, but it means that backroom functions cost more to perform&#8212;often thousands of pounds more, based on annual salary. Police officers who are paid &#163;30,000 a year and more doing jobs for which the salary is normally &#163;17,000 a year does not seem to be efficient or effective. Those back-office jobs are often complex and require significant skills, for which significant training of specialist staff is needed. The essential skills of those dedicated back-office staff are being wasted unnecessarily due to the SNP cuts. I believe that that is unacceptable and entirely avoidable.</p><p>There is serious concern about the SNP&#8217;s plans on police pay, too. Proposed changes to terms and conditions and police remuneration show that the Government is slashing pay at a time when living standards are dropping and the cost of living is continuing to rise. In one example, a 21-year-old member of staff at Tayside Police is having her shift allowance cut by a staggering 81 per cent, which translates into a 20 per cent cut in her overall pay. The minister might choose to ignore that point and chat while I am talking, but I do not think that the police officer would appreciate his ignoring her story. The total reduction in shift allowance that is paid to police staff across Scotland will be almost 30 per cent and the average reduction in pay for Scotland&#8217;s police force will be 6 per cent.</p><p>Coupled with increased pension contributions, a proposed two-year increment freeze, a reduction in overtime rates to time and a third, and a reduction in public holidays to four in each force, the cuts are set to impact profoundly on the ability of Scotland&#8217;s police to carry out their essential day-to-day duties, not to mention that the cuts will jeopardise the livelihoods of police staff and their families up and down the country.</p><p>However&#8212;I hope that the justice secretary will listen to this point&#8212;the Scottish Government has been offered costed alternatives to that course of action. Police staff and Unison have offered to reduce by one hour per week the time that is worked by every staff member, which would deliver the savings that the Government deems necessary&#8212;the exact savings that the Government wants to make. That way, the burden of cuts would be shared by all staff&#8212;not just shift workers, many of whom are women and are being unnecessarily targeted by the Government&#8217;s cuts. However, the proposal by Unison and police staff has been completely ignored by the SNP Government.

There is little doubt that inequality still mires our education system. From the early years through to university level and beyond, the socioeconomic status of our children is much more likely to determine their ambition and attainment at school, college, university and beyond. To propose that the situation is otherwise, as the motion unfortunately does in glossing over that important issue, is really to ignore the facts.</p><p>The gap in attainment between school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds and their more affluent peers cannot be overemphasised. The attainment of school leavers from the most deprived areas of Scotland is a staggering 65 per cent lower than the Scottish average and 137 per cent below that of the richest pupils in Scotland&#8212;this is today, in 2011, in our democratic and sophisticated country. Those figures are unacceptable.</p><p>Figures published just last week show that some children can be nearly 18 times more likely to attend university than those who live and are educated just seven minutes away. Everyone who read Paul Hutcheon&#8217;s report in the Sunday Herald would, I think, agree that it made for awful reading.</p><p>That postcode lottery is unacceptable and the achievement gap that it creates is worse now than it has ever been in the history of the Scottish Parliament. Indeed, that was brought home to me when I read the Sunday Herald article, which talked about many areas in Scotland, not least Glasgow, and highlighted the attainment levels in my home city of Dundee. It pointed out that at one secondary school in Dundee that is not far from where I live, the progression rate on to university has actually dropped since devolution in 1999. That is extremely worrying and I hope that the minister will address it when he sums up.</p><p>When college budgets are being slashed&#8212;some principals reckon that the spending review cut to college budgets is 40 per cent in real terms&#8212;it is difficult to imagine the attainment of those from the poorest backgrounds and their aspiration for further education and training improving any time soon. With one in five leaving school to join the dole queue, we must ask what impact cutting college budgets will have on our poorest children&#8217;s prospects of developing the essential skills and knowledge to be competitive in the jobs market.</p><p>Perhaps that is a rhetorical question because, for many of those students, college represents the first rung on the ladder of upward social mobility. When colleges remain local and well-staffed, with a comprehensive curriculum, students can reach levels of attainment and ambition that will make them more competitive in the jobs market or, indeed, qualify them for university if they were not able to progress to that from school.</p><p>With that in mind, the Scottish Government needs to give concrete guarantees that colleges will remain accessible to students from the poorest areas in terms of not just proximity and physical accessibility but resources and student hours, numbers and places. We have pressed the Government on all those topics this week; now it needs to give concrete guarantees on them, as the Minister for Children and Young People suggested, and stay true to what was suggested in the Scottish National Party&#8217;s manifesto in May. In committee and in the chamber this week, guarantees on those have been undermined and, to my mind, now cease to exist.</p><p>Much of the work to overcome the inequalities in our education system must focus on widening access. The Scottish Government must work to reduce barriers at each level of higher education in order to facilitate greater levels of attainment for people from non-traditional educational backgrounds. Its measures must go beyond statutory obligations on university admissions towards raising the ambitions and aspirations of people from non-traditional educational backgrounds. It must tackle drop-out rates and the reasons why they are so high in some communities and universities in Scotland and why more higher education students in Scotland than their United Kingdom peers drop out. Whether that is done through a package of incentives or a dedicated Government unit for Scottish mobility, more must be done.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to putting widening access on the statute book and Labour members look forward to the paper on that legislation and to working with the Government to ensure that we have the most robust widening access policy in Europe.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Raising Attainment and Ambition (Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A report that was published in the Sunday Herald last weekend, which has been referred to many times already in the debate, showed just how clear the link between attainment and poverty remains in the Scottish education system today.

With some 900,000 households struggling to meet their increasing fuel bills, the Scottish Government must do whatever it can within its powers to honour its obligation under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016. We have a long way to go to achieve that. Rising fuel prices, harsher winters and stagnating wages are undermining efforts to meet the 2016 target. As recent reports state that the cheapest dual-fuel price has&#8212;for the first time&#8212;risen above &#163;1,000 per annum, we face a huge challenge to stem the tide of those who are falling into fuel poverty in this country.</p><p>Fuel poverty affects us in Scotland uniquely. In Braemar in my constituency, heating a home takes 55 per cent more fuel than is needed to reach the same standard in Bristol. That is because we face colder, longer winters and because our households are more likely to be in rural locations, not to be connected to the main gas grid and to be harder to heat.

Circumstances are tough, but we have convened here today on the cusp of winter&#8212;as the clocks go back this weekend&#8212;in the knowledge that the Parliament can make a difference. As representatives of people across the country who worry about the impending winter, we have the responsibility to use the powers that are available to the Parliament to tackle fuel poverty to the best of our capability.</p><p>We have significant powers, not least in areas such as maximising energy efficiency. We have the ability to create policies that help the growing number of families, single occupants and elderly people who are vulnerable to fuel poverty. Too often, the Scottish Government has neglected its duty to tackle fuel poverty. It has used cross-legislative jurisdiction as an excuse and has overemphasised the powers that we do not have, rather than used the powers that we have.</p><p>I say to those who believe that we can tackle fuel poverty only through the exclusive right to regulate energy prices that they are wrong. Powers to regulate energy companies are reserved, but we can develop well-funded and well-targeted policies in the Parliament&#8217;s remit that work in tandem with Westminster to reduce fuel poverty. Ignoring that role and responsibility is a breach of our contract with the Scottish people.</p><p>In his speech to the Scottish National Party conference last weekend, the First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t control the energy markets but we can and will do something to help.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that he will be true to that pledge this winter. So far, campaigners have been disappointed to find that Mr Salmond has cut expenditure on tackling fuel poverty from &#163;70.9 million in 2010-11 to &#163;48 million in 2011-12. That is a reduction of almost a third, at a time when fuel poverty is worsening.</p><p>In answer to my question a couple of weeks ago about a Government underspend in last year&#8217;s fuel poverty budget, Alex Neil said that last year&#8217;s &#163;7 million underspend was being &#8220;recycled&#8221;. What does that mean? Is the money subsidising this year&#8217;s budget? Does it mean a further &#163;7 million cut in real terms on top of this year&#8217;s &#163;23 million cut? That would be a cut of &#163;30 million from the Government&#8217;s fuel poverty spending in the past couple of years, while the poorest households have suffered the harshest winters and some of the steepest energy price increases in living memory.</p><p>What could the Scottish Government do if it was not cutting the budget by &#163;30 million? Fuel poverty campaigners suggest incentivising installers to deliver insulation and energy efficiency schemes in very remote and rural areas. In the Western Isles, 58 per cent of households are fuel poor. In Orkney, the level is 44 per cent. Those figures are unacceptable, but not irreparable. By incentivising installers to travel to those areas, we can target resources efficiently for those who need them most.</p><p>Similarly, improvements could be made to widen access to resources for the most vulnerable by investing in the Scottish housing quality standard, which could be expanded not only to improve the performance of households in the social rented sector but to include the private rented sector in the scheme. That policy needs resources to work. In 2009, 62 per cent of dwellings failed the SHQS, and most failed on energy efficiency criteria.</p><p>For the rest of the United Kingdom, the Government has announced that privately rented properties are to meet minimum energy efficiency standards before they are allowed to be let. The Scottish Government has the power to implement a similar policy if it so chooses. Such schemes should be underpinned by proper incentives and regulation if they are to make a difference.</p><p>Those are just two initiatives in the campaign against fuel poverty. The continuing drive for consumers to maximise their fuel efficiency must be supported. Similarly, schemes that target harder-to-heat homes in communities in which homes are off the main gas grid would offer significant rewards when we are looking to reduce the overall levels of fuel poverty in Scotland. It is important to recognise that those opportunities are our opportunities in the Parliament. The prerogative rests with the Scottish Government to fully utilise the powers that it has to help the rising number of fuel poor in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653173", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, thank you.

That marks a distinct opportunity for member states and those within them who are closest to the fishing industry to take more control of the policy-making process. In light of that opportunity, the Scottish Government must work harder than ever with the industry, scientists, the UK Government and NGOs so that it can make a successful contribution to the achievement of the Commission&#8217;s targets.</p><p>There are still significant gaps in the Commission&#8217;s proposals that leave opportunity, if not responsibility, for the Scottish Government to act. For example, the delivery of long-term management plans through clear and specific targets for individual fisheries must be put in place, and the Scottish Government must work with stakeholders to achieve that.</p><p>Similarly, the Scottish Government must commit fully to multi-annual plans, in terms of resources and its efforts to engage. Our scientists must have the necessary resources to contribute fully to a more regionalised CFP, where good governance ought to be synonymous with good science. Too often we have seen quotas prescribed not on the advice of scientific bodies, but on the basis of political considerations. The Government must work hard to promote the role of science in the consideration of fishing rights allocation, because only then can we begin to meaningfully restore our fishing stocks. Scientists have made it clear that significant steps still need to be taken to monitor the state of our fisheries, and without the means to do so we risk losing the opportunity to focus our efforts efficiently on ecological sustainability and thus a healthy fishing industry.</p><p>In that process, the Scottish Government must listen to the concerns of fishermen, industry experts and NGOs in order to tackle fundamental problems such as overcapacity and discards. They all have a valuable contribution to make on the best way to tackle those issues. For example, like many stakeholders, I am concerned that the practice of commercialising would-be discards will bring unique challenges to Scottish fisheries. The Government must continue with the work of the Scottish conservation credits scheme to focus on avoiding the capture of unwanted fish in the first place rather than on creating a market for them. Mechanisms such as real-time closures, the use of CCTV, and gear specifications have been widely recognised as successful in combating discards, and I urge the Scottish Government to continue working with stakeholders to develop similar mechanisms that will help to eliminate discards by 2016.</p><p>The Commission has been bold in its proposals to reform the CFP in a way that makes it more sustainable. However, it has also placed the ball in our court and put significant onus on member states and related stakeholders to achieve that goal.

However, as energy efficiency and fuel poverty budgets were cut by a third last year, the UK committee has indicated from provisional data that Scotland will have missed its first annual emissions reduction target for 2010. The 2009 act cannot remain a fanciful wish list&#8212;it needs actions to make it a reality.</p><p>The opportunities to tackle climate change lie primarily in the areas of housing and transport, but too many Government proposals on those issues are exactly that&#8212;just proposals. A commitment to real policies on issues such as home efficiency and road traffic demand is crucial if we are to reverse the negative social consequences that are intrinsically linked to climate change around the globe.</p><p>I turn to the early years, and particularly childcare in Scotland. I welcome the proposed children&#8217;s services bill and look forward to the detail of the rights of children and young people bill. Families throughout Scotland are struggling to make ends meet. They are juggling rising living costs with falling earnings or wage freezes, and many are forced to make choices that seem like no choice at all, often between heating and eating. I do not make that point lightly. This morning, I signed the Save the Children petition that calls on the UK and Scottish Governments to act now to give more support on childcare costs for hard-pressed families in Scotland. The finding of Save the Children&#8217;s recent survey laid bare the difficulties that our poorest families face.</p><p>To make work pay and to address child poverty, childcare must be more affordable. Childcare costs in this country are among the highest in the UK. Parents are leaving work and turning down jobs because they cannot afford childcare. A third of low-income families are in debt because of those costs. That makes stark reading, so the Scottish Government must make tackling the issue a priority. Only last year, in Dundee&#8217;s Hilltown, three out-of-school care clubs were closed because of the Government&#8217;s policy of slashing ring fencing. There was no money left in the council budget to keep those out-of-school care clubs open. We had young mothers on the phone saying that they had to give up their jobs because they could not afford private provision. We must take the issue seriously if we are to get people back into jobs.

The deficit between what this Government promises and what it delivers is increasing and it looks as though it will continue to grow. Take the Government&#8217;s policy of no compulsory redundancies. Only this morning, Alex Neil on &#8220;Good Morning Scotland&#8221; repeated the Government&#8217;s commitment to the policy. He said:</p><p>&#8220;the security of employment is absolutely essential in a civilised society and one where you do not want to destabilise families or individuals by the continual threat of unemployment.

They include teachers, lecturers, council workers and police staff&#8212;the list goes on.

We need action to meet our ambitious climate change targets and to bring into force measures to tackle alcohol abuse for which the Parliament has already legislated.

That is very good of him, but it is not good enough to match his manifesto commitments to college staff.</p><p>The Government was not elected to wish, to advise or to think things useful; it was elected to make things happen. At what point will the minister stop wishing for better connectivity? There is no genie here to make those wishes come true. Only policy with commitment to pass legislation and make suitable investment and a sound framework will deliver the Government&#8217;s commitments on connecting rural Scotland to broadband.</p><p>Wishes are not good enough because connection to the internet can no longer be a luxury for the rich. Such are its advantages today that people who do not have good connection become more financially excluded. PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated that getting 4 million socially deprived people across the UK on to broadband would contribute &#163;22 billion to the UK economy through increased education and employment.</p><p>We can see it in the college sector as well. Many of the recent cuts in colleges have seen a move towards delivering courses through ICT and distance learning. However, the change in capital spending rules that means that ICT can no longer be purchased from the capital budget but must come from the revenue budget, which has been cut by 10.4 per cent by this Government, means that reliance on ICT is more of a challenge. Poor connectivity exacerbates that challenge, and distance learning is a vital education service. Of course, in rural areas with a lack of access, it is much more important.</p><p>In everyday life, the best deals for insurance, travel, clothes, household items and books are most regularly now found online. The average family, which includes rural families throughout the country, misses out on savings of &#163;560 a year if it does not use the internet. It was only last week that I discovered that I could save &#163;200 on my car insurance online&#8212;the insurers have clearly not seen me drive. Such savings should be available to all, especially at a time when families are feeling the pressure of increased utility bills, the price of fuel&#8212;which is more of a problem for people in rural communities&#8212;and the increased price of food.</p><p>I understand why the focus of the Government&#8217;s policy is to rely on private sector investment in financially constrained times&#8212;there is clearly a financial incentive for the private companies to deliver broadband services&#8212;but there must be back-up. Patchy service delivery is not limited to rural communities. In my home city of Dundee, the fibrecity project has collapsed. More than one Dundee household in three was said to have signed up for the network and work was initially expected to start in summer 2009 and be completed within two years. However, work started only last summer and, within weeks, Fibrecity Holdings temporarily halted it, 52 staff lost their jobs and nothing has happened since to put the cables in for the network.</p><p>The UK Government has committed only &#163;830 million of public funding to superfast broadband until 2017. We can compare that with much greater sums in other advanced nations. For example, the French Government has already spent &#163;1.7 billion and has committed another &#163;570 million per year until 2025. With the cost estimate for deploying fibre networks to every UK household ranging from &#163;5 billion to &#163;28 billion, the UK Government&#8217;s commitment looks woefully inadequate.</p><p>The Scottish National Party announced a &#163;50 million investment for the Scottish futures fund that aims to deliver superfast broadband in rural areas. However, we have only to look at Cornwall&#8212;which has a population 10 times smaller and a geographical area 20 times smaller than Scotland and where &#163;132 million has been invested in high-speed broadband&#8212;to see that the &#163;50 million investment by the Scottish Government falls far short of what is needed.</p><p>The Government needs to stop wishing and bring all the players together to make things happen.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Connectivity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was intrigued by the minister&#8217;s choice of verb in the motion.

The bill fails to draw the line.</p><p>That failure throws up two issues. The first is that by failing to define those crimes properly, the Parliament is handing the power to define sectarian crime to the courts. Nobody would really envy the procurator fiscal who is charged with marking the first of these cases in late July or August, nor the procurator fiscal who prosecutes the case and the sheriff who hears it come September. There is wide scope for judicial interpretation. That is the courts&#8217; job, but by leaving the lawyers such latitude for interpretation Parliament has surrendered a lot of its democratically elected mandate to pass good, clear, thorough and workable legislation and handed it over to the courts and the Crown.</p><p>The second issue is that the law will not be clearly understood by the public.

I stress that no one on the Labour benches wants to see compulsory redundancies. However, I put it to the cabinet secretary that further education colleges are struggling to make savings of more than 10 per cent and that in many colleges compulsory redundancies remain on the table. I also put it to the cabinet secretary that he cannot expect&#8212;I do not think that he ever did&#8212;colleges to be able to make savings of more than 10 per cent without any redundancies.</p><p>The whole line about no compulsory redundancies in the further education sector is a public relations exercise by the Government, leaving college principals and boards to clean up the mess.</p><p>In real terms, Dundee College has experienced a budget cut of 10.4 per cent, which is the equivalent of &#163;1 million of savings, or 100 lecturers&#8217; posts at the college. I ask the cabinet secretary how a college can go about achieving cuts of &#163;1 million without cutting the staff jobs. How can a college manage voluntary redundancies to that extent without seriously damaging its operation and effectiveness? How can it maintain the number of student places, which is one of the Government&#8217;s conditions in relation to the budget reductions? What if every member of staff teaching the most popular course in an oversubscribed department applies for voluntary redundancy? These are headline policies with no planning for or afterthought given to the outcome.</p><p>Why attack colleges during a time of economic hardship? Are they not where young people learn skills for the job market? Do they not provide crucial vocational courses that train people for the workplace and provide the extra qualification that people need to get the job that they want? Is that not the most foolish place to make cuts to such an extent during a recession?</p><p>Nearly half of all college students are over 25 years of age. They have gone back into education and training seriously, after giving good consideration to their future, and they stick at it: the drop-out rate for colleges in Scotland is far below that of our universities.</p><p>Dundee College has seen applications rise by 50 per cent on last year, and has received 16,500 applicants for 5,000 places. Much of that increase has to be attributable to the economy&#8212;the lack of available jobs and opportunities&#8212;but those 16,500 people in Dundee are serious about training for work. They have made the conscious decision to go back to college, to study and train and to give themselves a leg-up into the job market, but the Scottish Government has cut that critical training by no less than &#163;1 million in Dundee alone.</p><p>The cabinet secretary will be interested to know that the hairdressing course is oversubscribed tenfold in Dundee. There are more than 1,000 applicants for 128 places. I understand that he has been known to scoff at hairdressing courses, but let me tell the Government that there is always work for hairdressers. A haircut is one of the little luxuries that are not greatly affected by the economic downturn, and we rarely hear of hairdressers going bust. They are skilled businesspeople, and they are entrepreneurs. They can travel with their trade, they can work flexibly, they can work from home, and they can work around childcare commitments. They can go into industry, fashion, television and film. The number of applicants in Dundee speaks for itself. People who apply to college have a closer eye on the job market than we might presume, and they know where the money is and where the jobs are.</p><p>A constituent&#8212;a young man&#8212;whom I spoke to during the election campaign had received a letter that morning to say that his music course at Dundee College had been cut and that he was not to return to college in August to complete it. He is a friend of Dundee band The View, whose members studied on Dundee College&#8217;s music course before going on to great commercial success. At this juncture, I should advise the chamber that I have not been wearing the same dress for four days now&#8212;indeed, it was clean on this morning. For the uninitiated on the front benches, that was a reference to one of The View&#8217;s hit singles.</p><p>Dundee College has rationalised its cuts in music because there was good provision in Perth.

My friend and I had taken an afternoon out of a trip to London to visit the House of Commons for the first time. We were lucky enough to witness a little bit of Scottish history.</p><p>I never met Donald Dewar, but I know that it was always his intention&#8212;and the intention of everyone who campaigned for and framed the Scotland Act&#8212;that this building would be a living, breathing and working place to make Scotland better, to serve the Scottish people, to better their lives, and to give voice to those without one. That is what brings me to this Parliament today. For many Scots, despite their living in one of the most prosperous countries in the world, opportunities are still not theirs. Material poverty, poverty of aspiration, isolation, dependence, addiction and separation from the world are still the daily reality for many Scots. It is our job in this Parliament to create the climate in which people can learn, live, dream and work their way to a better future.</p><p>Employment is the fabric of our society. The dignity of work is undisputable. In my home city of Dundee, 24 per cent of adults are economically inactive. Most of them want to work. The First Minister talked last week of an ambitious Scotland. Our first, driving and ultimate ambition should be work for every Scot, and I pledge today to commit my term in this Parliament to working towards that ambition. It is worth every day of those five years.</p><p>For Dundee, we should have no greater priority. Job creation and the encouragement of private investment should be at the core of the Government&#8217;s term in office and I will press the Government at every opportunity for jobs for my home city and the north-east. We must realise the opportunities in the north-east of the renewables technologies market, combining the wealth of oil and gas expertise and higher education. Scotland should lead the world in that field, not just in the theory but in the application. I will hold the Government to account on its promise of jobs in renewables and will assist in every way that I can to make those jobs happen. Good-quality, skilled jobs in their home towns should be a realistic aspiration for every teenager leaving school. They strengthen families, communities and our country as a whole.</p><p>Every Dundonian in the chamber and every adopted citizen of my home town will know what I am talking about when I describe the shiver that goes up my spine as the north-bound train turns slowly from Wormit on to the bridge, pacing its way over the silvery Tay to Dundee. The former rector of the University of Dundee, Stephen Fry, said:</p><p>&#8220;Dundee&#8217;s setting is ... about as ideal&#8212;ludicrously ideal&#8212;as any city setting could be.&#8221;</p><p>That is why the plans to bring Kengo Kuma&#8217;s stunning design for the Victoria and Albert museum to Dundee are exciting beyond all expectations. They herald a new era for Dundee, which is taking shape along its waterfront. I know that the SNP shares my enthusiasm for those plans, and I presume that the Government has now decided to meet its full &#163;15 million commitment to that project. After all, it will be &#8220;part of better&#8221; and excuses will not wash on that one.</p><p>Neither will excuses wash while the blame game between the Scottish Government and local councils continues and out-of-school care clubs for our most vulnerable communities in Dundee close down, the number of teachers is slashed, there are no jobs for newly qualified teachers and bus routes are pulled. The councils blame the funding gap left by the Scottish Government; the Government blames the decisions of local authorities and washes its hands of such matters. SNP members have a cheek to suggest that the council tax freeze is fully funded, and they know it. We will look for a better settlement with the local authorities next time round&#8212;no excuses. We want to make things better, too.</p><p>I thank those Labour Party leaders in Dundee who have inspired me since I joined the party in Dundee&#8217;s Caird hall 18 years ago. They have lived the values of social justice and opportunity and have given years of public service to the city. I am thinking of Marlyn Glen, Jim McGovern, Ernie Ross, John McAllion, Iain Luke, the late Peter Court and John Henderson. Their commitment, principles and counsel come with me to Parliament today and will stay with me during my time here.</p><p>I do not see a tide of nationalism sweeping this country; I see that the SNP made a better case to govern than we did, and that is our challenge for the future.
