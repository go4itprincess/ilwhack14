I guess that if there is any good news to be found in the food bank agenda it is the fact that some people are being given the opportunity to gain skills through their work with organisations such as the Cyrenians and other social enterprises that facilitate food banks. Although there is a lot about food banks that angers us a great deal, the work that those people do helps them to regain access to the labour market.</p><p>The Citizens Advice Scotland report that feeds its briefing for today&#8217;s debate mentions payday loans, and it would be remiss of me not to recognise the degree to which payday loans increasingly force people to turn to food banks for help. I very much like the reference in Stuart McMillan&#8217;s motion to people who are unemployed, underemployed and underpaid all being reliant on food banks. I think that that gives us a broad picture of the groups of people who rely on them.</p><p>Whenever I talk about payday loans, I try to make the point that it is wrong to assume that people who go to payday loan companies are necessarily vulnerable. The statistics tell us that a large number of people who use those companies own their own homes, are in full-time work and have families, cars and all the rest of it. They also tend to have too much month left at the end of the money, which is what forces them to go to payday loan companies and food banks for help.</p><p>I want to talk specifically about a very vulnerable group of people in Edinburgh&#8212;people in temporary accommodation&#8212;who are heavily reliant on food banks and have an increasing propensity to use them because of difficult circumstances. There is huge demand for affordable housing that cannot be met in Edinburgh, where it is quite possible for people to live temporarily in flats or bed-and-breakfast accommodation for three months or, in some cases, for up to six months. The problem is that someone who lives in a hostel or a B and B has no access whatsoever to kitchen facilities, although they might be lucky, as some B and Bs in Edinburgh give people access to a kettle. However, if they go to a food bank for a food parcel, there is a massive reduction in the types of items that they can take.</p><p>In an article in The Guardian a few weeks ago, Patrick Wintour talked about a food bank within a food bank and the notion of a kettle box, with food banks having to make up bags of food whose preparation requires no electricity or heat. Food banks are having to accept that a kettle box of food, which is made up of dry crackers and biscuits, tinned sweetcorn and tinned potatoes, for example, will not remotely meet nutritional standards. There is no chance of such food meeting daily nutritional requirements, never mind meeting the needs of people who live off it for six months. I want to emphasise that&#8212;I expected to speak further down the speakers&#8217; list, so that I could add to what other speakers said.</p><p>We must be careful not to promote certain activities by the way in which we provide public services through our local authorities. The City of Edinburgh Council, for example, meets the full cost per night for hostels and B and Bs in the city. I challenge it to ask what it gets in return for the &#163;45 per head that it pays out, regardless of whether a room is filled. At the moment, those hostels and B and Bs get &#163;45 a night to provide no kitchen facilities and only the possibility of access to a kettle so that people can feed themselves.</p><p>As much as we share our rage today about the propensity for people to have to rely on food banks, we need to ask some hard questions about what our local authorities are doing and the degree to which we can help them to stop things such as kettle boxes becoming an ever bigger part of our food bank problem.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22883964", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Banks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Stuart McMillan on securing the debate and I associate myself with his comments about all the volunteers who make our food banks run week in, week out.

I see that the other co-convener, John Finnie, is also in the chamber. I hope that he will contribute to the debate. The next meeting of the cross-party group is about legal highs, so if members find that they are stimulated by this debate, they can come along and continue the debate there. We are crying out for members, and the group&#8217;s future relies on MSPs engaging in the issues. I worry, sometimes, that we do not talk enough about drug and alcohol policy.</p><p>I was struck by what Graeme Dey said about the number of head shops in Arbroath. The problems he has with prevalence of the shops in Arbroath strikes me as being similar to the arguments that we have around payday loan shops, in relation to the degree to which we can control the types of retail premises that open up on our high streets and what planning and licensing powers we have to allow us to curtail the types of shops that we do not like. I think that there is probably a wider conversation to be had about the role of planning and licensing in addressing some of the problems that we face in relation to town centre regeneration.</p><p>However, I say to Graeme Dey that evidence from the Scottish Drugs Forum suggests that the vast majority of legal highs are bought online. Head shops tend to be where people buy their first legal high, but once they have tried it once or twice, they buy online because, to be quite frank, that is where the better deals are. SDF also tells us that buying online encourages bulk purchasing, which brings into play a problem that has not been talked about today, which is the degree to which online purchasing leads to people who take legal highs becoming dealers themselves. They buy in bulk and sell what they have bought to their mates, with a 20 per cent levy, which means that they can consume what they want to consume for free, because they have profited from their friends. We need to understand the degree to which online sales promote that culture, and we need to understand how we will address that as part of our criminal justice response and the public health response that we need to develop.</p><p>I was really pleased to hear Roseanna Cunningham mention the know the score campaign and the further advertising that is in the pipeline. Has she considered doing more social-media targeted advertising? What do I mean by that? It is great that we have had a really good know the score website for a long time, but it relies on people going to it for the information that they are looking for.</p><p>Technological advances mean that we can now put adverts in front of people who visit certain websites. The technology exists that allows us to know who has visited legal high websites and, when they next log into their Facebook, Twitter or other social network account, to put in front of them adverts that warn them against using legal highs, or which at least give them the information that they need to take the drugs safely. I encourage the minister to look at the degree to which her social advertising budget is being targeted at people who we know are consuming legal highs regularly.</p><p>Who are those people? We know from the SDF that they are a varied group. Some of them would not consider taking illegal drugs but, broadly, the people who take legal highs are ambivalent about the substances&#8217; status in society&#8212;they will take the legal highs regardless of that. The people are also ambivalent about what they are taking.</p><p>The SDF tells us that many people who take legal highs do so regularly and never face any problems in taking them. I mention that because it is important to remember that a lot of people are consuming legal highs without appreciating some of the side effects that we are talking about. In a sense, the market regulates itself. If a product is bad, people stop taking it and it works itself out of the market. The SDF was keen for those points to be made in the debate.</p><p>Throughout the debate, I have heard many people say that we should not use the term &#8220;legal highs&#8221;, because that suggests that the substances are safe. However, there are plenty of legal things that are not safe, including alcohol and tobacco. That is not a petulant point; we need to be careful about the language that we use in the drugs debate. If we as policy makers and legislators do not talk the language of the people who use the drugs, we will be even further removed from them when we consider the public policy solutions. I am comfortable with the term &#8220;legal high&#8221;, because that is what the people on the streets, in nightclubs and at home&#8212;wherever they use legal highs&#8212;call them.</p><p>That brings me on to how we monitor use of legal highs. As much as local responses are critical to addressing the issue appropriately, I encourage the minister to consider that we need consistency from one alcohol and drug partnership to the next, so that we have a national picture that we can rely on.</p><p>In my final minute, I will put an idea to the minister. Previously, when people took pills&#8212;legal or otherwise&#8212;in Edinburgh, they used to be able to hand in one of those pills to Crew 2000 on Cockburn Street, which would pass it to the police. The police would pass it to the Scottish Police Services Authority, which would test it. A poster would then be put in Crew&#8217;s window to warn people about the drug and let them know what they were taking. That was public health messaging in practice. However, that work is no longer done because of cuts in the Scottish Police Authority.</p><p>Is there scope for the minister to consider working with universities? Perhaps universities in the city of Edinburgh could set up a social enterprise to work together with Crew 2000 to allow drugs that are being taken on the streets to be safely handed over to the authorities for assessment. Posters could then be put in Crew&#8217;s windows, so that young people and others who are consuming legal highs are better informed about what they are taking and can make the choices that they want to make about the drugs that they consume</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22884031", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Psychoactive Substances"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Drugs policy is very much on my mind at the moment, not least because I am halfway through season 3 of &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;, which I am sure that many members are currently enjoying.

I live in the Edinburgh Eastern constituency, not far from Portobello high school, and members will know that the private bill process explicitly excludes members who represent the area that is affected by a bill from the bill committee process. When I discovered that, I was anxious that I would not be able to convey to the committee just how important the issue is to the community. However, the committee has done the Parliament proud, producing a comprehensive and fair report, which criticises the process in places but ultimately recommends that the Parliament accept the need for the bill. The committee has served with the utmost diligence and professionalism and deserves credit for that.</p><p>I will open and close the debate for Labour. In my opening speech I will describe the urgent need for a new school, and in closing I will seek to address, with the facts, the arguments against having a school on the park.</p><p>I welcome all the people in the gallery who have found the time to attend the debate. Their number is big, but they represent a tiny fraction of the number of people who have been actively engaged in the issue for years. In particular, I welcome my colleague Councillor Maureen Child and pay tribute to her for all the work that she has done for years in considering the issues, working with the council and shoulder to shoulder with the community, which has been waiting for a new school for far too long.</p><p>I also pay tribute to Peigi Macarthur and her team for their outstanding leadership of a wonderful school at the heart of a community that is pounding with life, culture, sport and opportunity. I worry that in the decade-long battle for a new school the considerable merits and achievements of the current school and its pupils have been almost overlooked.</p><p>I want to highlight the work of Portobello for a new school and the parent council. PFANS is a group of people who are dedicated to securing a new school. In progressing the case for the school, the group has enhanced the community itself, building a forum for regular debate about not just the school but wider issues. Its Facebook page has nearly 2,600 members&#8212;a sizeable chunk of the community is online and engaged with issues to do with the school&#8217;s future and the community, demonstrating what can be achieved when people come together to work for the common good of a community about which they care so passionately.</p><p>Why do those people care so much? It is 2,596 days since the plans to build a new Portobello high school were approved by the council. Children in the feeder primary schools were asked to give the designers and architects their vision for a new school when they were in primary 2. Those very pupils are now in their fourth year at high school.</p><p>Jessie, who was in primary 2 at Towerbank primary school when the new high school was first promised, will likely sit the new national qualifications and her highers in the current building. I asked Jessie to show me round the school, which she did brilliantly. For her, the most pressing issue is the state of the stairwells. There are 1,450 pupils in a column-stack of a school, and when the bell goes at the end of class they all have to fire into the tiny stairwells to move from one floor to another, often getting crushed under incredible pressure. The problem is so big that it drives the timetabling of classes. The timetabling ensures that pupils do not have to go from the top floor to the bottom for their next class, whatever the subject, because of the logistics of getting kids round the school. That is ridiculous.</p><p>There are temporary buildings, which have been there for years, where the kids are taught maths and technology. The assembly hall roof blew off in strong winds and the school had to be closed for a day, not because that had made the school dangerous but because it simply would not be possible to get kids from one part of the school to the other, because space is so cramped.

Early in my tenure as an MSP for Lothian, I organised a public meeting specifically on the issue in Portobello town hall. Two hundred and fifty people came&#8212;so many that we had to open the upstairs part of the hall and sit people there, where there were not the tables, maps and materials that we were using to try to work our way through the arguments.</p><p>I invited Andy Wightman to speak and he came and talked to the community about the history of common good, what it meant and what it was for in an informative, engaging and enlightening way. After that, people at the public meeting sat round tables with giant maps and cut-out versions of the school and tried to work out where else in Portobello the school could go. Where could it possibly go on the map if it was not going to be in the park? The answer was that despite the 17 different options that we had, the park was the only credible option for the new school. The few alternatives that were available would have resulted in a school on a compromise site and would have taken far longer to deliver, at a much higher cost&#8212;money that would have been taken away from other schools in the City of Edinburgh Council area. The park clearly is the best site for the school. We took that very clear message from the public meeting of 250 people that night.</p><p>Common good by its very nature exists for the benefit of the community and the bill is in the best interests of the community. It is important to note that there will be no change to the status of common good land. The park itself will continue to be common good, but common good for the purposes of education. The neighbouring Portobello golf course, which was recently granted diamond jubilee park status, is protected in perpetuity for the purposes of public recreation.</p><p>I thank Fiona McLeod for highlighting the sections of the report that address the question of precedent&#8212;paragraphs 68 to 70&#8212;which are worth highlighting in detail.

Paragraph 69 says:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee is also of the view that, in narrow legal terms, this Private Bill by definition cannot set a precedent as it only makes specific application of law in these defined circumstances and does not itself change the general area of law.&#8221;</p><p>That is so clear in the report that it should allay anybody&#8217;s concerns.</p><p>&#8220;The Committee is, therefore, content that any such precedent effect is not closely enough linked to what the Bill actually does for it to constitute a valid reason why the Bill should not proceed to the next Stage.&#8221;</p><p>As I said, it is so clear.</p><p>I thank Alison Johnstone for raising the issue of green space. I recognise that all political parties support the school on the park. However, she was right to highlight the issue of green space. There are 74 hectares of green space in the Portobello area. We will lose 0.4 hectares when we build the school.

Fiona Hyslop, as then Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, ended that pilot.

In 2007, the SNP promised to extend free school meals to all primary 1 pupils and two and three-year-olds. Fiona Hyslop ran a pilot to extend the scheme, but it was not rolled out. Interest in free school meals disappeared when Mike Russell became the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning. In fact, he is so uninterested in free school meals that, in answer to Drew Smith, the Scottish Government revealed to us that, from 2010 it no longer collated data on school meals.</p><p>Radio silence on school meals followed for three years until Nick Clegg stood up at his party conference and announced that the UK Government would introduce free school meals for children in primaries 1 to 3. When the white paper was published, the SNP told us that childcare is its number 1 priority. We took its childcare policy seriously and looked to examine the detail. The detail of how the SNP got to the cost of its policy was not made available and still remains elusive. However, working with the Scottish Parliament information centre, we got to a figure of &#163;100&#160;million a year to implement phase 1 of the white paper&#8217;s plan.

We decided to lodge the amendments&#8212;they are in Neil Bibby&#8217;s name&#8212;despite our believing that free school meals are a good thing. Why? It was because there is not enough evidence to demonstrate that free school meals will increase educational attainment, to show that the policy will get women into work or that hundreds of thousands of children will be lifted out of poverty. Increased childcare would do that.</p><p>We know that free school meals will not lift children out of poverty because the Scottish Government&#8217;s evaluation of its pilot tells us that. That evaluation showed only a 4.4 per cent increase in uptake of free school meals among the poorest children; the vast majority of the uptake was among kids from better off families.

The First Minister might like to acknowledge that such an approach is provided for in amendment 86 to the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, which was lodged by Neil Bibby and will be debated at stage 2. I look forward to the Scottish Government agreeing to the amendment; Neil Bibby did that work before Christmas.</p><p>I have no doubt that the Government has moved on childcare because of the pressure that Labour members have put on it. Malcolm Chisholm made that point well. Why do I think that? As Neil Bibby said, all we have been told since the white paper&#8217;s launch six weeks ago has been that we need independence if we are to deliver on childcare at all. Incidentally, the First Minister was right. The white paper includes a reference to free school meals; it is just a shame that he did not read out what it says. It says:</p><p>&#8220;Alongside our priorities for immediate improvements we also plan to maintain access to passported benefits, such as free school meals. This will support 130,000 children in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>That is a commitment to maintain current levels of free school meals, not a commitment to extend provision. One hundred and thirty thousand is exactly the number of children in Scotland who are currently in receipt of free school meals.</p><p>The white paper said that independence is needed if we are to deliver on childcare, but it has been proved that that is not the case. The white paper said that 20 per cent of kids, and no more, will get free school meals, but today the paper&#8217;s authors go much further. It appears that we can have free school meals under devolution, but not under independence. It looks as if the white paper was just for Christmas, but members should not worry, another historic moment is just around the corner.</p><p>Members should forgive me for being cynical about the SNP&#8217;s change of heart. Why have all these announcements been made today? It&#8217;s the polls, stupid. The SNP and the yes campaign have a problem with women, so it was decided that childcare must be the number 1 priority&#8212;until, of course, the message did not work. At the weekend, a YouGov poll told Alex Salmond that 64 per cent of Scots want him to act on childcare now, so he acted. There is a clear message: if we want the Scottish Government to do something, we should commission a poll to prove that it is needed. If we prove that it is in the Government&#8217;s interests&#8212;not ours&#8212;to act, it will happen.</p><p>We support free school meals, but in the light of the hard choices and the money that is available, we think that the First Minister could significantly have enhanced women&#8217;s lives. He could have got women into work, lifted children out of poverty and made our country better by providing childcare for 50 per cent of two-year-olds.

She is an incredible woman who has published several books and is highly intelligent and dignified. She went back to Rwanda and had a very successful career, but then things started to change in Rwanda. She faced horrific systematic abuse and had to flee the country and come back to the United Kingdom. She has lived in London for 12 years now without recourse to public funds.

It is important to recognise the changing nature of personal debt in Scotland and the degree to which it is becoming a bigger and bigger problem.</p><p>Payday loan companies have been booming only since 2008 and it was in 2012 that they reached a &#163;2.2 billion share of the UK economy, with 8 million payday loans being issued that year. That poses new challenges for the bankruptcy and debt advice landscape, because people find themselves spiralling into debt at a far faster rate than previously, and the debt is created over smaller amounts of money, as was mentioned in last week&#8217;s debate. The fact is that &#163;5,000 borrowed from a payday loan company is far more significant than &#163;5,000 borrowed in the form of a personal loan. We need to understand the role that differing interest rates play in that process.</p><p>I welcomed the Government&#8217;s changes to the debt arrangement scheme earlier this year, because I had been campaigning for them alongside the Govan Law Centre. Those changes were important because it used to take three months for people who applied to the debt arrangement scheme to get on it and, during that application period, their debt continued to accrue interest. If they had borrowed from Wonga, their debt would still be subject to a monthly interest rate at horrific annual percentage rates. The step that the minister took to freeze interest rates at the moment that a person applies for a debt arrangement scheme was very important and has made a considerable difference to the lives of people who have that type of debt.</p><p>Given that the minister was so willing to listen to campaigners earlier this year, I had high expectations for the bill and I thought that he would come forward with some more progressive ways and means of taking on payday loan companies. I am afraid that I was disappointed to read the detail of the bill and I will go into three aspects of that.</p><p>We have already touched on the issues around discharge moving to a 48-month period and I want to try to address some of them. I am afraid that the minister is wrong: there is a distinct difference between an individual voluntary agreement and a statutory bankruptcy process; they are not the same thing. I ask the minister to find a comparable situation in the UK where a bankruptcy measure exists for more than three years. Jenny Marra is right when she says that it is the longest such period anywhere in the UK, yet the minister dances on the head of a pin to deny that.</p><p>I am keen to look at who supports the minister&#8217;s position. The evidence shows that not many significant organisations support him; in fact, a broad range of opposition, from Lloyds Bank to StepChange Debt Charity, opposes his position on the four-year issue. Uniquely, he has managed to get the Consumer Finance Association, Citizens Advice Scotland and Money Advice Scotland on the same page in their opposition.

First, we heard new evidence from StepChange that to move from three to four years could increase the default rate by 15 per cent. Far from getting more money paid back into the system, the mechanism of going from three to four years could lead to more people defaulting and less money going back into the system. That is quite a compelling argument.</p><p>The second point is about supporters of the Government&#8217;s position on the issue. I find myself sitting against my credit union colleagues on the issue, because the Association of British Credit Unions Ltd Scotland supports what the Government is doing. I will address why I think that that is. I am a proud member of a credit union and a critical part of our debtbusters campaign is the promotion of credit unions, but I think that their support for the Government on this issue is led by the fact that, very often, they are at the end of the queue in the debtor process. They do not have preferred creditor status, so they are at the end of the queue when people pay back their debts. Further to that, they charge much lower interest rates, so they need people to pay back over a longer period to recoup the cost of lending. In that sense, it is no real surprise that credit unions support the Government&#8217;s position.</p><p>The other issue that I raise in regard to that is that credit unions constitute only 0.5 per cent of all debts held in bankruptcy. Although I support credit unions and I understand the minister&#8217;s point, he is making a change to the system that does not reflect 99.5 per cent of the debtors estate.

However, I very much welcome the action that he is taking, and I ask him to think about what will happen after Christmas, because the campaign should not be just for Christmas.

One in three people in Scotland cannot afford to save and one in five has no savings at all. The payday loan industry was worth &#163;2.2&#160;billion to the UK in 2012; 8&#160;million loans were made in that year alone. We know that the most common use of payday loans is to pay for food, closely followed by fuel&#8212;gas and electricity bills.</p><p>The roll call of statistics is endless, but I specifically want to tell Parliament about one of my constituents, called James. James took out a &#163;200 loan to buy some extra Christmas presents in the run up to Christmas a few years ago. When January came and the pay cheque was late, he could not keep up with that loan, so he took out a bigger loan to pay the first one off. When the payments for the second loan got too difficult, he went to another payday loan company and took out another loan. Before he knew it, he was &#163;5,000 in debt to five different companies. Members might think that &#163;5,000 is not a great deal of money&#8212;plenty of people have &#163;5,000 car loans or carry that amount of credit on their credit cards&#8212;but the problem was that by the time James got to &#163;5,000, every single penny of his wages was going on payday loan debt.</p><p>That is because payday loan companies use something called a continuous payment authority, which is basically a computer programme that can check a person&#8217;s bank account every five minutes to see whether there is money in it. That is what people sign up to when they take money from Wonga. Every five minutes, it can test their account to see whether they have money there, and if they have been paid it will take their wages. It will take their money before their rent goes out, before electricity bills or council tax bills go out&#8212;it might even take it before they even know that they have been paid. That is how people get into tremendous amounts of trouble.</p><p>James is in a better position now, because he went to a citizens advice bureau and got the help that he needed, but there are countless people like him. We need to be very careful about using the language of vulnerability to suggest that people who go to payday loan companies are somehow vulnerable because that is not strictly true. We know that 75 per cent of people who take out payday loans are in full-time work, that 50 per cent of them are men, that 50 per cent of them are under the age of 35 and that 30 per cent of them own their homes. We are talking about working Scotland: people like James.</p><p>What can we do about the situation? First and foremost, we need to cap the cost of credit and limit the interest rates that the companies can charge. My friend and colleague Stella Creasy has been campaigning for years on that issue. I am pleased that her campaign has been successful and that the UK Government has committed itself to a cap. After all, we need to remember that these companies are in the UK only because they have been legislated out of America state by state. The maximum interest rate that can be charged in Germany is 40 per cent, but we let Wonga charge 5,284 per cent and let families get into tremendous amounts of trouble.</p><p>The UK Government is acting only because it has been forced to do so by the efforts of thousands of anti-payday-loan campaigners across the country. However, James&#8217;s story makes it clear that capping the cost of credit alone is not enough. We need to tackle the rollovers and stop companies upselling products by telling people, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t pay that loan, we&#8217;ll give you a bigger one and you can just pay it back over a longer period.&#8221;</p><p>We also need to address the prolific and relentless advertising of payday loans that has taken over our radio and television stations, that arrives in people&#8217;s inboxes and which comes through their letterboxes. In an interesting report that it published this week, the Office of Fair Trading pointed out that in 2009 there were only 17,000 payday loan adverts on our TVs. By 2011, the figure had reached a quarter of a million and, last year, there were 400,000 adverts for payday loans on our TVs and airwaves. Given those figures, I was keen to highlight the issue in my motion.</p><p>Put bluntly, payday loan companies are profiting from the cost of living crisis that the country is facing. For too many families, there is simply too much month left at the end of the money. No one knows that better than those who work in citizens advice bureaux across the country and who see 100 people a week turning to them for help. They are in a unique position not just to quantify the problem, but to explain exactly what is going on behind the scenes, so I am pleased to be able to highlight some of the evidence from its payday loan report card.</p><p>That report card points out that only 35 per cent of the people who went to payday loan shops were asked whether they could afford the loan before they took it out and that only 20 per cent were asked to provide any sort of evidence on their income. It also points out that 16 per cent were asked whether they wanted to take out a bigger loan without being pressured to do so, and that only 7 per cent were offered free and independent debt counselling. Those truly shocking statistics show that even with capping the cost of credit we still need to address so much more about the way these companies go about their business.</p><p>Two years ago, I set up the debtbusters campaign for three reasons: first, to take on payday loan companies street by street; secondly, to promote credit unions in their place; and thirdly, to improve debt relief. Indeed, this week, Jackie Baillie and I have taken to the streets across the country, not least the high street in Shieldinch on the set of &#8220;River City&#8221; as we tried to save the character Scarlett Mullen, who is in a tremendous amount of payday loan debt. I also pay tribute to Glasgow City Council, which is doing a tremendous amount to take on payday loan companies. I think that it has the most progressive anti-payday loan policy in the UK; it is looking at advertising, pensions, planning, rates relief and the rents that credit unions could pay to give them an advantage over payday loan companies.</p><p>However, it is no use telling people, &#8220;Payday loan companies are bad&#8221; when they are desperate and need access to affordable credit. In that respect, credit unions have part of the answer. I know that we will have the opportunity to debate the issue in detail next week, but I simply point out that credit unions such as the Capital Credit Union offer a direct alternative to payday loans by providing instant access to money that is capped at an interest rate of 26.8 per cent. We need to invest in and to see more of that alternative model&#8212;I know that the Government is considering options in that respect.</p><p>The final part of the debtbusters campaign is debt relief. Given that we are about to debate the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill, I ask the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism to think about what else he can do with that legislation to protect people from payday lenders. As I have said, even after we have capped the cost of credit, there is still so much more to do. For example, we have to examine the link with football clubs and look at financial education in schools.</p><p>I thank members for coming along and listening to the arguments, and I particularly thank Santa, who, although he is very busy at this time of year, was outside Parliament this morning warning people against payday loans. The fact that Santa has time to do that shows how important the issue is.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22804804", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Payday Loan Industry (Regulation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members for staying and draw their attention to my entry in the register of interests, in which I am listed as being a member of the Capital Credit Union and the Co-operative Party.

It is a real joy to be able to stand up and say that I agree with every word that he says. I cannot say that that happens often.</p><p>In my speech, I will talk briefly about three projects of which I am aware that do tremendous work, and then I will make some comments about youth work overall.</p><p>The first project that I will mention is the Canongate Youth Project. I know that the minister is familiar with it&#8212;certainly Angela Constance has been to it a number of times before. It is based in central Edinburgh.</p><p>I was delighted to be able to host the Canongate Youth Project in the Parliament a couple of weeks ago, when it put on a music concert in committee room 3. Never has Taio Cruz been blasted out of a committee room to quite the same degree. I was really impressed by two young people who were both care leavers and had been accessing the project for about a year. They took to the stage and played an incredible song that they had written together. One was rapping and the other was playing the guitar. They were brilliant. They were not just good at what they did; they could be selling the song now. They could be leading, cutting-edge artists and I wish them the very best in doing that.</p><p>The thing that struck me was the importance of music in their lives. Through the Canongate Youth Project, they had been able to record a song and that allowed them not only to express themselves and how they felt about the world that they lived in but to realise how talented they were. It gave them the skills and confidence to build on that talent, which they had perhaps been unable to do in any other environment, including at home and at school. I am really grateful to the Canongate Youth Project for the opportunities that it has given those young people.</p><p>The second project that I want to talk about is the youth bus, which is a mobile youth work project in the east end of Edinburgh. It moves around different parts of the east end every night and works with dozens of kids. There are loads of different facilities on the bus, including an Xbox where kids can just sit and play computer games, access to Skills Development Scotland advice about employability and, crucially, a c:card service, which is NHS Lothian&#8217;s free condom service. It is a real mix of different services, all available on one bus, which moves around the city at night. I put on record how grateful I am to Lothian Buses for its continued support for the project. At the end of the day, it is a bus that moves around parts of the city, and Lothian Buses parks, maintains, funds and secures it every week. The contribution that Lothian Buses makes is probably worth about &#163;15,000 a year. It is worth recognising the important role Lothian Buses plays by doing that.</p><p>The third group that I want to mention is Girlguiding Scotland, which George Adam mentioned. I have been really impressed by the work that the girl guides have been doing in the past year on female body image and empowering young women to feel more positive about themselves. The guides are not just giving young women the confidence to speak up on their own behalf but are filling them with a degree of civic activism that is letting them campaign on a national stage. It was the girl guides who took to the airwaves recently to say why they wanted to back the no more page 3 campaign. It was not just about personal body image but about the girl guides turning round and saying to the country: &#8220;This is not okay any more in 2013. We are going to stand up for a more equal world. &#8221;</p><p>It is important to remember that a lot of youth work relies on volunteers and increasingly stretched public funding. Although the youth workers will do everything that they can to keep things going under the most strained of circumstances, we need to recognise that without core funding, they are fighting a losing battle. If we, as politicians, believe in youth work and its powers, we need to fund it. We cannot just let youth workers go from one bidding process to another and hope for the best.</p><p>Another issue is capital investment. The more that youth projects&#8217; budgets are squeezed, the more tatty the minibus will become and the more the paint will fall off the church hall roof or the community centre. That will need to be addressed.</p><p>Ultimately, we need to remember about equality of access. Everybody should be able to access youth work whatever their surroundings&#8212;urban or rural&#8212;and whatever type of community they come from. If we value it, we must ensure that every young person can benefit from it.</p><p>Thank you, Presiding Officer, for letting me speak a little bit over my time slot and, once again, I congratulate George Adam on securing the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22798561", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: YouthLink Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate George Adam on securing tonight&#8217;s debate.

I am a member of the Terence Higgins Trust, and I have been a member of it for a long time. That is in part due to when I came of age. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, when Mark Fowler was diagnosed as being HIV positive on &#8220;EastEnders&#8221;. That led to a national debate about what that meant. Freddie Mercury died when I was obsessed with Queen and all the rock music around it. My childhood was framed around Band Aid. I watched AIDS ravage Africa, as it still does in many ways. That heightened my political interest in the HIV/AIDS debate, which is why I joined THT.</p><p>My membership of THT took a different personal meaning when a good friend of mine was diagnosed with HIV two years ago. That was a bit of a shock. He sat down and told me, and we talked through all the consequences that it would have for his life, job and relationship. We then had a drink, and it was all good and fine. I then got up, went home and cried all night because I knew that my friend was going to die. I knew that that would not necessarily happen tomorrow or in a few weeks&#8217; time, but that it would happen and was likely to happen before I died. I found that really hard to deal with.</p><p>A few months later, that friend was walking to meet me&#8212;we were going for a coffee. He was on his mobile phone, accidentally walked into a lamp post and bashed his nose, which started to bleed. When he arrived and met me, he was in covered in blood. That was a despairing moment for him&#8212;not for me&#8212;because he was so conscious that he was covered in a thing that was everything that symbolised his illness. He felt a great sense that his body was a danger to me at that moment. I could see his despair and fear for our friendship, about how I might cope with the fact that he was bleeding, and about what to do about that.</p><p>I share those personal stories because each says something significant about the challenge that we still face around HIV/AIDS. Part of that is the stigma. All members who have spoken are right to have pointed to the great deal of ignorance that still surrounds HIV/AIDS. I was ignorant, too. My friend does not have to die. The Terence Higgins Trust report that looks at the greying element of the HIV/AIDS epidemic shows that people can live very well for a very long time with it. I was ignorant on that issue, even though I was very engaged in the debate.</p><p>Crucially&#8212;Sarah Boyack made this point&#8212;we must consider the support services that exist. I will forever be grateful to Waverley Care and the Terence Higgins Trust for the breadth and variety of the services that they run and operate, which have helped my friend. It is not only about his mental health; it is about the impact on his work, and how he can continue to go about his way of life and live his life to the full.</p><p>In conclusion, I once again thank Sarah Boyack for bringing the debate to the chamber, and I thank members for letting me share my very personal experiences.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788770", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World AIDS Day 2013"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sarah Boyack on securing this debate and recognise her long-standing passion for the issue, the work that she has done with Waverley Care, and the work that she is doing overseas.

I can assure the ministers that I have read it thoroughly. It has 170,000 words, but women get only 39 of them. There is no mention of occupational segregation, equal pay, flexible working or low pay, and the words &#8220;gender equality&#8221; appear only in connection with our international development responsibilities. If independence is key, where is the compelling vision for a more equal and just nation for women? If we follow the logic that an independent Scotland would have a written constitution that enshrines rights, why is there no mention of women? The Government tells us that social rights to a free education and prescription charges can be enshrined, but there is silence when it comes to a political and economic right to gender equality.

That is why I ask the Government to be more ambitious in what it says about the jobs of the future and women&#8217;s ability to access them. We previously discussed the issue when we talked about the Wood commission report in the chamber. I will cite again some of the statistics that we used in that debate.</p><p>The number of awards for STEM subjects in further education in Scotland is falling&#8212;it has gone from 43,000 in 2008 to 30,000 in 2011-12&#8212;so fewer STEM subjects are being studied in our colleges. In the gender breakdown, the figure for women is falling, too. In 2008, 33 per cent of those who studied STEM subjects were women, whereas that is now down to 25 per cent. Not only are fewer STEM awards being made in our colleges but fewer women are studying STEM subjects.</p><p>The same principle applies to our modern apprenticeship framework. As the Minister for Youth Employment said, the number of women who are accessing the frameworks has increased, but the increase is in administration, retail and hospitality, and it tends to be at level 2. Women are not breaking into the technical modern apprenticeships&#8212;the level 4s&#8212;which take a substantial time to undertake. In 2008, 2.1 per cent of those who studied engineering were women; now, the figure is 2.6 per cent. Progress of less than half a percentage point has been made under the Government that we face today.</p><p>The issue does not stop at modern apprenticeships. In today&#8217;s programme for international student assessment&#8212;PISA&#8212;statistics for Scotland, boys outperform girls at a rate of seven to one in STEM subjects; they are seven points higher, whereas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average is one point. Why are women still failing to succeed in studying science subjects in Scotland? We need to do something about that.</p><p>That is why Jenny Marra and I wrote to Mike Russell on 7 October. We said:</p><p>&#8220;the Wood Commission report recommends that ... Modern Apprenticeships should be ring-fenced for STEM subjects.&#8221;</p><p>We asked for gender quotas to be applied to the ring-fenced places, to ring fence 50 per cent of the opportunities for women.

Why? From everything that I have read and learned, every story that I have heard and every person whom I have met, nothing has angered me more than the experiences and life stories of looked-after children.</p><p>Let us go through some of the key statistics. There are 16,200 looked-after children today, which is up 25 per cent from 2006. Thirty per cent of them have experienced homelessness and up to 80 per cent of our young offender institutions&#8217; population have been in care at some point; that figure was as high as 88 per cent of Polmont&#8217;s population when Barnardo&#8217;s published its plan B report. A person is far more likely to go to jail than to university if they have been in care&#8212;and that is before we even look at the difference in educational attainment between those in care and those beyond it. Such wasted potential somehow now feels inevitable.</p><p>While I was reading ahead of the debate, I followed the footnotes through to the 2007 report in the name of the then education minister, Hugh Henry, titled &#8220;Looked After Children and Young People: We Can and Must Do Better.&#8221; It is a fantastic report, brimming with statistics and action points to make things better. I was struck by just how little has changed in the six years since the report was published. When I put that to Who Cares? Scotland today, I was told that 17 different reports have been written on looked-after children since the dawn of the Parliament. One care leaver told me that each one somehow reads like an apology. Perhaps that is an apology for inaction, but it is more likely an apology for what feels like the inevitability of poorer life chances for looked-after children, which is a problem that somehow seems too big to fix.</p><p>I am not interested in a blame game of how we got here, because that care leaver could not care less about that. She wants to know what will happen now, and she is looking to the bill as a huge opportunity that must not be missed. That is why I am committed to lodging a number of amendments at stage 2, in conjunction with Barnardo&#8217;s, the Aberlour Child Care Trust and Who Cares? Scotland.</p><p>The legislation alone is not enough; we need a cultural shift in the public&#8217;s attitude towards looked-after children. I have two reflections on that issue. First, the public are largely ignorant about care leavers&#8212;how many there are, what being looked after at home is and means, and how poor their life chances are. Too many people think that those are bad kids worthy of little sympathy from anyone other than the biggest softies, rather than them being fundamentally good kids who find themselves where they are because of a life that has been free from care and full of neglect, and kids who have more experience of violence than affection and more experience of physical contact defined by restraint rather than by love. We need to put those children at the front and centre of our public discourse. We can start to do that with the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.

The minister can count on that not just throughout the bill process, but throughout this parliamentary session. I will speak more about that in a second.</p><p>We need to talk more about looked-after children and we need to challenge the media to do the same. We need to unite as a Parliament and agree that nothing should be inevitable about looked-after children&#8217;s life chances except the fulfilling of those children&#8217;s potential. They are our children and we should demand that their lives are full of love and expectation. In this Parliament we should create the rules by which that might happen.</p><p>My second reflection is on care leavers. It was put to me that the stigma associated with being in care is so strong that when a young person turns 16 they want to rid themselves of that label and everything to do with it. In so doing, they lose their rights to expect support as they transition into adult life. I can understand that, but I would like to get to a place where young care leavers can wear their label with pride and demand support to enhance their lives. In many ways it should be a liberation issue: care leavers should have more rights to support into their adult life exactly because of where they have come from and who they are. That will require a cultural shift in our attitudes to looked-after children, but it also requires care leavers themselves to make demands and exercise their rights.</p><p>Every care leaver whom I have met can name the date on which they left care. I cannot imagine that many people around the room can remember the date on which they left their family home. Why is that? The reason is that leaving home is a process, not an event. I want to see the bill greatly enhanced in that respect.</p><p>I hope that the Government will engage constructively on the bill. I appreciate that we cannot change society&#8217;s attitudes to looked-after children overnight, but I hope that by the end of the bill&#8217;s passage we will have a clear vision of our ambition for care leavers and a clear route map for how to get there.</p><p>Let me make it absolutely clear: I will do everything that I can to work with the Government to improve the lives of looked-after children, not just on this bill but throughout this parliamentary session.

At the outset, I acknowledge that I do not have the cycling credentials of Alison Johnstone or of my colleague Sarah Boyack. Back in 2007, when I was Sarah Boyack&#8217;s election agent, it used to infuriate me that she insisted not only on cycling to each engagement, but on doing so without a helmet. She would try to convince me that she was actually safer without a helmet, but I was never convinced. My attitudes to cycling have changed over the years&#8212;I will come on to that in a second&#8212;but it is important to acknowledge Alison Johnstone&#8217;s and Sarah Boyack&#8217;s long-standing interest in cycling as a policy issue.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell and Rob Gibson mentioned Copenhagen. While I was exploring that fantastic city earlier this year, I found myself in the middle of a march, but could not work out what it was about because all the signs were in Danish. I followed the march round to the Christiansborg palace, by which point I had worked out&#8212;I thought&#8212;that the demonstration must have been the Danish equivalent of pedal on Parliament. However, after stopping some people on the march to ask what they were campaigning for, it turned out that all the teachers were locked out and were striking. It happened that they all had bicycles because that is how intrinsic cycling is to daily life in Denmark. That taught me that what we really need in Scotland is a cultural shift, so that cycling becomes something that the majority of people do. However, we are a long way from that point.</p><p>Frankly, it is people like me who need to be persuaded that cycling is a safe activity. After this year&#8217;s pedal on Parliament, I purchased a bike and I now cycle fairly regularly, but I cycle only to two places. One of those is Portobello beach, which I can cycle to from my house entirely off road, thanks to the Restalrig railway path and all the public investment that has gone into off-road cycling paths in Edinburgh. The other is my gym, for which I need to cross only one main road, which I can do by pushing the bike over the street. There is no way I would cycle to work, because that would involve cycling up Easter Road in the morning at peak times; it is just too dangerous. Until I can be persuaded that cycling is safe, or we invest in the infrastructure such that cycling becomes obviously safe for everyone, I do not think that we will meet that challenge.</p><p>I pay tribute to all the cycling campaigners who regularly contact MSPs on various issues relating to the cycling agenda. Cycling is probably the single biggest issue in my inbox and is paralleled only by equal marriage in terms of the strength of feeling and regularity of contributions that I receive. People have written to me regularly about active travel for a number of years, but many are now writing about strict liability. However, I get the sense that some people within the cycling community are not utterly convinced that strict liability is the answer; rather, they see a need to speak out about the sense of anger and frustration within the cycling community about the number of accidents and deaths. Too many people find themselves at risk when trying to cycle to their work because our roads just are not safe.</p><p>There has also been some legitimate criticism of the Government&#8217;s plans around the nice way code campaign, on which I would like to hear Keith Brown&#8217;s comments tonight. There is a sense that some of the things that the nice way code has been encouraging cyclists to do actually put them in greater danger. Unless we get a sense of community among cyclists, drivers and all other users of our highways system, we will not get to the critical point that is necessary to drive cultural change.</p><p>I conclude by saying that I am grateful to a couple of my constituents, who are avid cyclists, who have offered me free cycling lessons to try to improve my cycling confidence. I may well take them up on that offer, but I think that, first and foremost, we need to have a serious conversation about what safety on our roads means.

It is key to economic growth and gender equality. I say to Angela Constance and Annabelle Ewing that they need to go back and look at the independent statistics. Child poverty fell under Labour between 1999 and 2005. It then stabilised, and then the SNP came into power and child poverty went up. Child poverty has only ever gone down under Labour and up under the SNP. I am afraid that that is a fact that they cannot deny.</p><p>I encourage the Government to take a moment to look at Save the Children&#8217;s recent report &#8220;Give Us a Hand with Childcare&#8221;, which contains 10 key messages from parents throughout Scotland about what childcare means to them and how it must be best delivered to benefit their lives. Four key points from that report stood out for me: the cost of childcare is too high, particularly for low-income parents; parents have a strong desire to work but feel trapped by the cost of childcare; flexibility is key; and childcare is a particular challenge for parents who wish to study.</p><p>I will take those clear messages to the scrutiny of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. There are 100 voices in the Save the Children report, all clearly stating what they want from the childcare provision that the Government is introducing. The Government has, of course, said that it will extend childcare to 600 hours for looked-after two-year-olds and for all three and four-year-olds.

I have seen the proposals go from two bills to one, and many of the ambitions have been diluted. I want the bill to work. I want it to be a good bill and to deliver for young people across the country. I said to the minister before and I repeat that we are listening, and working with her. We would like the bill&#8217;s ambition to be realised, but she must listen to us and the sector, which comes to the table with legitimate concerns.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s amendment addresses many of those legitimate concerns. There is no doubt that the named person element has widespread support from the children&#8217;s sector. I say to all the groups that have provided evidence to the committee and lobbied MSPs that their evidence is really welcome. It is great that the children&#8217;s sector has come together and spoken with one voice by uniting behind one briefing. That makes the sector&#8217;s voice more powerful and I encourage organisations to do that again.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s amendment recognises concerns about parents&#8217; feelings about the named person element. Ken Macintosh articulated those concerns well. They are partly about intrusion and about whether a named person is truly necessary for children who come from stable and loving homes. I have some sympathy with that, but there is a sense that a degree of ignorance is behind some people&#8217;s opposition to the named person element. I know that Aileen Campbell would share that view, but it is up to her to sell the policy to the public and to children&#8217;s charities. I would like her to do a bigger job of that. She has failed so far to articulate what a named person is and means and to rebut some of the criticisms in the press.</p><p>Aileen Campbell rose&#8212;</p><p>I am sorry; I have only four minutes.</p><p>I have a bit of advice for Aileen Campbell. Will she think about recording a video, as Mike Russell did? She could record a video about the named person element and perhaps have it played at assemblies and in schools across the country.</p><p>The definition of the role of named person is very important and our amendment recognises the degree to which we need to see a clear definition, not just in terms of what a named person would do but to distinguish the role from the role of a lead professional. At the moment, I am afraid that that message is not coming out loudly or clearly enough from the Scottish Government to alleviate some of those concerns.</p><p>There are also significant concerns about the degree to which the named person is financed and resourced&#8212;a point that was well made by Gavin Brown. I ask the minister to listen very carefully to what my colleague Anne McTaggart had to say today. Anne comes to the chamber with years of experience as a social worker. When she says that people at the front line need to understand what their roles and responsibilities are, the minister should be listening very carefully to that and ensuring that that message is understood by all the professionals who are involved in this.</p><p>It will be clear, come 5 o&#8217;clock, that the Labour Party&#8217;s decision is to abstain on the motion&#8212;quite frankly, because we are still listening; our minds are not made up. We would like to be persuaded of the Government&#8217;s case, but I am afraid that the Government needs to do a better job of articulating it. The Government does not have to sell the bill just to us. It can pass the bill without the votes of the Labour Party or the votes of the Conservatives. However, in order for the bill to work, the Government has to get the support of parents across the country and of professionals on the front line and so far, I am afraid that the minister is not winning that argument.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697561", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Named Persons)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome Jayne Baxter to her front-bench role.

I speak with a particular degree of pride, as I am a graduate of the University of Edinburgh.</p><p>I will make three comments about the ranking system. I will say something about the ranking system that was used, which puts Edinburgh at 17th on spin-outs. I will talk a little bit about the student experience, which appears in some ranking systems but not the one that was used. Then I will say something about widening access, which, as far as I am aware, does not appear in any of the higher education ranking systems.</p><p>Many members talked about spin-outs. There is no doubt that the University of Edinburgh is a world leader in that regard. It is head and shoulders above many other Scottish and, indeed, UK institutions. At the cross-party group on colleges and universities last week, we heard a great presentation from the university. Many of the figures that Gavin Brown used came from that report&#8212;which is quite startling&#8212;about the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s success on spin-out companies.</p><p>I hope that the Government is examining what the University of Edinburgh has achieved and is working out how it can share that expertise so that other universities can have the same chance of producing their own income through spin-outs and helping their graduates set themselves up in business.</p><p>As I said, student experience does not appear in the QS rankings but does in others. The student experience is important to the marketing of institutions to bring students to particular cities and institutions. A part of the student experience about which I feel strongly is the role of the students association.</p><p>One thing that has not been mentioned is the incredible record of Edinburgh University Students Association in contributing to the university community. The university invests a lot of its own money in the students association, and EUSA, as it is known, is perhaps the best-funded students association in the United Kingdom because the university recognises how important it is to have an active student population.</p><p>EUSA is important for the academic experience of students. It has fought for longer library opening hours, better feedback on essays and myriad other issues on which the academic element of a student&#8217;s experience can be improved.</p><p>EUSA is also important for the pastoral services that are available on campus. It has an important welfare service&#8212;for which I used to work&#8212;which provides front-line welfare advice to students on housing, sexual health, mental health and finances. It provides a range of things that are not necessarily provided at most other institutions.</p><p>On representation, the university is brave to invest so much in the students association when the association spends so much time fighting back at the university, but it recognises that that enhances the student experience. It also promotes a sense of citizenship within the student community that equips students with the skills not only to go out into the employment market but to contribute to society. Many great political leaders have come from that student representative sector, so it is worth recognising its role.</p><p>I will make a remark about widening access. As far as I am aware, it is not assessed as part of any of the major ranking systems for higher education. That is an interesting point to consider when we think about how we assess how good our universities are.</p><p>I am concerned about the degree to which we teach to the test. Universities want high placings in those rankings and, to do that, they will look at what the methodology is and will play to it.

The Government can hardly be surprised that that inconsistency fuels a sense of cynicism in the public debate around the independence referendum.</p><p>The same argument applies to the sense that we are going to have a written constitution in an independent Scotland. On the one hand, the SNP says that it will enshrine certain things in that written constitution. On the other hand, it tells us that it is for the people to decide what will be in the constitution. That is a cynical ploy, and it is no wonder that public support for independence is falling. It is also no wonder that public support for the First Minister is falling, because he has been found out.</p><p>An excellent example of the SNP&#8217;s inconsistency lies in the issue of payday loans. For the past 18 months or so, I have been running a campaign on payday loans and, time and again, I have said that in order for us to rid our high streets of the problem we need to cap the cost of credit. That is an issue for Westminster. It took the First Minister a year to say, in the Sunday Post, that the SNP would cap the cost of credit. At that point, I started to ask hard questions about how we could do that in an independent country. If we have the same currency as England and have the Bank of England as the currency of last resort, how could an independent Scotland cap the cost of credit for payday loan companies? I was told, &#8220;Ah, the answer to that lies in the hands of the post-independence Government. It will come up with the hard answers on that.&#8221; Meanwhile, I put forward many ideas for things that the Government could do now to address the problems of payday loans in our communities, but was told, time and again, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a bit difficult,&#8221; or &#8220;We don&#8217;t have the powers for that.&#8221; The political will simply is not there on the part of the Government to make change happen now.</p><p>I wondered why that should be, and John Swinney gave the game away last week.

I am personally grateful to Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid for supporting an event called next-generation feminists, which I recently hosted in the Parliament and in which the organisation played an integral part.</p><p>We are on the cusp, if not right in the middle, of a new phase of feminism being an in thing. There are a lot of national campaigns and we need to ensure that we capitalise on that. I refer to campaigns such as the lads mags campaign, the everyday sexism campaign, the no more page 3 campaign and the campaign for women on banknotes and the way in which the rape threats that came from that started a discourse on the power of social media and the threats that it poses.</p><p>I read in the paper this morning that no more page 3 is encouraging all the female MPs at Westminster, whenever they find a copy of The Sun in the House of Commons, to stick a no more page 3 sticker over page 3. I wonder whether there are enough women in the chamber to ensure that any page 3 newspaper in the Scottish Parliament might look somewhat different after tonight.</p><p>There is a point in that because, as much as I welcome the debate, looking around the room at my sisters, I feel a little bit like I am preaching to the converted. If we have a new phase of feminism, we need to ensure that we use that platform wisely and that it has an impact on the people who have the power to effect change. We need some brothers in the room and, particularly, on boards of multinational corporations and media outlets to listen to the debate and use the power that they have to change things for the benefit of everyone.</p><p>On revenge porn, I will talk briefly about the role and responsibility of the education on healthy relationships with which we provide young people.</p><p>I have done quite a lot of work recently on cyberbullying. I recently visited a school in Edinburgh&#8212;Craigmount high school&#8212;where I was shocked to discover that every pupil had an iPhone or a 3G-enabled smartphone in their pocket and that 40 per cent of the pupils had their own iPads or laptops of which they had exclusive use when they went home at night.</p><p>We need to understand that technology is developing at a far faster rate than society&#8217;s ability to cope with it. We do not really understand the impact that issues such as revenge porn on new media have on young people and the people who are exposed to them.</p><p>Cyberbullying is an example of that. The impact of cyberbullying is dark. It is subversive. It bubbles under the surface until it explodes in the most dramatic way for a young person. It is destroying lives and, often, it is too late.</p><p>Parents do not necessarily understand the technology. They think that, if their child is in the room upstairs, they are safe because they are not outside, but they are exposed to dangers that the parents do not necessarily understand.</p><p>Teachers perhaps do not know the dangers that the new media pose and, therefore, do not know how to address them in a classroom environment. However, the way in which we teach healthy relationships and sexual education in the classroom environment needs to understand technology. If somebody gets involved in a relationship with a partner for the first time, they experience the sense of trust for the first time&#8212;what is okay and not okay to share; where the boundaries are. Those issues are smashed wide open when we apply technology to them and give a child a smartphone with the power to take a picture that can be around the world in seconds.</p><p>We need to understand the technological impact on how we teach sexual health and how we ensure that young people&#8212;particularly young women&#8212;grow up with a sense of self-confidence, self-esteem and control over their bodies being theirs and not men&#8217;s. Jackie Baillie described that well when she talked about power and control being at the heart of the domestic violence debate.</p><p>My colleague Richard Simpson put to the Education and Culture Committee a suggestion for a parliamentary inquiry into cyberbullying.

I know that Mr Wilson is very committed to the credit union movement. Indeed, he chairs the cross-party group on credit unions, which will meet after the debate finishes. I draw members&#8217; attention to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests, where I am listed as a Co-operative Party-sponsored MSP and a member of Capital Credit Union.</p><p>I am pleased that John Wilson&#8217;s motion refers to high-cost lenders, because I want to talk first about the payday loan industry and then about the credit unions&#8217; ability to respond to it. Last year, the payday loan industry was worth &#163;2.2 billion to the UK economy and companies such as Wonga have gone from operating at a loss in 2006-07 to making tens of millions of pounds of profit last year. In fact, payday loan companies are one of the UK&#8217;s fastest growing industries, which tells us everything that we need to know about the state of the economy and how hard it is for people to make ends meet at the moment. For too many families across Scotland, there really is too much month at the end of the money and it is no surprise that people end up in the arms of those companies, given their prevalence on our high streets, on our airwaves, online, in our inboxes and on our mobile phones. They are absolutely everywhere.</p><p>First and foremost, we need to cap the cost of credit. I find it perverse that credit unions can charge a maximum 26.8 per cent interest rate on loans while payday loan lenders can charge what they like, which is why companies such as Wonga can charge in excess of 4,000 per cent APR without any consequences.</p><p>Payday loan companies are in the UK only because state after state in America has kicked them out and countries such as Germany have a maximum interest rate of 40 per cent. That clearly shows that if we capped the cost of credit in this country we would very quickly be able to cut the legs from under those companies.</p><p>Credit unions can play a very important role by offering affordable and accessible alternatives to short-term loans. The best example that I can point to is probably Blantyre Credit Union, which recently made a presentation to the cross-party group. It provided a little evaluation of the product that it was able to offer, a so-called &#8220;fast 500&#8221;, which is an instant access loan of &#163;500 that can be had on very much the same terms as a payday loan but without the extortionate interest rates. Blantyre Credit Union managed to lend out 2,900 short-term loans and was able to evidence that those loans had saved that community &#163;500,000 of interest. That was &#163;500,000 back into the pockets of low earners and back into the local economy through local spend.</p><p>I want to get across a clear message to the minister. When he says that there is no money to invest in credit unions, I want him to appreciate the extent to which credit unions are effectively a preventative spend and will help him further down the line.</p><p>Blantyre Credit Union is not just about saving people money; it has also transformed people&#8217;s financial habits. The same 2,900 people who borrowed from Blantyre instead of from Wonga or other such companies were able to amass &#163;113,000 of savings between them within 12 months. That completely transformed their financial habits. Therefore, the loans not only addressed an instant, up-front financial need, but allowed those people to get a grip of their finances and think longer-term about how they could fund their lives, their families and their future.</p><p>I have met the minister on this issue before and put to him an idea of mine. I am very grateful to have the support of ABCUL for my idea, which is, namely, a loan guarantee fund that would build on the credit union expansion project and help credit unions lend to people who would not otherwise meet the affordability criteria. The minister has promised me an answer to that request by the end of June and I very much look forward to hearing it.</p><p>Once again, I congratulate John Wilson on bringing the debate to the chamber.

Marco Biagi has spoken particularly well on the impact of such underemployment, particularly on women, which is an issue that my colleague Margaret McDougall touched on. With regard to women, the key aspect of the report that the Government must take on board is the fact that their underemployment is probably far greater than the statistics suggest because of childcare and that they would like to work longer hours but cannot do so because they cannot access affordable childcare. In that regard, the report certainly highlights many issues that the Government needs to go away and think about.</p><p>As for self-employment, Murdo Fraser recognised that the issue merited further analysis and the STUC has noted that the new self-employed are very different from those in the pre-recession period. In evidence to the committee, the cabinet secretary welcomed the increased trend towards self-employment, although he, too, acknowledged the need to explore whether all those business ventures provide individuals with economic security and sustainability.</p><p>I decided to do a bit of exploring and this morning took to the Department for Work and Pensions jobmatch website to see what I could find out. Anyone who is looking for a retail job in the Lothian region will find just 61 jobs that have been advertised on the website in the past two weeks; however, those who look at the detail of those 61 jobs will soon discover that 50 per cent of the posts are self-employed.

My first job out of university was as a welfare adviser at Edinburgh University Students Association. Day in and day out I dealt with students complaining about their landlords. A huge amount of that time was spent advising students about their rights as tenants and what to expect. I could tell members countless stories about students&#8217; experiences, such as a &#163;15 fee for a light bulb that was not replaced and a &#163;5 fee for the egg cup that never existed&#8212;small things that constantly irritated, combined with bigger issues around deposits and failure to get them back.</p><p>In many ways, landlords were chancing their arm. They would take just enough off the deposit for the student not to complain any further because it was not worth their while to go to court or complaining any further; landlords could slice &#163;100 to &#163;150 off a deposit without having to worry about the tenants taking it any further.</p><p>There is a great deal of ignorance in the student community about their rights as tenants. We set up a service for students&#8212;they could take their lease to the advice place where we worked and get it checked before they signed it so that we could highlight the terms and conditions that they were signing up to. Few people used that service&#8212;few people knew that it existed, as important as the work that we were doing was.</p><p>We were able to do some serious work in respect of bad landlords who were operating in Edinburgh at the time. One particular company had a third of the market share of all private rented flats in Edinburgh back in 2004-05. It had a particularly bad record in how it dealt with students. I see Marco Biagi nodding&#8212;I think that he knows which company I am talking about, although I am not brave enough to name it in the chamber. However, we managed to mobilise students by empowering them about their rights and empowering them about their options to come together and take on that company. We ran a campaign specifically against that letting agent and we forced it to change its ways.</p><p>That campaign turned into a pilot of the landlord accreditation scheme in Edinburgh. We had good practice by landlords recognised with a charter and with a badge that they could wear to say that they were good landlords. We then got the EUSA to accept adverts only from accredited landlords. Suddenly, the bad landlords were unable to advertise to students. We used the power of the students coming together collectively and organising to effect change and to make things better for them.</p><p>I acknowledge that the private rented sector is not just for students. As Marco Biagi said, in Edinburgh, in particular, we are talking about a very diverse mix of people including a lot of young professionals, migrants and people moving out of homelessness into private rented sector accommodation.</p><p>I remember legislation that was designed in Parliament to protect tenants being used against the very people whom it was supposed to protect. In 2006, we were still campaigning against housing in multiple occupation quotas when people in local authorities were trying to use the legislation that was designed to protect tenants to limit the number of properties in Edinburgh in which young people could live. That just forced up rents for people who could least afford to pay.</p><p>We must ensure that, when we create new systems, they do not have unintended consequences that increase the amount of money that people have to pay, or which damage their rights. I am already hearing cases of people having to pay holding fees as well as deposits, so landlords are working their way around the legislation in different ways.</p><p>Ten years on, things are better. We have a tenancy deposit scheme, but there are other challenges. As other members have mentioned, the private rented sector has doubled in size in the past 10 years, so we perhaps need to think about how housing here will evolve in the future. Many people do not want to own a home, but want secure tenure that does not involve ownership. When can we, in this chamber, think about long-term leases whereby people can have access to a flat that is theirs for a long period without living in fear of being turfed out? In Edinburgh, people often sign a six-month lease that then rolls on for two or three months until the landlord kicks them out in July so that they can lease the flat out for festival rents and then re-market it in September. The landlord wins, time and again.</p><p>Perhaps we can think about new and creative ways of allowing people to have long leases and continue to rent, so that they can enjoy the fabulous city of Edinburgh as they want, without being exploited by landlords.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692846", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Rentals (Deposits)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Patrick Harvie on bringing the issue to the chamber.

The report&#8217;s authors looked at vulnerable families, meaning those affected by one of seven factors: worklessness; housing; lack of qualifications; mental health; illness and disability; low income; and material deprivation.</p><p>According to that report, the impact on families of the tax and benefit changes, combined with cuts to public services for vulnerable families, is the equivalent of &#163;3,000 per family per year. Moreover, the negative impact on family income increases the more vulnerable the family is.</p><p>I want to concentrate on the impact of such reduced income, whether we are talking about the average loss of &#163;480 per adult of working age or the &#163;3,000 loss for the most vulnerable families. There is a growing gap between what people need to survive and the income that they get, and the question is how they will fill it.</p><p>That brings me on to the issue of payday loans, which last year were worth &#163;2.2 billion to the UK economy, or the equivalent of 8 million &#163;500 loans. What do we know about the people who take them out? Citizens Advice Scotland has said that 75 per cent of those people are in work; perhaps they are among the 372,000 Scots affected by cuts to tax credits or the 621,000 Scots affected by the child benefit cuts whom the Sheffield Hallam report identified in its report. We also know that they are most likely to spend payday loan money on bills and food.</p><p>To get a payday loan, a person must have a bank account and evidence of income. In many ways, therefore, those who are out of work are largely protected from the impact of those loans. However, we know that that situation will change come October, when universal credit is introduced and the 125,000 Scots who are currently unbanked will have to get an account to access the benefit. That is a brand-new market of extremely vulnerable people who will be exposed to the practices of predatory payday lenders.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.

When they get their first home, the council gives them some money that allows them to get something to sleep on, something to sit on and something to eat with.

Mitigation is not just about filling the gap between what people used to have and what they are getting now; we need to think about the extra risks that they take to fund their families, put food on the table and ensure that their kids can buy the books, clothes and other things that they need.

I thank the members who have stayed for the debate and the organisations that have provided briefings for it, most notably the Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust, Leonard Cheshire Disability, Hollaback! and the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund.</p><p>The one billion rising campaign, after which the motion is named, was set up in response to the United Nations campaign UNiTE to end violence against women, which began in 2008. A key finding was that one in three women worldwide will be raped or beaten in their lifetime. That is 1 billion women throughout the world who have direct experience of violence. The one billion rising campaign&#8217;s call is simply to turn those 1 billion victims into 1 billion activists calling for change.</p><p>I will focus my speech on how community organising and empowering women to take action are the key to successfully changing our culture and our society&#8217;s attitude towards women. I will do that by talking about three campaigns that have done that in their own separate ways. Before I turn to Hollaback!, the everyday sexism project and the no more page 3 campaign, I will take a moment to recognise the dedication of the people throughout Scotland and around the world who took decisive action on 14 February this year. That day, the one billion rising campaign asked women around the world to organise dance strikes to raise awareness. There was a dance strike here outside the Scottish Parliament and another in Waverley station.</p><p>The reason why so few people know about that day of action is that 14 February was also the day when the world learned that Oscar Pistorius&#8217;s girlfriend had been shot and killed. The story monopolised our airwaves. The next day, The Sun&#8217;s coverage of the killing shocked the country&#8212;it pictured Oscar&#8217;s nameless girlfriend in a bikini. That front page led to the hashtag #HerNameWasReevaSteenkamp trending worldwide, with thousands of column inches devoted to the media&#8217;s portrayal of women, in particular its portrayal of victims of gendered violence. That served only to reinforce my long-held belief that we cannot seek to tackle gender-based violence without tackling gender inequality in all its forms no matter how small or how endemic, and no matter how difficult that is.</p><p>One of the most difficult challenges is to persuade some tabloid newspapers to give up their obsession with page 3 models in so-called family newspapers. The no more page 3 petition campaign currently has 96,000 signatures, and it recently secured the support of the 500,000-strong UK Girlguiding movement. For as long as women are promoted as sex objects in our mainstream media, gender equality will be forever distant.</p><p>Topless models in newspapers is one of the better-known crusades of the feminist movement, but there is a new crusade that is celebrating its first anniversary this week, called the everyday sexism project. The campaign is led by the formidable Laura Bates, who, like Caitlin Moran and Lucy-Anne Holmes, speaks with an authenticity and a coolness that cuts through and speaks to young women who might not recognise the word &#8220;feminist&#8221; in their own identity or indeed see gender inequality in their lives in the blunt and unforgiving way that their mums or grannies did.</p><p>The everyday sexism website and Twitter account reveal a catalogue&#8212;an anthology&#8212;of women&#8217;s daily experiences of everyday sexism, from gender stereotyping in the workplace to a so-called harmless bum pinch in a nightclub, which paints an ugly picture of our culture and the casual sexism that we let slip by day by day. All that casual everyday sexism leads to the normalisation and acceptance of gender inequality, which eventually leads to violence.</p><p>What can we do as men and women who are all striving for a more equal world? The answer is to fight back, to come together as a community, whether in the real world or online, and to say no.</p><p>I became involved in the everyday sexism project before Christmas in response to a tweet that I had seen from a friend, lambasting Amazon for its Christmas gift list. Amazon had suggested lists of books for Christmas presents. Under men, the list included science fiction, political biographies and business books. Under women, animal calendars, cookery books and romance novels were promoted. My friend tweeted:</p><p>&#8220;Thanks @AmazonUK for letting me know business, politics and sci-fi aren&#8217;t for my pretty little head&#8221;.</p><p>That was retweeted more than 1,000 times in 24 hours. That ultimately led to Amazon withdrawing its gift list and changing its ways. I tell that story to say that, when we unite together and challenge everyday sexism, we can change our society and make for a more equal world. If we believe in equality, we owe it to one another to challenge gender inequality in all its forms, wherever we see it.</p><p>I congratulate Hollaback! in Edinburgh on its work in empowering women to holler back whenever they are subjected to street harassment in the city.</p><p>I thank members for the opportunity to bring these issues to the chamber.

The SNP has presided over the provision of a number of targeted benefits since it came to power in 2007. To dental treatment&#8212;which has been mentioned&#8212;can be added optical vouchers, the cost of travel to hospitals, student bursaries, individual learning accounts, the education maintenance allowance, the energy assistance package and shared equity schemes.

It could be suggested that the Government might argue that it has just not got round to reforming those benefit schemes yet or that it would have reformed them if it had had the cash, but we know that that is not true either.

In that sense, we are all on the same side.</p><p>I say to the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth that we agree on the need for targeted and universal benefits. Let us be honest about that. We just disagree on the mix, and it does the Parliament no good for us to pretend in the parliamentary knockabout that our positions can be presented as black versus white or good versus evil. In the words of the Christie commission, what we need is a &#8220;non-polarised and transparent environment&#8221; for debate.</p><p>We also need to raise the standard of the debate, which I will try to do by taking on what Christina McKelvie said. She asked what happened to the idea of tackling child poverty. Labour managed to lift 600,000 children out of child poverty. We did that through a targeted public policy approach; it was an approach that was targeted at women and which included the national minimum wage, tax credits, part-time jobs and&#8212;crucially&#8212;rights that enabled trade unions to reinforce them, childcare, and paternity and maternity rights. A concerted attempt was made across portfolios to target women.</p><p>Let me take that argument and apply it to John Swinney&#8217;s opening remarks. He admitted that his reformed colleges programme has led to fewer part-time opportunities and more places for young people. The consequence of fewer part-time places in colleges is a detrimental impact on women.</p><p>We will feel that for years to come in our child poverty statistics. The employment stats already demonstrate that. Inactivity among women is up 25,000 this year; for men, it is down 1,000. The inactivity rate is up 1.4 per cent in Scotland, but down 1 per cent in the UK. The trends are going the wrong way for the cabinet secretary. He hailed the progress on youth employment&#8212;which I welcome&#8212;but he must recognise that that is a result not of young people moving into jobs, but of them moving out of the employment statistics through inactivity.</p><p>I go as far as to argue that the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to youth employment is targeted rather than universal. It is focused on the business end of the market and helping those young people who are closest to getting into the job market. The Government completely abandoned the young people who have been out of work for two years or more. That is a targeted approach driven by its need to satisfy statistics and get out a good press release.</p><p>I have only a minute and a half left, so I cannot pay tribute to Siobhan McMahon&#8217;s speech and the important things that she said about higher education.

For such a bright guy, I never fail to be astonished by his inability to get it. Johann Lamont is opening up a debate. She is asking for people&#8217;s thoughts and opinions. She is not so set in stone that she cannot move.

I congratulate the Government on doing that, but I ask it to recognise that we have been floating that idea for several months.</p><p>In a vain attempt to put another idea to the minister in the hope that he will rubbish it for a couple of months and then agree to it, I ask him to consider the fact that part of what the debt arrangement scheme is doing might in fact increase the amount of money that is paid to payday loan companies. I will try to explain that to the minister.</p><p>If someone takes out a &#163;100 loan from a credit union and they are charged 26 per cent interest APR for three months, they will pay back &#163;108. If they take out a &#163;100 loan from Wonga for three months at an interest rate of 4,200 per cent, they will pay back &#163;1,050&#8212;and that is before the levies, the fees and the administration charges are added. When someone enters a debt payment programme under the debt arrangement scheme, all the interest fees, all the debt and all the extra charges are lumped in with the capital sum that has been lent, which is what is sought back from the debt payment programme. Payday loan companies will profit from the debt arrangement scheme if we are not careful. I ask the minister to look at the possibility of separating out capital from interest charged. He could make sure that the scheme addresses the capital load, so that payday loan companies and credit unions get that back, but treats the interest in a slightly different manner. It is an idea, which I ask him to consider and return to at a later date.</p><p>I am also concerned that, at the moment, if someone has substantial debt, they end up on a debt register. It is possible for marketing companies to access that register, phone people up and ask them whether they would like help from a private company to file for bankruptcy. Those companies are profiting from people in extremely dire financial circumstances. Will the Government look at making it illegal to sell that data on to private companies for them to exploit? I believe that that is within the Government&#8217;s power. I hope that the minister will look at it in the context of bankruptcy legislation.</p><p>I hope that the minister can see that we are presenting these ideas in the most genuine manner. We simply cannot wait any longer to act on payday loan companies. I get the points from the SNP back benches about waiting for independence and the need to regulate. I have pointed to the work that Stella Creasy is doing at Westminster on regulation and have said that we cannot wait for a change of Government in 2015 and we cannot wait for independence in 2016. Think of the interest that will be charged in two or two and a half years if we do not act now for people who take out these small loans. We have to do more today. I have put some ideas to the minister about how we can do that. I ask him to please work with us on this issue. These are legal loan sharks who are exploiting vulnerable families across the country. The minister has the ability to crack down on legal loan sharking. I ask him to look to do so today.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684051", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Debt Arrangement Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry, but I really do not have a lot of time today.

Not having enough money to pay the bills for rent, fuel and food is a worry for many people in January, but hundreds of thousands of people throughout Scotland face that struggle every month. Every week and every day, the worry preys on their mind.</p><p>Payday loan companies have exploited those pressures for profit. As a consequence, high-interest short-term lending was one of the fastest growing industries of 2012&#8212;it was worth well over &#163;1 billion to the United Kingdom economy. Today, I intend to outline the problem and explain why I anticipate that it will get significantly worse in 2013. I will then seek to outline what can be done to address the issue, in the hope that the Scottish Government will adapt some of these ideas and show some serious leadership.</p><p>The rising profits of payday loan companies should come as no surprise to anyone who has been up their local high street recently. There has been a great explosion in the number of payday loan retail units. For example, when I recently had half an hour between meetings in Edinburgh, I took a walk down Leith Walk and within half an hour had managed to find nine different payday loan outlets, which are within five minutes&#8217; walk around Leith. Facing the eyeline of anyone who comes out of Central station in Glasgow are four payday loan shops. There are three such shops within five minutes&#8217; walk along Stirling&#8217;s Pitt Street. As payday loan companies do not conduct credit checks, it is easy to take out thousands of pounds within a couple of hours literally by walking from one shop to the next.</p><p>The danger comes not just from our high streets but from relentless television and radio advertising, doorstep sales and targeted emails and online marketing. People can borrow &#163;500 from Wonga on their mobile phone within 15 minutes without a credit check. One constituent who registered with the recruitment website jobinaclick.co.uk found that the website sold on her details, so she found herself being bombarded by targeted emails around pay day that offered her hundreds of pounds at reasonable rates. Their presence is relentless.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the marketing strategy of these companies has changed over the past few months. The adverts used to promote life&#8217;s little luxuries such as a new mobile phone or another foreign holiday; now the adverts focus on people paying their bills. That fits very much with the findings of a recent Which? report, which shows that most people take out payday loans for bills, food, fuel and emergencies&#8212;people who are clearly struggling to make ends meet. The typical payday loan customer is not what one might think. As the Citizens Advice Scotland report highlights, 75 per cent of clients with payday loan difficulties are in full-time work, the majority of them are men, the majority of them are under 35 and 30 per cent of them own their own home. This is working Scotland.</p><p>Frankly, it is a scandal that families in 21st century Scotland can work a full paid week and still live in poverty. The living wage is clearly an answer. To anyone who disagrees, I put the question: if work is really paying, why is it that six out of 10 kids living in poverty in Scotland come from working households?</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683026", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living (Payday Loans)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I begin, I draw attention to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests as a Co-op MSP and a member of Capital Credit Union.

Currently, 125,000 people in Scotland&#8212;1 million across the UK&#8212;are completely unbanked. Come October, many of those will need to get a bank account in order to access universal credit. The only thing that people need to get a payday loan is a bank account, so a whole new enticing market is about to open up for payday loan companies to exploit. Combined with the fact that benefits will move from being paid two weeks ahead to four weeks in arrears, that means that thousands of Scots will instantly face a six-week cash-flow problem.</p><p>As members who have read today&#8217;s Govan Law Centre briefing will know, a further problem that arises is associated with the bedroom tax. People with an extra bedroom in their house who do not want to move may well end up at a payday loan company to finance the difference between their income and their rent. That is another huge market for predatory lenders to exploit.</p><p>That will be a huge issue not just for individuals but for housing associations and local authorities, which are seriously worried about rent arrears. The problem will affect not just the security of tenants but the credit rating of housing associations. I would be so bold as to say that some housing associations could fail as a consequence of increased rent arrears. Any such problem will fall squarely on the Scottish Government&#8217;s doorstep.</p><p>That is the problem, but what can we do about it? First and foremost, we need to regulate these companies. They are here only because they have been forced out of America, state by state, through legislation. My Labour and Co-operative colleague Stella Creasy has been leading the charge at Westminster to cap the cost of credit and to legally limit the number of roll-ups, which is when people take out one loan to pay off another. That is an important point, because the industry body for payday loan companies tells us that 90 per cent of payday loans are paid off in full. Of course they are, because people are told to take out another loan to pay off the first one, and that is a much larger sum at a much higher rate.</p><p>Stella Creasy, along with trade unions and community groups across the country, has built a movement that is so strong it has forced the UK Government to reverse its opposition to a cap on the cost of credit. I am therefore surprised that the Tories seek to delete that commitment from the motion. Regulation is reserved to Westminster, but debt is devolved, which is why I have set up a campaign in Scotland called debt busters, which seeks to do three things. The first is to take on payday loan companies street by street; the second is to promote credit unions and their capacity to offer credible alternatives; and the third is to seek to change the law to improve debt relief for those who find themselves in serious trouble.</p><p>I will give members an example of that in practice. In Craigmillar in the east of Edinburgh, I work closely with Castle Credit Union and Link Housing Association on a joint campaign against payday loan companies. We jointly produced a leaflet and delivered it to thousands of homes in Craigmillar and Niddrie. That led to joint money advice surgeries, and we now regularly share resources in relation to newsletters and other such items as we work together against these companies. Many of my colleagues are now doing similar things in their areas.</p><p>I have a long list of things that local authorities can do to crack down on payday loan companies. I will not talk about them today, although I would happily share them with any member who wants to see them. Instead, I would prefer to use the rest of my speech to make two specific asks of the Scottish Government.</p><p>The first is to ask the Government to look seriously at the concept of a wealth warning on payday loans. In 2010-11, the Government spent &#163;6.78 million on public information and marketing campaigns, with the figure rising to &#163;7.13 million in 2011-12. That money is being spent to educate us all not to eat fatty or salty foods and not to drink too much&#8212;it is being spent on health warnings. If we seek to educate the public about their health, why cannot we do it about their wealth? I would like the Government to run its own think twice campaign on payday loans, to expose the risk and promote the alternatives, which include the Government&#8217;s core money advice services. I am pleased to have explicit support for that measure from the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Church of Scotland.</p><p>I have raised the issue with the minister previously and I understand his concerns about the Government taking such direct action. However, if he is still willing to address the issue of payday loan companies, he could consider facilitating another organisation to take on that work, which is an approach that Citizens Advice Scotland has supported.</p><p>Part of the problem is that banks&#8217; short-term lending has shrunk by 20 per cent in the past few years, creating a new market. At the very least, the minister should get third-party organisations such as Citizens Advice Scotland and the banks round a table to try to make the approach work. There is precedent for such an approach, because big energy companies fund big energy week, which is usually successful. All that is needed is leadership, and Mr Ewing is the man to do it.</p><p>A second action that I would like the Government to consider relates to how it supports credit unions. In the previous financial year, the Government gave &#163;1.2 million to credit unions. Much of that money was spent on business development, but they now need help with product development. A few of the larger credit unions offer same-day payday loan services. Scotwest Credit Union started it with the fast &#163;500, which is linked to its current account, and Capital Credit Union has recently introduced its swift 500. The annual percentage rate for both those loans is just 26 per cent. If someone was to take out a loan with Wonga today, they would be charged 4,200 per cent for the same amount.</p><p>Those are great, credible, accessible and&#8212;crucially&#8212;affordable alternatives, but a number of small credit unions simply do not have sufficient capacity to offer such a product. They need a guaranteed loan fund: a sum of money from the Government for the purpose of lending by credit unions. The minister might ask where that cash would come from. It could be redeployed from existing credit union funds but, ultimately, it would be preventative spend, because his goal is to prevent people in Scotland from falling into rent arrears and causing his Government a problem with the debt that that will create. I know that the minister has huge respect for the work of credit unions. He now needs to show that by providing support to address the impact of payday lending and the financial pressures that thousands of Scots face.</p><p>The challenge is huge, but we are not powerless to act. With a bit of leadership and creative thinking, the Government could take on and beat legal loan sharking in this country. I hope that the Government will rise to the challenge today.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that January is a long and hard month for working families, made even worse in 2013 by the ongoing recession and austerity programme; notes with concern the rapid boom in payday loan companies that target low-income working people who struggle to make ends meet; recognises the need to both regulate more heavily payday loan companies and cap the total cost of credit; believes that local authorities and the Scottish Government should demonstrate leadership and seek to curtail the explosion in high interest, short-term lending that results in huge debts and financial misery for thousands of people in Scotland; notes that the welfare reform changes will force more people in Scotland into debt; recognises the important role that credit unions can play in providing a viable alternative and, believes that the Scottish Government should take the lead and warn against the dangers of legal loansharking.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683026", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living (Payday Loans)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Sorry, I have a long way to go, but I hope that Mr Mason will contribute to the debate later.

To try to understand the size of the challenge, I carried out some research of my own in Edinburgh around this time last year. I visited Craigmount high school in the west of Edinburgh, where I met a class of secondary 1 pupils. Every one of those S1 pupils had a 3G mobile phone in their pocket, the majority of them had their own laptop and 40 per cent had their own iPad. That happens at 12 years old. All the pupils had Facebook profiles. Despite the fact that the age restriction on Facebook applies until someone is 15 years old, many of those pupils had had a Facebook profile since they were 10.</p><p>Craigmount high school has an excellent information technology department, which really is at the cutting edge of integrating technology into the educational experience. Mobile smart phones are used in the classroom and are integrated into homework programmes. That reminds us all of the educational value of technology, which we should not lose sight of.</p><p>The school is about to wi-fi enable its whole campus, which brings huge educational possibilities. When I spoke to the school about that, I was told not to worry about kids being able to get on Facebook on the school campus, because that is not possible with the City of Edinburgh Council&#8217;s IT system. However, the blunt reality is that that is irrelevant when every kid in the class has their own 3G phone in their pocket. They are not protected by council bullying policies. The danger is far greater than that.</p><p>I do not know about you, Presiding Officer, but I am not sure how many of my Facebook friends I could count on in a crisis or how many of my Twitter followers actually agree with my views. As Alex Johnstone said, the definition of friendships and relationships is remarkably distorted online. We need to do more to support children and young people to cope with the increasing online cataloguing of their lives and growing pains&#8212;things such as spots, haircuts, fashion faux pas, likes and dislikes, academic results, who their parents are, what their parents do and, as Dennis Robertson mentioned, body image and what they look like.</p><p>Much of our societal debate about children&#8217;s online safety is focused on the warning signs of predatory relationships and grooming, but far less public attention is paid to online peer-led bullying. Many parents safeguard their family computers, have the talk with the kids about online strangers and think that they are safe, only to let them go online and suffer silently at the hands of their classmates and acquaintances. Such bullying can be blatant and playground-like, but it can also be subversive and darkly psychological. Malice can spread like wildfire through a young person&#8217;s cyber-world in minutes and can cause a lifetime&#8217;s worth of damage to their self-esteem and feelings of self-worth.</p><p>If members think that I am exaggerating, they should take a second to look at the website www.littlegossip.com, which is dedicated to actively encouraging young people to leave anonymous comments about their classmates and teachers on a school-by-school basis.

On 16 May, I informally approached Aileen Campbell, who said that, if I wrote to her, she would agree to a meeting. I did that but, on 22 June, I got a letter back from Alasdair Allan saying that there was no reason to meet me to discuss the problems with cyber-bullying.

I was pleased to see it in the budget and I understand that it will be on stream from April.

I have a lot to get through.</p><p>Kenneth Gibson was, however, right to point to the fact that I welcome the Government&#8217;s &#8220;Make Young People Your Business&#8221; document. I spoke at great length on Tuesday about how much I welcome that. It is particularly important that we say to businesses that it is about not a moral duty to employ young people, but the opportunities that they give companies to build and grow. I completely welcome that, but I want to see more emphasis placed on getting that message out to businesses. I do not want this to be a glossy leaflet that sits in a council office, which businesses can rush by without picking up. We need to make sure that the message is getting out to businesses.</p><p>Earlier this week, the cabinet secretary talked about a website dedicated to promoting that, called &#8220;Our Skillsforce&#8221;. I have looked at the website and I am afraid that it has many of the same problems as the &#8220;My World of Work&#8221; website. I will share those with the minister. I hope that, if she takes one message away from the debate, it will be the need to look into this. Just before Christmas, the minister and I shared a platform not about youth unemployment, but about sexism and gender inequality. On that subject, we had a lot of views in common. On the home page of the website, there are 10 photos, nine of which are of young men and just one of which is of young women. I am sure that the minister will want to look at the presentational impact of that. There is also a page on the website about recruitment, with a message for businesses on how to access Government programmes. That one website page still has four different contact telephone numbers for businesses to access support. Once again, businesses are faced with the complexity of the employability landscape. Surely one telephone number would have been enough.</p><p>It gets worse. I thought about how, if I were a business, I would access support for youth recruitment. I googled the words &#8220;help recruiting a young apprentice in Scotland&#8221; and that website did not come anywhere in the first 10 listings on Google. I tried again, googling the words &#8220;our skillsforce Scotland&#8221;. Again, the website did not appear in the first 10 listings on Google. How are businesses going to access the website and find the support if it does not come up in a web search? I ask the minister to think seriously about the approach from a business perspective. How can businesses access the information and make the best of it? It is of no use if it is just in a glossy document.</p><p>In the time that I have left, I will say why Labour cannot support the Government today.

There is a good story to tell about the minister&#8217;s work in that regard, if she will let me get to it.</p><p>There is a company in Edinburgh called Adcentiv Media, which specialises in signage. It is doing really well despite the adverse economic circumstances, and it has already expanded once. Last year, the company took on a young guy called Calum, who was doing a get ready for work placement in Edinburgh. He thrived in the new environment and got on really well. He demonstrated a real talent for car wrapping. In case members are not familiar with it, car wrapping involves literally wrapping a car in adverts. It is a growing trend: not many businesses in Scotland are doing it, but there is an increasing demand for it.</p><p>Calum had a real skill for car wrapping, and towards the end of his get ready for work placement the employer wanted to take him on because he had such a talent and ability to help the business grow. Several calls were made to different agencies, all of which led to dead ends. The employer phoned Skills Development Scotland and got nowhere&#8212;and got really frustrated. I was visiting the company with the local MP Sheila Gilmore for other reasons and it was only because I recognised Calum&#8212;I had met him at the Rathbone centre while he was doing the get ready for work programme&#8212;that I asked how he was getting on. I was told the whole story: the company could not get his employment programme continued and he would have to join the dole queue again in a month&#8217;s time. I wrote to the minister and, to her credit, she intervened to fix Calum&#8217;s situation. She made the right parts of Skills Development Scotland talk to each other, so Calum now has his modern apprenticeship and is thriving. It should not, however, have taken a Government minister&#8217;s intervention to get him to that point.</p><p>It is crucial that people are able to navigate the system and get from one programme into another and then into a job. The Scottish Government has not shown me that there is a pathway for people from the minute that they leave school until the minute they get into employment.</p><p>Falkirk Council does incredible work in that regard. It does not take its eyes off a young person from the minute they leave school until they are in a sustainable job. Too many young people are falling through the net and dropping out of the system. From the visit that we made to the City of Edinburgh Council in December, the minister knows that Edinburgh is doing fantastic work and has great plans to do more. We need such strategies from the Scottish Government&#8217;s own programmes and it needs to drive the policy across 32 local authorities.</p><p>I had a lot more to say, Presiding Officer, but I have run out of time.

At first glance, that seems to be a good thing, but, when set against the changing practices of the Department for Work and Pensions and the reality of how jobcentres work, it is devastating. Many jobcentres operate on an appointment-only basis. I have spoken to countless young people who find going to the jobcentre incredibly intimidating, especially when the first thing they are faced with is a security guard asking them why they are there.

Jamie Hepburn said that it is designed to focus on those who are in need. Let me take a moment to explain to him and others why we hold our view. The Unison briefing notes that the vast majority of drop-ins at careers centres were diagnosed as needing one-to-one advice help. In some instances, 80 per cent had an identified need. The 2009 annual report for SDS boasts that 242,000 young people dropped in. If we apply Unison&#8217;s evidence that 80 per cent need help, what we get is a figure of 193,600 one-to-ones taking place in 2009-10. The SDS expects to deal with 35,000 amber clients, which is a huge reduction in service in only three years; in fact, that is less than a fifth of the number from three years ago. It looks to me as though tens of thousands of young people will simply slip through the net as a consequence of the changes.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Careers Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At Jewel and Esk College along the road, there are 1,800 full-time students and just under 8,000 learners overall.

I read in papers ahead of the debate that many people praise the service, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank. I say to the minister that it is a shame that just 17 per cent of pupils know that it exists. The minister&#8217;s response to my colleague Drew Smith was particularly misleading, because it is necessary to register on the website in order to access a number of the tools. I know that because I had to do it in order to see what tools are available on the website. So, I am afraid that what the minister said is just simply wrong, because 83 per cent of Drew Smith&#8217;s constituents are missing out and 88 per cent of the kids in Edinburgh are missing out, which means that 14,975 pupils in Edinburgh alone are missing out as a consequence of the programme.</p><p>Mary Scanlon rightly pointed out that 93 per cent of staff whom SDS surveyed are unhappy with the new system. It was not unreasonable of her to expect the minister simply to listen to what the union is saying. We have a Tory spokesperson here asking the minister to listen to a trade union. Does the minister not understand that that is a simple ask? I hope that in her closing remarks she will reflect on that.</p><p>While we are on the topic of the Education and Culture Committee, I refer the minister to a point in the Official Report of the meeting of 27 November, which I am sure she read before she came to the chamber today. One of the committee&#8217;s members asked SDS how much the my world of work website cost, and SDS said that it would write to the committee with the details. I checked with the committee clerks this morning and found that SDS had told them that they would get an update response before this debate started. However, I am afraid that such a response has not arrived with any of the committee&#8217;s members, and I have not seen it, either. I think that it is unreasonable to be asked to debate a website without knowing simple things such as how much it cost the Government to produce. I hope that the minister will be able to provide some information on that at the end of the debate.</p><p>This is not, of course, the first time that I have complained to the minister about how difficult it is to extract information from SDS; it happened to me over apprenticeships and it happens to many of my colleagues every time they submit a freedom of information request. I asked the minister during a previous debate to address that issue, and I ask her again to look at the obfuscation and SDS&#8217;s deliberate attempts to stop members of the Opposition having simple facts ahead of debates.</p><p>Neil Bibby perhaps put it best when he said that giving young people one-to-one advice allows them a decent chance of getting a job. It is not too much to ask, but asking for it is exactly what the Government wants young people to do.</p><p>An SDS official told the Education and Culture Committee:</p><p>&#8220;If a young person finds that they are struggling, they will come forward. They have done so in the past ... and there is nothing to stop them doing so now.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 27 November 2012; c 1646.]</p><p>How complacent. How arrogant. If we ask any teacher, youth worker or anybody else who has contact with young people, they will tell us that often the last thing a struggling young person will do is ask for help, and that serious interventions are needed to help them to move forward.</p><p>I believe that tomorrow marks the minister&#8217;s first anniversary in her job. There has been little mention of that today, with no cake and no party&#8212;certainly not one that Neil Findlay and I have been invited to. I wonder whether that is because, after the minister&#8217;s 12 months in the job and with &#163;18&#160;million spent, youth unemployment is higher than it was when she took up her post. Is that any surprise after what we have heard in this afternoon&#8217;s debate&#8212;arrogance and complacency from a Government that is out of touch and ill-informed? Today, more than 100,000 young people in Scotland are unemployed, but the minister says, &#8220;Everything&#8217;s fine.

I argue that regulation is often, in fact, the enabler of freedom. For example, the Financial Services Authority&#8217;s regulations against insider trading help to ensure the freedom of the market. A press that is subject to the independent regulation that Lord Justice Leveson has proposed will still be a free press.</p><p>We need to recognise the pressures that newspapers are under in a 24-hour news cycle and with the explosion of online and social media. I am a news addict, but that does not mean that I buy lots of newspapers. I consume most of my news online and I rarely pay for it. I get the news headlines every morning from Twitter, with my hairdryer in one hand and my iPhone in the other&#8212;members can picture it if they dare. There is a big question mark over the financial viability of newspapers, which have yet to find a way in which to make money from making news available free of charge. Leveson refers to that when he states:</p><p>&#8220;social media such as Twitter have ... contributed to a dramatic change to the cost base and economic model on which newspapers are based.&#8221;</p><p>In his view, that has</p><p>&#8220;increased the pressure for exclusive stories.&#8221;</p><p>We can see how the temptation to behave badly could build.</p><p>I raise that issue in order to provide some economic context for Leveson. It is hard to see how we will be able to get the cultural revolution that we need from the press without ensuring its financial sustainability. I argue that the freedom of the press is under far greater attack from the changing nature of the economics of journalism than from anything in Leveson.

Surely, in the light of all that has been discussed today, the First Minister understands the need to keep his promise. In that spirit, I wonder whether he will comment on that in closing, and whether he will reflect on paragraph 134 of the executive summary of the Leveson report, which is in the section headed &#8220;The press and politicians&#8221;. In that paragraph, Lord Justice Leveson states:</p><p>&#8220;I have recommended as a first step that political leaders reflect constructively on the merits of publishing on behalf of their party a statement setting out, for the public, an explanation of the approach they propose to take as a matter of party policy in conducting relationships with the press.&#8221;</p><p>If we are to take the First Minister&#8217;s word in good faith and accept that he is committed to changing the nature of the press in this country and its relationship with politicians, surely he will tell us today when he will answer Johann Lamont&#8217;s question and also when he will commit to publishing his statement of how he deals with the press.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Leveson Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I commend Dennis Robertson for his incredibly moving speech.

I would like to make some consensual comments and suggestions to the minister before addressing some of the points that have been made.</p><p>This morning, I visited Fort Kinnaird shopping park in the east of Edinburgh&#8212;I am sure that the minister is familiar with it&#8212;where 1,400 people are employed in the retail industry. Today, it opened its Christmas jobs fair. It was a pleasant experience to see partnership working there between the public and private sectors in Edinburgh. Fort Kinnaird retail park paid for big portakabins to be set up with computers inside and encouraged people to use them to apply for jobs. There are also desks and space for employment advisers so that the public sector can do its bit and provide careers advisers, DWP officials and all the people needed to do the partnership working and make it work for the people who are desperately in need of employment in the east of Edinburgh.</p><p>The jobs fair is going to be there for three and a half weeks. There are 350 jobs available and, in the first three days, 450 people have come through the doors, which gives a good picture of the appetite for Christmas jobs across Edinburgh and what we can do about that.</p><p>That work has been driven by the Capital City Partnership, which is an organisation that I am sure the minister is aware of and which I am hugely fond of. It contributes heavily to Edinburgh&#8217;s joined up for jobs strategy and is doing some great work there. It recognises that it has a key role in job creation&#8212;I know that the minister does not always accept that it is within the powers of government to do that. In the CCP&#8217;s view, it creates jobs by unlocking and de-risking. It has the capacity to unlock latent vacancies, which organisations perhaps do not know they have, by de-risking the process and taking out some of the challenges that organisations face. In doing so, it can provide recruitment support, engagement and the necessary skills to enable small, medium and large businesses to take on people whom they might not otherwise be willing to take on.</p><p>If the minister is still informing her thinking about how the job subsidy programme could work in future, I encourage her to consider how the CCP is developing its plans. Fantastic work is being done because SNP and Labour are joining forces in the City of Edinburgh Council to make productive things happen. I say that to the minister in the most genuine way, because we can achieve great things when we listen to and interact and engage with each other.</p><p>I have been pushing hard for the business gateway in Edinburgh to become embedded in the council&#8217;s employability arm. The council is moving towards having a one-stop shop for businesses, which very much relates to what Gavin Brown talked about. When a business contacts the council, it will be able to access information about recruitment, engagement and skills, and the same person at the shop front will be able to guide it through the planning process and deal with building control issues if the business is looking to expand, or deal with environmental health issues.</p><p>Small businesses tell me that that is exactly what they need if they are to be in a position to take on more people&#8212;young or not. From their perspective and the council&#8217;s perspective, the one-stop shop is a great way of hiding the wiring, as I was told. There is just one person to deal with, and the business does not need to worry about the mess behind the scenes. It needs only to access the support at the start of the process. I encourage the minister to go and see that fantastic work.</p><p>Elaine Murray made an excellent point about people&#8217;s difficulties in navigating the infrastructure around employability and the desperate need for a one-stop shop. Margaret McCulloch reminded us that we need to retain the aspiration for full employment in this country. We should never lose sight of that ambition.

I welcome the opportunity to talk about widening access in a more general sense. I look forward to more debates of that nature in the chamber in the coming months, as we will talk about higher education quotas in line with the Government&#8217;s legislative programme.</p><p>Members can tell by the number of Labour MSPs who are in the chamber that there is a real appetite to examine the issues behind widening access that are not simply about tuition fees. I have a long-standing interest in, and passion for, widening access, through my previous roles at Edinburgh University Students Association and at the National Union of Students. I am also a law graduate, so I will talk about the issues that face law students today.</p><p>However, I will first address Marco Biagi&#8217;s speech. He said that Labour MSPs had a cheek to bring the issue to the chamber because of tuition fees. When will the SNP understand that widening access is about much more than tuition fees? There are many issues behind it.</p><p>Marco Biagi stood up and said that his Government has an exemplary record of opening the doors to higher education. However, only 3.9 per cent of the students studying law in his constituency at the University of Edinburgh come from the most deprived backgrounds in Scotland. That is the second-worst record in Scotland. The only university that does worse than that is the University of Aberdeen, which is the institution that I went to. I will talk about that in a second.</p><p>Widening access can be about a number of things. It can be about the course choices that somebody has at school, the aspirations or fears that their parents have for their future, the encouragement that they get from their school and teachers or whether they really think that university is a place for them.</p><p>There is an issue with getting people from the legal profession into classrooms at the earliest stage to talk about different legal careers. When I went to study law, I was inspired by &#8220;Ally McBeal&#8221;, which was the big television programme at the time. I wanted to be a courtroom lawyer like the character Ally McBeal. Only when I got to university did I realise that criminal law or courtroom law was only one sixteenth of the LLB programme that I was there to study and that I had to do tax law, family law and trusts&#8212;all the things that bored me senseless for four years at university.</p><p>There is an important point in that: students need to understand the type of education and experiences that they will have at university before they get there. That has a lot to do with retention. It has to do with what happens to students when they get to university and their ability to stay there.</p><p>In the short time that I have left, I will comment on cost and culture. At the University of Aberdeen, I was surrounded by people who were privately educated. I come from a middle-class background&#8212;both my parents are teachers and I went to a state school&#8212;but I still found that incredibly intimidating. I ask members whether they can imagine what it would be like to go into that environment if they came from a really deprived background. I do not know how people would cope. I simply cannot get my head around it.</p><p>From day dot&#8212;from the word go&#8212;at the University of Aberdeen, all the law students from privately educated backgrounds were already on a mission to secure their traineeships. It was all about accessing the next path into their careers. They were able to work for free at legal firms over the summers and build up the work experience that I and my friends could not get because we had to work during the summer to get enough money to stay at university and continue studying.</p><p>Such networks open and continue to grow when someone is at university. Widening access goes right through a person&#8217;s entire education. We need to address many cultural issues about opportunities and networks.</p><p>The final issue is cost. Students who study law have huge amounts of initial, up-front costs for the textbooks that they must access. In my first two weeks as a law student, I spent hundreds of pounds buying books. It is not possible to buy them second hand. They change every year because, by its nature, the law changes every year. We do not give students the ability to cope with those additional costs.</p><p>Those are only two issues. There are a range of issues, and I strongly urge the minister to take on board Sarah Boyack&#8217;s request for a summit and make some serious progress on widening access.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673005", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Diploma in Professional Legal Practice (Access)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other colleagues, I thank my friend Sarah Boyack for bringing the motion to the chamber.

I also welcome the community sports hubs, which are a critical part of the agenda.</p><p>However, I will speak about the 13,000 clubs throughout Scotland that are a step below the hub model, or would not benefit directly from it at the moment. I will talk about two clubs in Edinburgh with which I work closely. The first of those is Lochend Youth Football Club, which has huge ambitions to grow and develop as a local club. It is just 10 minutes up the road and has a fantastic view of the Salisbury Crags&#8212;it is a great place to visit if the minister is ever short of places to go.</p><p>The club is desperately keen to take more ownership of the facilities that it uses. It currently has its eyes on the Seafield pitches down in Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s constituency, which are currently run by Edinburgh Leisure. The club would like to take ownership of those pitches, as it is the only club that uses them just now and believes that it could run and maintain them better. Crucially, it would not have to pay the extortionate letting fees week after week. The club could do so much more with the facilities if it ran them, and as a Co-operative Party-sponsored MSP, I could not agree more with that. I will work directly with the club to help it to realise that ambition. That will be easier now that City of Edinburgh Council is run by both Labour and the SNP, who are committed to a co-operative council agenda.</p><p>The club could also be assisted greatly by the Government&#8217;s move towards community ownership. There are many good examples throughout Scotland of clubs taking ownership of the facilities in which they operate, but the examples have often been born of crises, for example when a facility is closed by a local authority or needs help. We should see that agenda as being a progressive step for all community sports facilities. It should not be just about the crisis point; it should be about the development of clubs and helping them to become sustainable in their own right.</p><p>In June last year, the sport minister announced a community ownership support scheme worth &#163;500,000 of funding. I asked the Scottish Parliament information centre to dig out a bit of detail about whether that money had been allocated yet. Sportscotland seems to think that it is coming in its direction, but it is not sure when and it does not really know whether it will administer the fund or when it will be able to start giving out that money. In fact, sportscotland is beginning to think that it might be linked to the Government&#8217;s proposed community empowerment and renewal bill, which has now been delayed for a further year. So, it could be up to three and a half years before any of that money lands in the hands of the people who desperately need it. Can the minister comment today on how quickly clubs might be able to aspire to access that cash? It would be very welcome.</p><p>The other club that I will talk about is the City of Edinburgh Basketball Club, which is based in Portobello high school. It has its own problems at the moment, because Portobello high school desperately needs a school building and there is a huge debate about the site for the new school. I am doing everything that I can to support it in finding a site. The City of Edinburgh Basketball Club has a huge number of young teenage women participating in a competitive team sport. That is fantastic and we should do everything that we can to support them. The club wants to grow and to have a more sustainable future. It is considering becoming a social enterprise so that it can access more pots of cash.</p><p>I am trying to bring together Lochend Football Club, the City of Edinburgh Basketball Club and Lochend Amateur Boxing Club into one east end team sport effort, so that I can help them to access funding streams that are currently just for multi-sport clubs.</p><p>There is a development worker in Social Enterprise Scotland who focuses on sports development. She does a fantastic job, but her post will exist for only six months more. It is part funded by sportscotland and part funded by the Robertson Trust, but I understand that the trust has removed half the funding for the future. The fact that the person who is charged with enhancing the sustainability of sports clubs is about to have her post taken away speaks to the issues that we are addressing. I would really like the minister to commit to extending that post and to addressing some of the issues that I highlighted.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673083", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Sport Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate this afternoon.

Ten thousand of the 26,000 modern apprenticeships that the Government delivered last year went to folk who were already in work that had lasted for six months or more. The detail of where the modern apprenticeships went reveals a real difference between the future skills needs of the economy and where we are delivering modern apprenticeship programmes.</p><p>I will mention a few statistics. Since 2008, the percentage of modern apprenticeships in the construction industry has fallen from 22 per cent to 9 per cent. In engineering, the percentage of modern apprenticeships has gone from 13 per cent to 5 per cent, and the percentage of electrotechnical apprenticeships has gone from 9 per cent to 2 per cent. When it comes to opportunities for our young people in this country, although there are 26,000 modern apprenticeships the percentage in industries that will grow in the future is going down.</p><p>There has been a rapid increase in the number of modern apprenticeships in retail, administration and hospitality, many of which have been taken up by people already established in employment. I appeal to John Swinney, who I wish was in the chamber, because&#8212;I say this most sincerely&#8212;he has to look at the issue again. He must ensure that the skills agenda matches the future skills needs of the economy.</p><p>Another example is that of construction apprenticeships. In the first quarter of 2012-13, 110 apprentices were made redundant in Scotland. Given that 75 of those redundancies were in the construction industry, 68 per cent of redundant apprenticeships came from one industry. What did the Government do? It scrapped the adopt an apprentice scheme&#8212;the very scheme that is designed to help new businesses keep or take on redundant apprentices. It also scrapped the safeguard an apprentice scheme, a fund that gives &#163;75 a week to small companies that are struggling to keep their young people on.</p><p>I wish that John Swinney was in the chamber so that he could make a commitment to look again at the issue, because the schemes have advantages for young people and for businesses. It is cheaper for businesses to take on apprentices who have been made redundant, because they get them half or three-quarters qualified, or just before they complete their qualification. It is a real shame that we are failing those young apprentices.</p><p>Page 34 of the SNP&#8217;s manifesto states that the SNP will create 500 dedicated apprenticeships in the renewable energy sector.

Recently, I hosted an event in the Parliament with Scottish Families Affected by Drugs; it is nice to see some of the people from that organisation in the gallery this morning. Also, I congratulate Sheila McKay on a lifetime of work on the agenda.</p><p>I have travelled across Edinburgh and across Scotland to speak to different organisations and groups that work in the field. I went with John Finnie to visit NHS Highland&#8217;s harm reduction unit, which is doing groundbreaking work on naloxone. I ask all members to look at that fantastic work, which should be happening throughout Scotland. I reiterate Richard Simpson&#8217;s point about naloxone and the situations that people find themselves in when they overdose. It does not tend to happen in a family environment; people tend not to overdose in front of their mum, dad, brother or sister. They are more likely to do it in front of somebody with whom they are taking drugs, or perhaps on their own, in which case they might be found by somebody else, in a coma or otherwise.</p><p>As important as it is that we help families to understand what naloxone is, and that we train them in using it&#8212;which is relevant to a conversation about drug and substance misuse&#8212;we also need to consider &#8220;family&#8221; in the widest possible sense. &#8220;Family&#8221; does not have to mean a relation or a blood relative; what matters is who a drug user or substance misuser defines as family. That is why community development is important, because services should be provided to the people whom somebody defines as their community on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>For some people whom I have met or worked with in the past year, family members are not the most helpful people for the recovery journey. Families might be at the heart of underlying problems or might have unhealthy relationships. Getting back into positive relationships with their families requires people to be at a stable point of recovery and to feel strong in their recovery. That cannot happen instantly&#8212;getting to the point at which people want to tackle underlying issues with their families takes a lot of time on the journey of recovery. That goes back to community development and the recovery communities that we can build.</p><p>I pay tribute to the Serenity cafe, of which some members might be aware. It has recently moved to new premises at the Tun, which is just around the corner from the Parliament. It is a fantastic organisation that is linked to Comas. I encourage members to use that open cafe, which is run by people in recovery for people in recovery and for the nearby community. More than 40 people in recovery provide the services&#8212;they are involved in food preparation and in making and serving coffees, for example. For those people, that is part of learning how to play a part in society again and learning skills that will equip them to get back into work. We parliamentarians are based close to that organisation; perhaps we all have a role and a responsibility to encourage people in that environment to do the best that they can.</p><p>I will conclude, because I appreciate that time is tight. I have learned from the recovery community that the Government could do a couple of simple things that would not cost much but could make all the difference. One suggestion relates to the support that we offer families when a family member is in recovery. Often, the person who is recovering gets concessions for leisure activities or bus journeys, but the family gets no such concessions. If we extended to the children of recovering addicts free swimming and free bus travel to and from appointments, we would alleviate somewhat the financial pressure.</p><p>Another simple point relates to the appointments process. People in recovery being told that they must make a 3 o&#8217;clock appointment with their consultant, which is the time when they are picking up their kid from school&#8212;perhaps for the first time in a decade&#8212;creates stress that addicts really struggle with. That applies particularly to those who have had a lifetime of using benzodiazepines, which means that their stress hormone receptors are suppressed and they cannot deal with stress in the way that other people can.</p><p>Simple things could make all the difference. I would like to hear the minister&#8217;s response to these simple ideas.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Not long after my election, I took on the role of co-convener of the cross-party group on drug and alcohol misuse, and through it I have learned a tremendous amount about the issues that we are discussing today.

In my view, we need to talk about not just political and civic life, but how that is reported. The number of female faces in the lobby in this building has been tiny during the five years that I have worked here, and that shows in the reporting. The news is of divisions and splits or barnstorming speeches; it rarely sees an issue in the round. I refer to what I have heard Lesley Riddoch describe as civic health. Child poverty is a good example: all aspects of it should be looked at and then reported on in the round. There is an age-old feminist adage that the personal is the political, and we need more of that in our politics if we are to turn around declining turnout figures.</p><p>Members might question the link, but I repeatedly hear two things when I am out on the doorsteps: first, that politicians are all corrupt and, secondly, that people are not very interested in politics. Part of the battle to overturn apathy is in reaffirming the relevance of the political process to people, and we can do that by making it personal. Instead of abstract fights about splits, we need more actual stories about how people live their lives and pay their bills&#8212;human voices that articulate the political ills of the day. If we change the way in which we talk about politics, we can change the audience, building one that listens. Breaking down the establishment and the political elite is crucial to achieving equality.</p><p>Lesley Riddoch has a lot to say about that issue. In fact, an article that she wrote back in 2000 has stuck with me over the years. In the article, which was entitled &#8220;In the land of cynics and numpties, let&#8217;s hear it for the Holyrood women&#8221;, she poses the question:</p><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the point of electing women to parliament if they have to act like men to survive?&#8221;</p><p>The article points to the early trials and tribulations that leading women such as Wendy Alexander and Susan Deacon had to face in order to do things differently and, therefore, well. The article describes the bold steps that Susan Deacon took to tackle the health inequalities that women faced&#8212;to address smoking rates among young women, abortion rates and access to contraception&#8212;and how she was harangued for them. Johann Lamont, Margaret Curran and Wendy Alexander are all women who inspired and continue to inspire me. So, too, did Nicola Sturgeon, who is a fantastic role model for young women in politics, operating at the highest level of Scottish politics for more than a decade. It is important that we demonstrate solidarity with one another, as women, across political lines, in the name of progressing the case for gender equality together.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women&#8217;s Representation (Public Sector Boards)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to make a bit more progress, please.

That is fact 1&#8212;and it is level 2 apprenticeships that account for the significant growth in the number of modern apprenticeships. The important fact is that in 2006 youth unemployment in Scotland was 60,000, whereas now the figure is 100,000. The Government says that I have a cheek in criticising a programme that is exactly the same as the Labour one; I think that the Government has a cheek in taking the same approach to apprenticeships in a time of crisis as Labour took when the economy was booming.</p><p>The SNP cannot escape the simple fact that it said that it would create 25,000 modern apprenticeships to tackle youth unemployment in this country, when the reality is that it is not doing so and 100,000 young Scots who are without jobs are paying the price.</p><p>If the minister insists on harking back to when Labour was in power, let me say to her that, according to figures that are published on the Scottish Government website, Labour spent &#163;60 million in 2006-07 on creating 15,869 apprenticeships, whereas the SNP is spending &#163;72 million to create 26,427 apprenticeships. The SNP is spending &#163;1,000 less per apprentice throughout Scotland. In truth, the commitment to 25,000 modern apprenticeships is a slogan that works for Alex Salmond but it is not a policy that is working for Scotland&#8217;s 100,000 young unemployed people.</p><p>In the debate in February I asked the minister to take forward and report to the Parliament on three things. I said that long-term youth unemployment had doubled in the six months before the debate. It has now quadrupled. Jenny Marra will talk at greater length about that. I asked the minister for a strategy to address long-term youth unemployment, but the Parliament has yet to see a finalised strategy for youth employment&#8212;and the minister has spent all her money.

Therefore, the audit of skills is urgent and I look forward to hearing the Government explain how it will make progress on it.</p><p>Teachers whom I have spoken to are positive about the initiative, but they are quick to highlight the training needs of teachers. If we want kids to soak up a new language, we need to immerse them in it from the beginning. Those points were well evidenced by Maureen Watt and Marco Biagi. It is ridiculous to ask a primary teacher with a higher in Spanish to take on that task, and it could be counterproductive. We need to empower kids to learn a language. It is not simply about teaching them the French or Spanish for &#8220;cat&#8221; or &#8220;dog&#8221;; we need to empower them to ask questions, such as &#8220;&#191;C&#243;mo se dice ... ?&#8221;, or &#8220;How do you say ... ?&#8221; Those are the sort of skills that we need to give young people.</p><p>I am pleased that the report recognises the role of mother languages that are not English in the 1+2 strategy. To give some statistics, 24,555 kids in Scotland have English as an additional language, which is 3.7 per cent of all Scottish pupils. Of them, 3,588 are in Edinburgh, which represents 8 per cent of the school population in our capital city. That is a hugely significant amount, but when we get down to school level, it becomes even more significant. No fewer than 100 of the children at Leith primary school, just down the road, have English as an additional language. That is 36 per cent of the school roll. That is a huge amount that&#8212;of course&#8212;brings challenges, but the school relishes that and, in fact, celebrates it. Every time a new country is represented in the school, a new flag is hung. The headteacher told me that, just last week, they hung the Nepalese and Guatemalan flags for the first time. That is fantastic and wonderful and it shows the diversity in Scotland that we love, but additional resources are needed to support the school.</p><p>The City of Edinburgh Council has an English as an additional language service. That is great, too, but it is hugely underresourced. As I said, 100 kids at Leith primary school have English as an additional language, but they have access to one teacher for one and half days a week, and that is all. That is only enough time to train teachers. The English as an additional language specialists never get anywhere near the kids whom they seek to support in the classroom. With more resources, their time could be better spent. However, we are kidding ourselves if we think that the infrastructure is there even to support the kids with additional languages who are already in our schools. There are just 6.2 full-time equivalent bilingual support assistants for the whole of Edinburgh&#8212;that is six people to support 3,000 kids.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I absolutely accept that, but the issue should have been at the heart of the remit.

They hold down jobs and bring up families, and they go home and drink a bottle of wine, night after night. Minimum unit pricing will do little to change the impact of the cost of a bottle of wine and it is key to the cultural shift that we need in this country. Education is critical to that&#8212;not just education of adults, but of children. In the 1980s and 1990s, we ran campaigns such as smokebusters that got kids to go home and bin or hide their mum&#8217;s fags. We need a similar education campaign that tells mums and dads, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t drink that four-pack&#8221; or &#8220;You don&#8217;t need that bottle of wine tonight.&#8221; Education is critical to the culture change that we need in this country.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, we had a cross-party group meeting in Parliament at which children and young people came together to talk about parental drug and alcohol misuse. Two young Prince&#8217;s Trust ambassadors were there, and they were heartfelt in their view that our education system should do more than just tell young people about the dangers of drugs and alcohol. They told us that our education system must teach young people how to cope with the misuse of drugs and alcohol by their parents. That is the type of intervention that I would like the Government to make. It is about a wider range of interventions to change the cultural framework and do so much more than simply looking at price, as in this narrowly drawn bill.</p><p>Finally, I want to talk about future generations of young people for whom price is not yet an issue. There are five, six and seven-year-olds who are watching their parents drinking, and seeing billboard and bus-shelter advertisements promoting drink as an answer to how to have a good time. We need to ban the advertising and do so much more to make sure that the generations who follow do not have the same problems with alcohol as the current generation has.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Eadie promised an intervention on the point that I had made.

It is also a day to reaffirm our collective commitment for a better tomorrow, to focus on a more equal and just Scotland and to share our energy, experiences and hopes with sisters around the world for whom the march towards equality is only just beginning.</p><p>Those principles of celebration and contemplation are good principles to apply to the living wage debate. We have come far, but there is so much further to go. I speak in that context. As my colleague John Park said, two thirds of low-paid jobs are held by women, so they have the most to gain from a living wage policy. We are talking about cleaners, caterers and carers&#8212;the people who quietly get on with the job of keeping the country running.</p><p>I was pleased this week to hear the Health and Sport Committee recommend a living wage for all carers, because our elderly deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and that is best achieved by ensuring that those who work with elderly and vulnerable people have the dignity of decent work and of decent employment conditions. The reality is that that is not the case at present.</p><p>There is a prevalence of carers in Scotland who work on zero-hour contracts and who literally sit in car parks, waiting for the phone to ring. Such people are juggling two or three jobs just to earn enough money to get by. It is worth remembering that that is how the living wage movement was born&#8212;through women trying to work out how they were going to juggle life with their childcare commitments, making ends meet and paying their bills. London citizens came together and worked out that the solution was a living wage, and that is how the campaign that we are talking about today began.</p><p>The benefits of a living wage have been well rehearsed, not least in this chamber over the past seven days. It produces happier, healthier and more productive workers. It reduces absenteeism and delivers higher retention rates. One of its less well-recognised benefits is reduced childcare costs. If women work fewer hours to earn the same amount of money, they can get home at the end of the day and read their child a story, make their tea and have the important and valuable social time with their kids and families that will be of benefit to the child&#8217;s development throughout life. It is worth remembering that the benefit of a living wage is both social and economic.</p><p>I was pleased to hear the First Minister talk about the living wage during First Minister&#8217;s question time today. The fact that he addressed the issue during the prime-time event of our political week tells us just how far the campaign has come. He made a slight mistake, however, when he said that the living wage was &#163;7.23 an hour. Moreover, in his lecture at the London School of Economics a couple of weeks ago, he said that it was &#163;7.30 an hour. The living wage is, of course, &#163;7.20 an hour, so will the minister tell us whether the First Minister&#8217;s intention was to slip in an early gift for low-paid workers throughout Scotland, or was it a genuine mistake?</p><p>Finally, at the end of my speech in last week&#8217;s debate, I asked the minister whether he could commit his Government to ensuring that the living wage would be uprated for every year of this parliamentary session, but he gently dodged the question. I therefore ask him that question once again and hope that he will answer it in when he closes the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662943", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate John Park on securing the debate.

I am sorry to disappoint him, but, sadly, the Scottish National Party-led council in Edinburgh is not one of those local authorities, so it was a little bit cheeky of Colin Keir to have a go at Alison Johnstone in that regard.

However, it is also an opportunity that should not be wasted. The Scottish Government has a serious opportunity to address structural unemployment in the system. A crude approach to the crisis would be simply to focus on economic growth, in recognition that its return will alleviate the situation by creating graduate and highly skilled jobs, which in turn will sort out the displacement in the market that is pushing the harder-to-reach young people even further away from jobs.</p><p>That is a comfortable but complacent place for the Scottish National Party to be, as it allows the Government to sit back and profess that it does not have the economic levers of power to effect change.

The number of long-term unemployed young people in Scotland has doubled in the past six months. The reports of the countless academic studies on wage scarring show the impact of worklessness on young people and on their health and life chances. Those young people need serious interventions and support, not just to get them job ready but to provide life skills. They need the ability and will to get out of bed and out of a house that is dominated by worklessness. They need life skills to cope with budgeting, relationships and the stresses and strains of a life of work.</p><p>Countless schemes are delivered by a multitude of agencies that work in that area, from small organisations such as the Canongate Youth Project to the giants such as the Wise Group, Rathbone, Barnardo&#8217;s and Children in Scotland. Since my appointment, I have visited or met representatives of dozens of projects and heard the resounding message that is emanating from all of them: that the mechanics of funding are letting people down. An example is the Barnardo&#8217;s works programme, which is delivered in five different locations in Scotland. I have seen at first hand how that incredibly successful programme delivers for young people across the north of Edinburgh. Finance for the programme works on a year-by-year basis, with no fewer than 14 different funding providers, each of which has its own planning cycles, conditions, measurements and evaluation processes. It is one person&#8217;s job simply to manage all that. The last three months of each financial year are spent in complete inertia, sitting with a giant calculator desperately trying to predict how many places can be offered in the future. Meanwhile, the young people sit around desperately asking, &#8220;When will there be jobs?&#8221;</p><p>Staff members dedicate their working lives to supporting the young people we are talking about today. They know what the young people need, and they know how to deliver it. They could do so much more if they were simply freed from the shackles of bureaucracy.

I was taken with Fiona McLeod&#8217;s speech&#8212;in particular, the points that she made about information literacy and the processes that we use to find information, evaluate it and apply what we know to what we do. There are lessons for the cabinet secretary and&#8212;I will be generous&#8212;for us all in how we use the information that we learn in debates such as this one.</p><p>As I said, I welcome the opportunity to contribute and I intend to focus my efforts on aspiration and the college system. However, I will start by passing comment on the school league tables that came out just before Christmas.</p><p>I was shocked to discover that there are three schools in Edinburgh in which not a single child in either 2010 or 2011 achieved more than three highers. I find that to be an utterly shocking statistic. I accept that there are all sorts of caveats around league tables, and I will come on to them in a second, but I cannot tolerate a culture in which the aspiration for our kids reaches different levels and heights in different schools in different towns. That is not what equality of opportunity is about or what we should seek to progress in this chamber.</p><p>If our system limits ambition by lowering the ceiling, we cannot blame anybody other than ourselves for kids&#8217; inability to touch that ceiling. The expectations are set by schools, family and society. We need movement away from comments such as, &#8220;You&#8217;ll always be trouble&#8221; by parents or people in schools, towards the teacher who lifts a kid up by believing in them and giving opportunities. As a Parliament and Government, we need constantly to remind ourselves of those key facts.</p><p>There are legitimate caveats to use of school league tables. They are a very blunt measure, and they suggest that there are de facto bad schools, when many of the schools that perform badly in the league tables are good schools, often because they lead the way by doing things differently or use alternative and creative approaches in how they deliver the curriculum. Many such schools place greater emphasis on vocational courses and pathways for progression. They also tend to have earlier and stronger links with business. They have people in the classroom who use their capacity to empower kids with pathways into work straight from school that are not necessarily through the education system. That is very important.</p><p>We know that the skills needs of our economy are ever changing, but the one consistent fact is that we need skills&#8212;we need a highly skilled and highly educated workforce. Our colleges play a pivotal role in delivering that. That is why it is with utter dismay that Labour considers the SNP Government&#8217;s &#163;17&#160;million-worth of cuts to further education budgets. As Liz Smith said earlier, that is blatantly illogical, given the Government&#8217;s wider aspirations. I worry very much about the decisions that college principals are facing at the moment with regard to the budgets on their desks and the choices that they have to make between cutting places or courses, and about incorporating the needs of the economy with the desires of learners. For example, refitting and mechanical engineering courses are expensive to run and, by cutting those courses, college principals can save a lot of money per head and maintain places on a wider level.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658693", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People (Improving Learning Outcomes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.

We in the Labour Party accept the economic challenges that we face, but there are obvious concerns about the impact that the Government&#8217;s approach will have in communities. Kids in Craigmillar are understandably concerned about being asked to travel to Sighthill or to Telford College to study, if they do not have the financial mechanisms to deal with the travel costs. However, the changes mean that they might have to make those journeys, as we might have courses only in one part of Edinburgh rather than right across it.</p><p>For a wee while before I came to work in this building, I worked for the National Union of Students and I was involved in drafting its policies in the run-up to the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections. During that process, we talked about a guaranteed minimum income for students of &#163;7,000, and it was great to see many political parties adopting that as a policy. However, we also expressed a wider concern and made a philosophical request for Governments and political parties to lead a cultural change around parity of esteem. I am still concerned that Scottish culture and society view college places as being secondary to university places and do not view apprenticeships as being as worthy as academic degrees.

We are talking about the legacy of the games to sport, to skills, to the health of our nation, to the regeneration of Glasgow and beyond, and to our economy. Ultimately, legacy is about how we better ourselves and our nation for the next generations that follow us, and for me that is what politics is all about.</p><p>We have heard some great speeches covering various aspects of what legacy means. On health, I felt that Neil Bibby made some excellent points about physical literacy and the fact that sport brings confidence to young people and allows them to access new disciplines that they may never have seen or experienced before. That is incredibly valuable in its own right.</p><p>John Mason, Sandra White and Bob Doris all talked eloquently about the facilities that they will see in their constituencies in Glasgow and the legacy that they will bring to the communities that they represent. Hanzala Malik talked about the important role that the legacy can bring in community cohesion and the integration of communities across Glasgow.</p><p>I thought that Tavish Scott spoke very well about the contribution of the games to the economy. In particular, he made a point about the legacy of the games in tough economic times and the fact that we need to keep faith and encourage people to keep faith in the economic benefits when they might see other ways of spending public money as better. There is a great job to be done, and I welcome Tavish Scott&#8217;s comment about publishing the lists of Scottish companies that have benefited from the games to promote that agenda more widely. He made a very salient point.</p><p>I will spend the time that I have left talking about skills and sport together. Neil Bibby talked about two Glasgow City Council initiatives&#8212;the Commonwealth jobs fund and the Commonwealth graduate fund&#8212;that seek to bring them together. The Commonwealth jobs fund aims to create 1,000 jobs that are targeted to 18 to 24-year-olds who have been without employment for six months or more. Personally, I was impressed to see that priority is being given to living wage employers, which is important in progressing the case for the living wage.</p><p>The Commonwealth graduate fund is worth &#163;10 million over four years and seeks to create 1,000 graduate jobs. That is important considering youth unemployment, particularly when there is so much displacement within the jobs market and underemployment in the market itself. Similar to the jobs fund, the graduate fund is focused on graduates who have been without employment for six months or more.</p><p>There is also a role for the future jobs fund. I am aware that the Scottish Sports Association has taken on 67 young people through that scheme, which to the association is the equivalent of &#163;435,000-worth of investment. That is money used to create new roles in sports administration, coaching, information technology and sports development.</p><p>Coaching in itself is particularly interesting. I notice that hockey bodies have picked up the opportunities more than other sports have done, because they recognise that they provide the ability not just to coach people in hockey skills and allow them to take those coaching skills into the classroom, but to increase the capacity of the active schools programmes. More coaches are created, and they can then go into schools and deliver the sport. We need to recognise the value of that and encourage more of the same by ensuring that, when we need new coaches, we give them the business skills that they need to be the self-employers that they so often are. We need to remove any barriers to that development.</p><p>I recognise that the community jobs fund does much of the same work, but I am conscious that the future of that particular pot of money is unknown beyond March. I am sure that the Scottish Government would not be daft enough to get rid of the fund, so perhaps it could look at enhancing it by developing a specific sports strand that could form part of a wider legacy of the games.</p><p>I want to talk about volunteering, which John Mason touched on. I read with great interest the Manchester legacy paper, which talked about volunteering opportunities for more than 10,000 people in Manchester and greater Manchester. What was interesting about that was that 24 per cent of those people were volunteering for the first time; 47 per cent said that they had learnt new skills; and 20 per cent reported improved employment chances following that experience, which I thought was very important.</p><p>There were a mixture of volunteering opportunities around transport, event organisation, security, technology and indeed supporting the ceremonies themselves. There is a mix of volunteering opportunities with which to engage. I was interested to see that, of the 10,000 volunteers in Manchester, 2,250 came out with a level 1 qualification&#8212;they were accredited for the volunteering work that they had done. Does the Scottish Government have plans to ensure that people who volunteer in the Glasgow games get the same accreditation for the experience that they are about to put themselves through?</p><p>I recognise that the personal best scheme is mentioned on the Commonwealth games website. Although it is a very welcome scheme, which seeks to work with those who are perhaps furthest removed from the jobs market, it is very small scale, in that only 127 opportunities have been taken up so far. How many opportunities would the minister like to see being taken up by the time that the games come round in 2014? Perhaps the Government will match the ambition&#8212;and indeed the delivery&#8212;of Manchester in that regard, as it brought more than 2,000 accredited positions.</p><p>The Alliance of Sector Skills Councils Scotland report on delivering the skills for the games recommended that perhaps 10 per cent of the opportunities that the games create could be ring fenced&#8212;for want of a better term&#8212;for those who are disadvantaged in the labour market. Perhaps there is a role there to ensure that it is not just the same faces and the same people who benefit from the games.</p><p>The report made important points about the use of community benefit clauses, which I encourage the minister to look at more closely, not just with regard to the games but in a wider sense across Scotland in the procurement processes that we go through. It also made recommendations around the use of student placements and the secondment of employees across the different partnership organisations involved with the games to ensure that we feel the benefit of the games across a number of aspects of civic society and across public bodies.</p><p>I read a little bit of the organising committee&#8217;s report on progress on the games so far, which paid particular tribute to the Government and the various other agencies involved with regard to the strength of partnership that has been delivered. It is in that spirit that Labour comes to the chamber to say, &#8220;Please work with us.

We wanted to see the living wage in the Scottish Government and we are pleased that it has been delivered. We want to see it for directly employed local authority staff, and some progress remains to be made there. We want to see it implemented through tendered local authority contracts. When we get to that point, we will have a critical mass that will force change in the private sector. In order to make that journey, we need political leadership. My party differs from the member&#8217;s party in its willingness to drive that culture change all the way through the process.</p><p>Some 350,000 people in Scotland earn less than &#163;7.20 an hour. It is a huge challenge for us to address that, particularly as it is those people who are most susceptible to the pressures of the cost of living such as increases in VAT and so on. The living wage has value and benefits for employers through reduced sickness, a more stable workforce and better performance. There is also value in the increased life chances and experience of the workers themselves. That is important to the local economy because of the buying power of low-paid workers. All the evidence points to the fact the lowest paid spend most of their money in their local economy. If we raise their wages, we are supporting and stabilising our local economies and the communities that we are here to represent. The Scottish living wage campaign report states that, for every &#163;1 of the living wage, &#163;1.63 is generated in the local economy. That makes an important point about the relevance of the living wage to all the economic issues that we are discussing.</p><p>There are many workforce-related issues in Labour&#8217;s amendment, but I would like the Scottish Government to commit to a living wage to address some of the wider issues that we talk about. Six out of 10 children who live in poverty come from households in which at least one parent or guardian is working, so child poverty is an important economic issue. When the Joseph Rowntree Foundation gave evidence as part of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee&#8217;s living wage inquiry this morning, it stated that child poverty costs the UK economy &#163;25 billion a year. That is the cost of providing services to children who are living in poverty and covering the loss of earnings by those adults who have not made it into the labour market. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that &#163;17 billion of that money could be brought back directly to the Exchequer if we meet the target to eradicate child poverty by 2020.

I apologise to Mr Gibson.</p><p>That is why I am so disappointed to see the UK Government do two key things. The first was to scrap the proposed increase in child tax credit. Kevin Stewart mentioned that earlier. The second was to drop the commitment that was enshrined in the Child Poverty Act 2010, which is barely a year old, to measure poverty in relative terms. The UK Government&#8217;s own figures show that child poverty is likely to increase by 100,000.</p><p>I would go a bit further than Mr Stewart and say that the Scottish Government has a duty to play its part in challenging the changes to the child tax credit arrangements.

I would like to see more support for those kids, and I am pleased that the City of Edinburgh Council has this year allocated money to every secondary school to allow each school to find the employability training that it deems most appropriate for its kids. I commend Sue Bruce, the chief executive of the council, for taking such a strong lead on the issue. I only wish that the elected politicians around her had cared as much about it, as it is because of their failings that she has been left to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Just before the recess, I had the enjoyable experience of presenting awards to people who had participated in the Edinburgh challenge project, a joint initiative between Rathbone and Action for Children in Edinburgh that was about the redevelopment of King George V park, in Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s constituency. Fourteen kids out of the 538 that I have mentioned were given six weeks to redevelop a park that they used to trash&#8212;they were graffiti-ing, smoking and drinking there. Through a six-week programme that was given a little bit of money, they rebuilt the park. The experience was amazing and taught them a huge amount about the working environment that they seek to be part of. I met a young guy called Lloyd, who, following his involvement in the six-week programme, moved to a work placement that is half paid for by Rathbone and half paid for by his local employer. Lloyd just wants a job. He hated school and he cannot go to college; all that he wants is an opportunity to work. He could not be a nicer, more ambitious guy. I want the best for him and an opportunity for him to get a job. Had Lloyd been given an activity agreement with two hours of contact time a week for a whole year, he would never have gained the experience that he gained in the park&#8212;six weeks of full-time work experience that allowed him to get a work placement.</p><p>I ask the Government to acknowledge that there are a multitude of ways of delivering on its policy commitment for 16 to 19-year-olds. If it just gives every kid who comes out of school with no positive destination two hours of contact time a week, it will fail them.

It is vital that the Scottish Parliament devotes considerable energy and resources to considering and addressing this.&#8221;</p><p>Those are not my words; they are the words of five of Scotland&#8217;s biggest children&#8217;s charities. I welcome the fact that we are debating them.</p><p>Alongside Marco Biagi, I have taken on the role of convening the cross-party group on children and young people. We had a very productive meeting last week that focused specifically on welfare reform. A number of members who are in the chamber attended that meeting.</p><p>I will focus on the impacts of the Welfare Reform Bill on children and young people. I will list a few of them first and then focus on one aspect: child maintenance, on which Annabelle Ewing touched.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to put to the ministers four key issues that came up at the cross-party group meeting. Action for Children Scotland expressed concerns that, under the bill, claimants with dependent children would face sanctions if they could not access appropriate childcare. One Parent Families Scotland highlighted the concern that lone parents with children over five years old would have problems seeking employment because of a rule change. Children in Scotland highlighted the point that childcare costs mean that, contrary to popular belief, work does not pay for most families in Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Child Law centre also made an interesting point. It highlighted the possible impact of the reforms on the minute of agreement for separating couples, which is unique to Scotland. It is a formal, signed agreement on the division of assets and custody. The bill seems to threaten it.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of the bill is the proposed changes to the child maintenance system. I have worked closely on that issue with Sheila Gilmore, the member of Parliament for Edinburgh East. She is also the chair of the all-party group on welfare reform at Westminster and is in the gallery listening to the debate so that she can use it in her work in Westminster.</p><p>With its child maintenance proposals, the Tory-led Government is trying to encourage people to make their own arrangements with their ex-partner for the care of their child. If the lone parent needs the state to intervene, they will have to pay for it. That is about the Tory Government putting the taxpayer&#8217;s welfare before the child&#8217;s, and it is absolutely disgusting.</p><p>There will be a one-off fee of &#163;100 for the use of the state system, although the fee will be &#163;50 for someone on benefits&#8212;a small concession. The state will also charge the non-caring parent an additional 15 to 20 per cent of each monthly maintenance sum. As if that was not enough, for the privilege of state intervention, the caring parent will also have to surrender to the Government between 7 and 12 per cent of the money that they receive monthly.</p><p>If the Tory Government cares about the big picture, why on earth does it seek to profit from broken marriages? It must realise that, if parenting is everything, the environment that it creates to help families to stay together and to cope when they do not is critical.</p><p>There is a specifically Scottish dimension to the matter as well: the bill requires the new child maintenance system to be implemented through sure start centres, which simply do not exist in Scotland. Therefore, the Scottish Government will have to come up with an alternative way of dealing with implementation.</p><p>In June, I lodged a parliamentary question to ask whether any work was being done to assess the impact of the changes on child maintenance. In her answer, Roseanna Cunningham said that no work had been done. I then wrote to her to ask whether she would model the impact on Scotland to decide what could be done to address it. She wrote back saying that she had no plans to model the impact of the changes.</p><p>What does that tell us? I suggest that it tells us that the Scottish Government is taking a very relaxed, perhaps even complacent, approach to the distinct areas that it has the power to address now. That view is shared by One Parent Families Scotland, which was, in its words, &#8220;very disappointed&#8221; with the response that Roseanna Cunningham gave me, which, naturally, I shared with it.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government will back Labour&#8217;s amendment to vote down the forthcoming legislative consent motion, recognising that much more scrutiny needs to take place.</p><p>I will give the Presiding Officer a minute of his time back, but I will first focus on the issue of child poverty for a second. Nicola Sturgeon made a comment in her opening speech about how child poverty in Scotland had come down since 1994. However, she will also be aware that little or no progress has been made since 2005, on her watch and on the SNP Government&#8217;s watch. I refer her to her own child poverty strategy, which states:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government will encourage individuals and organisations to share emerging analysis of local and national impacts as they become known. This analysis will help to inform Scottish Ministers as well as other organisations seeking to secure positive change in the lives of the people of Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>In the light of that reference to welfare reform in her child poverty strategy, will she back Save the Children&#8217;s call today to publish information about the impact of the bill on tackling child poverty and take steps to mitigate the impact of the changes on child poverty in Scotland?</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652497", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, there is &#8220;no doubt that no other piece of UK legislation will have such a direct and indirect effect on the people of Scotland, particularly some of the poorest and most vulnerable families in our society, and on our capacity to run our own affairs in those areas which are devolved to Scottish control.

I appreciate that it is a consultation, and I would like to take the opportunity today to discuss the relationship between drugs, mental health and inequalities.</p><p>I think it was Mary Scanlon who said earlier that addiction is self-medication. That is right, but I would say that addiction is also a form of self-harm. Figures from the Scottish Drugs Forum show that 40 per cent of mental health service users have addictions but only 5 per cent of them access treatment. We must remember that mental health services play an important role in referring people to other services in the health service that they might need. In the light of the Christie commission&#8217;s report, that fact shows that an emphasis on prevention and addressing failure demand should be absolutely at the heart of the mental health strategy&#8212;I hope to develop that point during my speech.</p><p>I have spent some time as an advocate in Edinburgh for three people with complex and multiple needs who had problems with their homelessness situation. Those individuals had a background of homelessness, but they also had complex needs relating to learning disabilities, a history of abuse, addictions, numerous mental health conditions&#8212;some really difficult life stories. I was very privileged to work with them over the past couple of years&#8212;it absolutely changed my life; through having them share their experiences with me, I have understood how the state systematically fails people with chaotic lifestyles. There is a huge human rights issue in that, but there is also a huge issue for the public purse&#8212;I will develop that point.</p><p>I would like to see more of the Christie commission principles around shared working, community empowerment and addressing failure demand at the heart of the mental health strategy. In that regard, I will take a moment to concentrate on why people take drugs. In my experience, people take drugs to escape life. There might be a multitude of factors involved in that, but that is the reason why they do it. Drugs offer people a crutch. When we ask people to stop taking drugs and step on to a pathway towards recovery, we see the end point of that recovery as their no longer taking drugs. We ask them to return clean to the same community from which they chose to escape by taking drugs. We fix their medical and psychological dependencies, but in doing so we stir up a lot of emotions that they have sought to sedate for years and years by taking drugs. We do not leave them with the support mechanisms to cope, remain clean, sustain a tenancy, pay bills, seek and retain work, and live the life that so many of us take for granted. Without specialised mental health support that is not clinical or medical, we are setting those people up to fail. The inability to cope with life as they see it without drugs leaves them to go round the corner to score drugs again and to go back on that pathway to escape a life with which they simply cannot cope.</p><p>We need to focus on the fact that there is an immense social and human cost to relapse. We see people who relapse in our prison cells, our police stations and our accident and emergency departments. Those costs can easily be evaluated, but what we do not see is the collateral damage that a relapse causes to a community that is already beset by drugs. That impact is very hard to evaluate, but it is so deep.</p><p>There is also a personal consequence for people who relapse. A relapse leads to even poorer mental health. In that, there is an issue about a lack of self-worth and people not feeling that their life is worth living, which increases suicide rates. The Scottish Drugs Forum has in the past questioned overdose statistics, asking how many of the people who overdosed did so intentionally. The answer is that we do not know the difference between somebody having an accident and someone deliberately choosing to overdose in such situations.</p><p>People in recovery need access to support for their mental health. That is a social point, not a clinical point and I would be very grateful to the minister if he would comment on it in his response to the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have read the mental health strategy and, like Mary Scanlon, I was a little disappointed to find that it was so NHS-focused, and that there was no reference to drugs or addiction.

Last night, I went to the briefing that was mentioned earlier, to hear what we were promised would be new information around the minimum pricing model in Canada. However, I do not think that I was at the same meeting as James Dornan and others, because I still remain unconvinced after hearing that evidence. There is no doubt that price is a factor and that harmful drinkers are the most susceptible to price. At last night&#8217;s briefing, Professor Tim Stockwell told us about the situation in Canada. He said that people had asked what harmful drinkers who simply could not buy drink would do, and informed us that the answer was that they stopped, and that that decision to stop drinking gets them on to a pathway to recovery. That might be a success story, but to me it seems to be a particularly inhumane approach to helping harmful drinkers get out of their addictions. It is like starving a rabbit out of a hole.</p><p>I want to move on to the issue of problematic drinkers. That is the problem in Scotland: the people who hold down jobs, have families and live successful lives but drink far too much. The problem with minimum unit pricing is that the price of wine would not change one little bit. Under the SNP&#8217;s proposal, the minimum price for a bottle of wine would be around &#163;4.50, which is still three times cheaper than a trip to the cinema, with popcorn included. That is not going to drive a major cultural change in Scotland&#8217;s attitude to alcohol.</p><p>I agree with one aspect of the motion, which is that we need a &#8220;package of measures&#8221; to deal with Scotland&#8217;s alcohol problems. That is why I look forward to some of the measures that are being brought in on 1 October as a result of the 2010 act, including the cutting down of major discounting, such as three-for-&#163;10 offers on bottles of wine. That, not minimum unit pricing, is the way in which to change the price of alcohol.</p><p>The Labour Party is thoroughly committed to tackling and addressing Scotland&#8217;s attitude to drink, but the SNP must accept that minimum unit pricing alone is not going to deliver that change, and it is certainly not going to tackle problematic drinking in the way that we need it to be tackled.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651953", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would prefer to move on, if that is okay&#8212;another day.

I acknowledge the work that Save the Children has done in providing briefings for all of us, and I know that much of the evidence and the facts that they have provided us with will come up in members&#8217; speeches.</p><p>I want to talk briefly about the living wage and, if I can find the time, college provision. Jamie Hepburn&#8217;s motion says that supporting the poorest parents into work is the best way to tackle child poverty. I agree, but I also think that that work must be quality work. To my mind, what is needed are good jobs that provide a greater degree of security and which pay a decent living wage. I know that the Scottish National Party and Labour agree on that, as their support for the campaign for a living wage shows.</p><p>I welcome the commitment that the Scottish Government announced yesterday to uprate the current living wage to &#163;7.20 an hour. The minister will be aware that I revealed that 1,000 Scottish Government employees were entitled to the living wage but were not getting it. I am pleased to say that the wages of a number of those employees are now being uprated, and are being backdated, but there are still some areas in which that process is not quite complete.</p><p>The minister might also be aware that, last week, the campaign for a living wage revealed that across Scotland 16,000 employees who are employed directly by local authorities receive less than &#163;7.20 an hour. I appreciate that the Scottish Government cannot demand that they be paid at least the living wage, but it has a political role to play in demonstrating leadership and the capacity of the living wage to help people work their way out of poverty. I certainly feel that if the Scottish Government and the local authorities demanded that all their employees be paid the living wage and built that into tendering contracts, we would drive a cultural change in the private sector that would benefit people right across Scotland. The Government has a leadership role to play in that regard.</p><p>On working conditions, there is an issue with temporary posts, zero-hour contracts and poor pay and conditions, which make getting and retaining a job extremely difficult. For some families, the thought that a temporary post might put them back on the job market in a few months&#8217; time means that they will not bother going for such a job, because they will lose their jobseekers allowance and will have to wait six weeks to get that money back in their pockets. Frankly, that is just too big a risk. Therefore, we need to ensure that the jobs on offer are quality jobs.</p><p>In the time that is left, I want to talk about college provision. I recently visited Jewel and Esk College in Edinburgh Eastern, which is an excellent college that does tremendous work. I was very interested to hear what it had to say about childcare support and the allocations for that to further education colleges. Until I visited the college, I did not realise that the allocations are based on historical uptake. In other words, the money that colleges get is based on the number of students that they used to have who had children to look after. That means that we always address the situation in the past but never drive cultural change for the future. If we want to get into colleges more students who care for children, we need to be more up front about the type of provision that we can offer them.</p><p>It is important to recognise that colleges deal with the situation in different ways. Jewel and Esk College provides childcare support directly to the student, while Stevenson College and Telford College pay the money to the provider. Such inconsistency across the sector does not help people who might be considering going to college for the first time. It would be great if the Government could think about running a serious advertising campaign to attract parents back into education, thereby recognising the power of education to lift people out of poverty as much as the power of work to improve their life chances.</p><p>I congratulate Jamie Hepburn on an excellent motion and an excellent speech.

I am aware that many of the staff who work in our court system are PCS members, and it would be wrong to discuss the work that they do without recognising their hard work and dedication to public service. They are striking today because of the serious attack on their living standards that is the result of measures that the UK Government has taken, and I encourage members to sign my colleague Drew Smith&#8217;s motion in support of their position.</p><p>In preparation for today&#8217;s debate, I read the interim report of the group that is chaired by Lord McCluskey, who is supported by Sir Gerald Gordon, Sheriff Charles Stoddart and Professor Neil Walker. I was fortunate enough to have been taught constitutional law by Professor Walker at the University of Aberdeen a decade or so ago, and I admit that I had hoped that I had left late nights of reading legal opinion for his class behind me but, alas, that is not the case.</p><p>Like the SNP, I am very proud of Scotland&#8217;s legal system and its proud history, which is one of the first things that students learn about at law school. We are different, and our system has been admired and plagiarised, in the best possible way, around the world.</p><p>However, I fear that the SNP, through its attempts to chastise the Supreme Court for the role that it plays, has done our legal system a disservice. Let me develop that point. The McCluskey report is right to recognise the fact that Scotland is the only devolved authority in the UK for which the Supreme Court has an unqualified right to grant special leave when the court below has not granted leave. That is an anomaly, which the report is right to raise, but it does not amount to a constitutional crisis that demands the levels of hysteria that have been displayed by the justice secretary and the First Minister.</p><p>For me, the answer is not to narrow the role of the Supreme Court in Scotland, but to refine it by addressing the anomalies that exist and to use it to our advantage. For as long as Scotland is part of the UK, which is the signatory to the convention and is therefore accountable for its application, that is the right and proper way to function.</p><p>The McCluskey report argues that the Supreme Court should have a role in identifying the law that the criminal courts apply, but that that law should be remitted back to the High Court for application. Paragraph 60 of the report says:</p><p>&#8220;Once the Supreme Court has defined and expressed the law applicable in response to the point of general public importance raised in the certificate, the High Court of Justiciary should be able to apply that law to the case in hand. This method of proceeding would ensure that the Supreme Court, in dealing with its human rights jurisdiction in criminal cases, would concentrate on identifying and articulating clearly the relevant law contained in the Human Rights Act and would not proceed to decide the case as if it were the High Court of Justiciary. In this way the traditional role of the High Court of Justiciary would be preserved.&#8221;</p><p>That might make uncomfortable reading for Government ministers, coming, as it does, in a report that they commissioned, but it strikes me, at this early stage, as being a sensible and legally sound position to adopt.</p><p>The report goes on to discuss briefly the prospect of the High Court seeking a ruling from the Supreme Court on a point of human rights law before trial. Actively seeking the Supreme Court&#8217;s guidance on the application of human rights law prior to the commencement of a trial could, arguably, speed up the justice process and improve the finality of decisions. That is an extremely interesting prospect, and I look forward to reading more on the detail of that idea in the final report of Lord McCluskey and his team. I acknowledge that, as other members of my party have said, the report that we are discussing is an interim report and that much more evidence needs to be gathered before any real conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>I do not accept that the integrity of Scots law is under attack from an English court. I am firmly of the view that the application of our law needs to be read alongside our duties under human rights legislation, and I am as proud of our country&#8217;s human rights laws as I am of the Parliament. Freedom of expression and the right to privacy, life, freedom from torture, a fair trial and freedom of thought, conscience and religion are all fundamental to a free and fair society. The Supreme Court exists to protects those rights, and we will undermine them if we choose to make this debate about a constitutional question about Scotland&#8217;s relationship with its neighbour. We have a duty as parliamentarians to reaffirm why those rights exist and to recognise that there is no hierarchy of rights between law-abiding and law-breaking individuals. As my colleague Graeme Pearson said, &#8220;vile people&#8221;&#8212;the First Minister used that term&#8212;go to jail not for who they are, but for what they have done. When we send people to prison, we remove their liberties, but not their rights. That said, the public debate about human rights in action would benefit from more positive stories about their capacity to protect victims and vulnerable people.</p><p>The Scottish people&#8217;s choice of Government is indisputable, but their future constitutional preference is not. Government ministers&#8217; attempts to cut off the Supreme Court and remove it from the jurisdiction of our land to raise the spectre of independence are not just poor politics; they border on abusing the rule of law. That is why I welcome Lord McCluskey&#8217;s thoughtful and sound interim report and look forward to seeing the continuation of the debate surrounding the Supreme Court.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649724", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill (Supreme Court)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome the opportunity to take part in today&#8217;s debate on the Supreme Court.

I strongly encourage members to consider signing my motion on the Edinburgh festivals, S4M-00161, and to book as many shows as they can, now.</p><p>In the time available, I hope to cover two issues: crime fiction and Scottish theatre. The writer Denise Mina wrote a fascinating piece for the British Council a few years ago about how we classify culture. As a nation, we consider opera, ballet and theatre to be high art, while we classify musical theatre and crime fiction as being somewhat lowbrow. She argued that the real distinction should be between good and bad work&#8212;there are terrible operas and great crime novels.</p><p>Scotland certainly excels at crime fiction. From Inspector Rebus to Carol Jordan, and from DI Steel to Bob Skinner, our home-grown writers produce characters that not only sell hundreds of thousands of books but lead to television series and film productions that continue to entertain our people and power our economy. Nine out of 10 of the most borrowed books from libraries and the top three novels that were sold at Waverley station last week were crime novels.</p><p>Crime fiction is something that we, as a nation, simply cannot get enough of. As well as being a cultural commodity that we consume under desks and on buses and beaches, quickly and feverishly, it has the power to drive social change, or at least to inform social attitudes. Ian Rankin's &#8220;Fleshmarket Close&#8221; looked at the life of asylum seekers living in Scotland, while Stuart MacBride&#8217;s &#8220;Cold Granite&#8221; looked at the perilous livelihoods of Aberdeen sex workers. They are examples of narrative that seeks to make sense of our country&#8217;s ills at the same time as shocking, amusing, horrifying but, ultimately, entertaining. I am sure that the minister recognises the value of our home-grown crime-writing talent, and I hope that she will do everything that she can to encourage and support the next generation of Scottish writers.</p><p>Moving from MacBride to Macbeth, I pay tribute to the excellent production of &#8220;Dunsinane&#8221; that recently finished a run at both the Royal Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh and the Citizens in Glasgow. The play, which was written by the Edinburgh-born David Greig, originally ran at the Hampstead theatre in London and was brought to Scotland by the National Theatre of Scotland in conjunction with the Lyceum. It has now returned to Hampstead with its Lyceum cast.</p><p>When I spoke to Alex McGowan, the director of the Lyceum, earlier this week, he had many interesting comments to make, one of which was to do with the conditions of the grants that Creative Scotland gives to theatres. At present, a company is allowed to use only 15 per cent of its grant to take its production out of Scotland. I wonder whether that is inhibiting the ability of our home-grown writing, acting and production talent to take their work beyond our borders. I would welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s views on that point.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649457", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Culture and External Affairs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am thrilled to take part in the debate as an MSP who lives in, and now represents, a city whose cultural scene is renowned around the world.

However, a word of caution must be aired about co-productions, particularly if they are to become the norm in light of the difficult financial climate.

In fact, I did my very best to avoid being elected. I spent the past 18 months campaigning for Ewan Aitken, the Labour candidate who stood against the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Edinburgh Eastern. Ewan would have been an outstanding addition to the Parliament&#8212;I am sure that that is one thing that Mr MacAskill and I can agree on. It was undoubtedly a bad night for our party, but we cannot afford to grieve for too long. More than 70,000 people in the Lothians trusted their vote with Labour, and I must do right by them.</p><p>However, every member in the chamber carries a weight of deep responsibility, not least the new Government ministers, whom I welcome to their roles. The potential that the SNP Government has to effect real and lasting change according to its party&#8217;s values is far greater than that of any Government that has preceded it. No compromises means no excuses. It must use the opportunity wisely and focus on the issues that really matter to the people whom we seek collectively to represent.</p><p>With that sentiment, I turn to child poverty. Today, the First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;Elsewhere in these islands, the tolerance of the poor is being tested. Budgets are being slashed, priorities have been changed, and hope has been crushed by the braying tones of people who claim to know best.&#8221;</p><p>That might be true, First Minister, but it is also happening here, in your Scotland. The brutal truth is that just over 200,000 children in Scotland live in relative poverty today. In the history of the Parliament, that number has only ever gone down under Labour and up under the SNP.</p><p>I have in my hand the &#8220;Child Poverty Strategy for Scotland&#8221;, which was launched by the Deputy First Minister a week before Parliament was dissolved. Today, the First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;Our vision is of a nation that is fair and just, and fertile for ambition and talent, where the deepest challenges we face are first acknowledged and then tackled head on.&#8221;</p><p>If that is true, why was the child poverty strategy document the final action of the last Government rather than its first? It is for the Government to prove that the strategy is more than a gesture or a box-ticking exercise through early and decisive action on child poverty during the lifetime of this Parliament.</p><p>To give it credit, the strategy document recognises that little progress has been made since 2004-05 and that</p><p>&#8220;further and faster progress must be made.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to say that the</p><p>&#8220;recession does not widen the risk of poverty. It increases it for those people already most at risk of becoming poor, or remaining in poverty for longer.&#8221;</p><p>It therefore follows that the Government must double its efforts simply to maintain the status quo. Child poverty is so deep-rooted and entrenched in our society that this must be the Government that makes serious in-roads if we, as a nation, are to have any prospect of achieving the 2020 target of eradicating child poverty. We must have that 2020 vision. I admire the SNP for its chutzpah and its passion for separation, however misguided. I only wish that it had the same fire in its belly for tackling poverty.</p><p>We have heard much today about a social wage, but whatever happened to the pact or promise for a living wage? Why is the Government so coy about producing an early years bill, and so shy about providing nursery places for vulnerable two-year-olds? While the SNP hopes for and aspires to an independent Scotland, the Prince&#8217;s Trust has produced a report that says that one in four young people has lost the ability to hope at all. It warns of a developing youth underclass in our country. Those young people want and are able to work, but they need real support in the transition from school to adulthood, and from training programmes to the workplace.</p><p>My first official engagement as an MSP was to visit the Canongate Youth Project, which is an innovative organisation that has been working with young people in Edinburgh since 1977. I was astonished to hear those young people talking about their lives&#8212;how they consider their community to be a dump and how they hate the police, and to hear them boast about living for the weekend and a chance to drink and lark with their friends.</p><p>When pushed and given the opportunity to really express themselves, they opened up a little and explained how they felt harassed by the police. They walk in numbers because they fear for their own safety, but the police seek to break them up. They are regularly stopped and searched&#8212;sometimes, they feel, with good reason but sometimes without. Their experience of life in their community has left them without self-respect and without good reason to hope.</p><p>The voices of those young people must be heard in Parliament. Their stories and lives should inform what we do, for&#8212;ultimately&#8212;it is their Scotland that we in Parliament seek to make better in all the work that we do. I worry that the more that the Parliament wrangles over constitutions, procedures and powers, the further it gets from addressing the needs of the people who need that the most.</p><p>We have been elected to hope, aspire and lead. We have that luxury, but we must use it wisely.</p>", "hdate": "2011-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.
