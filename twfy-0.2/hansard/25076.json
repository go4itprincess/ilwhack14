We often say that debates are important, but I cannot think of many debates that are more important than one on how we protect our children from harm and from sexual exploitation.</p><p>I thank Dave Stewart and the other Public Petitions Committee members for their inquiry. I know that they have spent a great deal of time investigating the causes of child exploitation and investigating the actions that governments national and local, and all relevant authorities need to take to prevent children from being sexually exploited. I also thank Barnardo&#8217;s for lodging its important petition in the first place.</p><p>I was a member of the Public Petitions Committee from May to December 2011 and remember when the petition was first lodged; it is clear that the inquiry was a lengthy piece of work by the committee. We all need to recognise that the issue probably deserves more prominence than it has been given in the past. I am not saying that any of us, or that any organisation, does not think that it is an important issue, and I welcome the actions that the minister has set out on behalf of the Scottish Government. However, I think that it is fair to say that the issue has not until now had the prominence that it requires, which is why the Barnardo&#8217;s petition and the work of the Public Petitions Committee have been so important.</p><p>As Dave Stewart outlined, the committee report proposes a national strategy and action plan. My Labour colleagues and I whole-heartedly agree with that proposal and we expect it to be progressed as a matter of urgency. As the minister quite rightly said, a time-consuming review is not a necessity. Where there is agreement on recommendations, we would like to see those recommendations being progressed as soon as possible.</p><p>As many members have said, to tackle child sexual exploitation effectively, we must look at the extent of the problem and that means compiling and tracking statistics. When the petition first arrived at the committee, I was concerned about the issues that were raised by children&#8217;s charities including Barnardo&#8217;s about the lack of information on the number of cases of exploitation held by the authorities.</p><p>I understand that there is currently no estimate of the prevalence of child sexual exploitation in Scotland; although studies have taken place, they have been on a small scale. We should look at statistics with caution because we are, of course, talking about children, and not statistics, but we cannot address the problem properly if it is not properly understood.</p><p>I welcome the work that has been done to date and the research that has been commissioned by the Scottish Government, but we need more comprehensive research and more comprehensive data collection if we are to fully understand the extent to which such exploitation is prevalent in Scotland and what needs to be done to tackle it.</p><p>The Barnardo&#8217;s briefing that members received in advance of the debate supports a number of the report&#8217;s recommendations and highlights the importance of engaging with children through education and work in schools. I know that the committee report makes a series of recommendations around that and I echo calls from around the chamber for those recommendations to be progressed and for greater engagement with children and young people.</p><p>We are right to acknowledge the importance of effective education programmes in helping young people to recognise and report incidents of sexual abuse. Children need to know the signs of sexual exploitation, how to raise the alarm and where they can ask for help and get the support that they need. The NSPCC&#8217;s talk PANTS campaign is an example of such a programme.</p><p>As Graeme Pearson said, of course we must look at how to prevent cases from arising, but we must also better support survivors&#8212;children and adults who suffered exploitation as children. I know that the Public Petitions Committee is also currently considering petition PE1351&#8212; entitled &#8220;Time for All to be Heard&#8221;&#8212;which is about victims of institutional abuse. A number of adults across the country continue to suffer the effects of having been abused and exploited as children. I know from speaking to constituents that more needs to be done to support many survivors. I hope that the Scottish Government will work with the Public Petitions Committee and the cross-party group on adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse on that petition.</p><p>On supporting survivors, as David Torrance said, we all agree that we need safe places for children who experience sexual exploitation and other forms of abuse to go to when it is not appropriate for them to return to their family home. Therefore, like many members, I was deeply concerned to learn that the only dedicated young persons refuge, which was run by Aberlour Child Care Trust, was forced to close at the end of June last year because of a funding shortfall. Provision of refuges should be a priority for the Scottish Government, so I welcome the minister&#8217;s comments about the ministerial working group and her commitment to look again at how we support victims of child exploitation and abuse. I ask her to update Parliament and other parties on that and on how the Government will support vital support services like the Aberlour facility.</p><p>I take the opportunity to praise some of the organisations that work tirelessly to protect children from abuse and exploitation. I have mentioned Barnardo&#8217;s and Aberlour, and members have mentioned a number of other key organisations, but I particularly thank the Internet Watch Foundation, which does invaluable work in preventing sexual abuse images of children from being published on the internet&#8212;an issue that several members raised. The foundation works with the police and internet service providers to track down individuals and rings of individuals who abuse and exploit children, as well as those who share the images.</p><p>On that point, this year&#8217;s safer internet day takes place on 11 February. The day, which in the UK is organised by the UK safer internet centre, promotes safe and responsible use of online technology and mobile phones by children and young people. I encourage members and the Scottish Government to do what they can to help to raise awareness of safer internet day and the work of the Internet Watch Foundation.</p><p>As I said, the issue is clearly a serious one and many members have made a number of points about it. Effectively tackling child sexual exploitation requires a co-ordinated multi-agency response. It is essential that all services and individual practitioners take responsibility. I welcome the committee&#8217;s proposal for a national strategy and action plan, and many of the committee&#8217;s other recommendations. I again thank all the organisations that are working flat out to reduce and prevent child sexual exploitation. We should send out the message from across the chamber that we continue to support them fully in their work. Our children deserve no less.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.

Why has he not done that, if childcare is the big priority for him? Thousands of families across Scotland will be confused and perplexed by the SNP&#8217;s motion today, and confused about what Alex Salmond&#8217;s priorities really are.

The Scottish Government is now opposing its own policy, which it could deliver now, from its white paper pledge six weeks ago.

That is what we called for when the announcement was first made, and it is what we are calling for again this afternoon in Johann Lamont&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>The question will be put at decision time. Is the SNP going to vote against the first stage of its own childcare policy of six weeks ago? I know that the SNP does not like the Labour Party much, so I am never optimistic about receiving its support, but to vote against its own childcare policy will surely show how determined the First Minister is to put his referendum before supporting families with childcare.</p><p>The reality is that the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament have the powers and resources to increase childcare now. The one thing that they do not have is excuses. Parents have been badly let down by the SNP&#8217;s inaction time and again over the past six and a half years. The Scottish Government has chosen to spend money on things other than childcare in the most recent budget and every other budget since 2007.</p><p>It is simple: if we want more childcare, we need to spend more money on it. The truth is, though, that the SNP will not deliver the first stage of its white paper plans now because it does not want to prove the point that is obvious to everyone&#8212;that it does not need to break up the UK to increase childcare and support for families. To suggest that it does is cynical politics at its worst, and it just goes to show that the SNP will say anything to get a vote for separation in the referendum.</p><p>Despite the recent hype, the truth is that families have received little help with childcare since the SNP came to power. Members should compare that with Labour&#8217;s record in office of supporting families. Labour in Scotland delivered a childcare strategy within months of coming to power; child tax credits to supplement child benefit; and universal early-years education for three and four-year-olds&#8212;the very system that the SNP now wants to bolt hours on to. Labour raised the standard of and invested in out-of-school care, and piloted nursery programmes for vulnerable two-year-olds, which the SNP scrapped when it first came to power.</p><p>In May last year it was Labour that brought to the chamber a debate and reached across party lines to call for a cross-party childcare commission to examine ways of improving childcare using existing powers. That idea was supported by all parties, but rejected by the SNP.</p><p>Among my constituents there is a family in the west of Scotland who have two children: one aged two and the other aged one. The dad works full time, but the mum cannot work during the week because of the cost of childcare. The SNP&#8217;s plans for two-year-olds are needed now.</p><p>That family is just one of the many families that have been let down since 2007, and continue to be let down. During a cost-of-living crisis we should do everything possible with the resources that we have to save families money and to help people where possible to get back to work, and investment in childcare should be a priority. There are 60,000 two-year-olds in Scotland, and by rejecting our amendment the SNP Government will be costing more than 15,000 families &#163;2,000 a year in childcare.</p><p>One other thing&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22825309", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Government should extend childcare now to 50 per cent&#8212;not 15 per cent&#8212;of two-year-olds and pay for it from the Barnett consequentials of \u00a3300 million that we will receive over the next two years.

The chancellor set out his choices in the autumn statement, but with a budget of &#163;35&#160;billion, the Scottish Government also has big decisions and big choices to make in the coming months.</p><p>I do not intend to talk this afternoon about all the various budget streams; I will concentrate on how the Scottish Government could, and should, use the &#163;300&#160;million of Barnett consequentials that it will receive over the next two years to take action now to support families by providing extra childcare.</p><p>Last Wednesday, my Labour colleagues and I called on the Scottish Government to invest the Barnett consequentials following the autumn statement in childcare for two-year-olds, as Malcolm Chisholm said. I rise again today to make the same demand of the finance secretary and the SNP Government.</p><p>We talk all the time about the importance of the early years in children&#8217;s learning and development. The committee has rightly scrutinised the effectiveness of the preventative spend agenda and issues around the early years change fund. We also talk consistently about the need to help people with the cost of living and about the importance of childcare to the economy. Families across Scotland want us to not just talk about it but take action. That is why we are proposing that the money from the Barnett consequentials be used to give childcare to half of Scotland&#8217;s two-year-olds now.</p><p>I lodged amendments to the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill to that effect, which could save 30,000 families more than &#163;2,000 a year on childcare costs. The proposal is very similar to the promise on childcare for two-year-olds made in the white paper. I know that the Liberal Democrats have been pushing for action on this, as Willie Rennie said again today, and I hope that the proposal will receive support from SNP and Conservative members as well.</p><p>I do not criticise the Scottish Government&#8217;s aspirations in the white paper for more childcare. In actual fact, I am proposing that it deliver its pledge on two-year-olds now. However, I do criticise the Government for not even providing full costings for its proposals. The fact that it has not provided a full price tag raises the question how serious it is about improving childcare now.</p><p>The fact is that, despite all the hype about childcare, it has in reality done very little to help families with childcare over the past six years. As we know, childcare is already fully devolved to the Scottish Parliament and, therefore, the SNP Government. The SNP Government&#8217;s childcare record is simple: families have yet to see any significant benefit from its childcare policies since 2007. No doubt, the Government will point to a small increase in hours for three and four-year-olds and the proposals in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. However, we in the Labour Party have said consistently that we will not solve the childcare problems of 2013 with a policy that is six years old.</p><p>Members will know that last week I compared the SNP&#8217;s record to Labour&#8217;s record in office. Labour&#8217;s record included a childcare strategy within months of coming to power; the introduction of universal early years education for three and four-year-olds; provision for vulnerable two-year-olds; the raising of standards; child tax credits; and much, much more.</p><p>Labour is clear: families need help with childcare now. As I have said time and again in this chamber, it is regrettable that the SNP Government has yet to deliver its promise of 600 hours for three and four-year-olds, despite that promise being made way back in 2007. It is also regrettable that the Scottish Government cut back nursery programmes for vulnerable two-year-olds when it first came to power and that the SNP Government and SNP MSPs voted against Labour&#8217;s proposal for a childcare commission back in May.</p><p>There are lots of ways in which families need support for childcare, and those could have been looked at by a cross-party commission. The reality is that families do not care who delivers the support as long as action is taken to address their needs. However, the SNP now has the opportunity, as it has had in every year since 2007, to put more money into childcare and help families with the cost of living.</p><p>I was encouraged during last week&#8217;s debate when Mr Swinney said that he would consider Labour&#8217;s proposals. I welcome that. He said that it would be up to the Cabinet to decide. The Cabinet will probably have met since last week so I ask the cabinet secretary whether that has been discussed. Will the Scottish Government support that proposal? Are the members of the Cabinet raising concerns about this? As we said in May when we proposed a childcare commission, we are happy to work on a cross-party basis and urge Mr Swinney to act on that as soon as possible.</p><p>Labour wants extra childcare to help families with the cost of living now and to help give children the best start in life. Affordable, quality and flexible childcare has always been a priority for the Labour Party. It was a big priority for the SNP three weeks ago; I hope that it still is. There was a lot of mention of testing ambitions earlier. I think that this is a key test of ambition. It is time that we helped families with the cost of living. It is time that the Scottish Government made up its mind and backed Labour&#8217;s call. The SNP Government has the powers and the resources. The only thing that it does not have is excuses.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.

Scotland office in Glasgow and here in the Parliament, and in particular the young people from the Kibble who performed a thought-provoking play in the Parliament for the committee.</p><p>We know that all too often looked-after children have poorer outcomes than other children and, as Stewart Maxwell set out at the start of the debate, the purpose of the inquiry was to investigate the decision-making processes involved in determining whether a child should be removed from the family home and whether those processes are delivering the best outcomes for children and their families. It is quite clear, both from the evidence presented to the committee and from the contributions that we have heard this afternoon, that that is not always the case. We can do more to improve those processes and we can and must do more for looked-after children.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s inquiry covered a number of areas and, as has been said, recommendations for improvements were made in almost every one. It is clear that there is work to do and action that needs to be taken. Many of the questions and issues raised are difficult and often sensitive, but Stewart Maxwell was quite right when he pointed out that open, public discussion of those issues is positive and I welcome the wider discussion that the committee&#8217;s inquiry has stimulated around the issue of children and young people in care.</p><p>As members have highlighted, there is a great deal of work going on in that area, not least the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, which we debated in the chamber recently. However, there is a fear and a danger that a lack of overarching strategy means that that work is not tied together. We need to be absolutely sure that problems are not being missed, that reforms are co-ordinated and that the key priority is that any changes that are made lead to better outcomes for children and young people.</p><p>In the report, the committee recognised the role of local authorities, community planning partners, social work and the relevant public and third sector bodies in bringing about change, but what is clear is the importance of the Scottish Government&#8217;s role in leading the process. I hope that the minister and the Government will listen to and act on the issues and challenges highlighted by the inquiry and will do so in a timely fashion. It is recognised across the chamber that the pace of progress in improving the experiences of looked-after children has simply not been good enough. Things need to improve and they need to improve more quickly.</p><p>I welcome what the minister said about supporting the social work workforce, listening to young people, early intervention and the care permanence strategy. Those are clearly good intentions. I welcome the minister&#8217;s responses to a number of the committee&#8217;s questions and I hope that she will follow up on the points that she has not had time to address today and respond to the report in full. I know that a number of issues have been raised about the use of terminology, about more detail on preventing children from falling through the gap and about other matters on which we would welcome more detail.</p><p>A number of members have mentioned resources. At a time of budgetary pressure, the issue of resources is, unsurprisingly, extremely important. As members have said this afternoon, the committee heard evidence suggesting that decisions about removing children from the family home were affected by the availability of appropriate placements. That is why the committee repeatedly pressed the Scottish Government to outline the total sum of money that all relevant bodies spend on protecting children and to say whether that spending is providing value for money.</p><p>The Scottish Government has made it clear that work on understanding spending and future demand is best undertaken at a local level. However, as Stewart Maxwell said, it is critical that we know the level of current spending, what it is delivering and whether spending is achieving the best possible results. The committee is right to question in its report how the Government&#8217;s approach will allow for the establishment of a national picture of future spending and placement needs. Again, I press the minister to address how that fits in with and is fundamental to the Scottish Government&#8217;s leadership role in this area.</p><p>More than one member has referred to social work training. I do not think that anyone would disagree that social workers have a key role in implementing improvements, so I would expect the Government to take action if the evidence supports the claim that cuts to local government are having a severe impact on social work training.</p><p>We know that the decision to remove a child from his or her home is always extremely difficult. The committee report recognises that and states:</p><p>&#8220;deciding whether or not a child should be removed from the family home and taken into care is one of the most difficult tasks carried out by public authorities.&#8221;</p><p>It has far-reaching consequences for the child involved, for the parents and for other members of that family. It is no exaggeration to say that the future of the child is at stake and therefore the decision has to be made at the right time and for the right reasons. It is essential, therefore, that we do everything possible to support the decision makers to get the decisions right.</p><p>The committee was determined to listen to the views and hear about the experiences of children and young people and put them at the centre of its report. Like other members, I have talked many times in the chamber about the importance of listening to young people rather than just talking at them. That is especially important here.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity, on behalf of the committee, to close the debate on an important subject.

Those challenges are not easy to address but we must work to tackle them if we are serious about improving outcomes for children and young people in care.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland states that the biggest improvement to outcomes for looked-after children and young people would come through improving the consistency, speed and earliness of decision making on whether to take children into care. It also made the point that once that decision has been made, there should be an absolute focus on securing permanence for that child. On that point, I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy aim of early permanence. When developing the care permanence strategy, I urge the Scottish Government to act on the committee&#8217;s call for it</p><p>&#8220;to establish a shared vision of what success would look like for looked after children, and ensure that resources and processes are built around that vision.&#8221;</p><p>I also urge all those active in the process of reform to involve children and young people who are in care and to listen to their opinions.

We need action to improve those processes and the outcomes for looked-after children, and we need to improve the pace of reform for the benefit of those young people.

Labour believes that we need to get it right for every child and supports the aspiration of improving life chances for children and young people in Scotland.</p><p>However, as some of the evidence says and as has been said this afternoon, we believe that the bill lacks ambition and we have concerns about practical issues, wording, details and financial and resource issues, which will be difficult to sum up in a seven-minute speech. Put simply, getting it right for every child means getting the bill right. We cannot let it be a missed opportunity.</p><p>The committee heard about a considerable number of issues from organisations and individuals and a significant number of them have been raised today. We have also received many briefings this week, which have contained specific concerns. I will raise a number of the issues that have been presented to us. I thank Children in Scotland and all the other children&#8217;s and youth organisations for their helpful briefings in advance of the debate.</p><p>A while back, the bill was described to me as four bills in one. It is clear that we need a joined-up bill and a joined-up approach. We should be concerned when NSPCC Scotland says:</p><p>&#8220;there appears to have been little strategic thinking about the position of children&#8217;s services in the raft of legislation currently underway in Scotland. We are concerned that the disparate nature of the various pieces of legislation which affect children&#8217;s services indicates a lack of coherent vision for how the whole range of services meet the needs of children.&#8221;</p><p>The NSPCC is not alone in raising concerns. There have been concerns that the Government&#8217;s proposals on children&#8217;s rights will not extend those rights or make a practical difference to children&#8217;s lives. The Law Society of Scotland described the duty on ministers as</p><p>&#8220;a diluted version of the existing obligations&#8221;</p><p>and it noted that the duty requires ministers only to consider the UNCRC and not to act on or explain those considerations. Children in Scotland noted that the proposals fall short of those that the National Assembly for Wales has embraced. A number of suggestions have also come from UNICEF and others about the use of child rights impact assessments and the duties on public bodies. We will have to look at that again at stage 2.</p><p>We have heard a great deal of concern about the controversial named person proposals. As I have said, the Royal College of Nursing has said clearly that</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government must recognise the Education Committee&#8217;s concerns regarding the capacity of the health visiting workforce to deliver existing duties let alone those associated with the Named Person role.&#8221;</p><p>Health visitors&#8212;the people on the ground&#8212;tell us that an additional 450 health visitors are needed. I say gently to the minister that that needs to be not monitored but acted on.</p><p>In its briefing, the RCN makes the shocking statement that</p><p>&#8220;It is not currently known how many health visitors there are in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>I am sure that I am not the only one who is extremely concerned by that comment. If the minister does not know how many health visitors there are, how can the figure be monitored and how can they be expected to take on the additional role?</p><p>Other concerns have been raised. Children 1st said:</p><p>&#8220;We remain concerned about the potential for confusion, which we already have experience of directly in practice&#8212;between the role of the named person and lead professional.&#8221;</p><p>YouthLink Scotland has called for clarity on the practicalities of a named person for a young person who is under 18 and who has left school. Questions have also been asked about inadequate funding for training and about who will take on the duty during school holidays.</p><p>Those issues are not going to go away. The minister and the Government need to take them seriously and address them accordingly if they want the provisions to be supported and to work.</p><p>We have been lobbied by Who Cares? Scotland and a number of our constituents about care leavers and we have been asked to speak up for them in the debate. I will speak up for them, just as Kezia Dugdale and others did. We should extend support for care leavers, and I hope that the Government will consider that request and look favourably on stage 2 amendments about that.</p><p>Jayne Baxter made a good contribution on kinship carers. The Government has more work to do to convince them of the merits of what it proposes.</p><p>I said that the bill should not be a missed opportunity. However, I feel that it will be a missed opportunity and that it lacks ambition on nursery education and childcare. I welcome again the Government&#8217;s flagship policy of an increase to 600 hours of provision for three and four-year-olds but, as we know, that was in the SNP&#8217;s manifesto in 2007. I have said it before and I will say it again: the Scottish Government will not solve the childcare problems of 2013 with a policy from 2007.</p><p>John Swinney was on television the other night, rightly saying that, if we increased childcare and female employment, that would be a good thing and it could create jobs. My message to the Government is this: do it, then! Actions speak louder than words. It has the powers right now to introduce more childcare than it is doing.</p><p>Labour in government acted to support and massively expand universal nursery education and childcare. The SNP in government has done very little in comparison. Instead, it has offered empty and vague referendum bribes. Members should not just take my word for it that that is unambitious. As Children in Scotland and Save the Children point out, the bill does not go nearly far enough in providing support for two-year olds. Only about 1 or 2 per cent of two-year-olds are to be guaranteed nursery in Scotland, whereas 40 per cent of those in England are going to be offered it. You have a stated aim of making Scotland the best place to grow up in the world, but you cannot even offer the best nursery package in the UK.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Cara Hilton on her maiden speech, in which she showed passion and commitment&#8212;the sort of passion and commitment that helped her to win the Dunfermline by-election.

We should have had a full ministerial statement several weeks ago on the issue; it is telling that Labour has had to bring the issue to Parliament today.</p><p>The minister spoke for several minutes on the Government&#8217;s actions on the Glasgow airport rail link and we heard many words, but the one word that we did not hear was &#8220;sorry&#8221;. We should have had a full apology from the minister today for three reasons: for cancelling an important infrastructure project for the region and the country; for costing an estimated 1,300 jobs in the Renfrewshire and Glasgow area; and for scandalously wasting our constituents&#8217; taxes in the process.</p><p>We need transparency and we need accountability for this mess. It is completely unacceptable for ministers to hide behind officials, which is why Labour is calling for an independent audit into the land transactions, as James Kelly outlined earlier. The cancellation of the rail link has cost at least &#163;30 million However, it is not the Government&#8217;s money, but our constituents&#8217; money that has been wasted. The &#163;30 million is a staggering figure. If the minister does not think so, that shows just how out of touch he is and how badly we need an independent audit.</p><p>I firmly believe that a rail link to Glasgow airport would have been beneficial to the whole country, with Scotland&#8217;s biggest city being linked by train to its airport. The SNP&#8217;s record on the issue means that we can get a direct train from Glasgow Central station to Manchester airport but not to Glasgow airport.</p><p>I note, as others have, that the minister&#8217;s amendment describes the Glasgow airport rail link as &#8220;ill-conceived&#8221;. He must disagree, in that case, with both John Swinney, who previously described the project as &#8220;desirable&#8221;, and Derek Mackay, who when he was leader of Renfrewshire Council acknowledged the &#8220;economic and transport benefits&#8221; of the rail link. The Government&#8217;s amendment also points to</p><p>&#8220;&#163;660 million of improvements to rail infrastructure, trains and services serving Glasgow, Paisley, Inverclyde and Ayrshire&#8221;.</p><p>However, the reality is that weekday off-peak train services from Paisley Gilmour Street to Ayr have been halved, despite the minister&#8217;s continued denials. What sort of improvement is that? In addition, the investment in the Paisley corridor and the rolling stock that has been put on the route was done to facilitate the Glasgow airport rail link. The Government&#8217;s misrepresentations and failure to be open are not just reasons for an audit, but are a demonstration of a behaviour pattern.</p><p>We should not forget, as James Kelly said, the delayed publication of the Aecom study that the Government was part of, as the transport minister has confirmed, which recommended a rail link at the same time as the Government was selling off the land. Four years on from the cancellation of GARL, rather than seeing the benefits of a rail link, all that we are left with is an expensive mess and more questions than answers. This is not the SNP governing in Scotland&#8217;s interests. In relation to George Adam&#8217;s speech, what is even less forgivable are the actions of SNP MSPs who purport to stand up for Paisley and Renfrewshire and who supported the Glasgow airport rail link until Alex Salmond and John Swinney told them not to.</p><p>We all know that unemployment is too high and that we need jobs for young people and people who have been made redundant. In Paisley, we heard the announcement of 141 job losses last week. The SNP&#8217;s response to that is to sell off the land for the rail link cheap in a fire sale and, while they are at it, to slash college places for training and retraining opportunities.</p><p>It is about time that the SNP Government apologised for the mishandling of the Glasgow airport rail link and the loss of jobs to Renfrewshire, and time that we had an independent audit.

I hope that other ministers will take note of that.</p><p>This afternoon&#8217;s debate on play has been a good one. It has given us the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to play and play-based learning and education. We know that play can make a significant contribution to a child&#8217;s development. It can make a huge contribution to nursery education and a significant contribution to families. It can also aid and develop children by changing the nature of how they learn, not just in nursery education but in primaries 1 and 2.</p><p>When Labour was in power, we initiated a debate on play and the role that it can play in education, so our approach to children&#8217;s learning is now more about play-based development than about talking at children. During the debate last year on the national parenting strategy, Labour called on the Scottish Government to come forward with details of the role of play in that. We are pleased that we now have a play strategy and action plan&#8212;something that was also in Labour&#8217;s manifesto at the 2011 election.</p><p>The play strategy is effective in explaining what play is and why it matters. As the minister and other members mentioned, it rehearses the cognitive, social and physiological impact of play and the contents of article 31 of the UNCRC, which states that every child has the right to rest and leisure and the right to engage in play and recreational activities. As Jayne Baxter said at the start of the debate, Labour agrees that play is vital to children&#8217;s learning, development and wellbeing, and that Scotland needs an action plan that sets out specific actions, timescales and responsibilities for delivering support for play. Labour agrees that a collaborative, multi-agency approach to improving the life chances of all children is the right way forward and, like the minister, we appreciate the work of the play sector and congratulate it on helping to improve support for play.</p><p>I do not think that Labour would disagree with anything in the strategy, but suggestions have been made by members from all parties on what could be done to improve it. Mark McDonald mentioned &#8220;No ball games&#8221; signs. He is a decent footballer in the Scottish Parliament football team, and&#8212;who knows?&#8212;if it was not for those signs, he could have had a glittering football career or, failing that, played for Aberdeen. However, he made the serious point that, within reason and as long as children are safe, we should have a presumption against such signs.</p><p>The Conservatives and others talked about the need for targeted support for children with additional support needs, and Stewart Maxwell mentioned children with disabilities.</p><p>A point that came up time and again this afternoon is that the strategy could and should go further. One of the biggest challenges with regard to play is deprivation. As Mary Fee and Dick Lyle said, it is clear that poverty damages children within the home and can prevent them from benefiting from important early experiences. There is a substantial volume of evidence to suggest that access to high-quality play experiences from a very young age can support the healthy development of some of our most vulnerable children and go a significant way towards closing the gap in educational attainment. There are some good examples of that. James Dornan mentioned the Jeely Piece Club in his constituency, and I have heard a lot of good things about it over the years.</p><p>I therefore join Save the Children and Poverty Alliance, which provided the briefings for this debate, in urging the minister and the Scottish Government, in delivering the plan, to prioritise support for families that experience poverty and to join up commitments that were made in the parenting strategy to help families to provide a good home learning environment. Poverty places huge pressures on families and their ability to provide the kind of play experiences that benefit children. It is only right that we should provide them with the kind of support that allows play to be an equaliser among children rather than something else that widens the gap between rich and poor.</p><p>This afternoon, it is important that we recognise, as many members have done, the contribution that has been made by groups of parents who fundraise and organise to build or improve play parks in their local communities. A number of suggestions have been made about how that could be improved, and there are certainly a number of good examples in my own area in Renfrewshire. Again, however, not every community necessarily has all the support that is required to help with fundraising expertise and nor is the money available. That is especially true of those communities that are in areas of multiple deprivation. We need to address that point.</p><p>Although I welcome the focus on joined-up planning and training, it is important to note that many agencies are already working together informally and we need to review how much of a difference that will make on the ground. Mary Scanlon mentioned existing strategies, but we still need to take note of the concern.</p><p>We also need to recognise the wide importance of training. The only mention of initial training in play is in the domain of nursery and school. Knowledge of the importance of play must go much wider than school staff and early years practitioners. We need to do something on that as well. For example, courses for social workers, residential social workers, and play workers who might never work in a school or a nursery are also in need of review, and I hope that the minister and the Scottish Government will consider that when considering delivery of the plan. Ken Macintosh made the general point very well when he said that play development should not be left simply to the play sector.</p><p>Probably the most challenging and serious issue, which has come up in a number of contributions this afternoon, including that of Anne McTaggart, is that of resources. I simply ask the minister: where is the strategy for renewing play areas backed up by resources? I would certainly push for properly resourced environments for children and young people, as I am sure we all would. Will the Scottish Government add that to the existing budget? Will it give cash to local authorities to improve tired and worn play areas?</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On independence, I am genuinely pleased that the minister has pressed the play button on the play strategy today, given that Scotland is on pause.

We therefore welcome the fact that the Government&#8217;s new publication, &#8220;The keys to life&#8221;, reflects the underlying principles of that strategy.</p><p>As I have said before in the chamber, we will support the Government where we agree with it and believe that it is doing things right, but we will point to areas where we believe that it could&#8212;and should&#8212;do more. As the Government refreshingly acknowledges in the motion, there is more to do, and we need to work across party lines to address that.</p><p>We know from the most recent statistics that there are more than 26,000 adults and 16,000 children and young people with learning disabilities who require support. According to Learning Disability Alliance Scotland, those people want three main things: a secure and safe place to stay; meaningful things to do with their time; and friends and family in their life. I do not think that any member in the chamber would dispute that those are things that everybody wants and which should not be too much to ask for.</p><p>Our challenge is to ensure that adequate support is provided to those who need it to allow them to fulfil those aims. We welcome the publication of the new strategy and support the drive to deliver better outcomes for people with learning disabilities&#8212;as well as their families and carers&#8212;in the areas of life that they say are most important to them.</p><p>However, there are considerable challenges that must be addressed if we are to ensure that the strategy does not fall into the trap of simply becoming another strategy that sounds good on paper but has little impact on the ground. Rhetoric must be turned into reality if the strategy is to be deemed a success.</p><p>Organisations such as Learning Disability Alliance Scotland have expressed reservations about the strategy&#8217;s lack of an overarching theme, and we must pay heed to their views. As I am sure many members have discovered for themselves in the past few days, &#8220;The keys to life&#8221; is a lengthy strategy that stretches to more than 170 pages, which detail 52 separate recommendations. Although the strategy declares a human rights focus, we need to ensure that people with learning disabilities are at the centre of improvements to the quality of their lives. In other words, we need to ensure that we are working with people rather than talking at them.</p><p>We must also consider some of the challenges that lie outside the strategy, and which will undoubtedly have an impact on its success. It is essential that the Scottish Government takes action to ensure that we establish a fair, consistent and transparent system of care for disabled people throughout Scotland. Resources continue to present a huge challenge to the delivery of support services, and local authorities of all colours are struggling with the pressures of delivering services in the face of vastly reduced budgets.</p><p>As a result, there has been a sharp increase in the use of care charges. Some authorities are charging as much as 100 per cent, and 25 of the 32 local authority areas charge a rate that is higher than the top rate of income tax. In my area, the previous Renfrewshire Council administration introduced charges for people with learning disabilities to pay transport to daycare centres. That policy has now&#8212;thankfully&#8212;been reversed, but it had a serious impact on a large number of vulnerable people in the community. That emphasises the need for a consistent approach across the country that places the needs of people with a disability or learning disability at its centre.</p><p>I agree with the strategy when it states that the key to delivering effective services is to ensure that people are provided with the outcomes that they need at the right time and in the right place. We know that a range of public bodies are involved in delivering services that people with learning disabilities need. We should be encouraging local authorities, college and health boards, for example, to work together to achieve the kind of joined-up approach that benefits people, and to do that in conjunction with people with learning disabilities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Learning Disabilities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scottish Labour is committed to improving the quality of life for people with learning difficulties, and we welcome the debate and the opportunity to examine how we can best act to turn that aim into reality.

That makes Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s point.</p><p>Adults with learning disabilities should have the opportunity to learn at college but unfortunately, that opportunity is being taken away from hundreds of people in Scotland. The Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability published a report in August that estimated that around 9 per cent of people with learning disabilities attended further education colleges in 2012. That is a fall of nearly 300 people compared with the previous year, from 2,696 to 2,407.</p><p>It is clear that there are significantly fewer courses for people with learning disabilities than there were just a few years ago. That is just one element of the human cost of the Government&#8217;s cuts to colleges. A Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability study from last year showed that there had been a 34 per cent cut in part-time places for students with learning disabilities from 2,155 to 1,413. In addition, 2012 figures from the same organisation showed that the number of adults with learning disabilities who attend college for 2.5 days or less per week is down 20 per cent on 2011. That is no surprise when we consider the drastic reduction in the number of part-time courses.</p><p>It is not just the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability who is saying that. A 2012 survey of Scotland&#8217;s colleges by Enable Scotland found that the number of courses for people with additional support needs has halved since 2007, with a 46 per cent cut in the past two years and a 42 per cent cut in the past year. The number of staff who are teaching people with additional support needs has been cut by 16 per cent in the past two years.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s strategy suggests that people with learning disabilities should be included in mainstream further education classes. The argument is that it will give them greater access to award-bearing courses and improve employment prospects. However, that fails to acknowledge that while some people with additional support needs might be able to cope with mainstream classes and benefit from the opportunity, there are others for whom mainstream classes would be a route to failure, lowering self-esteem and perhaps causing further retreat from mainstream life. Any efforts to encourage people with learning disabilities into mainstream classes must be matched with a commitment to provide them with the additional support that they need; otherwise, the disproportionate impact of college cuts on people with additional support needs will only get worse.</p><p>It is clear that people with learning disabilities are suffering as a result of the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to slash college budgets. People with learning disabilities are not getting the opportunity and specialist assistance to learn. As a result of that, the Scottish Government is preventing them from accessing the skills and qualifications that they might need to get and hold down a job. The minister mentioned employment figures and it is concerning that the figures show that there is an increase in the number of adults with learning disabilities who are failing to secure employment. In 2012, 3,393 adults with learning disabilities were recorded as being in employment or in training for employment, which is just 13 per cent of all adults with learning disabilities who are known to local authorities and represents a decrease of 653, or 16 per cent, compared with 2011. Meanwhile, 55 per cent are neither in employment nor in training for employment. Is that any wonder, if we are cutting their college courses? Obviously, we should commend the good work that organisations do to help with supported employment and we should encourage more such initiatives, but we are undermining that with the approach to colleges.</p><p>I believe that the high proportion of people with disabilities and learning disabilities who are affected by the bedroom tax and other iniquitous welfare reforms means that it is essential that the Scottish Government uses its powers to act to negate the bedroom tax. Jackie Baillie was right when she said that a UK Labour Government would reverse the bedroom tax and, as we speak, Ed Miliband will be reaffirming that commitment.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already found &#163;20&#160;million and it should commit to finding the other &#163;30&#160;million. There is nothing outlined in next year&#8217;s budget to support the vulnerable individuals and families affected, as John Swinney keeps people on the hook before next year&#8217;s referendum.</p><p>The Scottish Government should also support our plans to legislate to prevent evictions as a result of the bedroom tax. The people who are affected&#8212;the people whom we are here to represent&#8212;need and deserve action from the Scottish Government.</p><p>Scottish Labour welcomes the publication of &#8220;The keys to life&#8221; strategy paper. We are pleased that it maintains the underlying principles of the previous strategy and of course we support its aim to improve the lives of people with learning disabilities. However, for people with learning disabilities to see a genuine benefit, we need more than a strategy that simply sounds good on paper. We also need action to tackle the disproportionate effect that welfare cuts and cuts to colleges are having on people with disabilities and learning disabilities.</p><p>Progress has been made but there is more that we can and should be doing to ensure that people with learning disabilities have the support and the opportunities that they need to live with the quality of life that they deserve.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-07787.2, to insert after &#8220;were before&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;; notes the strategy&#8217;s focus on promoting and raising awareness of the human rights of people with learning disabilities; considers that the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reform agenda and cuts to social care and further education budgets in Scotland are likely to have an impact on translating human rights into reality by way of services and support for people with learning disabilities&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Learning Disabilities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I have been saying and will go on to say, people with learning disabilities should be involved and consulted on the services that they need.

Last year, the National Union of Students, the Educational Institute of Scotland and Unison said that college cuts would harm economic recovery&#8212;and they are right. According to the Scottish Parliament information centre, the Government is continuing its real-terms cuts to colleges in 2014-15 and 2015-16 when it should be repairing the damage that it has already done.

Unfortunately, far too many of the communities in which colleges are situated have high levels of health inequalities. It is important that colleges consult community health partnerships and, when possible, work with them to resolve issues when health and education services overlap. Amendments 102 and 107 are simple, reasonable and necessary.</p><p>My amendments 103 and 108 would require regional colleges and regional strategic bodies to consult transport providers that serve the areas in which colleges are situated. Those amendments are important, particularly given the regionalisation agenda. We are hearing more and more concerns about the prospect of courses not being available at local colleges because they have been moved to other campuses in a region.</p><p>The Education and Culture Committee has heard about construction courses being moved from Dalkeith in Midlothian to the other side of Edinburgh. To put it simply, if such changes continue, as we fear that they will, transport providers must be consulted. I have said many times that, in my West Scotland region, I regularly hear concerns about the possibility of a lack of transport for people who want to travel between Clydebank and Greenock. Such a situation would be very problematic. If that is the case in West Scotland and Edinburgh, I am pretty sure that the situation will be repeated in almost every part of Scotland.</p><p>I would of course prefer courses to be retained at their present locations but, if they are to be moved to different parts of a region, there must be engagement with transport providers to ensure adequate transport provision between college campuses for staff and students. That is necessary in relation to the regionalisation agenda. Even if that agenda was not happening through the bill, it would make sense to consult and work with transport providers that serve local colleges.

At a time of high unemployment, it is vital that our colleges continue to play a key role in helping people back to work. Prior to stage 2, there was a complete lack of a specific regional focus.

I support the Liz Smith&#8217;s amendments 37 and 73, which would limit possible causes of removal to breaches of the code of governance, and amendments 38 and 74, which would remove broad ministerial powers to remove board members for failure to discharge duties.</p><p>My amendment 105 calls for the establishment of an independent panel to review decisions to remove college board members.

Unfortunately, our calls at stage 1 were not heeded and the SNP Government used its majority to carry on regardless. As a result, nearly 200 amendments were lodged at stage 2 and more than 100 amendments were lodged to be debated at stage 3 today. For the cabinet secretary&#8217;s benefit, I confirm that that means that the number of amendments has gone down, rather than up, between stage 2 and stage 3, but that is testament to our view that the bill was badly drafted. That view is backed up by the fact that the cabinet secretary has lodged more than 100 amendments of his own. Today, the bill may be less bad as a result of the Labour amendments lodged by the Labour Party and some Labour amendments lodged by Mike Russell, but many of our other suggestions were rejected during the process, and the bill is not fit to be supported.</p><p>A significant number of outstanding issues still need to be addressed. Some of those, but not all, might be dealt with through the higher and further education governance codes, which will need further scrutiny by the Parliament before their implementation by the Scottish funding council. Those issues include local representation on college boards and whether principals may participate in board meetings where board appointments and the principal&#8217;s pay are being discussed. However, the governance codes alone will not suffice because some provisions in the bill do not go far enough, some raise unanswered questions and some could have unintended consequences.</p><p>As Neil Findlay said, much that is in the bill could have been achieved without legislation. The bill centralises power in the hands of the cabinet secretary without sufficient checks&#8212;the cabinet secretary rejected a number of amendments today that would have provided those checks. The bill compromises autonomy and accountability, confuses college governance, has limited ambition and, I think, pays lip service to widening access. The bill also fails to challenge gender bias in our higher education governance arrangements by simply restating United Kingdom legislation. Worst of all, the bill will do nothing to create a single college place.</p><p>In the time remaining, I want to focus on the issue of widening access, which is an aim that I am sure we all fully support. As I have said previously, questions need to be raised about university admissions policies, but questions need to be raised about Scottish Government policy, too. The Scottish Government has not stated by how much the bill will improve access and it has not set a target or a timescale. In today&#8217;s newspapers, Michael Russell is quoted as saying that a further 16,000 young people from deprived backgrounds &#8220;could&#8221; obtain a degree.

According to the Scottish Refugee Council, in 2012 around 1,200 children sought asylum in the UK, and up to five separated children arrive in Scotland each month to claim asylum. Many of the young people show indications of having been trafficked. The minister was right to say that most of those children and young people have little knowledge of Scotland and its language, culture or policies.</p><p>I cannot begin to imagine what that is like, and I do not think that any member can do so. However, I am sure that we all understand that it would be hugely daunting to be faced with the bureaucratic processes of a new country, in a world that we did not know, while bearing the physical and mental scars that many asylum seekers have&#8212;let alone facing all that without the protection and support of an adult family member.</p><p>The Scottish guardianship service works with vulnerable children and young people who arrive in Scotland unaccompanied and separated from their families. Those children and young people need the service&#8217;s crucial support if they are to navigate the complexities of the asylum process and access the support services that they need, when they need them.</p><p>As the minister said, guardians work primarily in three areas: they assist separated young people in their claims for protection as refugees; they act as a bridge to social work, accommodation, education and health services; and they support young people in their everyday lives. It was good to hear from the minister some personal testimonies of the service. I put on record my appreciation of the Scottish guardianship service&#8217;s work, and I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s announcement of further funding for the project over the next three years.</p><p>The Scottish guardianship service does excellent work in supporting young people through the complexities of the asylum process, but we must also do everything that we can to reduce the barriers that such young people face in accessing the support that they need.</p><p>I thank Aberlour Child Care Trust, the Scottish Refugee Council and other partners for their work on the service and for their informative briefings ahead of today&#8217;s debate. It is important that we use this debate to congratulate the people who run an important service. We should also use it to consider how we might offer more and better support to asylum-seeking children and young people and to recognise some of the wider concerns in relation to young asylum seekers and victims of trafficking.</p><p>On how we better support asylum-seeking children and young people, organisations such as Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, which provided a helpful briefing for the debate, have expressed concern that some local authorities tend to assume that asylum seekers are a low-needs group, which requires low levels of service support. The experiences of asylum seekers suggest that the opposite is often the case. Many asylum seekers have high levels of trauma, and people often have mental health issues as a result of their experiences. Young people who seek refuge have often fled persecution, physical and mental abuse and even life-threatening situations in their own countries.</p><p>The first annual evaluation report of the service outlined that in year 1 of the project, nearly 70 per cent of the people involved were between 16 and 17 years of age. It also highlighted that a large number of young asylum seekers in Scotland are age disputed. That is often due to a lack of documentation or because of language barriers, which make it difficult for young people to communicate with the authorities.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland has expressed concerns that many asylum seekers are not receiving appropriate age assessments from the UK Border Agency. Many young people are being identified as adults and are subsequently treated as such, which is of course a cause for concern. It is vital that everything possible is done to ensure that young people are identified correctly and do not miss out on vital support because they are wrongly classed as adults by the UK Border Agency.</p><p>On ensuring support, I would welcome information from the Scottish Government on whether it has considered whether asylum-seeking children and young people should be entitled to the same support that the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill seeks to give looked-after children&#8212;namely support from corporate parents until the age of 25. I would also welcome it if the Scottish Government could tell us what liaison it has had with the Home Office regarding the questioning of young asylum seekers and the criteria that are used for determining the age of adulthood, and whether it is calling on the UK Government to raise the qualification age to 21 or 25.</p><p>Support for children in terms of immigration and welfare when they arrive in Scotland is very important, but young asylum seekers also face a number of education issues. Many young asylum seekers are keen to access education and learning opportunities, but often they do not have access to the support that they need in order to learn. A lack of language skills is often the main reason for that, but the reality is that many local authorities across the country have been forced to cut language support services, which provide vital support to young asylum seekers. That affects their ability to learn and, ultimately, their ability to gain meaningful employment.</p><p>Although many young people will have positive experiences while they are here, it is very concerning to hear about instances of interfaith and racial bullying in Scottish schools. I would welcome it if the minister could provide&#8212;or give a commitment to obtain&#8212;up-to-date information on the instances of interfaith and racial bullying in Scottish schools and details on what action the Scottish Government plans to tackle the issue.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland and others have expressed a desire to see more intensive support for young asylum seekers who are keen to access education in order to improve their long-term outcomes. I hope that the minister will take that on board this afternoon.</p><p>As I mentioned at the start, around a third of young people receiving the service show signs of having been trafficked. The evaluation of the Scottish guardianship service pilot states that around a third of young people receiving the service had</p><p>&#8220;trafficking indicators associated with domestic servitude, sexual exploitation and cannabis cultivation.&#8221;</p><p>That is an extremely worrying statistic. It is all the more worrying when we consider that there are likely to be many more trafficked children and young people whom the authorities are not aware of. As well as facing the difficulties and challenges that all young asylum seekers face, victims of trafficking face additional problems and have additional needs. Victims of trafficking have often experienced considerable trauma and need specialist support.</p><p>Many trafficking victims do not see themselves as victims of exploitation and accept the view of their traffickers that they owe them a debt. Others live in fear of their traffickers, who have forced them into the sex industry, drugs industry or to work as cheap labour. The problems that trafficking victims face are serious and wide ranging and require tailored, specialist support.</p><p>It is therefore alarming that Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland has raised concerns that trafficked children across Scotland are not receiving the specialist support services that they need in order to recover and integrate into their local community. I urge the Scottish Government to listen to those concerns and to do all that it can to ensure that those children&#8212;as the minister said, they are some of the most vulnerable in Scotland&#8212;receive the specialised support that they need.</p><p>It would be good to hear from the minister what priority the police and the Government are giving to tracking down and prosecuting traffickers. In particular, how are they supporting young asylum seekers to give evidence against those who have exploited them? Where young people are targeted for exploitation in their communities, what support do the police and local authorities give to those young people and communities?</p><p>We should welcome the important and worthwhile work of the Scottish guardianship service.

The debate has been a welcome opportunity not only to recognise the important role played by the Scottish guardianship service but to identify some of the issues affecting asylum-seeking children and young people who arrive in Scotland unaccompanied. It is clear from the contributions to the debate that we believe that, as a society, we need to support children who arrive in Scotland unaccompanied by a parent and that there are aspects of that support that we can improve.</p><p>All members have paid tribute to the important work done by Aberlour Child Care Trust, the Scottish Refugee Council and other partners in the Scottish guardianship service. I reiterate the recognition that I gave those organisations in my opening speech. I also welcome again the Scottish Government&#8217;s pledge of continued support for the project over the next three years.</p><p>We do that because children are children and&#8212;as many members, including Stewart Maxwell, demonstrated&#8212;we have a duty to care for children who find themselves in a country where they do not understand the language or the culture. Graeme Pearson put it best when he said that we have a moral obligation if we are to be a compassionate society.</p><p>As many have said, forced migration is sadly a fact of life for many of the world&#8217;s children. That forced migration can often cause high levels of trauma as well as mental health issues. Malcolm Chisholm spoke about the range of physical and mental health issues and the need for a friendly face&#8212;a need that the Scottish guardianship service meets.</p><p>Many members also spoke about children and young people who have fled persecution, physical abuse or, even, life-threatening situations, and about children and young people who have been trafficked to Scotland, against their will, to be exploited.</p><p>A number of other important points were raised. John Mason started his speech by saying that he had not been overly familiar with the service, but the more he found out about it, the more positive he became. I am probably the same as Mr Mason in that regard. He made an important point about learning lessons from the excellent work of the Scottish guardianship service and seeing whether those lessons could be applied to looked-after children. I was pleased to hear the minister give a reassurance on that point.</p><p>Dave Thompson talked about an internationalist approach to tackling the issues. I agree that we need an international approach to global poverty and trafficking, and I hope that the UK Government will use its influence to take such an approach, working with other Governments around the globe.</p><p>A number of other issues were raised and I hope that the Scottish Government will listen to them and take on board the comments and the concerns and do all that it can to ensure that some of the most vulnerable children in Scotland receive the specialised support that they need.</p><p>Following on from the debate, the Scottish Government should look at three key areas that are as evident now as they were at the start of the debate: consideration of how best we extend support; how we improve the support that is offered; and child trafficking.</p><p>First, on the issue of whether support should be extended, as I said earlier the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill will be discussed in the Parliament later this year. Perhaps there is an opportunity for the Government to consider whether asylum-seeking children and young people could be entitled to support similar to the support that the bill seeks to give looked-after children&#8212;namely, support from corporate parents until the age of 25.</p><p>A number of points were raised by, I think, Christina McKelvie, Sandra White and Stewart Maxwell in relation to the UK Border Agency. I will not get into the constitutional debate about that, but improvements could be made&#8212;in particular around age assessments. It would be helpful if the Scottish Government could update us on its liaison with the Home Office on the questioning of young asylum seekers and the criteria that are used to determine the age of adulthood.</p><p>Secondly, on what better support we can give asylum-seeking children to complement the job that the Scottish guardianship service is doing, it would be good to know, for example, more details of what the Scottish Government is doing to support children who are traumatised, who do not understand the language and who need on-going support to live if they are given leave to remain.</p><p>We have discussed immigration and welfare issues. However, in relation to education it would be helpful&#8212;as I said in my opening speech&#8212;if the minister either has, or could give a commitment to obtain, up-to-date information on instances of interfaith and racial bullying in Scotland&#8217;s schools. I hope that the level of bullying is not significant but I am sure that the Government will agree that it is important to look into the matter. I also ask the Scottish Government to tell us what action it will take to address those issues.</p><p>The third key area is trafficking. Murdo Fraser referred to it as one of the great social ills of our time and he is absolutely right. Many members have mentioned the issue and we know that a third of the children who are supported by the guardianship service show indicators of having been trafficked here against their will to be exploited. We also know that there are likely to be more. We need to ensure that everything possible is done to identify trafficked children and stop trafficking. It would be good to get an assurance from the Scottish Government that it and the police view the tracking down and prosecution of traffickers as a priority.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm also made an important point about the need to train police officers to help to identify trafficked children and to prosecute traffickers. It is also good to know that the cross-party group on trafficking will consider the issue seriously later today.</p><p>Graeme Pearson was right to raise the issue of the low number of prosecutions for trafficking that have been secured.</p><p>It would be good to know how the Scottish Government is supporting young asylum seekers to give evidence against those who have exploited them and, where young people are targeted for exploitation in communities, what support police and local authorities give them and the communities.</p><p>I reiterate what my Labour colleagues and I have said about the important work that is being done by the Scottish guardianship service. We hope that that will continue to improve and help the children who, for whatever reason, end up here without parental support.

If that is to become a reality, the Government needs to do more than just talk about improving equality in access to higher education. That is what our motion is about: taking action to reverse the cut to grants for the lowest-income students</p><p>On widening access, I say to the cabinet secretary that the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill will not put money in the poorest students&#8217; pockets. If the cuts remain, they will damage poorer people&#8217;s opportunities to go to university. The Government&#8217;s minimum income policy looks more like a maximum debt policy. By cutting bursaries for the poorest students by &#163;890, the SNP is placing lower-income students at a serious financial disadvantage.</p><p>Instead of encouraging lower-income students to enter and stay in higher education, increasing their student loan debt is likely to have the opposite effect. If SNP members believe that to increase tuition fee debt will put people off seeking to study at university, they must also accept that to increase student loan debt will do the same. Debt is debt.</p><p>Speaking of debt, I point out that the SNP Government promised to dump the student debt. Its excuse in its first term was that it did not have a majority. It has a majority now, so it can get on with that if it still wants to pursue the policy.</p><p>As Hugh Henry mentioned, the most recent statistics on student support show that the total amount paid in non-repayable awards fell by 19 per cent in 2011-12, while the amount authorised in loans increased by more than &#163;20 million, so there is a clear trend in the Scottish Government away from bursaries and towards loans. That is the reality.</p><p>When SNP members such as Stewart Maxwell make comparisons between the support that is available for poorer students in Scotland and what is available for those in the rest of the UK, their rhetoric is yet again at odds with the reality. Stewart Maxwell mentioned combinations of loans and bursaries. A maximum bursary of &#163;1,750 is available here for students whose household income is less than &#163;17,000, whereas in England a maximum grant of &#163;3,354 is available to those whose household income is less than &#163;25,000. Wales and Northern Ireland also offer better support to the poorest students. Put simply, Scotland is not the best place but the worst place for someone who is poor to get student support. Rather than the minister congratulating himself, he should be ashamed.</p><p>The household income threshold of &#163;17,000 in Scotland is now so low that, if a student&#8217;s parents both work full time on the minimum wage, the student will not qualify for the minimum income guarantee. That is at the same time as the maximum non-income-assessed loan is increasing to &#163;4,500. The Scottish Government needs to prioritise support for lower-income students, as it is clear that we could and should be doing more to ensure that lower-income students are not disadvantaged in order to provide cheap loans to those from the most affluent backgrounds.</p><p>I am sure that many members across the chamber will have read with interest the comments that were made by Professor von Prondzynski yesterday as well as the compelling recent comments by Sheila Riddell and Lucy Hunter. We keep hearing from the SNP that everything would be better for students in an independent Scotland, but we know that cutting public expenditure to fund corporation tax cuts for big business is more of a priority for the SNP Government. This is about priorities. Instead of cutting taxes for big business, Labour would prioritise widening access and supporting lower-income students into higher education. It is not too late for the Government to do the same and reverse the cuts to grants for lower-income students.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Student Support"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join my Labour colleagues in stating that we want to see not only a well-funded, high-quality education system in Scotland but one that helps people from all backgrounds to succeed and allows people to fulfil their potential, irrespective of their income.

We need to get around the table on a cross-party basis, talk through problems, identify solutions and deliver the support that our families need. As Hugh Henry said, we need a comprehensive childcare strategy and a childcare commission to make that a reality.</p><p>That is why Johann Lamont offered to work with the First Minister and other party leaders on childcare. The reason for that and the purpose of Labour bringing this debate to the chamber is to support Scottish families from Paisley to Peebles, in Ayr and Aberdeen; families in every part of Scotland face childcare problems.</p><p>We welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill to extend pre-school care hours to 600 for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, and we recognised that in our motion. That will build on the progress that was made by Labour in Government on pre-school education and our family-friendly policies such as child tax credits, and paternity and maternity pay, which Michael Russell and Stuart McMillan mentioned.</p><p>However, let us be honest: if we are to represent the views of the families whom we were elected to represent, every party must accept that not enough is being done on childcare to support families. The view that the childcare problems of 2013 will not be solved by the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill is not a political view. It is the reality of what we hear from families in our communities.</p><p>Three things are as evident now as when Hugh Henry mentioned them at the start of this debate. Childcare provision does not meet the current needs of the children and families of Scotland; childcare is expensive; and the educational underpinning of early years provision should be paramount. A number of members highlighted those issues.

If the minister had listened to what Hugh Henry and others have said, she would understand that we need to take a rounded view of childcare provision in Scotland from birth to the age of 14. That is the point that the minister is missing.</p><p>Issues that have been mentioned include pre-school childcare, out-of-school care, and childcare provision at work. Neil Findlay mentioned childcare at St John&#8217;s hospital, and there are issues to consider in relation to childcare for disabled children, as Mary Fee mentioned.</p><p>Mary Fee and Marco Biagi mentioned the Equal Opportunities Committee. The impression that SNP members gave about the reaction to 600 hours is questionable as at an Equal Opportunities Committee meeting&#8212;in an answer to Marco Biagi&#8212;Jackie Brock of Children in Scotland said:</p><p>&#8220;Our members have a rather lukewarm view on the 600 hours and the contribution that it will make to that long-term vision.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 2 May 2013; c 1259.]</p><p>Hugh Henry mentioned childcare costs at the start of the debate. SNP members have said that the extension of hours will save families &#163;700 a year. There has been a seven-year delay in that policy, so the SNP delay in extending that policy has cost families &#163;700 a year. We know that childcare costs are high. We know from a recent Save the Children report that, on average, childcare payments take 33 per cent of household income. We know that many families believe that that cost is a barrier to work and that too many have had to cut down on food and payment of household bills to pay for childcare.</p><p>Age segregation and the geographical dislocation of services can also create difficulties for parents. In the area that I represent, Save the Children recently took evidence and I was shocked to find that, in some cases, parents are having to pick up their children from three different establishments because no one service deals with children aged one year, three years and six years old&#8212;that is if parents can find childcare at all.</p><p>Those are just some of the challenges that families whom we are elected to represent are facing. We need to develop a Scottish system of childcare that is affordable, high quality, accessible and flexible and which meets the needs of families. It is therefore disappointing that the SNP minister in her judgment does not appear to think that establishing a cross-party commission is a good idea.</p><p>The SNP amendment talks about the early years task force. The task force is doing important work, but as I have said before we need to look at how we support families with children from birth to the age of 14. We need to look at pre-school education and care for two-year-olds, where we could be doing more. As Liam McArthur and other Lib Dems have said, we are massively behind the rest of the UK. That is why we want to work with parties across the chamber to look at how we can improve childcare for two-year-olds.</p><p>We also need a renewed focus on supporting out-of-school care&#8212;a focus on how we support the retention and expansion of breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday clubs. Such services for school-aged children are crucial for working parents. They allow parents to work and to provide for their children.</p><p>The Scottish Out of School Care Network reports that most services are managed and administered by parents themselves, who form charities or co-operatives, employ staff themselves and pay dearly for the service. I pay tribute to those parents but we also need to look at how we can support parents who want to retain or set up community or co-operative childcare services, as some are doing with the City of Edinburgh Council&#8212;as Malcolm Chisholm mentioned.</p><p>As Hugh Henry said at the start of the debate, it is time for us to work together across the Parliament and to do so with some humility. We appear to have a consensus in the chamber for a commission&#8212;with the exception of the SNP. I am pleased that, out of the chamber, organisations such as Children in Scotland support the idea and organisations such as Save the Children want us to work on a cross-party basis. I plead with the minister to change her mind.</p><p>None of us here has all the answers to the early years and childcare questions. As a Parliament, we know that we need to do more, but we realise that that will come with a cost. We know that families across Scotland want real solutions to their problems. We need to take advice and come to an agreement on the way forward. That is why we are asking for all parties to support the establishment of a Scottish childcare commission to establish how best to expand affordable, accessible, good-quality childcare and early years provision across Scotland.

I welcome the debate and join other members in thanking my colleague Neil Findlay for bringing it to the chamber.</p><p>Much has been said this afternoon about blacklisting, which has had a significant amount of media coverage. As members will know, I recently spoke about blacklisting in the Scottish Government debate on procurement two weeks ago. During that debate, I congratulated Unite, the GMB, UCATT and their members for being at the forefront of the campaign to expose this shameful practice, and I reiterate that. Without their campaigning, I doubt that the issue would be discussed here or in the House of Commons, where the Scottish Affairs Committee has done tremendous work to expose blacklisting.</p><p>I have met union members inside and outside this Parliament on at least four occasions to discuss blacklisting, and each time the message has been loud and clear. The trade unions and their members want us to do more than just talk about how bad blacklisting is and condemn the practice with words alone. They want us to use the powers that we have to eliminate this illegal and immoral practice.</p><p>We know that at least 582 people in Scotland have been blacklisted, and the issue affects people in every part of Scotland. The map that the GMB union has provided shows that, in my region, blacklisting has affected seven people in Paisley, 19 in Irvine, 16 in Greenock, 10 in Port Glasgow, 10 in Saltcoats, 11 in Stevenson and 15 in Ardrossan, as well as people in Johnstone, Erskine, Renfrew, Largs, Kilwinning, Bishopbriggs, Clydebank, Helensburgh, Balloch and Dumbarton&#8212;the list goes on and on.</p><p>That is a list of numbers, but of course we know that we are talking about people, not statistics. They are people who were denied the right to work just because they joined a trade union or raised concerns about health and safety; people whose lives were devastated and who deserve action and a full and independent Scottish inquiry; and people who deserve compensation and action on procurement from the Scottish Government.</p><p>That is why my Labour colleagues and I propose that we exclude from providing public service contracts organisations, companies and individuals who have been found guilty of grave misconduct such as blacklisting in the course of their business activities. As members have said, it is regrettable that the Scottish and UK Governments have issued contracts to companies involved in blacklisting. I know that the Deputy First Minister and other Government members have said that they are keen to engage with the trade unions and to do so on a cross-party basis. I welcome that and hope that that will progress matters. As the Unite briefing for the debate states, if there is the political will to act, action can and must be taken.</p><p>I advise the minister and the Government again that, if the Government does not take action through procurement, Labour will. I will fully support my colleague Neil Findlay if he lodges amendments to the procurement bill to stop public contracts for blacklisters. The debate has put our views on the record and put the cards on the table. From the speeches that we have heard, it is clear that there is the political will to act.

I will not suggest that what is proposed is perfect for everyone, but it is clear that changes need to be made.</p><p>I am a member of the Education and Culture Committee and we heard evidence from a number of witnesses, all of whom accepted the need for change, those from the press included. As Patricia Ferguson said, the Labour Party supports a royal charter that underpins a UK-wide system of self-regulation. Crucially, the draft royal charter on self-regulation of the press is in keeping with the broad recommendations of the Leveson inquiry. As has been said, we agree that the royal charter should be amended so that it is in keeping with Scotland&#8217;s devolved responsibilities and Scots law.</p><p>This afternoon, it is important that we recognise how we have reached this point, as my colleagues Patricia Ferguson and Graeme Pearson have done, and that we acknowledge the extensive work that was done by the Leveson inquiry. Over nine months, it heard from more than 600 witnesses. It encompassed the culture, practices and ethics of the press, and Lord Leveson&#8217;s report was welcomed by both the Scottish Labour Party and the UK Labour Party. It would have been unacceptable for the royal charter to proceed if it was not in keeping with his broad recommendations.</p><p>The changes that the inquiry proposed are required to give greater protection to the victims of the press. It cannot be right that celebrities who can afford media lawyers can get justice, but not ordinary families such as the Dowlers. The revelation that the mobile phone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler had been hacked by journalists is what brought the conduct of the press fully into the public spotlight. I have no doubt that every member in the chamber and millions of our constituents were shocked and appalled by the sickening treatment of the Dowler family. The listening to and deleting of voicemail messages that raised the family&#8217;s hopes and severely disrupted the police investigation serve as a stark reminder of the need to act and change.</p><p>As members have already mentioned, this is not just an issue for families in the rest of the UK, as the negative effects have been felt by Scottish families as well. Families such as the Watsons and others, as well as the Dowlers, need our protection.</p><p>Many people are speculating about whether certain press organisations will sign up to a new scheme. I hope that they will, and I hope that those who have ruled out joining will reconsider. However, I do not think that we should speculate too much at this stage about what will happen should the press refuse to join. A cross-party consensus has emerged on the proposals, and that is crucial.</p><p>The Education and Culture Committee has explicitly stated its support for a UK system by royal charter. Scotland and the rest of the UK&#8217;s culture and media make that necessary and inevitable. People in Scotland and the rest of the UK read the same papers and the editors from whom the committee heard evidence agreed that it was preferable to have a single system operating across the UK as a whole. It can be suggested, as some have done, that the recent phone-hacking crimes are a south-east problem but, as Graeme Pearson said, the same papers are sold in Scotland and the same papers are read in Glasgow and Aberdeen as in Manchester and Liverpool, so it is our problem, too.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689722", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Press Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s debate is important because, as we all know, it is vital that we have a system that balances the importance of a free press with the need to protect victims of press abuse.

However, that need is even greater in difficult financial times.</p><p>As has been said, the public sector in Scotland procures around &#163;9 billion-worth of services and goods from the private, voluntary and independent sectors. That is a huge amount of money&#8212;it is nearly the size of the whole of the spend on local authorities or on the health service. That is why it is vital that the Parliament considers the issue. It should seek to consider not only the cost savings to be made but, crucially, how procurement can be used to drive up quality and support some of the key objectives that we as elected representatives want to see&#8212;objectives such as supporting and encouraging job creation; promoting a commitment to fair trade; supporting the development of small and medium-sized businesses; and encouraging good employment and family-friendly practices.</p><p>A number of public sector bodies now pay their staff the living wage and they should be commended for that. However, it cannot be right that, at the same time, they are happy to award contracts to organisations and companies that do not pay their workers the living wage. Public sector organisations can be accused of operating double standards, applying one set of principles to themselves while permitting others not to meet those standards.</p><p>I appreciate that there is a debate about whether European regulations could prohibit the imposition of the living wage as mandatory but, in my view, we should be doing all that we can to promote the living wage through our procurement processes and we should be looking at the use of contract performance clauses. I therefore urge the Government to work creatively to extend the living wage through public sector procurement. If the Government does not act, my Labour colleague Kezia Dugdale is keen to introduce a bill to that effect because, as we understand it from evidence that was given by Thompsons Solicitors to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, that would be possible.</p><p>There has been significant media coverage of the issue of blacklisting and I congratulate Unite the union, GMB and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians and their members for being at the forefront of the campaign to expose that shameful practice. I attended a meeting in Parliament over a month ago and I met members of Unite again earlier today. The message from those present was loud and clear. The trade unions and their members want us to do more than simply condemn the practice by words alone; they want us to use the opportunity of procurement to eradicate the immoral and illegal practice of blacklisting.</p><p>People who were denied the right to work and earn a living deserve nothing less than that. We know that there are at least 582 men and women in Scotland who have been blacklisted&#8212;some of them are in the public gallery today. The map drawn up by the unions shows that people in every part of Scotland have been affected. In my region, people in Paisley, Greenock, Irvine, Clydebank, Johnstone, Erskine, and Renfrew are blacklisted&#8212;the list goes on and on. People were driven into poverty, people suffered from depression, and families broke up because people were excluded from work just because they exercised their basic right to join a trade union.</p><p>That is why my Labour colleagues and I propose that companies that have been found guilty of grave misconduct such as blacklisting in the course of their business activities should be excluded from providing public sector contracts. Regrettably, public sector contracts have been awarded by the Scottish Government and others to companies involved in blacklisting&#8212;we cannot allow that to happen again.</p><p>I welcome the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s commitment to engage with trade unions and I hope that that will be done on a cross-party basis, so that we can send a message that Scotland is no friend of blacklisters. I advise the chamber that if the Government does not act, Labour will. My colleague Neil Findlay, who cannot be here today, has asked me to put on record that if the Government fails to act, he will lodge amendments to the proposed bill to stop public contracts for blacklisters.</p><p>If it is right to exclude companies and organisations that blacklist from public sector contracts, it is surely wrong not to do the same for companies that are guilty of tax evasion. That is an issue that must be dealt with. I understand that many MPs have signed an early day motion in the House of Commons, including members of the Scottish National Party, Labour, the Liberal Democrat Party and the Green Party, and I therefore anticipate that the SNP Government will address the issue in the proposed procurement bill.</p><p>Through Scotland Excel and NHS procurement, the Scottish public sector already saves millions of pounds through procurement. The question is what the next steps are. Once cost has been driven down, the savings on second and third-generation contracts are often harder to make. As I said at the start, making things more cost effective is only one of the benefits. We need to consider how procurement can and should be used for social and community benefits. Renfrewshire Council, for example, already asks those who wish to provide services on its behalf whether they pay the living wage. It is also looking to expand its procurement activities to address the issue of blacklisting and tax evasion, and ask questions about whether companies and organisations have family-friendly employment policies and practise job creation and retention.</p><p>I understand that Scotland Excel will conduct a round-table discussion on Friday, which Scottish Government officials will attend. I hope that the Scottish Government will follow the good leads that we are seeing in Renfrewshire Council and others.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688659", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Procurement Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer to my entry in the register of interests.

The debate is timely in that regard because just last week figures were published that showed that a pupil from a state school in England has more chance of going to university than a pupil from a state school in Scotland.</p><p>There are, of course, questions to be raised on university admissions policy, but questions also need to be raised about Scottish Government policy. Tinkering at the edges is not good enough. Substantial progress will not be made on widening access unless substantial investment is targeted at improving life chances in pre-16 education. This Government&#8217;s lack of prioritisation of pre-school education is incompatible with the widening access agenda, as are the massive cuts to colleges.</p><p>As the committee report states, there was little information in the policy memorandum on levels of representation or on the relative success of various initiatives. That is not surprising because, as officials admitted, there has been something like only a 1 per cent improvement over the past nine years. The policy memorandum also does not explain how the bill would improve access or the rate of improvement that is being sought by the Scottish Government.</p><p>When challenged on that point by the committee, the cabinet secretary said that he did not expect an overall target to be set. If the Government was serious about widening access, it would be serious about answering such questions. Officials even downplayed the possibility of financial penalties if universities did not meet targets&#8212;something that the cabinet secretary has now talked up. All of this is to be achieved without a new and additional budget and there will not be any displacement either. If it sounds too good to be true, it is because it probably is.</p><p>Those are not just our concerns. Concerns have been raised by a number of organisations. The Open University, which was created by a Labour Government in the 1960s, is an institution that probably knows more about widening access than any other organisation in the UK. Like us, it supports the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to increase the number of students from non-traditional backgrounds but it would like to see</p><p>&#8220;greater policy direction in this area&#8221;.</p><p>I can sum up my argument in five words.

The Labour Party shares the ambition for Scotland to be the best place in the world to grow up. I am sure that everyone in the chamber shares that aspiration.</p><p>We all want our children and grandchildren to have a safe, nurturing and enlightening childhood. As legislators, we also want to ensure that our laws protect the rights of all children and young people, set out the responsibilities of public bodies, agencies and Government, and support families. As I have said a number of times, we will support and work with the Scottish Government when it is doing things right and challenge it when we believe that it could be doing more. It is right that parties work together to create better life chances for our children.</p><p>We need to ensure that the rhetoric is turned into reality. Everything in the garden is not rosy. However, despite the somewhat self-congratulatory tone of the motion, we will not vote against it, because we agree with a lot of the Government&#8217;s strategies, such as early intervention, prevention and multi-agency working. We will offer constructive suggestions on what more can be done.</p><p>We enthusiastically believe that strategies such as GIRFEC are an effective way for agencies to work together in the best interests of the child and with parents to plan collegiately for the best future for children. We welcome the recognition that comprehensive implementation of GIRFEC needs funds for staff training if it is to work effectively. We know that some authorities are at a more advanced stage than others in the implementation of GIRFEC as standard practice. We also recognise the need for teachers to be trained, as they are staff who have day-to-day contact with children. However, I am hearing concerns that a one-off, two-day training event belies the need for on-going training in the sector. As with other initiatives, GIRFEC will not stand still. New teachers will come into the system, people will need to refresh their knowledge, and other staff such as admin staff and classroom assistants will require training. Will the minister consider what more can be done to support that important area of work? GIRFEC is very real in many authorities and regular training is needed now.</p><p>I want to put to the minister a number of points on the provision in the children and young people bill to have a named person. How will the proposed role of teachers be divided in a school? Will class teachers in primary schools be responsible for all children in their class? As well as the issue of high pupil teacher ratios, there is the problem of school holidays. Will teachers be expected to maintain their named person duties during those periods and, if not, who will take them on? I would welcome further details from the minister on those points and on the role of a named person in general.</p><p>In health, as in education, across services we need to ensure that we are meeting our children&#8217;s needs. Liz Smith&#8217;s amendment mentions health visitors. Specific issues around health visitors are in need of clarification, particularly with regard to their proposed role in the children and young people bill as the named person until a child reaches the age of five. From the people to whom I have spoken, I understand that many health visitors carry large case loads and do not necessarily see children regularly. What reassurances can the minister offer regarding those concerns?</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s aspiration is for Scotland to be the best place in the world to grow up&#8212;a noble aspiration. However, we need to ensure that the reality matches the rhetoric. In my area, the rhetoric is unfortunately nowhere near the reality of life for many children. In the communities that I serve, deprivation, which already affects far too many, is deepening and widening. As End Child Poverty&#8217;s child poverty map shows, too many people are income deprived and disadvantaged. Health inequalities abound, with two communities just 3 miles apart having a difference of 15 years in male life expectancy. The number of children who are looked after as a result of substance abuse or neglect is rising. Welfare reform is hitting and is set to take millions out of the economy. Shops are selling single eggs because families cannot afford a box of six.

We know that to support vulnerable children, we need to look again at our priorities and support vulnerable families. There will of course be concerns over welfare reform from the UK Government but, as Drew Smith said, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report tells us that we need to focus here on what we can do to help vulnerable families with education, health, housing and childcare.</p><p>On the subject of childcare, the Labour Party, which introduced free entitlement to early education as a matter of urgency in 1997, welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposed increase in entitlement to free early education to 600 hours. We welcome it, but we would have liked it to be introduced much sooner. It will make a difference, but as I have said before we will not solve the childcare problems of 2013 with a six-year-old policy that has still not been implemented and which will not be implemented until 2014 at the earliest. We need a model of childcare in which costs are reasonable and under which parents know that their children are well cared for and are receiving high-quality care.</p><p>The Government could do much more to provide support for vulnerable two-year-olds; that is covered in our amendment. Although we do not agree with the Lib Dems on the exact details, we are sympathetic to their amendment. We welcome the increase in hours and the extension of support to some two-year-olds, but the Labour Party believes that the Scottish Government is lacking in ambition. The proposed children and young people bill guarantees provision only to looked-after children who are two. Many of those children will already be in nursery, and estimates suggest that no more than 800 two-year-olds will be affected. In England, more than 250,000 two-year-olds&#8212;which is 40 per cent&#8212;will have a place by 2014.</p><p>I have heard the First Minister state that he will not increase that guarantee for two-year-olds in Scotland because staff to child ratios are being increased in England.

When Renfrewshire Council sets its budget next week, I know that the new Labour administration will make the best use of the limited resources available. Renfrewshire Council has already shown a determination to do all that it can to assist the most vulnerable people in our communities. The council recently announced a number of measures to support local residents in dealing with the impact of welfare reform cuts. The council is also investing heavily in tackling youth unemployment in Renfrewshire.</p><p>That work is being completely undermined by a Scottish Government that is cutting not only the local government settlement but other financial support. Renfrewshire Council needs to plug not only a &#163;16 million shortfall over the next two years but the &#163;800,000 of youth employment money that was allocated by the Scottish Government last year but is not being continued. With around 13 people chasing every job vacancy in Renfrewshire, funding to tackle youth unemployment should be an absolute priority. We need to do all that we can to help people back into work. The Scottish Government&#8217;s answer appears to be not to give additional money but to pass on disproportionate cuts, which could result in Renfrewshire Council losing 250 staff in the coming year.</p><p>Ministers have described the settlement as a good deal, but the people in Renfrewshire will regard it as a bad deal. As the cabinet secretary and the minister know, Renfrewshire Council is the only mainland council in Scotland to have been allocated the minimum possible grant floor funding by the Scottish Government year on year since 2009. During that time, deprivation has increased significantly. According to the Scottish index of multiple deprivation, last year 48 zones in the 15 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland were found in Renfrewshire, compared with 43 in 2009 and 36 in 2006. Renfrewshire has also experienced an increase in the number of zones in the 5 per cent most deprived areas. Ferguslie in Paisley was judged to be the most deprived area in the whole of Scotland last year. It is no coincidence that the level of deprivation in communities in Renfrewshire is increasing at the same time as the Scottish Government&#8217;s financial support is decreasing.</p><p>In difficult times, support should be provided to those most in need. Why should an area such as Renfrewshire, which has above average social and economic need, receive below average funding? John Swinney and Derek Mackay can change funding settlements when they want to. They have made extra finances available for other areas, so why not give Renfrewshire a fair deal?</p><p>In the past two days, we have seen the Scottish Government make damaging decisions that will have a serious impact in many communities across Scotland. Yesterday&#8217;s cuts are unwelcome, but I fear that, with the Government passing on the buck to local authorities once again, even worse may be yet to come. It is time that this Government stood up for local communities. It is time that the Minister for Local Government and Planning stood up for Renfrewshire and gave Renfrewshire a fair deal.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683985", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2013 [Draft]"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No thanks.

From speaking to young people in Renfrewshire and across the west of Scotland, I know that they are looking for things to do. I doubt that any member in the chamber has not spoken to a young person who has complained about there not being enough for them to do in their area. They want varied, engaging, affordable and accessible activities that prevent them from being bored and I believe that the street stuff project is successful in providing those things to thousands of young people between the ages of 10 and 18 in Renfrewshire each year.</p><p>As we know, the project takes into communities activities that would otherwise not be available there. It delivers for hard-to-reach and disaffected young people throughout Renfrewshire. One of the reasons that the street stuff project has proved to be so successful is the variety of activities that it offers. That is vital for keeping young people engaged. Those activities include street football, youth gym sessions, interactive dance mats, DJ workshops and computer gaming. There are a number of important mobile facilities, including a youth gym bus and a mobile youth activity unit.</p><p>The only complaint that I have ever heard about the street stuff project is not really a complaint, but a compliment. People would like it to be brought into their areas, which is testament to how popular and highly regarded the project is across Renfrewshire.</p><p>The key aims of the project are to develop the social and interpersonal skills of young people who are engaged in the project, to increase physical activity and to promote active and healthy lifestyle choices. Those aims are all welcome. They help to educate young people and build on the skills that they already have. The project also provides training and work experience to support young people into education and employment. We have also heard that one of the main aims of the project is a sustainable reduction in antisocial behaviour and violence in our communities. The success in achieving that is shown by the reduction in the incidence of youth crime across Renfrewshire, which has fallen significantly in recent years. Although there is no doubt that a number of factors have contributed to that fall, the positive impact of the street stuff project on local communities is clear.</p><p>The project has not stood still since it was first launched, but has looked to improve and build on its success. The kick and collect programme was added in 2011 and we should thank St Mirren and the other businesses that have provided free tickets for that initiative. It is a great way of motivating young people to play an active role in improving their local communities and I hope that the programme can be rolled out across the country.</p><p>I join other members in paying tribute to all those who are involved in the street stuff project for their fantastic work in our local communities. I also thank Councillor Eddie Devine, Stevie Gallacher, Angela Convoy, Fiona Walsh, and Carolanne Robertson at Renfrewshire Council and the local area committees and businesses for their invaluable financial support. I will also mention some of the project&#8217;s partners, including Strathclyde Police, Strathclyde Fire and Rescue, Engage Renfrewshire, St Mirren FC and Reid Kerr college.</p><p>The street stuff project relies on core funding and LAC funding and any reduction in that would mean a direct reduction in the services that the project is able to offer. In these challenging financial times, I hope that the street stuff project continues to receive the necessary support to ensure that young people in local communities across Renfrewshire continue to benefit from the project&#8217;s excellent work.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683848", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Street Stuff"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Annabel Goldie for the debate, which is a great opportunity for us to highlight the excellent work that is being done by street stuff and the impact that it is having on young people across Renfrewshire.

That will have serious repercussions for levels of child poverty. Looking ahead, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which was regularly quoted by the Conservatives when they were in opposition, has said that thousands more households will lose the benefit over the next few years because the threshold for receiving it will remain fixed and will not take into account wage inflation.</p><p>The policy has serious failings, including the administrative complexities that Drew Smith mentioned. As I said, I agree with Nicola Sturgeon that the changes to the system are wrong. However, it is important this afternoon to focus on what we can do to support families in Scotland and throughout the UK.</p><p>We all know that we need an economic recovery. We need to support parents back to work and we need to make work pay. How can we encourage parents back to work if they are paid &#163;6 an hour while, at the same time, they pay &#163;5 an hour for childcare? That is not how we rebuild an economy and get people back to work.</p><p>The cuts to tax credits and child benefit will not help, but what is the Scottish Government doing to help parents with childcare? Tom MacInnes, of the highly respected Joseph Rowntree Foundation, hit the nail on the head when he said that action &#8220;cannot wait&#8221;. The foundation, like so many others, has shown that this Parliament has the powers and resources to effect change now.</p><p>Today, in this Parliament, we have a chance to make a difference. The Scottish Government should use its powers and resources to support families. Ministers regularly talk about the extension of nursery hours for three and four-year-olds but the reality is that you have been talking about that since 2007. You will not solve the childcare problems of 2013 with a policy that is six years old&#8212;a policy that you have still not implemented and a policy that you will not implement until 2014 at the earliest. As I have said before in the chamber, one rehashed or recycled policy&#8212;no matter how good&#8212;will not deal with the problems that parents face.</p><p>Your policy to guarantee early learning to only about 1 per cent of two-year-olds is not good enough, particularly when the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are planning to offer nursery places to 40 per cent of two-year-olds in England.</p><p>It is clear that the Scottish Government is not doing enough to help families with childcare. It tries to speak the language of social justice but falls down when it comes to the crunch. It fails to act while, on this side of the chamber, we campaign to end the scourge of child poverty in Paisley and in Plymouth&#8212;child poverty is not acceptable anywhere.</p><p>Labour members continue to view childcare as a major priority because it is an issue of equality and fairness. We need a model of childcare in which costs are reasonable and under which parents know that their children will receive high-quality care. That is why, when you say you need the powers to improve benefits for children, people will ask, &#8220;What you would do with them?&#8221;</p><p>Although I did not agree with everything in Willie Rennie&#8217;s speech, he made an important point: SNP ministers should be careful about making billions of pounds-worth of benefits promises for their independent Scotland. People will rightly question whether those promises are just slick soundbites when ministers do not use the powers and resources that they already have. They will ask how the SNP will increase benefits when it also supports corporation tax cuts for big business.</p><p>Rather than simply calling for more powers, I hope that the minister will outline the positive steps that the Scottish Government will now take to give families the support they need now. A starting point would be to support Labour&#8217;s call for investment in colleges and housing, which could create jobs and opportunities to break the cycle of poverty. The reality is that progress was made on child poverty under Labour and has stalled under this Government.</p><p>The Labour Party has consistently demonstrated our commitment to children and families in Scotland and across the UK.

When Mike Russell was asked a simple question about college waiting lists, he said that they were a &#8220;false concept&#8221;. The only false concepts around here are Mike Russell&#8217;s answers. He disputes the figures that were mentioned earlier. How many people are on college waiting lists? We still do not know, and the cabinet secretary does not know. What is clear is that the Scottish Government&#8217;s own sample interim audit has stated that there are people on lists, in Scotland, waiting for college places. If there was any more doubt, even the SNP Government&#8217;s amendment admits that there are waiting lists.</p><p>It should not be a surprise that we have college waiting lists. It should not be a surprise that that is where we end up when 1,300 staffing posts are removed from our colleges, colleges&#8217; teaching budgets are slashed, and student numbers are cut by 70,000.</p><p>It took Mike Russell six months to apologise for misleading Parliament the last time, when he falsely claimed that he was not cutting the college budget.

How can anyone have any confidence in him when he continually misleads the Parliament and, more seriously, implements policies that continue to damage the life chances of thousands of Scots?</p><p>The key issue is to address the cause of the college waiting lists scandal.

As we have heard, the Scottish Government has made a crystal-clear pledge to abolish it by 2016. Although I am sure that that ambition is shared across the chamber, it appears that progress is not sufficient to make it reality. In fact, the most recent figures show that fuel poverty is not being ended but is increasing. More and more people are struggling to pay their energy bills.</p><p>We have heard a number of statistics this afternoon. It is extremely worrying that Energy Action Scotland estimates that around 900,000 households&#8212;nearly a million&#8212;are affected by fuel poverty. That is not progress. More must be done, as the severity of the situation is clear.</p><p>It is widely accepted that there are three main factors in creating fuel poverty: energy prices, household income and energy efficiency in homes. Many speakers have rightly pointed to energy prices as a significant contributing factor to increasing fuel poverty. Energy prices, which are already unacceptably high, continue to rise while incomes stall. Vulnerable customers who are in need of protection continue to be ripped off while energy companies record huge profits.</p><p>In November last year, Scottish Gas announced a 6 per cent increase in energy prices. At the same time, its parent company, Centrica, posted profits of &#163;1.4 billion. Scottish Gas is not the only culprit: all the major energy providers announced price rises this winter for UK customers, with the big six announcing rises ranging from 6 per cent to 11 per cent over the past few months. Citizens Advice Scotland backs that up in a survey that has already been mentioned. It shows that energy bills have doubled in the past eight years and are set to increase further.</p><p>I recently spoke to a constituent in Paisley who was told that, because of his postcode, he would have to pay &#163;150 to have a pre-paid meter removed from his house. How will people who are already struggling to pay their energy bills be able to get out of the poverty trap if the costs and the postcode discrimination are not addressed?</p><p>Energy giants should not be able to get away with inflation-busting price rises when they are already making massive profits. There is no doubt that the energy market is in need of overhaul. I want vulnerable customers to be protected and savings to be passed on to consumers.</p><p>I agree with my Labour colleagues at Westminster that we need to consider setting up a new, strengthened energy regulator. However, we also need to consider new and innovative ways of helping people with their bills.</p><p>The Labour Party is taking positive steps by launching a switch together campaign to drive down energy costs through signing up thousands of people to switch suppliers collectively and force better deals. That is a practical suggestion that I hope local authorities, housing associations and the Scottish Government will consider and support.</p><p>There is no doubting the impact of hikes in energy prices on households throughout Scotland. However, the Scottish Government can do more to help the families who are forced to choose between heating and eating.</p><p>Two years ago, the Government cut spending on fuel poverty, and families are feeling the impact of that today. The Government has at its disposal powers and resources that it must start using. It has powers and resources to improve the energy efficiency of our homes. For example, yesterday, in the budget debate, we argued that additional investment in housing could not only increase the number of warm and energy-efficient homes but provide an expanded retrofit programme to improve the energy efficiency of existing houses. That, in turn, could create jobs and apprenticeship opportunities, which are even more important because we know that household income is a key part of fuel poverty.</p><p>Figures from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show that the proportion of households that are in fuel poverty is considerably higher in Scotland than in England. The Scottish Government needs to tell us exactly how it will address that.</p><p>I know that the Government has a desire to secure &#163;200 million to invest in tackling fuel poverty, but there are a number of questions&#8212;not just from me but from organisations such as Energy Action Scotland&#8212;that need to be answered about that. I understand that almost two thirds of the required &#163;200 million is to come from the fuel companies, as has been mentioned. I ask again how much of that has been delivered. Can we have an assurance that the money will be passed on to customers through savings on their bills?</p><p>We need to support community groups that are working on fuel poverty. With my colleague Mary Fee MSP and Jim Sheridan MP, I took the opportunity last weekend to visit the local energy action plan&#8212;LEAP&#8212;project in Bridge of Weir in Renfrewshire.</p><p>LEAP provides free local services to communities in Renfrewshire. It helps residents to save energy and money by providing free and impartial advice on insulation, draught proofing, heating, grants and subsidies. It was great to meet some of the dedicated volunteers and see the positive work that they are doing to reduce people&#8217;s utility bills. Such initiatives make a difference to communities and I would like the Scottish Government to support the roll-out of more such projects urgently across Scotland, so that households in my region and across Scotland can benefit from those excellent services.</p><p>Vulnerable and low-income families cannot wait years to get help to alleviate the misery of fuel poverty. Instead of seeing significant progress, we are seeing an increase in the number of households that are in fuel poverty. The Scottish Government pledged to abolish fuel poverty by 2016. There is no doubt that rising energy prices make that target more challenging, but ministers can and must do more. That is the least that families and households deserve.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682266", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join members in welcoming the fuel poverty debate.

The job losses come while Renfrewshire continues to trail behind other local authority areas on Scottish Government funding; Renfrewshire Council is the only mainland council in Scotland to have been allocated the minimum possible&#8212;the funding grant floor&#8212;for the past three years in a row.</p><p>Renfrewshire is a fantastic place that has hundreds of excellent employers, thousands of skilled and hard-working employees and good infrastructure links, but it is clear that more investment and more employment opportunities are needed.

As members have pointed out, the number of female graduates in STEM subjects has increased recently and that is, of course, welcome and I hope that the trend continues into the future. However, it should not distract us from the reality, which is that women are still underrepresented at every level of STEM education and careers. The glass ceiling clearly still exists for women in science.</p><p>In the report &#8220;Tapping all our Talents&#8212;Women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics: a strategy for Scotland&#8221;, the Royal Society of Edinburgh stated that women are lost at every level of the academic career structure. They also continue to be underrepresented in top posts. The report highlights the loss of qualified female scientists to the public and private sectors in Scotland. That represents a loss of individual opportunity and a cost to the Scottish economy.</p><p>The report states:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland fails to realise the full potential of its research base, and will continue to do so if it systematically fails to cope with the debilitating loss of talent represented by the high attrition rate of highly-trained women from employment.&#8221;</p><p>Those words are key in outlining the challenges that we face. It is concerning to hear that 73 per cent of female graduates are lost from STEM careers, compared with less than half the number of male graduates. We need to ask why that happens and examine why female graduates are discouraged from pursuing a career in their field of study.</p><p>Professor Anne Glover, who has been well quoted today, also highlighted some important points when she was asked about the issues for women and science that need to be tackled. She pointed out the difficulties of combining a family life with working in science. She spoke about the importance of encouraging employers to think about how female-friendly their environment is. Professor Glover points to flexibility being a key issue. Allowing work meetings to be tailored to childcare arrangements, job sharing and keeping women in touch with their workplaces when they are on maternity leave are relatively simple things that can make a positive difference. I am sure that all members support such steps, and it is vital that significant steps are taken to foster the kind of work-life balance that encourages women to pursue a career in the science sector.</p><p>Many members have highlighted the importance of our universities to science and research and I do not think that that can be overstated. Our universities have a long and proud history of research, innovation and discovery and, as Neil Findlay and others have said, one of the many benefits of being part of the UK is that Scottish universities receive a large amount of funding from UK bodies; indeed, Scotland punches above its weight when it comes to competing for UK research funding. Scottish researchers continue to work collaboratively with leading researchers from across the UK. We have only to look at the world-famous example of Dolly the sheep, the world&#8217;s first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell, to see the success that such working together can bring. The Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, where Dolly the sheep was created, brings together experts from across the UK and receives substantial funding from the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. We should aim to build on that already successful partnership by making collaboration easier, not more difficult.</p><p>Before the debate, I took the opportunity to find out about the University of the West of Scotland, which is in my area and which George Adam mentioned. Its financial figures for the academic year ending July 2011 show that it received nearly &#163;3 million in research grants and contracts, which included money from UK research councils, the European Commission and UK charities. That sort of funding has allowed the UWS to undertake valuable research projects, which are described on its website, and which Mr Adam also mentioned.</p><p>Members have mentioned various briefings. The Society of Biology briefing that was provided to members highlights the strategy for UK life sciences, which describes the importance of the sector to the UK economy in generating turnover of &#163;50 billion and employing 167,500 people in more than 4,500 companies. That makes clear the important role of science in economic growth, which we should all appreciate, particularly in the current financial circumstances.</p><p>Scientific research plays a significant role throughout modern life. We are rightly proud of our reputation for excellence in research and science, but we need to address the significant challenges that we face. We can and should address those challenges in Scotland while maintaining our status as a world leader in research as part of the United Kingdom.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of Science in Public Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is important that we use the opportunity today to recognise not just the important role that scientific evidence plays in forming public policy, but the importance of science and research to Scotland as a whole and the challenges that the sector faces, particularly in relation to the underrepresentation of women, which is where I start my remarks.

In a survey of Unison members, 92 per cent believed that the new RAG&#8212;red, amber, green&#8212;model created a danger of people slipping through the net.

I have spoken to many students and staff about the effect that the cuts are having on them.</p><p>Worryingly, Audit Scotland identified the true extent of the cuts in its recent report on the challenges that the college sector faces. It said that the Scottish Government&#8217;s revenue support grant to colleges was likely to fall from &#163;545 million in 2011-12 to &#163;471 million in 2014-15. That represents a staggering real-terms reduction of 24 per cent. Figures that the Scottish Parliament information centre has produced show that funds for teaching have been reduced from &#163;469 million in the academic year 2010-11 to &#163;396 million in the academic year 2012-13, with more to come next year.</p><p>In my region, the west of Scotland, the cuts are having a serious impact. Reid Kerr College in Paisley has had its teaching grant cut from &#163;14.4 million in 2011-12 to &#163;13 million in 2012-13. That is a reduction of nearly 10 per cent and more than &#163;1 million. The same can be said of Clydebank College. The SNP might try its best to keep those figures out of the public spotlight, but no amount of smoke and mirrors can disguise the impact that the cuts are having on our colleges. That is just what happened last year; more cuts are on their way.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676797", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate, because there is an absolute need for us to highlight what is going on in our colleges.

I hope and anticipate that today&#8217;s debate will be consensual and constructive, and I should say at the start that we support the Government&#8217;s motion. Our amendment is proposed as a constructive suggestion. We need to work together, because we know that the scale of the challenge that faces us is stark. As the minister has just said, there are 16,000 looked-after children in Scotland at the moment, and that figure has increased every year since 2001. It is at its highest level since 1981.</p><p>We know that, between 2010 and 2011, there was a 2 per cent increase in the number of children who are on child protection registers. The number of children who are in residential care has remained fairly static during recent years, but an increasing number of children have been looked after in community settings by foster carers, prospective adoptive parents and kinship carers. There is therefore a growing need to increase the number of parents who are willing to adopt, to increase the number of foster carers, and to improve the adoption process.</p><p>We know that children thrive in stable and supportive environments, and that permanence gives children long-term stability. As the minister said, our policies must be child centred and must put children&#8217;s needs first. I therefore join the minister in paying tribute to the British Association for Adoption and Fostering for its work in raising awareness of adoption and for its national adoption week, which is in its 15th year, as well as the rule yourself in campaign. I am pleased to see that a host of events and activities will take place across the United Kingdom to raise awareness of the rewards and challenges of adoption.</p><p>I was pleased to see that a number of events will happen in Scotland, including talk to us about adoption drop-in sessions, one of which will take place at the St Enoch shopping centre in Glasgow on Thursday. I am also pleased that Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland is hosting adoption information evenings in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. That type of event is an ideal opportunity for people to meet Barnardo&#8217;s staff and find out a bit more about what adopting with Barnardo&#8217;s is like. I hope and anticipate that those information sessions will be well attended.</p><p>I was also pleased to see that the campaign is using social media as a means of raising awareness and interacting with those who might be interested in adopting. The national adoption week website encourages people to participate in the discussion by joining BAAF&#8217;s chief executive David Holmes on Wednesday from 7pm to 8pm for a twitter question and answer session on adoption.</p><p>Such positive work should be welcomed, because we need to encourage more people to consider becoming adoptive parents and foster carers. I am sure that we have all had contact with parents who have adopted children; I know a number who have done just that. I am sure that, like many others, they were frustrated at the processes that they had to go through and how long they took, but they are now delighted to be supporting a child in a loving environment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate on adoption and permanence.

Becoming a foster carer or adoptive parent is not easy, and nor should it be. Candidates need to go through long and rigorous assessments and sets of checks to ensure that children will be safe and nurtured. We want to ensure that the appropriate checks are in place, of course, but permanency needs to be established sooner rather than later. Lengthy delays in decision making and establishing permanency are frustrating for adoptive parents, and they can be damaging and confusing for children. We know that preventing such delays is easier said than done, as adoption plans can be contested and sometimes there can be challenges in placing children until the final order is made, but we must listen to what parents and people who work on the front line say about how we can address such issues.</p><p>The minister mentioned the children and young people bill. I welcome the move to ensure that carers receive appropriate recognised training, but we caution the Government that any training should be at an appropriate level. Similarly, we welcome the move to limit the number of children whom any foster carer can care for at one time, but we cannot be so rigid in the application of the regulation that children from multisibling families need to be split up for no other reason than that the family exceeds the regulatory number. The wellbeing of children must always be our prime concern.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s plans to enshrine the getting it right for every child approach in legislation with the children and young people bill and to have a named person for each child are also welcome, as is the seeking to improve information sharing and planning in relation to individual children. That will help with the early intervention that is needed.</p><p>Early intervention is crucial. We know that, in July 2011, there were 80 unborn children on child protection registers. Previously, some local authorities did not place unborn children on child protection registers&#8212;they did not place children on those registers until they were born. The revised national guidance states that unborn children should be placed on child protection registers if that is required. That is a welcome step, and it is to be hoped that it will lead to children being placed in permanent care more quickly.</p><p>Early intervention is also crucial because we know that identifying adoptive parents for older children is a major challenge. It can be difficult to find adoptive parents for boys over the age of five and for girls over the age of eight. It is also difficult to find adoptive parents for children with special needs, who will often be the most damaged from their life experiences.</p><p>It should not be forgotten that parents will often require on-going support even after a child has been adopted or fostered. There are good examples of such care. Barnardo&#8217;s provides a post-adoption support service, and I know that a number of adoptive parents and foster carers have found that service to be very useful. Therefore, we welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment in its national parenting strategy to developing good practice in providing support to adoptive parents before and after a child is placed with them.</p><p>Sharing good practice is key&#8212;the minister mentioned that&#8212;and that is one of the major themes in the helpful briefing that Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland provided for the debate. Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland has made a number of important points and suggestions. It has raised concerns about inconsistency in the evidence that local authorities gather in the decision-making process, and it believes that local authorities and the Scottish Government must collect more robust data on the process, including data on the times that are taken to place children and the reasons for delays. It has pointed out concerns that no aggregated data or evidence is routinely collected that could help to identify areas of good practice.</p><p>I know that the minister will carefully consider the points that Barnardo&#8217;s has made, as I am sure that we all appreciate that data collection is crucial to understanding the problems and helping to improve outcomes. Sharing good practice is also important, because the recruitment of prospective adoptive parents is not always uniformly positive across Scotland. Some authorities struggle to identify potential parents.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland made an important point about support for social workers. As a son of two retired social workers, I should probably declare an interest here, but there is no doubt that social workers are caring and dedicated professionals who do an important job in often challenging circumstances. Resources are important in this debate, and it is concerning to hear of social workers with increasing case loads and of their concerns about the pressures that that places on them in trying to meet the needs of children and families. We must aim to ensure that social workers are adequately supported and properly resourced and, along with thanking adoption panel and children&#8217;s hearings panel members for all their hard work, we should thank social workers for all the work that they do all year round, which often goes unrecognised.</p><p>The problems of looked-after children and the adoption process have been with us for many generations. Solving those problems will not be easy, but we must do whatever we can because we know that, if we can give children a stable, loving and supportive environment, they will thrive and flourish. We must do what we can to ensure that children get the best possible start in life in a stable and supportive environment, to share good practice and to support adoptive parents and people working on the front line. As corporate parents, we must do all that we can to help Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable children.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-04682.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;further notes the publication of the consultation responses to the Bill and agrees to give them full consideration as it progresses, and believes that more robust data collection at a national level and adequate support for social workers is critical to ensuring success.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Six years is clearly a very long time.

The organisation&#8217;s recent launch of its updated online dyslexia toolkit is a prime example of the excellent work that it continues to do.</p><p>That valuable resource assists in identifying and assessing the needs of the one in 10 children and young people in Scotland who are affected by dyslexia. I join Stuart McMillan in thanking Margaret Mitchell for bringing the debate to the chamber.</p><p>Dyslexia exists in all cultures and across the range of abilities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Dyslexia Scotland states:</p><p>&#8220;Unidentified, dyslexia is likely to result in low self esteem, high stress, atypical behaviour, and low achievement.&#8221;</p><p>However, it is widely recognised that dyslexia does not need to be a barrier to achievement. A number of successful individuals have spoken publicly about their dyslexia, including household names such as Sir Richard Branson, Jamie Oliver and, as we have heard, Sir Jackie Stewart.</p><p>There is often a focus on the weaknesses that are associated with dyslexia, whereas people&#8217;s strengths go unmentioned. As Stuart McMillan said, it is important that we use this opportunity to highlight the positive skills that many dyslexic people possess. People with dyslexia are often particularly creative and have strong visual thinking skills, verbal skills and problem-solving skills. Those are qualities that many dyslexic people often use to ensure that they achieve a level playing field so that they can excel in early years and later life.</p><p>Learners with dyslexia will benefit from early, appropriate intervention and targeted, effective teaching. The dyslexia toolkit is central to meeting those crucial aims. As has been said, the dyslexia toolkit was formally launched in June 2010. I welcome last month&#8217;s relaunch under the title &#8220;Addressing Dyslexia&#8221;. As Margaret Mitchell said, it is important that those resources do not stand still and instead continue to develop and incorporate best practice, in order to provide the best possible assistance.</p><p>The addressing dyslexia toolkit for teachers and early years workers will help those people to identify literacy difficulties and dyslexia early and to support pupils once they have been identified. I was pleased to see that it now has a section specifically for parents. Parents are often the first to recognise that a child is struggling, but many often have no previous experience of dyslexia. Gaining initial recognition of their child&#8217;s literacy difficulties and obtaining the support needed can seem a daunting prospect. The toolkit offers parents a wide range of advice on such things as understanding dyslexia, approaching a child&#8217;s school and finding support groups where parents can speak to others in the same situation.</p><p>It is clear that challenges remain. A lack of consistency of support across local authorities remains an issue. I hope that the Scottish Government will take action to improve that. From speaking to parents I have also heard reports of differences in the level of support that is available between schools in the same local authority area. We must ensure that schools have the required resources at a time when local authority budgets are being squeezed and the numbers of classroom assistants and teachers have been reduced.</p><p>Another crucial area is support in employment, for both the individual affected by dyslexia and the employer. It is essential, therefore, that Skills Development Scotland takes a leading role in providing support measures for particularly challenged young people.</p><p>I acknowledge the importance of the individuals and organisations involved in increasing the understanding of dyslexia and supporting the people who are affected by it. It is essential that we work together to continue to provide the best possible support for them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674871", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dyslexia"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today is an opportunity for us to recognise the importance of understanding dyslexia and to pay tribute to the excellent work of Dyslexia Scotland.

Given the current economic climate, the obvious challenge is to identify ways in which that can be done creatively and effectively. As is stated in the national Gaelic language plan, Gaelic is an official language of Scotland and investment in Gaelic initiatives has the potential to produce educational, social and cultural benefits. The plan&#8217;s headline aim of attaining stability in the number of people speaking Gaelic is an aim that I join previous speakers this afternoon in welcoming.</p><p>This summer, I was fortunate enough to make my first visit to the Western Isles. When I was there, I was struck not only by the beautiful scenery but by the very important role that the Gaelic language has in those areas&#8212;not just in the past, but in the here and now, as a living language. We must support those communities to protect that heritage and Gaelic as a living language.</p><p>Moving from one beautiful part of the world to another, it would be remiss of me not to mention that the Royal National Mod is coming to Paisley in 2013. The festival&#8212;famous for celebrating Gaelic linguistic and cultural heritage&#8212;provides opportunities for people of all ages to perform across a range of competitive disciplines, including Gaelic music and song, Highland dancing, drama and literature.</p><p>Having been once before, I know that Scotland&#8217;s premier Gaelic festival will not only be a very enjoyable event for local residents to attend, but will act to raise awareness of Gaelic language and culture in an area where the language is not readily spoken. I am certainly looking forward to going again when it comes to Paisley next year.</p><p>I spoke in the chamber earlier this year about the importance of introducing children to modern languages at an early age and the same applies here. If we are to see an increase in the number of Gaelic speakers, it is essential that early years development should be considered a priority.</p><p>The plan identifies a number of strategic priorities for the early years development of Gaelic, including strengthening links</p><p>&#8220;between the use of Gaelic in the home and Gaelic&#8221;</p><p>pre-school</p><p>&#8220;provision&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;Improving the quality and availability of voluntary-led Gaelic pre-school activities&#8221;.</p><p>Those areas have to be considered as priorities, but I would also like to see further details and specific plans for how we achieve each of the priorities identified in the plan, as well as an outline of the resources required to make the plan a success.</p><p>Although I was not a member of the Education and Culture Committee at the time, it is important to recognise the points that were raised in the committee report that was published in December 2011. The committee welcomed the plan but did express a concern that the plan is so wide ranging and broadly focused that it was</p><p>&#8220;difficult to identify ... and ... determine the most important priorities&#8221;.</p><p>To avoid falling into the trap of becoming another strategy that sounds great on paper but fails to have any real impact on the ground, I hope that that concern is taken into account. It is essential that key priorities are established and specific plans are outlined for how those priorities are to be achieved. I also hope that the Scottish Government will monitor closely the progress that is made in achieving the plan&#8217;s aims.</p><p>If the plan is to be successful in its overarching aim, it is clear that collaborative working will be required. A number of bodies have an important role to play, particularly in the development of the Gaelic language in the early years. There is an opportunity for public authorities in Scotland to deliver elements of this national Gaelic language plan through their own strategies.

However, he was keen for the debate still to take place.</p><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about an organisation that has been instrumental in the fight against child neglect and abuse, and which has been at the forefront of child protection since the 1800s.</p><p>The NSPCC was established in 1884 by the Reverend Benjamin Waugh who, having witnessed high levels of child deprivation and cruelty in London, strove to draw public and Government attention to the plight of children. Within five years, the society had branches throughout the United Kingdom, had changed its name to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and had played a major role in changing the law to protect children, with the passing of the first prevention of cruelty to children act, which was the Prevention of Cruelty to, and Protection of, Children Act 1889.</p><p>Since its establishment, the NSPCC has helped more than 10&#160;million children. It continues to be involved in groundbreaking programmes and its innovative strategies aim to find the best and most effective ways of helping children and of using its resources efficiently to reach as many children and young people as possible. Key areas that the NSPCC is prioritising include physically and sexually abused children, disabled children and children aged under 1.</p><p>The NSPCC has had a presence in Scotland through its links with ChildLine Scotland and the centre for learning in child protection. In 2010, Matt Forde was appointed as head of services in Scotland, together with a team of experts to support the efforts of the charity, in partnership with other leading children&#8217;s charities, to fund and add new services to those that are already in existence.</p><p>This year a number of new initiatives are being heralded that are aimed specifically at helping children and families. Child protection remains at the forefront, with programmes concentrating on the most important issues surrounding the children who are at greatest risk. Programmes that are currently being delivered in Scotland include the improving parenting, improving practice programme and the parents under pressure programme. Improving parenting, improving practice is a groundbreaking new programme that is being trialled by the NSPCC to help parents to improve their relationships with their children. Renfrewshire is one of eight areas where the new programme, which is the first of its kind in the UK, is being piloted. The NSPCC believes that neglect arises as a result of poor parenting skills, together with the inability of parents to bond with their children. The NSPCC holds to the belief that early intervention can help parents to change their behaviour by helping to eradicate emerging problems before they become long-term issues.</p><p>Sadly, even in 2012, neglect remains the biggest reason why a child will need protection. The improving parenting, improving practice programme aims to reduce instances of neglect by helping parents of children aged between four and 10 to bond better with their children and to have a greater understanding of their needs. Two approaches are being tested and both are carried out in the family home. Over a two and a half year period, 1,640 families will be supported in eight locations across the UK. One approach uses videos to film parents playing a game or getting involved in another activity with their child. An NSPCC social worker provides feedback to the parents on what they did well and on how to interact better with their child. It aims to build parent confidence and the bond between parent and child.</p><p>The second approach supports parents who, due to depression, family conflict or problems with their child&#8217;s behaviour, cannot cope and, in turn, neglect the child. Through home visits and telephone support, the NSPCC worker will help parents with stress and anger management.</p><p>The approaches will be evaluated to find out which, if either, is more effective in identifying, tackling and preventing neglect at an early stage and I am pleased that the evidence will be shared with the Government and the use of the approaches will be promoted throughout the UK.</p><p>Parents under pressure is another programme&#8212;it was developed in Australia&#8212;that is being delivered in Renfrewshire to vulnerable families. It is an intensive home-visiting programme that runs for 20 weeks and aims to help parents who are undergoing treatment for severe drug and alcohol problems to bond with their babies and improve their parenting skills. The NSPCC is working with families who have children aged under two and a half. A randomised control trial is being used to determine the success of the programme in preventing abuse and improving the parent-child bond. The parents under pressure programme in Australia has proved to be successful in helping to keep children safe and in promoting a closer bond between parents and their babies.</p><p>NSPCC programme teams work in conjunction with other agencies that are involved with the family and hope to reduce the number of babies and toddlers who are harmed by parents who have severe substance misuse problems by providing the parents with the coping mechanisms, care, support and education that are necessary to help them to enable their children to have the brightest possible future.</p><p>Child neglect is the most commonly reported child protection concern in the UK, with some studies suggesting that as many as 10 per cent of children are at risk. Such neglect is damaging to children in the short term, and in the long term it is associated with some of the poorest outcomes and can have on-going tragic effects from generation to generation. On the other hand, kindness and care are of on-going benefit, and make for a happier society, more dignified treatment and huge savings on health expenditure. Accordingly, organisations such as the NSPCC play a valuable and essential role.</p><p>I have great admiration for the achievements of the NSPCC, which raises the vast majority of its own funding, and for the relentless work of the organisation in tackling the problem of child neglect by helping to identify children who are at risk, raising awareness among practitioners and the public, sharing models of good practice, introducing new initiatives and offering early support to children and families.</p><p>I am delighted that one of the pilot programmes that are under way at the moment encompasses Renfrewshire. I will continue ardently to support the NSPCC&#8217;s campaign in its fight against an issue that sadly has become a major feature of life in this country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I apologise on behalf of Hugh Henry, who is unable to speak to his motion today as he has, unfortunately, to attend a family funeral.

It is an important and challenging debate on an issue that we need to deal with on a cross-party basis and with consensus.</p><p>Drug misuse is not an easy problem to deal with. As we know, there are about 60,000 problem drug users in Scotland and, on average, for every known problem drug user, four other people&#8212;often family members&#8212;are directly affected. Therefore, there is no doubt that drug misuse affects a significant number of people in Scotland. Many of them will be children who, through no fault of their own, are neglected because of their parents&#8217; drug addiction. The Scottish Government estimates that 40,000 to 60,000 children are affected by parental drug misuse, but more recent studies suggest that the figure could be even greater.</p><p>Parental drug and alcohol misuse can have a serious impact on all aspects of children&#8217;s and young people&#8217;s lives. For some children, basic needs might not be met and there is a heightened risk of maltreatment and abuse. Audits of child protection registers have found that a significant proportion of children live with parental drug and alcohol misuse. Parents with drug problems are often physically and emotionally unable to meet children&#8217;s needs, which can result in children taking greater responsibility in the household and can affect their education.</p><p>We must recognise that the secrecy and stigma surrounding the issue are likely to affect parents and children when they consider seeking support. In some cases, children might feel frightened about the consequences of telling someone outside the family. Children want somebody to talk to whom they can trust, who does not judge them, who listens and who is reliable. Meeting other children who have similar experiences can often prove to be helpful.</p><p>Family support groups provide an opportunity for relatives, partners and friends to meet others who are experiencing or have experienced similar circumstances. As Nanette Milne pointed out, surveys have shown that family members of addicts often feel isolated, depressed and stressed. It is widely accepted that addicts need support to recover but so, too, do family members.</p><p>Given that responses to surveys have made it clear that family support groups offer the type of supportive, non-judgmental environment that helps recovery, we should welcome the work being done by the Grampian Family Support Forum and Scottish Families Affected by Drugs to bring families affected by drugs together. The dedication and commitment of staff and volunteers in such projects provide much-needed support to families affected by drug misuse. As families benefit from working together, developing bonds and relationships and helping one another to get through challenging periods in their lives, we must ensure that not only information but the best advice are properly shared with them and that they are given the practical support they need.</p><p>I am sure that other members will highlight examples of good practice from across Scotland. However, I believe that we should acknowledge the contribution made by grandparents and recognise the pressure felt by kinship carers who step in to look after children of drug-addicted parents. Not only do many kinship carers not get the financial support that they need, but they are not well equipped physically and emotionally; after all, they often have to look after young grandchildren as well as deal with their own child&#8217;s drug addiction. The financial support for kinship carers that the Scottish Government promised has still not arrived, and I ask it to bring forward that support as soon as possible.</p><p>Although it is vital that families are supported, Scottish Families Affected by Drugs has found that, despite the pressures that they face, most family members wait for at least two years before seeking help for themselves. I know that people are keen to change that situation but, in order to do so, we must tackle the stigma surrounding drug misuse. Indeed, 41 per cent of respondents to the Scottish Families Affected by Drugs survey said that stigma had been a barrier to their seeking help for a relative. The truth is that we all have a duty to tackle stigma, as it can have very serious consequences. We must also ensure that the proper facilities and treatments are available to those who decide that they want to come off drugs because, if they are not, we will see a long-term decline in their chances of recovery.</p><p>The problem of drugs is not easy to deal with. As I said, we need to approach the issue on a cross-party basis and build a consensus about how we move forward on it.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-03394.2, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;; recognises the contribution of Scottish Families Affected by Drugs, and believes that family support groups need to be given the support required to help their members and relatives through challenging periods in their lives.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Nanette Milne for bringing forward this debate on supporting families who are affected by drugs.

As my colleague Neil Findlay said, Labour welcomes the languages working group&#8217;s report, which makes a number of positive recommendations.</p><p>We know from a recent survey that has already been mentioned that in many European countries nearly all secondary school pupils learn two or more foreign languages, while more than half of the senior secondary pupils in the UK do not study a foreign language at all. As Neil Findlay, Stuart McMillan and a number of other members have made clear, language learning is life-enhancing and opens up possibilities that are not available to those restricted to only one language.</p><p>Claudia Beamish, Liam McArthur and others set out the economic case for language learning; indeed, as we know, the report estimates that the decline in language learning has cost the Scottish economy around &#163;0.5 billion. As a result, the cultural and economic motivation for improvement is clear.</p><p>Many members recognised the dedication and commitment of modern language teachers and assistants up and down the country, and I am pleased that the working group report has acknowledged the</p><p>&#8220;considerable innovative practice in relation to the teaching of languages&#8221;.</p><p>Although the 1+2 policy that the working group has outlined is to be welcomed, and although increased language learning is a good and ambitious idea&#8212;as Neil Findlay, Kezia Dugdale, Liz Smith and Liam McArthur have stated&#8212;there are clear and obvious concerns about its proposed implementation. There is universal recognition that developing language skills from an early age is best supported by well trained teachers and language assistants but, as many of my Labour colleagues and other members have pointed out, the numbers of both have fallen significantly since 2007.</p><p>The report states that foreign language assistants in primary schools and secondary schools will have a key role to play in the successful implementation of a 1+2 policy but, as we have heard in this debate, there are only 59 such assistants this year, down from almost 300 in 2005-06. The report clearly states that this ambitious goal will be achievable only with the right resources, and it is obvious that the Scottish Government must take action to address that decline if we are to avoid another strategy that sounds great on paper but fails to deliver on the ground. Given estimates that council funding for foreign languages will have to double&#8212;or possibly even treble&#8212;to make this policy a reality in our schools, I would welcome more detail from the minister on how the Government intends to fund this initiative. He mentioned a figure of &#163;4 million and we look forward to seeing more detail on what that &#163;4 million is for and what it will provide.</p><p>Although the 1+2 model of language learning in primary schools is to be welcomed, it is not enough in itself and the languages working group report makes a number of other key points and recommendations. As Neil Findlay mentioned in his opening remarks, there is also an issue about the emphasis placed on learning additional languages from P1 and the lack of a requirement for secondary pupils to study an additional language beyond a certain age. Such subjects are no longer part of the core curriculum. As Margaret McCulloch, Hanzala Malik and many others pointed out, we must tap into the many international languages that the children and young people in our schools already speak.</p><p>We must also look at enhancing partnership working between primary and secondary schools to ensure continuity of learning. The working group&#8217;s report highlights that very issue and research carried out by Scotland&#8217;s national centre for languages indicates that up to a third of the primary schools that responded have no regular language links with secondary schools in their areas.</p><p>Perhaps the most worrying part of the working group&#8217;s report is the recognition of a significant decline in the number of languages taken forward to SQA-certificate level. I do not believe that that is just an issue of take-up&#8212;to believe that would be to blame pupils&#8217; motivations; possibly, it is part of a worrying trend of high school pupils being unable to choose the highers and advanced highers that they want to choose at their local school.</p><p>I am aware that in at least one local authority the overall number of highers and advanced highers in languages and other subjects taught in school has fallen. It is vital that that is part of any audit. I suggest that the Government carries out a similar audit to see if the general number of highers and advanced highers is reducing in schools in the other 31 local authorities to ascertain whether our young people are getting the choices locally that they deserve.</p><p>As many members have mentioned, the reality is that 75 per cent of the world&#8217;s population does not speak English, and we should give consideration to learning the languages of countries whose economies will undoubtedly play a stronger role on the world stage in the future. Claudia Beamish mentioned China. Brazil, Russia and the countries of Eastern Europe are other obvious examples. Although the working group did not set a specific hierarchy of languages to be learned by pupils, it did note the strong case to be made for learning languages such as Portuguese, Arabic and Russian, as well as other Slavonic and Eastern European languages.</p><p>I note that part 5 of the report details the working group&#8217;s recommendation that the Government should engage with higher education to look at the implications of the report for that sector and for students. I was pleased to see the suggestion that universities should look to expand the number of languages offered to take account of a future increase in the number of languages taught in schools and the anticipated increase, over time, of pupils studying to higher level and beyond. The Government therefore needs to be serious about supporting the teaching of languages at Scottish universities.</p><p>Sandra White referred to the Public Petitions Committee, which is considering a petition in the name of Dr Jan Culik, a senior lecturer in Czech studies at the University of Glasgow, calling for the Scottish Parliament to protect lesser-taught languages at our universities. The petitioners are rightly concerned that a lack of targeted funding for lesser-taught languages will mean that Scotland is at risk of losing much of the teaching provision for lesser-taught languages. The petition seeks the Scottish Government&#8217;s support for the University of Glasgow&#8217;s unique languages-based programmes in Czech, Polish and Slavonic studies, and in Latvian, Estonian and Hungarian. Once lost, the existing expertise will not be easy to regain and I hope that the Scottish Government will give the petition serious consideration.</p><p>The Labour Party is committed to providing opportunities for young people across Scotland. Members have given numerous examples of how language learning can help to do that and provide significant cultural and economic benefits. Therefore, it is vital that any policy is realistic and takes into account the challenges faced by schools and education authorities.</p><p>The 1+2 policy must be fully resourced, to allow well-trained teachers and language assistants to help children develop language skills from an early age. We need enhanced partnership working between primary and secondary schools. Action must be taken to address the decline in language courses being offered in secondary schools. Support must be given to higher education institutions that provide strategically and economically important, but vulnerable, language courses.</p><p>Increased language learning is a good idea but the challenge is as the report states, that we need</p><p>&#8220;the right approach and the right resources&#8221;</p><p>to make it achievable.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The speeches in this morning&#8217;s constructive debate leave little doubt that we can and should do more to promote language learning.

We have a debate not to launch a consultation process or even, at the end, to discuss the strategy.

It is vital that we use the opportunity to do just that and&#8212;crucially&#8212;to support parents rather than simply to lecture them. We need to develop a strategy that embeds in our culture the idea that it is natural&#8212;that it is expected, even&#8212;that all parents need advice and support at some stage. We must challenge the stigma that says that only vulnerable parents and parents at risk need a helping hand. That is why Labour members want to see more action from the Government to support parents and other guardians. We want to see the Government deliver on the promises that it has already made, and we want to take the opportunity to make other suggestions.</p><p>We want the Government to support parents. That should include working with local authorities, health boards and the voluntary sector to improve the existing network of family centres, and it should start with communities in which there are the highest levels of deprivation. Family centres provide support and advice for parents as well as specialised intensive work with vulnerable children. That can include play sessions, transition support, mentoring and respite. I know that both the Labour and the SNP manifestos included a commitment to a new generation of family centres, so I expect that we will see specific plans for that detailed in the strategy.</p><p>It has been mentioned that we also need to see action to increase free childcare and nursery provision for three-years-olds and four-year-olds. As we know, the SNP Government made a pledge on that back in 2007, and it could be introduced now with a simple piece of legislation. Instead, childcare measures are being folded into a children&#8217;s bill that will take years to implement. We want action to support parents and other guardians sooner rather than later.</p><p>We support initiatives such as the FAST&#8212;families and schools together&#8212;project, which is run by Save the Children. It aims to boost the chances of children in the UK&#8217;s most deprived areas by supporting parents to improve their children&#8217;s learning and development at home so that they can reach their full potential at school.</p><p>According to Save the Children, teachers have reported, after just eight weeks, a 10 per cent improvement in reading, writing and maths among children who are enrolled in the FAST programme, and that 73 per cent of parents have become more involved in their children&#8217;s education. That demonstrates significant developments in a short time. I was pleased to visit one such project in Clydebank late last year.</p><p>We also need a corporate parenting strategy that will improve our performance as corporate parents to the most vulnerable children who most need our help. We hope and anticipate that commitments to those ideas will be part of the national parenting strategy.</p><p>We need action from the Government to support parents and other guardians. Although the Scottish Government talks a good game in that regard, we would feel more confident if the Government had already delivered on its commitment to support parents and on the promises that it has made. There would be no better way for the Scottish Government to show that it is serious about supporting parents and other guardians than to deliver on those specific promises.</p><p>I mentioned increased nursery provision earlier; another such commitment is on kinship care. The level of financial support for kinship carers is less than the support for foster carers in far too many local authorities, and we hear from kinship carers about patchy support depending on which local authority area they live in. Patchy support is little better than no support at all.</p><p>We know that the First Minister committed on 27 September 2007 to providing &#163;10&#160;million to fund financial support that is equivalent to that which is paid to foster parents. Successive SNP ministers made further commitments that the promise would be met via the concordat with local government by 2011 at the latest, but that is still not happening.</p><p>In 2007, the Scottish Government promised aid to kinship carers&#8212;who are often elderly and making sacrifices to help children, and who are seeking not massive sums but simply equal treatment&#8212;and yet it did not deliver.

The election campaign is about local issues; it is not about one person&#8212;Alex Salmond.</p><p>Like many other members, during the campaign I have been knocking on doors and talking to voters. I have been saying to people in Renfrewshire that, despite his prominence in the SNP&#8217;s council election campaign, Alex Salmond will not clean up the dog mess at the end of the street, he will not fix the potholes, he will not put the school bus back on and neither he nor his special adviser will provide meals for the elderly&#8212;unless, of course, the person concerned happens to be Rupert Murdoch or Donald Trump. Those services are delivered by dedicated council staff, who do a good job in difficult circumstances. The decisions that are made about those services should be made by local councillors who are elected by local people.</p><p>There will always be a debate about what powers should sit where. A balance needs to be struck. Some decisions should be made at a local level to give people a say over local issues, but some should be made at a national level in order to ensure that there is a minimum standard of service and a strategic oversight of how the services are delivered.</p><p>Under the SNP Scottish Government, however, there appears to be plenty of willingness to call for more powers from the UK Government but a reluctance to give more power and influence to local authorities. The SNP separation rhetoric&#8212;about being able to make our own decisions and do what we want&#8212;is exactly the same as the argument that is made about why local councils and communities should have more of a say. If the SNP accepts that that is not straightforward in a Scottish context, it should accept that it is not straightforward in a UK context either.</p><p>Frankly, the real issue that we have with local services at the moment is that they, and local authority budgets, are being cut by the SNP Government. We can talk about powers for local authorities to deliver local services all that we want, but if local authorities do not have the appropriate finances, we will not be able to improve communities and people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>Local authorities cannot give more money to local area committees, community councils, tenants associations or parent councils if their own budgets are being cut. Councils need to take tough decisions, because the fact is that local authorities are bearing nearly 90 per cent of the Scottish Government cuts. The figures that make up that 90 per cent come from the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget. Those real-terms cuts to local authority budgets come to 5.7 per cent&#8212;or a staggering &#163;1.6 billion&#8212;over the next three years. The Tories are cutting the Scottish Government budget by 2.2 per cent in real terms.

John Park made a number of good points about that.</p><p>For parents who need assistance in caring for children, some with additional needs, and for children themselves, it is important to provide a safe place and a stimulating environment in which children can grow and learn and experience opportunities and events that they otherwise might not have.</p><p>As Anne McTaggart said, Labour-led Glasgow City Council is already showing the way on this by offering 15 hours a week of nursery provision and pledging to expand its provision to children before they turn three. That will benefit thousands of young children in Glasgow. Glasgow City Council is showing what can be done and should be commended for doing so.</p><p>We recognise&#8212;as many members have done this morning&#8212;that early education and care are inseparable. That is why we moved to give pre-school education grants to childcare services providing early education and care as part of our commitment to children and families. It is not just in the early years that childcare has expanded; out-of-school care for older children is essential for working parents. That, too, grew under Labour but, as the Daycare Trust and Children in Scotland highlight in their recent report, we need to do more to increase the availability of that care, particularly for children with additional needs.</p><p>We need action that will support children and their families, not make it harder for them. I therefore hope that the Conservative-Lib Dem UK Government will reverse its cuts to working tax credits, which are wrong and shameful, as they will have a devastating effect on thousands of low-income families. I also hope that the SNP will meet its pledge to increase nursery provision to 600 hours.</p><p>The SNP stated:</p><p>&#8220;We will increase the provision of free nursery education for 3 and 4 year olds by 50 per cent. That means increasing the entitlement from 400 hours a year to 600 hours a year.&#8221;</p><p>That is on page 51 of the 2007 SNP manifesto. Despite Mark McDonald&#8217;s suggestion that a 20 per cent increase is a great achievement, what the SNP promised was a 50 per cent increase. I hope that we have a 100 per cent implementation of the SNP&#8217;s latest announcement and do not deem a 20 per cent increase to be acceptable. I also hope that we receive more details from the minister about how the SNP will deliver on its pledge, how much resource will be given to local authorities and whether there will be consistent, teacher-led input across the country.</p><p>I hope that the Government will look again at childcare and nursery provision for babies and children under the age of three. Under Labour, the surestart scheme provided nursery places for vulnerable two-year-olds, but the SNP scrapped that in 2007 and has taken five years to announce a new initiative. We welcome the support for places for looked-after two-year-olds, but we also need support for other vulnerable two-year-olds who are not looked after and support for vulnerable children under the age of two.</p><p>As I said earlier, I welcome children&#8217;s charities and childcare providers looking to innovations in childcare regimes elsewhere to see how we can further improve childcare provision in Scotland. We need a Scottish model of childcare that supports the different needs of children and families and which ensures that every child has access to care, no matter where they live. We need a Scottish model in which parents will know that their child is receiving care of a high quality. We also need a Scottish model that celebrates and learns from the excellent work that is done in our childcare centres and which learns from other countries but does not follow slavishly practice in countries and contexts that are far removed from the reality in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663154", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I said in my opening remarks, Labour is committed to high-quality childcare and early education.

When parents have difficulty caring for children, for whatever reason, family members often step in to provide a stable and loving home for children. As a nation, we owe those carers a debt of gratitude.</p><p>This has been a wide-ranging and robust debate, and members have rightly raised concerns about the lack of support for children in kinship care. Although some progress has been made, Scottish Labour secured the debate because of those concerns and because the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government owe children who are looked after by family members the same financial support as children in foster care.</p><p>In the debate on looked-after children, there was consensus in the chamber and we had a constructive and positive debate on how we must help some of society&#8217;s vulnerable children. However, in the space of two weeks, we have gone from unity on looking after those children to debating why we are not doing enough for children in kinship care. Ministers and SNP back-benchers have continually tried to bring this debate back to the question of what the UK Government has or has not done, but Labour&#8217;s motion is about a specific commitment and promise that the SNP made but has not delivered. It is simply not good enough for the SNP to pass the buck and blame Westminster and local authorities&#8212;especially when the power to help kinship carers lies with the Scottish Parliament, and particularly given that carers were sold out in 2009</p><p>&#8220;In return&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>as a letter from SNP councillor Isabel Hutton reiterates&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;for Councils agreement to a specific and enhanced commitment to reduce class sizes&#8221;.</p><p>As for ministers passing the buck and playing the blame game, the Minister for Children and Young People said that she will attend a kinship care conference on Monday. She should try to pass the buck and play the blame game there and see what response she gets from the kinship carers that this Government has simply let down.</p><p>We are raising these concerns because many of the children will be cared for by grandparents and will have experienced many difficulties in their short lives. According to the charity Who Cares? 24 per cent will have lived with abuse, neglect and violence; some will have been deserted by their parents, often because of drug or alcohol abuse; and 10 per cent go to grandparents after the death of a parent, which is often&#8212;again&#8212;because of substance abuse. ADSW suggests that the number of children who require care has increased in every year since 2001 because of parental substance abuse. Who is providing the solution?

I mention that because one station in the greater Glasgow area, Paisley St James, could well be affected. Although it is located close to Paisley Gilmour Street and Paisley Canal stations, Paisley St James has had increasing passenger numbers since 2004-05 and a significant jump in passenger numbers since 2007. In large part, that is because St Mirren Football Club opened its new home stadium a stone&#8217;s throw away from the station. The stadium is now home to the Scotland under-21 team. The station helps home and away fans to attend football matches at the ground.</p><p>SNP members, particularly George Adam, were vocal in their support for changing the name of Paisley St James to Paisley St Mirren, in recognition of its importance to the local community. I say to the SNP and Mr Adam that it is not the name of the station that matters, but the station itself. I hope that Mr Adam and the SNP will be just as vocal in their support for retaining the station, no matter what it is called.</p><p>On a more serious note, Paisley St James is located in one of the most deprived areas in Scotland. Several stations in Glasgow are in areas of high deprivation. The 2001 census showed that 45 per cent of households in Paisley were without a car, which is more than 10 per cent higher than the average for Scotland. On top of that, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s People: Annual report: results from 2009/2010 Scottish Household Survey&#8221; illustrates the clear links between access to a car and the level of deprivation of an area. In the 15 per cent most deprived areas, 44 per cent of households have at least one car available to them, compared to a figure of about three quarters of households in the rest of Scotland.</p><p>As we know, the SNP does not have a good track record&#8212;if members will pardon the pun&#8212;when it comes to railways in Renfrewshire and Glasgow. The Glasgow airport rail link was to be completed in 2013, but the SNP scrapped it. Therefore, the SNP will forgive me and my fellow Renfrewshire residents for wanting a specific guarantee that no stations will close in Paisley before we are convinced that the future of the station is in safe hands.</p><p>I have talked a lot about Paisley stations, but I also have concerns about stations in Glasgow. For example, Mosspark station, which serves the Pollok and Cardonald areas of Glasgow, has been identified as one of the stations that are in close proximity to another. Any alteration to services at that station would have a knock-on effect on the Paisley Canal line and would potentially put the viability of that line in jeopardy.</p><p>I could not help but notice the minister&#8217;s recent comments in Paisley&#8217;s highly regarded local newspaper, the Paisley Daily Express, of which I have a copy. As the minister has reiterated today, he said:</p><p>&#8220;There are no plans to close rail stations in Paisley, or any other part of Scotland for that matter.&#8221;</p><p>As other Labour members have said, we do not want a guarantee that there are no plans; we want a guarantee that there will be no closures.

I also thank the minister for welcoming Labour&#8217;s education team to their new roles. We look forward to working with members across the Parliament on an issue on which there is a great deal of common ground. I was not a member of the committee until very recently, but during the Christmas period I spent time looking over the evidence that has been gathered, and I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.</p><p>Educational attainment levels among looked-after children are a failure not of the children themselves, but of us as a society and as corporate parents, in our efforts to help and support those children and their families. The committee heard that only 0.5 per cent of children who are looked after at home&#8212;fewer than one in 100&#8212;attained five or more standard grades in 2010. The inquiry is therefore vital. We need to ask ourselves why, despite a series of policy initiatives, pilots, projects and working groups, we continue to fail to meet our responsibilities as a society and as corporate parents. We must ask ourselves what more can be done to stop the trend continuing.</p><p>Many children&#8217;s charities have rightly indicated that our aim for looked-after children must be not just to improve qualifications, but to improve outcomes and to harness talents and skills, as well as to offer other support to looked-after children in order to improve their life chances.</p><p>Many statistics will be mentioned in the debate, but we all know that looked-after children should be treated not as statistics, clients or customers but as children.</p><p>I want to use the debate to support enthusiastically the efforts that are being made to help our most vulnerable young people, to highlight examples of good work, and to suggest where we must do better.</p><p>We know that children&#8217;s learning and wellbeing thrive in a stable and supportive home environment. The evidence backs that up, and that is why we must do all that we can to intervene early to help children and, where they cannot remain with their parents, to build security and stability for them by establishing permanent placements as soon as possible. We know the importance of a stable and nurturing environment, so we must do all that we can to support the dedication and commitment of kinship carers. We know from a recent Citizens Advice Scotland report that in two thirds of Scotland&#8217;s local authorities kinship carers still do not receive the same payments as foster carers. Patchy support is little better than no support at all.</p><p>The crucial importance of family centres has been mentioned a number of times in evidence and briefings. They can play a vital role not only in preparing children for school but in promoting good parenting and offering parents support and advice. It is important that family centres are not designated in name only but are properly resourced with strong, flexible, suitably qualified and multidisciplinary staff groups that are equipped to offer an holistic approach to supporting children, families and communities, and are committed to working with others in an integrated way to help children and families.</p><p>Children cannot be expected to leave behind deprivation or the addictions of their parents, along with the emotional baggage that they might have, when they enter the school gates. It is clear that, despite the introduction of getting it right for every child and other policy initiatives, there is still patchy implementation and a need for greater understanding of society&#8217;s responsibilities and greater working together by agencies and professionals. As has been mentioned, there are number of barriers to that, and they need to be addressed.</p><p>One issue that has been raised is whether we can promote earlier action to train teaching staff to deal with looked-after children so that they are fully prepared to provide help and support when they take up posts. Teachers need to know about the difficulties and challenges that those children face, and how they can work with other agencies to support them. It appears that some of the modules that support such work are optional. Work with universities to improve awareness in that area could greatly assist at little extra cost.</p><p>My final point is on resources; it has been made by a number of charities and other organisations, and I know that the committee considered it during its inquiry. I do not say this in a partisan way, but we need to ensure that any progress that has been made is not undermined by the wider budget cuts that we are experiencing, which could have a disproportionate effect on looked-after children. For example, we have 4,000 fewer teachers since 2007. If every minute of teachers&#8217; time is being squeezed and they have larger class sizes, the teachers to whom I have spoken tell me that, regrettably, it is inevitable that less personalised attention will be given to looked-after children who have additional support needs. We must also fully examine the impact of staff reductions, as the number of behaviour support staff fell from 220 in 2007 to 190 in 2011 and the number of school-home link staff fell from 147 in 2007 to 113 to 2011.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the convener and members of the Education and Culture Committee for bringing forward this debate on an important issue.

Some 33 per cent of looked-after children go into further education and only 1 per cent into higher education. The Association of Directors of Social Work and the National Union of Students Scotland, among others, have made important points about the later development of looked-after children and the fact that their educational attainment significantly improves at the age of 18. That is due partly to the important work that further education institutions do with looked-after children. It would be concerning if regionalisation led to a reduction in the courses that looked-after children can access at their local colleges. Given that many looked-after children have attendance issues, the importance of locally available courses cannot be overstated.</p><p>A significant number of other points could be made about improving the life chances of looked-after children.

It has been an excellent debate and valuable points have been made by every member who has spoken. I apologise if I am unable to pick up on all of them.</p><p>It has been clear from all the evidence&#8212;and it has been backed up today&#8212;that our most vulnerable children and young people face a significant number of issues. As members have stated, poor educational attainment is not the only problem affecting those young people later in life. Emphasis must be placed on the importance of outcomes; that point was made by several members.</p><p>As Anne McTaggart said, looked-after young people are less likely to have employment opportunities and, as Liam McArthur said, they are more likely to have mental health issues. They are also more likely to have sexual health issues, to be homeless and to go to prison. Some important facts about that were cited by both Joan McAlpine and Christine Grahame, giving us a stark reminder that we need to do more on the issue.</p><p>The issue is becoming even more severe because the number of looked-after children has increased every year since 2001 as a result of what the ADSW has described as an</p><p>&#8220;epidemic rise in the numbers of children living with drug and alcohol misusing parents&#8221;.</p><p>Individual looked-after children face a complex range of issues; therefore, there needs to be a personalised response. All those issues cannot be fitted into a two-and-a-half-hour debate, which is why I welcome the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s inquiry.</p><p>Members have talked about early years intervention, and the minister talked about the Government&#8217;s announcement of a change fund to support early years work, which can make a big difference to vulnerable children. I cannot think of any better use of preventative spend than helping those children and their families at the earliest stage, hopefully preventing the children from entering the care system.</p><p>Parenting was mentioned by Hanzala Malik and other members. It was also raised by Children in Scotland, which stated in its evidence that children who have poor experience of parenting in their younger years are likely to repeat those mistakes later in life.</p><p>The positive parenting programme&#8212;triple P&#8212;is an international award-winning parenting education programme that has listened to and worked with thousands of parents and professionals throughout the world. It works for many families in different circumstances and with different problems. Whether they are the parents of a tantrum-throwing toddler or teachers who have to deal with truanting, triple P gives people useful ideas to help them to meet the challenges of raising children. The programme has been rolled out by Glasgow City Council education services to all parents of primary 1 and nursery children. Sessions are run regularly in libraries throughout Glasgow, providing parents with necessary information, tips and skills to practise with their children.</p><p>The importance of sharing best practice and working together is a theme that has run throughout the debate. Mary Scanlon made some important points about the need for consistency in approach throughout Scotland. Joan McAlpine made an interesting point about the plethora of policy initiatives and the various plans. That is an important issue that affects not just staff, but children who are expected to go to meeting after meeting and can sometimes feel overburdened and under pressure at the number of meetings that they need to attend. If improvements can be made in that respect, we should certainly consider them.</p><p>Alison Johnstone made an important point about raising awareness of the need for corporate parenting. The committee&#8217;s convener asked for good examples from around the country&#8212;Kevin Stewart mentioned Aberdeen City Council and we have heard about a number of others. We can learn a great deal from the efforts of dedicated staff and charities throughout Scotland, including those at the Kibble Education and Care Centre in Paisley, in the region that I represent. The centre has been looking after children from throughout Scotland for nearly 150 years. The statistics show that 4.7 per cent of children who are looked after away from home achieve five or more standard grades. The great work that the Kibble centre is doing has resulted in around 10 per cent of the children there attaining those grades. However, I know, from speaking to staff at the Kibble centre, that they are not complacent about that and want to improve that rate further, which is very encouraging.</p><p>With the sharing of best practice in mind, I welcome the expertise of organisations such as the Kibble centre being tapped into by local authorities so that it can benefit looked-after children in all our mainstream schools. I hope that the convener and the minister will reflect on that.</p><p>Many members&#8212;including Anne McTaggart, Hanzala Malik, Stewart Maxwell and Liam McArthur&#8212;mentioned the work that is being done by Glasgow City Council to help looked-after children. With around 10 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s population and around 20 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s looked-after children, Glasgow has a great deal of experience in helping to improve the life chances of looked-after children. Anne McTaggart mentioned the work of the CLASS programme.</p><p>Members have mentioned the need to support families, and we can learn a lot from the home start initiative, which has been run by the voluntary sector. Attendance and exclusion were also mentioned. It is not an either/or issue&#8212;dealing with both will be important in improving attainment.</p><p>I return to my earlier contribution by saying that we have a duty towards children whom it is determined have to be looked after by the authorities. Responsibility for the future wellbeing and achievement of those children falls on us as citizens and as corporate parents. We must not fail them any longer.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A number of important issues have been raised in the debate, which I am sure will help the members of the Education and Culture Committee with their inquiry into the educational attainment levels of looked-after children.

It often provides a pathway to personal development, learning and employment. Therefore, it is crucial that we encourage and develop volunteering, particularly among young people, as well as recognise and assist those organisations that already do that.</p><p>I am aware that the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire&#8217;s undertakings are wide ranging. Its activities include recruiting volunteers and matching them to suitable organisations; assisting in the development of new volunteering opportunities, policies and procedures; offering general advice on volunteering; and providing information on training opportunities for volunteers and individuals who work with volunteers.</p><p>I know that the centre&#8217;s staff have a number of positive aims and initiatives for East Dunbartonshire, but I will start by paying particular attention to the excellent volunteer champions project, mentioned by both Annabel Goldie and Fiona McLeod, which works with young people in high schools throughout East Dunbartonshire. The project creates a volunteering environment in schools and trains a number of young people to be champions for volunteering, encouraging their peers to volunteer inside and outside of school, and its aims include improving and increasing the promotion of volunteering within the school environment; empowering young people through volunteering; developing a volunteering culture within the learning environment; promoting award schemes for volunteering; and establishing an East Dunbartonshire volunteer champions network.</p><p>I know from speaking to Paul O&#8217;Kane, the centre&#8217;s development officer, just what impact the project has already had in East Dunbartonshire. In its first phase, 16 volunteer champions were recruited, completed their training at Turnbull high school and went on to promote volunteering within the school environment. Many of the first 16 have also been trained in facilitation and are now leading sessions in the new volunteer champions training programme. Such training and responsibility provide young people with fantastic experience that they can take forward; increase confidence; develop leadership and communication skills; improve CVs; and provide a genuine boost to young people aiming to access further education or find employment. The centre&#8217;s aim of establishing a volunteer champions programme in all East Dunbartonshire secondary schools should be welcomed, and I hope that this type of project will soon be replicated in other parts of the country. It is vital that the Scottish Government recognises the importance of volunteering in all educational establishments, and I hope that consideration will be given to how we can improve volunteering among our young people.</p><p>As I have said, the volunteer champions project is only one of the centre&#8217;s many positive initiatives. I want to briefly mention the successful befriending service, also mentioned by Annabel Goldie, which pairs a trained volunteer with an isolated adult. The pair are in regular contact for an agreed period of time and engage in social activities usually enjoyable to both. The befriending relationship, which is initiated, supported and monitored by the centre&#8217;s befriending staff, aims to make a difference to the quality of life of people experiencing social isolation due to ageing, disability or other changes in their circumstances and hundreds of people have benefited from the service since it was introduced by the centre more than 11 years ago.</p><p>None of these excellent projects and services would be possible without the commitment, hard work and creativity of the centre&#8217;s excellent staff and I am sure that we in the chamber can unite in placing on record our appreciation not only for their work but for the efforts of all those who have participated in volunteering initiatives in East Dunbartonshire, which continues to lead the way in volunteering in Scotland.</p><p>I have to admit that I have yet to visit the centre&#8212;I have not found time to do so in the past six months&#8212;but I met its staff and volunteers at the opening of Parliament in July.

My colleague Kezia Dugdale will speak about the importance of the games having a legacy in terms of youth employability, which is a crucial issue, given the investment that is taking place and the chance that it offers to provide work opportunities and to help young people to gain the skills that they need to get a job.</p><p>I welcome Glasgow City Council&#8217;s Commonwealth jobs fund and its Commonwealth graduate fund, both of which will make a significant contribution to employment in Glasgow.</p><p>I will concentrate on the wider benefits that the games can provide for young people and children in Scotland. First, it is encouraging that, thanks to Glasgow City Council, the Scottish Government and their many partners, the games are financially on budget and, in planning terms, on time.</p><p>One of the most important legacies that can be achieved following the games is the improved fitness and health of our children and young people. I think that we are aware on all sides of the chamber that, if children and young people are active, it will improve their health in their early years and continue to benefit them in later life.</p><p>Members of the Scottish sports alliance raised an important point about the need to improve the basic physical literacy of our children. We must look at all the ways in which we can increase the number of children who are able to run, jump, throw, catch and swim. The importance of that is emphasised by statistics on childhood obesity. According to the Scottish health survey, in 2010 almost 30 per cent of children were overweight or obese and 32.5 per cent of children had a body mass index outwith the healthy range. I am sure that we can all agree that such statistics make worrying reading and require action. The Commonwealth games and the showcasing of sport, along with the provision of two hours of quality physical education for all schoolchildren, can and should be aimed at creating a culture of regular participation in sport and physical activity, which in turn would constitute a huge step forward in our battle with obesity.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that sport and play not only make children and young people healthier but give them the confidence to apply themselves to other tasks that they encounter in everyday life. What is also important is that such aspirations can give them the confidence to learn and can improve their concentration and educational attainment. Sport therefore has the potential to give our children healthy bodies and healthy minds.</p><p>I welcome the recruitment this year of 96 Commonwealth games youth legacy ambassadors. They have an important role to play in getting young people involved in Glasgow 2014 and in encouraging people to be more active. Who better to ensure that the games have a lasting and positive legacy for young people than young people themselves? I pay tribute to Young Scot for its work with local authorities throughout Scotland and look forward to further progress in that area.</p><p>It is important that we recognise and learn from the success of the Lanarkshire international children&#8217;s games, which took place in August. The world&#8217;s biggest youth sporting event brought a total of 1,300 competitors and coaches, along with administrators and delegates, to Scotland. Seventy-seven cities from 33 countries worldwide were represented.</p><p>Lanarkshire 2011 was the 45th time that the international children&#8217;s games have been held but the first time in their history that the games had a legacy plan, which included a focus on education and learning and on promoting the importance of health. Event organisers also made a commitment to ensuring that equipment that was purchased and facilities that were improved would become available to support local sports clubs and to creating a Lanarkshire-wide youth sports competition involving schools and sports clubs. Lanarkshire should feel the benefits of hosting the international children&#8217;s games for years to come. That is exactly what we all want to see throughout Scotland following Glasgow 2014.</p><p>When Wimbledon is on, for two weeks there is a surge in the number of young people playing tennis. When the Ryder cup is on, participation in golf increases. On the day of a football match, I remember as a child going to the local park to re-enact the match&#8212;very badly. I am sure that children still do that today. With the Commonwealth games, we have a fantastic opportunity to showcase new sports to our young people. In total, the games will play host to 17 different sports to inspire future generations.</p><p>We are fortunate that Glasgow 2014 will be held shortly after the London Olympics in 2012, which will provide a platform on which the Commonwealth games can build. London 2012 should provide a significant boost to youth participation in sport in Scotland, and I am delighted that several football matches will be played at Hampden Park. I welcome sportscotland&#8217;s distribution of 400 free tickets for Olympic events to young people in Scotland.</p><p>As part of Glasgow 2014, an estimated 1 million tickets will be sold to 250 medal events. I am sure that I am not alone in hoping that as many young people as possible get the opportunity to see up close some of the 6,500 athletes whom the games will host, and I hope that the organising committee will consider that when it sets prices. I am aware of the need for around &#163;80 million in revenue to be raised from the selling of tickets, but I would welcome the minister considering how many free or discounted tickets will be made available to schools and clubs, which would have the added benefit of guaranteeing full stadiums.</p><p>I know that, following the games, the organising committee wants to keep admission prices to facilities as low as possible, and I hope that the Scottish Government will consider in what ways it can assist with that aim so that the games can provide not only an elite sports legacy but, as John Mason said, a legacy at community and grass-roots level for the benefit of people in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.</p><p>It has been a good debate, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the progress and legacy of the Commonwealth games in Glasgow.

There are more ferry crossings in the region than in any other area of the UK and there are a large number of coastal leisure users and maritime tourists. There are also more marinas on the Clyde than in any other part of Scotland, and their number is increasing with proposals for new marinas as far upriver as the centre of Glasgow. The Clyde is home to some of Scotland&#8217;s busiest holiday resorts and features the world&#8217;s last sea-going paddle steamer, the Waverley, which carries 140,000 passengers every year. From speaking to many constituents and people who are involved in the save the Waverley campaign, I know how valued the important work of the Clyde coastguard is.</p><p>In spite of that, on Tuesday, the shipping minister, Mike Penning MP, confirmed that the coastguard centre on the Clyde is to close. The decision will have a devastating impact on the local community, where 31 jobs will be lost in an area of high unemployment, and it will put maritime safety on the west coast at serious risk. As members have said, it was recently reported that the station in Greenock deals with more than 30 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s incidents. In 2010, the Clyde station was the busiest coastguard station in Scotland and the third busiest in the whole of the UK. Staff there assisted 2,357 people and rescued 539 members of the public&#8212;more than 10 a week.</p><p>Currently, the coastguard station at Greenock co-ordinates rescues from as far north as Fort William and as far south as Stranraer. As members have noted, under the new plans, emergency calls from the west of Scotland will be directed to Belfast and Stornoway. That would be laughable if it were not so serious. Concerns have been raised that, with reduced manning levels, those coastguard stations will not be able to cope with the increased workload. I know, from speaking to at least one person who is currently employed at the Clyde coastguard station, that on more than one occasion the team in Belfast has contacted the Clyde station to ask for assistance due to insufficient staffing levels there. The statistics for 2010 also show that the Belfast station was the quietest coastguard station in the whole of the UK, which raises concerns and questions about how prepared it is to take on the workload of the Clyde coastguard station.</p><p>In his statement on the UK Government&#8217;s proposals, Mike Penning MP said:</p><p>&#8220;They will make much better use of the talents and skills of our Coastguards&#8221;.</p><p>In issuing that statement, the shipping minister failed to take into account the vital role of local knowledge, which many members have mentioned. The coastguards to whom I have spoken insist that such knowledge can make the difference between life and death. As members will know, the west coast has a unique topography. Many areas have limited infrastructure, which can often make communications difficult if not impossible. When that happens, there is no substitute for the local knowledge of the experienced staff at the Clyde coastguard station.</p><p>Members may have read in the press that the Clyde coastguard recently responded to two divers who got into distress while exploring a sunken wreck. Sadly, one diver died in the incident but, thanks to the knowledge of the responding team, the other was rescued.

One in five 18 to 24-year-olds is unemployed&#8212;a total of 84,000 young people across the country&#8212;and the number of people in employment has fallen by 28,000 in the last quarter.</p><p>In my West Scotland region, the number of people claiming jobseekers allowance has soared to 20,718, a change over the past year of 1,956. The constituency of Cunninghame South saw a 0.7 per cent increase in claimant count to 2,832, while the figures for Dumbarton and Paisley have both risen by more than 0.5 per cent in the past year. That all underlines the absolute importance of regeneration in Scotland and, in particular, my West Scotland region.</p><p>As other members have pointed out, there are many communities in need of regeneration, but I will focus particularly on Clydebank and the regeneration company Clydebank Rebuilt in my West Scotland region.</p><p>Clydebank Rebuilt was formed in 2002 to drive the economic, social and physical regeneration of the town. Its two founders are West Dunbartonshire Council and Scottish Enterprise, and it receives financial support from the council as well as from the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise.</p><p>Much has been achieved to date, including major developments at Queens Quay&#8212;the former site of John Brown&#8217;s shipyards&#8212;at John Knox Street, and at the prestigious 4-acre riverside site in the Clyde Gate area next to the national health service Golden Jubilee hospital. Improvements have also been made to the public realm in the town centre, and riverside walkways by the Clyde have been created.</p><p>This year saw the completion of the improvements to the canal south bank at the Clyde shopping centre, complementing earlier work on the north bank. Next year will, we hope, see the completion of the Clydebank town hall, which will feature a major upgrade of the facilities for conferences and performances, a civic space with break-out areas, a small cafe, a new wedding chapel, a larger museum and a new gallery and garden.</p><p>Looking down, above all of that, is the Titan crane&#8212;a reminder of Clydebank&#8217;s industrial past that is being used in a modern way for a number of activities including abseiling. Restored more than four years ago, it has already attracted 35,000 visitors. The new education and visitor centre that was opened in May this year will greatly assist schools and the wider community in learning about the area&#8217;s history.</p><p>Clydebank Rebuilt is a success story so far, but there are still chapters to be written. As Eleanor McAllister OBE, managing director of Clydebank Rebuilt, stated in the 2010-11 annual report,</p><p>&#8220;We are less than mid-way through our 20-year regeneration programme for Clydebank. There is still much to do.&#8221;</p><p>She also noted:</p><p>&#8220;Jobs are critical for the town. We have worked closely with local business to help sustain and expand their activity in our new business pavilions, the successful JKS workshops (which have achieved almost 100% occupancy). Our projects have generated directly almost 300 jobs in the town.&#8221;</p><p>As my colleagues Duncan McNeil and Michael McMahon have already mentioned, the ring-fenced budgets for all urban regeneration companies other than Clyde Gateway run only until 2012-13. After that, Riverside Inverclyde, Irvine Bay and Clydebank Rebuilt will all have to bid for funding as part of a wider regeneration strategy. They no longer have guaranteed funding beyond 2012-13 even though they were originally guaranteed 10 years of funding. There is now a very real concern that they will not be able to function in the way they are used to.</p><p>Clydebank Rebuilt wants to build more workshops that will allow more training and work opportunities for local people. House building on the waterfront is still an absolute priority, and there are many other projects that need to be done. We should give the company the certainty of funding that it needs.</p><p>Today&#8217;s figures show that 2,190 people claim jobseekers allowance in Clydebank and Milngavie. Taking the wind out of the sails of Clydebank Rebuilt by forcing it to compete for funding after 2012-13 threatens to make that grave statistic even worse and to bring to a halt the significant advances seen in Clydebank as a direct result of Clydebank Rebuilt.</p><p>There is also a brand-new college in Clydebank. It is doing important work but it, too, needs to receive continued support to create opportunities for young people in the area and not to be affected by the cuts that we are seeing from the Scottish Government. We have seen excellent results in a relatively short space of time in Clydebank, but long-term plans with the potential to provide genuine and lasting benefits to the people of the town and the area are at risk of falling off the radar.</p><p>The motion states:</p><p>&#8220;it is imperative that there is a strategic vision for the regeneration of the most disadvantaged communities across Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>I welcome that statement and agree with it, but that needs long-term focus. Going back on a commitment to guarantee urban regeneration companies 10 years of funding is an example of short-term thinking and strikes me as counterproductive.</p><p>We have heard a lot about cities from the Scottish Government and we have a minister for cities strategy. Although I do not disagree that cities are important to the national economy, we must not forget the real and pressing issues that are faced by our towns, particularly in the west of Scotland.

As others have mentioned, veterans are traditionally thought of in terms of those who fought in the major armed conflicts of the 20th century: the two world wars and, to a lesser extent, the Korean war. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. All Scots are aware of the involvement of our armed forces in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. We must also remember those whom we have asked to protect human rights and defend the rule of law in areas such as Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone. As many members have mentioned this morning, those who serve our country do not make decisions on areas of conflict or our role in engaging in it. Politicians decide where and when our armed forces serve the interests of our nation. We require not that they are concerned with the rights and wrongs of conflict, only that they carry out the tasks that are given to them efficiently and effectively. The armed forces make sacrifices on our behalf that have short or even long-term consequences for individuals and their families and some even make the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>In this debate, we must also recognise the numerous organisations that ceaselessly support, advise and fight for the rights of our veterans. Organisations such as Poppyscotland, Veterans Scotland and the Royal British Legion seek to enhance the welfare and wellbeing of the veterans community and&#8212;most important for Scotland&#8212;an organisation in my own region, Erskine, has been looking after our veterans for almost 100 years and is the leading care organisation for ex-servicemen and women.</p><p>Others in this chamber can offer greater insight into the work of Erskine than I can. I know that my colleague Hugh Henry grew up in one of the homes for ex-servicemen within the grounds of the former Erskine hospital. His father paid for his years interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in what was then the East Indies and is now Indonesia with lasting ill health and Erskine provided the support that he and his family needed. That support is still needed today, perhaps more than ever, by this generation of veterans, and Erskine has developed its service to include four satellite homes in Erskine, Glasgow and Edinburgh. It has also revamped the main Erskine home, with its newly upgraded veterans&#8217; cottages, commercial garden centre and stores. I am glad that the new chief executive, Steve Conway, has vowed that the organisation will continue to provide the highest level of service to the veteran community.</p><p>We must also recognise the smaller clubs and societies throughout Scotland, such as the United Services Club in Johnstone&#8212;which I visited on Sunday&#8212;that provide a community focus for support and companionship for our veterans in their own communities.</p><p>I welcome developments by the Government and projects such as the roll-out of training on fitting and maintaining specialist prosthetic limbs, the specialist treatment centre for combat stress and improved community outreach and welfare services across Scotland. However, we must continue to ask ourselves whether we are doing enough.</p><p>Many veterans need help when they make the transition to civilian life. Some will need help with physical disabilities but, as others have mentioned, some scars are hidden, with only the ex-servicemen and their families aware of how they affect their daily lives.</p><p>I was dismayed to learn from Poppyscotland that recent research showed that some 350,000 members of the veterans community have potential welfare needs. It also showed that, in Scotland, veterans are 10 per cent more likely to become homeless, 8 per cent more likely to suffer from mental health problems and 3 per cent more likely to suffer from alcohol problems than they are anywhere else in the UK. In addition, although the number of individuals who receive a one-off financial grant from Poppyscotland has fallen by 10 per cent since 2002, the average amount that is required in each case has increased by 66 per cent. We know, too, that in the period from 2007 to 2010 more than 13,000 British forces personnel have been assessed as suffering from mental health disorders before leaving the services. Given that veterans in Scotland are still suffering&#8212;and are perhaps doing so disproportionately in comparison with veterans in the rest of the UK&#8212;I must ask the question, is our response good enough?</p><p>If the experience of one family from my area is to be considered, the answer is no. The ex-serviceman in question was suffering from combat stress, which affected his behaviour until family life became a nightmare for all concerned. His condition worsened until he was hospitalised in a specialist NHS mental health facility. He was placed in a ward with people who were being treated for alcohol and drug dependency. His wife described the treatment that he received as medication and sedation. He was given drugs that stopped the outward manifestation of his combat stress, but which did not help the problem. The family found that he had access to private health insurance through his work and they moved him to a private facility, where he received appropriate treatment and could return to his family able to cope. How does the Government intend to ensure that such families do not continue to suffer?</p><p>The odd, good-natured, verbal skirmish at elections aside, I have never had to test myself in conflict. I am lucky, as are most of us here today. We owe a debt of gratitude to those who have put themselves in the line of fire on our behalf. We owe our veterans security when they need it. We owe them decent housing that is suitable to their needs. We owe them and their families the opportunity to make a living or to obtain financial support if employment is not an option. We owe them appropriate medical care whether for body or mind. We owe them professionals who are trained to recognise their particular conditions and needs, and who can deal with them effectively. We owe them support and companionship. We owe them education and re-education when it is needed. We owe the excellent charitable organisations that support our veterans the security of knowing that they can continue their work without the threat of closure or contraction.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a privilege to speak in the debate today and to pay tribute to our veterans.

Unfortunately, we as an Opposition cannot blame the bad weather on the Scottish National Party Government; however, for once, the SNP cannot blame England for it either. I find that quite refreshing.</p><p>From speaking to my constituents, I know that the weather resulted in significant disruption for people, businesses and the most vulnerable in society. As we know, temperatures dropped to as low as -14&#176;; on one morning, 15cm of snow fell in just four hours. Not one pupil in Renfrewshire was unaffected by school closures. Indeed, at the hardest hit rally that I attended in Edinburgh on Saturday, a disabled woman told the crowd how she had to phone Domino&#8217;s Pizza because she could not get out to buy food. Like the conditions, the disruption was unprecedented.</p><p>As others have pointed out, we must acknowledge the commitment and hard work of all those who gritted the roads and cleared the pavements. There is no doubt that without the dedication of local authority staff, the British Red Cross and others the disruption would have been far greater. However, there is also no doubt that we must learn the lessons of last winter and look to improve the way in which the response to severe weather is managed. Central to that should be the need to protect key public services, such as schools and care for the elderly and the vulnerable. In addition, we must do all that we can to avoid seeing again the scenes that we saw on the M8, which was fast descending into a case of life and death.</p><p>It has been suggested that private contractors are reluctant to call on councils to assist with the salting of motorways and trunk roads because they would need to reimburse them for that. I would welcome a reassurance from the minister that he is satisfied with the arrangements between private contractors and local authorities for the salting of those roads this year.</p><p>I am sure that we would all agree that the safety of our commuters and avoiding a fragmented approach should be an absolute priority. As the Government&#8217;s report states, there is also a need to ensure business continuity. Analysis by economic experts indicates that last year&#8217;s severe weather affected the UK economy to the tune of -0.5 per cent. The Federation of Small Businesses has stated that one in seven people could not get to their place of work. I note that the Government has created a business continuity section on its ready Scotland website, which I hope will help businesses in Scotland this winter.</p><p>I am aware of the steps that the Government has taken to improve people&#8217;s level of preparedness, and I welcome the moves by local authorities to increase their readiness. I know that Renfrewshire Council has increased its salt supply from 4,000 tonnes last year to 8,500 tonnes this year. However, if we are to experience another prolonged period of harsh conditions, increasing councils&#8217; salt supplies alone is not enough. The fact that, last winter, Renfrewshire Council&#8217;s salt use topped 11,000 tonnes stresses the importance of having in place clear and co-ordinated protocols on access to the national salt supply.</p><p>Last year, there was some discussion about local authorities&#8217; access to the national salt supply, given that the percentage of the road network that is classed as high priority and which, therefore, is treated with salt varies significantly across local authorities. If one authority treats 50 per cent of its roads while another treats 60 per cent of its roads, to which authority should priority be given? We need clear criteria in place that allow the local authorities that are most in need of additional salt access to the national supply.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s report rightly identifies the need for effective co-ordination of communications to the public, which others have mentioned. It is vital that the Government ensures that people are kept well informed. In particular, we need to avoid what appear to be mixed messages from central and local government, such as the Scottish Government saying that there is ample salt while local authorities say that they must conserve their supplies. The minister will be aware that local authorities conserve salt in line with the Government&#8217;s salt preservation guidelines.

I am aware of that not only through personal experience, but from speaking to parents and teachers throughout my region.</p><p>I think we all agree that it is important that pupils learn about Scottish history and culture, and that it is important for our pupils to learn global, European and shared British history and culture so that our young people are encouraged to be outward looking and to develop an informed perspective of the world. We want to see an outward-looking, multinational and multicultural Scotland. All the parties support the one Scotland, many cultures campaign. That ethos has been promoted in schools and should continue to be promoted. The aim should be to provide a balanced education that recognises our heritage and culture and which teaches our children to be outward looking. We need a balanced approach.</p><p>I strongly believe that it is important for young people to learn about the distinctive local heritage even within Scotland, such as the industrial history in the west of Scotland. I do not propose the introduction of Renfrewshire studies or west of Scotland studies, although I am sure that they would be extremely interesting. I do not need to propose that, because schools, particularly in Renfrewshire, teach local and Scottish history very well. I remember in my primary school in Kilbarchan learning about the work of weavers in Renfrewshire during the 18th and 19th centuries. As part of that, we visited the weaver&#8217;s cottage in Kilbarchan, which is run by the National Trust for Scotland. At the cottage, which pupils at Kilbarchan primary school still visit, people can see how weavers lived and worked. It is an excellent site, and I recommend that members and parents and pupils should visit it if they get the opportunity.</p><p>I experienced another good example while at Gryffe high school. In my history class, I was taught about Mary Queen of Scots, Robert the Bruce and William Wallace as well as the industrial revolution and the struggle of the cotton mill workers in Paisley. We also visited New Lanark, which the minister mentioned, to learn about the Welshman Robert Owen and the foundations of the co-operative movement. That was engaging and informative and contributed to a balanced curriculum.</p><p>The focus on local history was interesting and stimulating because it was not abstract and was something that pupils could participate in. That type of learning was not directed from the centre, but it is a perfect example of how local history and culture can be delivered at local authority level, as it should continue to be delivered. The curriculum for excellence allows teachers the freedom to take into account local activity. I hope that any introduction of a Scottish studies course across the board would not remove that flexibility. I hope that the working group will take that point into account.</p><p>We have several concerns. As members have mentioned, the introduction of Scottish studies should not lead to the sacrifice or limiting of other subjects that are taught in our schools. The unfortunate fact is that the timetable is already overcrowded and leaves little room for manoeuvre. Members have mentioned the importance of modern languages and learning about other cultures. We live in an increasingly interdependent world, so we should seek to maintain the number of foreign languages that are taught in our schools in order to better equip the youth of today for the future. Concerns about that have been raised with me.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652307", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Studies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to the very high standard of teaching of Scottish history and culture that there already is in our schools.

Around 166,000 young people left school between 2007 and 2010, when the SNP was in power. Is the SNP saying that they left school without sufficient knowledge of their country?

If we want the Scottish economy to grow, we should prioritise the higher rank drivers such as infrastructure and skills. Those things are already controlled by the Scottish Government; ministers have power over them.</p><p>In addition, there is a real threat that, if Scotland cut corporation tax, other parts of the UK would do likewise, which would cancel out any competitive advantage that was sought. During the recess, I visited the Welsh Assembly. It is clear that Wales&#8217;s First Minister, Carwyn Jones, and the Welsh Assembly Government share those concerns and believe that there is a danger that competition in the tax system in the UK would result in a race to the bottom and that no one&#8217;s public finances would benefit.</p><p>This morning, the First Minister selectively quoted what Wendy Alexander said in last session&#8217;s Scotland Bill Committee report. He failed to mention that the committee said that it</p><p>&#8220;does not believe that Scotland should seek to maximise its tax income by becoming a tax haven for companies operating elsewhere in the UK. We therefore support the UK Government in not at this stage devolving corporation tax in the Scotland Bill.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government has stated that it would cut corporation tax to 20 per cent, but with low corporation tax rates already existing in the European Union, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that a cut in the rate of corporation tax in Scotland would result in a large number of businesses deciding to relocate here. Perhaps profit shifting is more likely. Economic activity and jobs could be created elsewhere, with profits being declared in Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Government may say that that is the objective, but I ask members to consider two things: first, the fact that the UK Government is already cutting corporation tax by 5 per cent over the next few years and, secondly, the question whether a cut in corporation tax leads to stronger economies. Mr McLetchie and Mr Rennie made that point. Ireland, for example, has a corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent, and countries such as Greece and Iceland have lower rates than the UK, but the UK&#8217;s gross domestic product growth rate in 2010 was 1.4 per cent, compared with negative rates for all three of those countries. Furthermore, the forecasted growth rate for the UK in 2011 is 1.7 per cent compared with 1.5 per cent for Iceland, just 0.6 per cent for Ireland, and minus 3.5 per cent for Greece.</p><p>Those numbers illustrate that there is no guarantee that cutting corporation tax will lead to a stronger Scottish economy. Ireland and Iceland are also prime examples of how quickly corporation tax receipts can fall in difficult economic times. However, we do not need to look overseas to see evidence of that; here in the UK we saw corporation tax receipts fall from &#163;40.4 billion in 2007-08 to &#163;30.3 billion in 2009-10; a 25 per cent decrease in the space of two years. If such a drop occurs here, combined with a lower rate of corporation tax, an even bigger black hole would emerge in the budget, which would inevitably mean cuts in public services.</p><p>When I speak to my constituents in Renfrewshire and throughout the west of Scotland they tell me that they are angry that public services are being cut and jobs are being lost because of the recession that was caused by the global banking crisis. Working people in Renfrewshire&#8212;or anywhere else in Scotland for that matter&#8212;should not pay for the mistakes made by others.</p><p>The CBI and the STUC have rightly raised concerns about how devolving corporation tax would work, while accountancy experts have criticised the Scottish Government for the lack of clarity about the costs of devolving the levy.</p><p>If there is a will to proceed with this policy, the Government needs to listen to the business community and the unions, which so far are not convinced by the proposals.

Education can be the silver bullet that fulfils our aspirations and lifts the next generation up. Scots have long realised that and we have a proud history when it comes to education. From being the first country to provide universal schooling, to modern days when we have an education system that continues to punch above its weight on the world stage, Scotland has put education at the forefront of our national priorities and we have a proud record to show for it.</p><p>However, there a danger that that proud legacy could be at risk. Whether it is intentional or not, education seems to be bearing the brunt of the cuts in public sector spending. Those cuts are beginning to bite across Scotland at all levels of Scottish education&#8212;no sector is safe. For example, Renfrewshire has seen cuts in teacher and classroom assistant numbers, schools have been closed and there have even been moves to cut teaching hours. I am not here to assign blame, but the responsibility for improving the situation lies with the Government. If something is not done, I fear that the cutbacks will not only affect children who are already at school, but could leave an indelible mark on the future of Scottish educational attainment. I do not need to remind the cabinet secretary of the outcry in Renfrewshire after the local council proposed cuts in teaching hours and up to 60 teaching posts in local primary schools. At a rally in Paisley town hall, 1,300 parents, teachers and pupils stood together to say no to those cuts and to defend the children&#8217;s education. I was proud to work with the EIS and the Renfrewshire parent council forum to reverse that proposal, and I urge the cabinet secretary to consult fully with and to listen to parents in Renfrewshire and throughout Scotland when the Government proposes any further changes to our education system.</p><p>The cutbacks are not confined just to primary and secondary schools. The Government must ensure that we do not allow cuts in education to become cuts in life chances. We have all seen the reactions of students north and south of the border to cuts in colleges and universities. Staff, students and the general public have shown that they believe that there is a better way.</p><p>I appreciate that there are stark differences between the approaches of the Scottish Government and the UK Government to university education. The UK Government at Westminster is pursuing a relentless agenda of swingeing cuts to all areas of public spending, with the further and higher education sectors being early targets. In England, university budgets have been slashed by almost &#163;450&#160;million and student numbers are predicted to fall by more than 6,000. The UK Government believes that introducing huge tuition fee hikes will replace the funding that it has cut, but the reality is that students who have the right qualifications will be priced out of education. With many English institutions setting tuition fees at the maximum of &#163;9,000, a funding gap between Scottish and English universities will become more apparent in the coming years. Both major parties in Parliament committed to the principle of free education during the recent election. I fully agree that tuition fees are not the answer and I am glad that the overwhelming majority of us in Parliament agree on that.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648601", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Education and Lifelong Learning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I congratulate Jean Urquhart, Anne McTaggart and Gordon MacDonald on their valuable contributions to the debate.

Those issues led me to join the Labour Party and to stand for the Parliament. Those issues and priorities will guide me in taking decisions in the Parliament. I will always put the interests of the people of West Scotland and opportunities for our young people at the very core of what I do.</p><p>Raising standards in education and creating job opportunities must be at the heart of the Government&#8217;s agenda. I welcome the SNP&#8217;s commitment to a youth talent fund and to improving education across Scotland. I look forward to seeing the details of its plans.</p><p>The Government has gained a mandate that many thought would be impossible to achieve, and I congratulate the SNP on achieving it. The Scottish Government now has a responsibility to rise and meet the expectations of the people of Scotland.</p><p>During the next five years Scotland faces huge challenges, but right now across the country the cuts are biting and opportunity is being snatched from the grasp of many of our young people. Across West Scotland we are seeing the true human cost of these tough economic times&#8212;the highest rate of unemployment in the UK and the highest rate of youth unemployment in the UK are in West Scotland, in North Ayrshire. In West Dunbartonshire the situation is not much better. In Clydebank there have been reports of 40 people applying for every available vacancy. Many applicants have the qualifications and are able to do a job but simply cannot find one.</p><p>The Government must rise to the challenges that face Scotland and confront such issues head-on. We must invest in the next generations, so that young people have greater opportunities than their parents and grandparents had. My constituents want a Government that abides by that principle and stands up for our young people.</p><p>I do not want to fill my entire speech with the problems and challenges that face the West Scotland. That would not do justice to the area. The west of Scotland is filled with some of the most dynamic and inspiring people we could meet. They rise to the challenges that confront them every day, and they succeed.</p><p>West Scotland also has many excellent schools. We must do all that we can do to support them and help them to continue to thrive. A perfect example of that approach is provided by East Renfrewshire Council. The authority is run by a coalition of Labour, SNP, independent and Liberal Democrat councillors&#8212;it is a non-partisan example, unless you are a Conservative. The council has shown what can be achieved when we work together with teachers, parents, pupils and staff. East Renfrewshire schools are the best in Scotland&#8212;indeed, Williamwood high school regularly comes out as the best school in Scotland, with 46 per cent of pupils achieving five or more highers. That is a remarkable achievement. I would like every school to be like Williamwood.</p><p>Educational achievement is not and should not be confined to the more affluent areas. Across East Renfrewshire, from Barrhead to Busby, at schools such as St Luke&#8217;s high school, opportunities are being created for our young people. In fact, educational excellence and opportunities are being achieved throughout West Scotland. In East Dunbartonshire, Douglas academy is a shining example, and my former school, Gryffe high school, and other excellent schools in Renfrewshire have given me and many other people the opportunity to aspire.</p><p>It would be wrong to think that full-time education is the only path to opportunity for our young people. Apprenticeships must be at the forefront of the Government&#8217;s agenda for young people. I was proud to support the work that Labour did in the previous session of the Parliament to secure thousands of extra apprenticeships for young people in Scotland.</p><p>I was elected because 92,000 people in West Scotland put their trust in Labour. I want to repay that faith and work for all the people of West Scotland. With that in mind&#8212;and as Iain Gray said&#8212;we will work with the Government when we agree and debate vigorously when we do not.</p><p>When I arrived at the Parliament, a poem on the wall caught my eye. It was the poem by Edwin Morgan that spells out the Scottish people&#8217;s hopes and aspirations for the Parliament. It outlines what the Scottish people want and what they do not want:</p><p>&#8220;And perhaps above all the droopy mantra of &#8216;it wizny me&#8217; is what they do not want.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that the Government and all members take note of that and go forward, rising to the expectations of the people of Scotland and always putting opportunity in the hands of our young people.</p>", "hdate": "2011-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to make my maiden speech in this important debate on how we take Scotland forward.
