The City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill has been perhaps the most complicated private bill that I have considered so far, not only in a legal sense but because the committee has, in its quasi-judicial role, had to walk a very fine line in responding to the deluge of emails that it has received from the public. We have found it very helpful to have our convener supporting and leading us in our work.</p><p>I will focus on three areas with regard to our committee report on the bill: the alternatives to a private bill; the precedent that may be set by such a bill; and&#8212;if I have time&#8212;the consultation process that was undertaken.</p><p>When the City of Edinburgh Council suggested to the Parliament that a private bill was the correct route to go down, it listed the alternatives that it had considered, which the committee convener went through in her opening remarks. I draw members&#8217; attention to paragraphs 74 to 96 of the committee&#8217;s report, in which we comprehensively go through the alternatives that the council considered and the reasons that they were rejected, and conclude that a private bill was the correct route to follow. Paragraph 97 on page 18 states:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee is satisfied that the Council was justified in pursuing the private bill process and none of the other possible alternatives to achieve its objective.&#8221;</p><p>We took a lot of time and care in coming to that conclusion.</p><p>Much has been made of the notion that, if the private bill proceeds and is passed, we will be setting a precedent that other councils throughout Scotland could follow. The convener has already addressed that concern, as did Cameron Buchanan. I refer members, when they are making their decision, to paragraph 68 on page 13 of the report, which shows that to some extent that can already happen. Motherwell, Kirkcaldy, West Dunbartonshire, South Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire authorities have all used various routes to enable them to take inalienable common good land and use it especially for educational purposes. What the City of Edinburgh Council proposes to do in the Portobello park private bill is not unique, and follows a tradition. The bill will not set a precedent, as it is not the first time that such a route has been followed.</p><p>We commented at paragraph 120 of our report&#8212;as the minister mentioned in his remarks&#8212;that we thought that the City of Edinburgh Council had gone through a fairly comprehensive consultation process, but that some mistakes and areas in which it could have been better had been identified.

I am pretty sure that I can spot that Peter Ivins from Bearsden is here, and can I see Neil Drain from Kirkintilloch? I thank those gentlemen very much for coming.</p><p>It was partly a visit to my local optician that made me want to have this debate today. I met representatives of Optometry Scotland at the Scottish National Party conference in October and learned about the amazing amount of extra work that I did not know opticians do. As many of you will know, I used to work in the health service, but I was surprised by what I learned, because I still thought that an optician was someone who dispensed glasses and that was it.</p><p>I learned from the Optometry Scotland stall at the conference what is going on, and then I visited both Peter Ivins and Neil Drain in my constituency to find out just how much opticians are moving into eye healthcare, rather than just giving us the pair of glasses that we need in order to read. What I found was inspiring. I learned about optometrists becoming independent prescribers. I have found it quite difficult to get figures, but I understand that from 10 to 25 per cent of optometrists in Scotland are now trained and registered as independent prescribers via Glasgow Caledonian University. Of course, that means that our optometrists are not just dispensing glasses and diagnosing ill health in our eyes but are able to treat the ill health in our local communities.</p><p>It was interesting to hear about the teach-and-treat clinic at Stobhill hospital, where local opticians can work with a consultant ophthalmologist to learn the skills that they need to provide treatment in the community. I also found out about the Scottish Government funding for digital fundus cameras, for example, for every practice in Scotland. Another thing that really caught my eye when I was out meeting the optometrists was the Scottish care information gateway electronic referrals. I understand that the electronic patient referral programme was launched in 2010 as part of the integration of eye care services and that it has funding of &#163;6.6 million for 10 years from the Scottish Government.</p><p>I know from my years in the health service of the benefits of electronic referral. It means that our independent prescribing optometrists can treat us locally but, when they diagnose something that goes beyond that treatment, they can appropriately refer us on to secondary care. Of course, the biggest benefit in that for any patient is the reduced time from diagnosis to referral to treatment.</p><p>It is a great step forward that our optometrists are now an essential part of primary healthcare in our communities. I understand that 20 per cent of out-patient appointments in hospitals are for eye problems. If optometrists are doing a lot more diagnosis and treatment and referring to hospitals only when appropriate, that 20 per cent figure will come down. I have read that, since we introduced the programme in 2010, there has been a 6 per cent increase in referrals to out-patient appointments for eye care in the national health service in Scotland but that the figure in England is 20 per cent. We are therefore seeing the benefits of appropriate referral and treatment being done as locally as possible.</p><p>Many members will ask what my interest is in the matter. I am obviously enthusiastic about it. Why am I so enthusiastic? It is great when I find out something new and find out that, yet again, Scotland is world leading in a healthcare area. However, for me, it is part of the preventative agenda whereby those of us with eye problems are being helped in our local communities to prevent them from getting worse. It is about community care and the best patient journey that we can have. It is incredibly important now because one in 30 of us in Scotland suffers from significant sight loss. Because of our ageing population&#8212;you will all know that I take a great interest in that issue because of my constituency interests in Strathkelvin and Bearsden&#8212;significant sight loss will double in 20 years. The optometrists&#8217; treatment work is part of the preventative agenda that looks to the future by saying to patients, &#8220;How well can we care for you? How can we care for you where you want to be cared for?&#8221;</p><p>Treatment for preventable sight loss in older people is not just about sight loss, because other health problems come with visual impairment. For example, an elderly person with visual impairment is more likely to have falls and end up being hospitalised. Interestingly, they are also more likely to have poor nutrition, because if someone has a visual impairment and they cannot see their food, they do not enjoy it, so they do not eat it, and that has knock-on effects. We should also remember the loss of independence that visual impairment brings, especially for older people, and the social isolation that that can bring.</p><p>It was for all those reasons that I wanted to bring this debate to the chamber. I have been so impressed by what I have seen and, through this debate, I wanted to recognise and promote the work that community optometrists do. Perhaps I can best sum up what I want to say by talking again about when I went to see Neil Drain and Peter Ivins. They talked about all the years that they spent training to be optometrists and said that they are now using all their skills in being healthcare professionals and not just people who sell others their specs.</p><p>I thank members for their support for this evening&#8217;s debate.

The passion of the library users of Moray was shown in the march and rally that Stewart referred to. For me, as a librarian, it is wonderful to be at a debate where I am listening to people such as Stewart Stevenson and Rhoda Grant laud libraries and say how important they are. I am sure that other members will impress me just as much with their enthusiasm for libraries.</p><p>To be very technical, when we look at library services, we have to go back to the 1887 legislation, which states that local authorities must provide an adequate library service for all.</p><p>There is no definition of what an adequate library service is, but for many years SLIC has looked at how we assess a library service and how we allow such services in Scotland to benchmark themselves against each other in order to reach at least a working definition of adequacy of library services. Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s motion talks about the public library quality improvement matrix, which we use to carry out assessment and benchmarking. I want to get a bit technical and refer to the matrix. As Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s motion states, the matrix is under review and one of the things that will be reviewed is its name. We will not call it PLQIM anymore; its name will be clear.</p><p>There are seven quality indicators for assessing libraries in Scotland. Previously when we looked at libraries, Moray came out as one of our five-star services. I found it quite interesting to take my seven quality indicators and cross reference them with the paper that Moray Council wrote on 10 September 2013. I want to highlight a few indicators to show that Moray&#8217;s five-star library status is definitely in danger. Indeed, not only is its five-star status in danger; I believe that it will no longer be providing an adequate library service. Therefore, Moray Council will not be meeting the legislative requirements, whether we have a definition of adequacy or not.</p><p>Quality indicator 1 is on access to information and refers to access to current information resources. A library service would get a very low rating if</p><p>&#8220;Access to current information resources is limited ...

That interest stems partly from my years as the chair of East Dunbartonshire children&#8217;s panel advisory committee. I note that Kenneth Macintosh and I are again speaking in a children&#8217;s debate, and I wonder whether there is an umbilical cord taking us both back to that very first Education, Culture and Sport Committee in 1999 that means that we just cannot leave the subject alone.</p><p>I would like to consider three areas: early intervention; prevention; and, particularly, the idea in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill of a named person. I would also like to consider how the voice of the child is heard in this process. Given my background, which I have just explained to the chamber, I would also like to speak about the role of children&#8217;s hearings in the process.</p><p>Planning for permanence and the elimination of what I understand is now being called drift runs through everything that we are discussing in relation to looked-after young people. I note that those issues were a theme in the minister&#8217;s opening remarks.</p><p>A lot of my speech today is based on recent reading and research. The information that went into the committee&#8217;s report was useful and important. Running through the report and the minister&#8217;s opening remarks is the idea that GIRFEC is the foundation of everything that we should do in this area.</p><p>There is a great deal of evidence that early intervention and the preventative agenda are best not only for young people but for their families. When I was a member of the Health and Sport Committee, the chief medical officer told us that, in his view, it is the nine months before birth and the nine months after birth that set the foundation for a person&#8217;s life. That is extremely clear in what we are talking about today.</p><p>When I was looking for evidence on which to base my speech, I found that there was a lot of specific evidence about how the early intervention agenda is important when taking children into care. As someone who likes to find evidence, I found it comforting, at an intellectual level, to learn about all the work that the Scottish Government is doing to support teams that are conducting research so that there will be a strong evidence base for all decisions that are made. The work of the permanence and care team and CELCIS, which was founded in 2011 at the University of Strathclyde and which Clare Adamson talked about, is important. We need to ensure that, when decisions are made, either legislatively or by a social worker on the ground, they are based on evidence.</p><p>For me, that is why the named person is so important. My understanding is that the named person will allow for integration across the child&#8217;s life. It will ensure that there is consistency and co-ordination of help and support for every child in Scotland. In his speech, Colin Beattie listed the multi-agency involvement in the lives of vulnerable children. That stresses the importance of the named person. As someone who is not at the heart of the debate, I say absolutely genuinely that I cannot understand why Kenneth Macintosh and others in the Labour Party say that they have reservations about the named person. To me, it looks like a crucial measure. Having a named person will be supportive for every child in Scotland, but it will be vital for vulnerable young people and their families.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I rise to speak in the debate with little expertise in this subject, but with a great interest in it.

That was a one-and-a-half-minute intervention.</p><p>My comments were genuine&#8212;I do not understand Ken Macintosh&#8217;s point. I do my best as a parent and I have my support networks. However, I registered my child with a general practitioner not when he was ill, but so that there was a general practitioner to take him to if he became ill. For me, a named person would have provided similar support&#8212;a resource that I could have turned to if my own family network had not been available. The named person will be a fantastic advantage for every child and family in Scotland but is an absolute necessity for vulnerable children and families, given the multi-agency involvement that Colin Beattie described.</p><p>When I was researching my speech, I found not just that there is evidence of the need for a named person but that there is almost universal support for the proposal. Seventy-two per cent of the respondents to the consultation on the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill supported having a named person. When Children 1st surveyed kinship carers, 90 per cent of those who responded said that every child in Scotland should have a named person and 78 per cent reflected on their own situation and said that, if they had had a named person, it would have been helpful to them and their family. The support for having a named person exists as well as the evidence for it.</p><p>I am a great fan of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child&#8212;I used to have the T-shirt&#8212;which is all about the child&#8217;s voice needing to be heard in the process. I found the evidence that Who Cares? Scotland gave to the committee interesting. Who Cares? Scotland is good and supportive at an organisational level, but the young people whom we met through it just blew us away with the stories that they told us. I quote from the evidence that Who Cares? Scotland gave to the committee:</p><p>&#8220;Young people should be better informed and included in the decision making process before, during and after leaving care&#8221;.</p><p>I would have liked to concentrate on the children&#8217;s hearings system at this stage. With your indulgence, Presiding Officer, I will do so.</p><p>When I was in children&#8217;s hearings, I often used to hear that the child&#8217;s presence would be dispensed with. For me, however, as article 12 says, that is where the child&#8217;s voice must be heard. Therefore, it has been lovely for me to find out about all the work that has been done recently, such as the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporters Administration setting up a participation in hearings group in 2009, the children&#8217;s hearings improvement partnership being set up in 2010, and the involvement of the Children&#8217;s Parliament. It has been lovely to come across a fantastic document entitled &#8220;Hearing Scotland&#8217;s Children&#8221; and to read about the changes made to the hearings system, including to the waiting rooms and the format of the information that goes out to young people. It has been useful for me to learn about all those things.</p><p>What I have learned in researching for the debate is that the policy is a work in progress. It looks to me that the intent is there by all parties, so I hope that we will all keep on the path and ensure that we get it right for every child.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You have been generous, Presiding Officer.

It used to be that talking about modal shift meant talking about getting out of cars and on to the bus or the train, but increasingly we need to talk about getting out of motorised transport and on to your feet or bike.</p><p>A big behaviour change or shift that we have to make is to convince the public that they have a false sense of security if they think that when they are in their car they are safer than they are on a bike or out walking.

More than 20 years ago, I worked in palliative care, and more than 14 years ago the centre for integrative care was opened in Glasgow on the Gartnavel hospital site. I warn members now that my speech is very much that of a health librarian&#8212;with evidence and references. That is where I want to start.</p><p>It is fantastic that that ambition now has a great body of evidence behind it to show that person-centred healthcare is the way forward for treating our patients, and I am also pleased that there is such great Government support for patient-centred healthcare. The cabinet secretary said that it would take him three hours to list all that the SNP Government is doing to support person-centred healthcare; I have half a page of examples in my notes, but I refer members to the list that Nanette Milne read out and the examples that Bob Doris and Aileen McLeod gave of the work that the SNP Government is doing around the person-centred initiative.</p><p>For me, the core of person-centred healthcare is health literacy. I always used to quote a phrase from Confucius:</p><p>&#8220;I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.&#8221;</p><p>That is the core of person-centred healthcare, whereby the patient does healthcare for themselves and therefore understands what they are doing.</p><p>There are two aspects to person-centred healthcare that we must consider. The first aspect is the therapeutic relationship, in which the patient is a partner in their healthcare. Nanette Milne referred to the dark days of the 1950s and 1960s, when patients were talked at rather than talked to and with. The other aspect is therapies. When we talk about patient-centred healthcare, we need to consider the therapies that are used and the therapeutic environment in which patients are treated. We need to look at the whole person and their holistic care, rather than just the treatment of the illness with which they have been diagnosed.</p><p>On the therapeutic relationship, we often talk in terms of the expert versus the passive recipient, that is, the doctor versus the patient. Many people would say that the patient is the expert in their illness&#8212;George Adam talked about that in the context of multiple sclerosis&#8212;but that does not mean that the patient does not have such a relationship with their clinician, because the patient is the expert in their illness and not in the medicine that is needed to treat it.</p><p>If patients are to be partners in their healthcare, access to high-quality information is fundamentally important. The clinician and the patient must both have access to the evidence base for the treatment that will be followed. Many years ago, in 2003, I left the Scottish Parliament after losing my seat and went back into health librarianship. I discovered that in the four short years in which I had been a member of the Parliament&#8212;hey presto&#8212;the e-library had been developed. The e-library was the most amazing resource. Every health professional in the NHS in Scotland could access it via a computer and find the peer-reviewed evidence base for everything that they did in their work.</p><p>The e-library is now called the knowledge network and it continues to grow. I would love it if not just every clinician but every patient could get access to it. However, there would have to be health literacy, so that people could not just access but assess the information and work out how it applied to them.</p><p>We have to look at holistic therapies when we look at patient-centred healthcare. I would like to read out a few quotes that relate to the fact that we are talking not just about medicines and operations, but about holistic, integrative healthcare. It has been said:</p><p>&#8220;There is a growing body of evidence for integrative interventions such as Mindfulness-based therapies, self-efficacy and self-management strategies, and wellness enhancement&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>that is a lovely expression&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;which all build self-awareness and inner resource development skills&#8221;</p><p>for patients, and that</p><p>&#8220;The ethos of this approach is to enable a person to rediscover or rebuild their own inner resilience, strength, and creativity, in order to engage with effective self-care and self-management. It is an inherently individualised, person-centred, and whole-person approach. Evidence from interpersonal neurobiology empirical research into compassion and empathy forms much of the bedrock of this approach.</p><p>Current research indicates that the activation of a person&#8217;s self-care abilities can trigger lifestyle changes e.g. healthy nutritional and exercise choices, as well as attitudinal shifts supportive of successful long term outcomes and the ability to &#8216;cope&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>When we talk about person-centred healthcare, it is incredibly important to talk about the whole person.</p><p>I want to move forward from the whole person or patient and talk about carers and their family, as well, because if we are doing person-centred healthcare, the person will come with their carer and family. To quote again:</p><p>&#8220;there is empirical evidence that the involvement of carers in a patient self-management initiative significantly improves therapeutic adherence, with resulting improved outcomes&#8221;.</p><p>That is what person-centred healthcare is about, and that is what I as a professional 20-odd years ago was working towards. I am delighted that we now have a fantastic evidence base to prove that person-centred healthcare is the way forward.</p><p>George Adam talked about not recognising the health service that Neil Findlay referred to. I agree with him. Neil Findlay and Nanette Milne talked about the casework that has come to them about people with problems in the health service. That casework is reflected in mine, but I remind members of Mark McDonald&#8217;s intervention. The casework that we get is from the approximately 10 per cent of patients who have had an unsatisfactory experience in the health service. I refer to my experience as the carer for my mother, with her multiple morbidities and possible five healthcare emergency admissions a year. She and I are among the 93 per cent who are satisfied with the care that they get from the NHS in Scotland.</p><p>Patient-centred healthcare is about patients as partners. That ultimately leads to fewer patients, and it also leads to effective and engaged practitioners. Is not that the way that Scotland would want to see its NHS?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Person-centred Healthcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The ambition to have person-centred healthcare is not new, as I know from my many years as a health service librarian.

Play also teaches young people about the consequences of actions. Those are surely all skills for life but, above all, as the minister said, play is fun.</p><p>Many members have reminisced; I want to do a bit of reminiscing, too. I also want to point out the intergenerational fun that we have when we play with children. James Dornan reminisced about his childhood, which sounded very like mine&#8212;it involved getting up in the morning, going out and not coming back until someone came and got you when it got dark. Looking back at the play experience that my son&#8212;who is now 23&#8212;had when he was young, I think that the dirtier he was when he came home, the happier he was. I am now in the same position with the dog.</p><p>Ken Macintosh mentioned his family&#8217;s Wendy house. Being politically correct, in my house&#8212;as we had a little boy&#8212;we had a play house. I remember how he used that play house with his granny. He used to play Mugdock cafe, which would involve him serving his granny the cup of tea that she had when they went up to Mugdock to play. It was wonderful to watch them interact in that way. Of course, he was also learning. He was learning about how to co-operate with someone and how to listen to what they wanted.</p><p>A few months after I watched that one afternoon, the children of one of my friends, who was the same age as my son&#8212;about three&#8212;was diagnosed as a late speech developer. Lo and behold! The speech therapist told his mum to go out and buy a tea set, on the ground that that would get him speaking and co-operating. That is exactly what Kenneth had been doing with his granny without anyone telling him to do it.</p><p>I have one last story that I must share with members, which relates to intergenerational play. My son had a much younger cousin, so he was able to keep playing for many years into his teenage years, not because he wanted to play, but because he was doing it for Cameron. He loved that. We had foam swords, which are not terribly politically correct&#8212;although at least they were not guns. I gave in on that one. We used to go out at night time in the summer and they would go wild with the foam swords and have great battles. One day, we took a friend&#8217;s mum. My goodness, did that unleash the inner scary mum! She just went wild with the foam swords. It was great to watch that truly intergenerational play.</p><p>I can tell anecdotes and talk about my childhood and my son&#8217;s childhood but, as a librarian, what I am delighted about&#8212;members would expect me to say this&#8212;is the fact that we now have an evidence base that tells us how important play is in the development of young people. That is extremely important, because it allows us to play officially. That comes into the action plan at section 9.3. Being able to play because the evidence says that we can also allows people to invest in play, and we see that in section 9.12 of the action plan.</p><p>Many members have talked about how important it is that we involve young people in development of their play areas. In my constituency, there is the Kirkintilloch skate park, which I think is now about 10 years old. It was young folk who said that they wanted it. They got together and got support from the adults. Ten years on, the skate park is still incredibly well used.</p><p>My local nursery school takes the kids into my mum&#8217;s care home, which means that the old ladies get to watch the wee ones play; I am sure that it will not be long before they get down on the floor and start playing with the children. It is important that such initiatives are allowed officially and can be invested in.</p><p>The Scottish planning policy says that planning authorities should protect valued open space, which is incredibly important. Many members have met my constituents and fellow villagers from Westerton, who are fighting hard to maintain the 100-year-old green space there.</p><p>I wanted to pick up on two more subjects, but I do not think that I will have time to do so, so I will concentrate on health and safety. My husband has a background as a health and safety professional. Health and safety is not about being risk averse but about managing risk. It is not like the modern urban myths&#8212;Liz Smith raised one with Ken Macintosh&#8212;such as the idea that people cannot play conkers if they do not have safety specs on. That is not what health and safety is about; it is about wearing head protection and not having scrums when young children are playing rugby. That is managing risk, not being risk averse.</p><p>I have a brilliant quote from the Health and Safety Executive. In 2008, it said:</p><p>&#8220;We need to focus on finding ways for things to happen, not reasons to stop them&#8212;a sensible approach to managing risk focuses on practical action to tackle risks that cause real harm and suffering.&#8221;</p><p>That approach is embedded at points 9.10 and 9.11 of the play strategy action plan.</p><p>I talked about intergenerational play. Members should look at what Finland is doing with not outdoor gyms but outdoor play parks, where all go to play together.</p><p>From the minute they are born, we play with our children and they learn from that play.

Two years later, when I bought my Dalmatian, Rona, my first thought was that she must be microchipped.</p><p>Claire Baker talked about the fact that in Scotland, more than 2,000 dogs a year are not reunited with their families. That must be heartbreaking, and one of the simplest things to do is to microchip your dog.</p><p>I also remember the story of my next-door neighbour&#8217;s westie, Hamish. This is more than 10 years ago. Hamish was not chipped and he was stolen&#8212;he did not stray; he was stolen. About two weeks later, Hamish&#8217;s owner was driving along the road and saw Hamish. He got out of the car and challenged the people and they gave Hamish back to him. Hamish was not microchipped. I think that Hamish was returned because his owner was in a police uniform when he challenged the people who stole Hamish. Would it not have been so much easier if Hamish had had his chip? The owner could have got Hamish back without having to exert his authority in that way.</p><p>I also remember when I was young, about eight years old, a lovely mongrel that we called Sally came into our street. Sally was adopted by the Windrams and she became part of our street and part of everybody&#8217;s family, but it must have been awful for her first owners, who never got Sally back again. We had the joy but they did not.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm referred to some of the claims about the alleged health risks of using microchips. In the whole time of the debate, I have had only one email from someone raising rather dubious health risk claims about microchipping dogs.

From yesterday&#8217;s coverage of the 500th anniversary of the battle of Flodden, there seems to be a bit of revisionism going on in relation to James IV and the idea that that was the end of Scotland as a cultural entity until the union. This is not meant to be a political point. The great hall that James IV had built at Stirling castle is stunning. He was making sure that Europe knew that we were not a tiny little dark nation on the edge of the European continent. Then James V built the palace within Stirling castle, which has just been all done up&#8212;it is beautiful. That is another example of the fact that Scotland was never a tiny little country on the edge of nowhere. I am sorry&#8212;that was the subject of my final-year essay.</p><p>I feel that I have done my wee bit for the historic environment in Parliament through my role as convener of the National Trust for Scotland (Governance etc) Bill Committee. I did my wee bit to ensure that the governance of one area of the historic environment would continue effectively.</p><p>Aside from my own passion, my constituency&#8212;which is often seen as just a suburb of Glasgow&#8212;has a fantastically rich tapestry of listed and scheduled ancient monuments and buildings, from iron age forts all the way up to arts and crafts villas. Clare Adamson mentioned the Antonine wall, which is a thread through my constituency. Since 2008, it has been a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization world heritage site. I remember the discovery of the Roman baths in Bearsden at a building site for flats. I was doing Latin at school, and we were all marched down to that building site to see history coming alive and rising up out of the mud before our eyes.</p><p>I live in Westerton garden suburb, which is having its centenary this year as Scotland&#8217;s first garden suburb. I hope that all members will visit our stand in Parliament in the first week in October so that they can learn more about my village and what we have been doing for the past year to celebrate its centenary. Huntershill house in Bishopbriggs in my constituency was the home of the father of Scottish democracy, Thomas Muir. The 250th anniversary of his birth will be in 2015. Friends of Thomas Muir has been working hard to ensure that we recognise his place in history and in the democratic tradition.</p><p>Turning to the draft strategy&#8212;it cannot all be about me and my constituency&#8212;I want to pick out a couple of points, the first of which is the fact that the town centre review will now understand the importance of the historic environment. I know that that will be very welcome to my constituents who are working hard on the preservation of at least the facade of Kirkintilloch town hall.</p><p>I was really pleased to hear mention of joint working in the strategy. I mentioned being the convener of the National Trust for Scotland (Governance etc) Bill Committee. It is incredibly important across the historic landscape that we all work together. I was particularly pleased when the cabinet secretary talked about the use of volunteers and the voluntary sector for the strategy. Those of us with a passion want to do what we can and be part of the preservation of our historic environment.</p><p>I think that the proposed merger of Historic Scotland and the RCAHMS is sensible. That is from a historian&#8217;s point of view, looking at how we record and preserve the past and present it to the future. I do not really see any worries in the charitable status. The National Library of Scotland, for example, is a registered charity, so I do not see why the proposed new body cannot be a charity. I put down in my notes &#8220;Name?&#8221;, because I like the name Historic Scotland. I am sure that the name aspect will be part of the debate, but I think that that name sums up what the body is all about.</p><p>I have loved hearing some of the words that members have used in the debate, and those that are used in the strategy. We have talked about the richness of our heritage and the inspirational buildings and how they help the wellbeing of individuals and societies. We have talked about their value&#8212;their economic value and their worth in their own right. We have talked about conserving. However, above all, we have talked about celebrating Scotland&#8217;s historic environment. That is something well worth doing and something that I have done for many years.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695872", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That was my husband&#8217;s reward.

The Balmore Coach House, which has been on the go for more than 20 years, has now raised more than &#163;1 million by selling fair trade goods. East Dunbartonshire achieved Fairtrade zone status a few years ago, and that status was renewed this year. Lenzie is now a Fairtrade town, having achieved that status this year, and on 3 October we will celebrate that achievement with a savour the flavour evening with the Co-op.</p><p>That reminds me that Bearsden and Milngavie have a very strong and hard-working team who are working towards that status. I am reminded because one of the first events in Bearsden and Milngavie was a savour the flavour event and I ended up as the chef&#8217;s assistant for the evening. Nobody got food poisoning, everything was made with fair trade food from Sainsbury&#8217;s and I was given an apron in appreciation, which I definitely appreciated.</p><p>I was interested to hear Graeme Dey talking about a fashion show, because I thought that Bearsden and Milngavie were the first to do a fair trade fashion show, but we were not; we were the second.</p><p>This June, East Dunbartonshire cycle co-op, which has a festival every year in Bishopbriggs, decided to make it a Fairtrade cycle festival. It managed to do that and get the accreditation for it, so well done to it.</p><p>I will pick up on two other issues. One is about procurement and follows on from what Ken Macintosh said. I have a constituent who is working really hard on fair trade school uniforms. She has got into quite a few local schools where people buy the sweatshirts and so on through the parent teacher associations. However, like Ken Macintosh, she sees the procurement bill as her way to get the whole issue debated in Parliament and perhaps to get people to realise that there are reasons other than pennies and pounds to consider when deciding where to purchase from; there is a moral reason, too.</p><p>We have another groundbreaking area in East Dunbartonshire: we have the first suite of fair trade nurseries. That is a useful point to finish on because if we can talk to two and three-year-olds in a way that they understand and ensure that their snacks are made with fairly traded products, then we ensure that young folk can understand the message, which is where it all starts, is it not?</p><p>Ken Macintosh talked about young kids in Pakistan making footballs. When children are two or three years old, they can begin to understand that if it is presented to them in their kind of language.</p><p>Fair trade makes us as individuals feel good but, more important, it is about what we as a country can do to support parts of the world that do not have the riches that we have.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my thanks and congratulations to Graeme Dey on securing this important debate for Parliament.

I understand that it met again this morning to discuss producing an options paper by mid-June in relation to the need for a residential pain management service in Scotland. I was delighted when the cabinet secretary said that he will go out to consultation on three models of level 3 pain management. Looking at the Labour amendment, I think that if a short-life working group is set up in March and the cabinet secretary tells us today that he wants the results by September, six months later, that shows a degree of urgency.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will concentrate on the level 3 programmes for pain management and specifically the requirement for a residential facility.

A superb project incorporating creativity within tight controls and a fine example for future healthcare buildings to emulate.&#8221;</p><p>That is the description in Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s dynamic place awards in 2002 of the Glasgow homoeopathic hospital, which had opened fairly recently, in 1999. As many will know, nowadays the Glasgow homoeopathic hospital is the NHS centre for integrative care. The hospital building, with its 15 beds, is capable of treating 10,000 out-patients and 500 in-patients a year. I worked there as the librarian from 2004 to 2008, so I have an interest. However, I also have an understanding of the services that are delivered in that NHS building.</p><p>In the years that I was there, the hospital set up the chronic fatigue syndrome/ME project and service delivery. After I left, it moved on to the wellness programme. Those are holistic, multidisciplinary, allopathic and complementary services. The hospital treats people with long-term chronic conditions. In fact, many of the patients at the hospital at the moment were considered untreatable and incurable. The hospital has done so well in its work over the years that its physio, Stephanie Wilson, has won awards for the delivery of her programmes for ME and wellness. I should say that Stephanie Wilson is a close friend of mine, but she well deserves the accolade that she received a few years ago.</p><p>We have the building, the staff, the reputation and the beds.

That charity, Lucky2BHere, was established in Skye in 2007 by a friend of mine, Ross Cowie, when he had just suffered an almost fatal cardiac arrest. As a result of its fundraising, nearly 30 defibrillators have been put in since 2007, especially in the Highlands and Islands but also in the central belt.

At that time, as committee convener, I thanked a number of groups and I reiterate my thanks at the final stage of the bill. I thank my fellow committee members and the witnesses who gave written and oral evidence. I especially thank the clerks and the Scottish Parliament information centre staff, who supported us throughout the short bill procedure.</p><p>At that preliminary stage debate on 23 April, I rehearsed the background to and the necessity for the bill. Members will recall that it was the 2008 financial crisis within the National Trust for Scotland that precipitated a lot of the problems that the bill seeks to solve. In that financial crisis, it was discovered that a lot of the problems were rooted in poor governance procedures within the National Trust. That led to the setting up of the Reid review under our former Presiding Officer, Sir George Reid. His report, which was entitled &#8220;Fit for Purpose&#8221;, was published in 2010.</p><p>In that review, Sir George was clear that there was a need to restructure and to refocus the trust&#8217;s governance procedures. Much of that has taken place in the three short years since the report was published but the bill completes legislatively the Reid report recommendations from 2010. It is important to add that there is still on-going work on restructuring and refocusing outwith the legislative process because the NTS has engaged in the review with a great deal of enthusiasm and commitment. It is still looking at an audit of all its assets. It seems strange that an organisation that owns or is the custodian of so much within Scotland still needs to know exactly what its assets are.</p><p>One important item that I look forward to seeing come to fruition is the introduction of local assemblies. That is important when we realise that the NTS is a membership organisation that has 310,000 members. To say that it can work with all those members at an annual meeting is perhaps a little far-fetched. The introduction of local assemblies will bring that membership much more into the whole structure and function of the National Trust for Scotland.</p><p>I will spend a little time talking about the consultation review process, because it is an exemplar. Sir George Reid held 32 presentations, and there were 140 meetings with small groups. There were 9,061 responses to the membership questionnaire, a website forum, email and of course old-fashioned letters. It is testament to that consultation process that the bill has come to Parliament with no objections at any stage, and with no amendments introduced either at the consideration stage or at the final stage today. The same can be said of the National Trust for Scotland&#8217;s 2010 annual general meeting, when the membership voted 424 to 2 to accept the recommendations of Sir George Reid&#8217;s &#8220;Fit for Purpose&#8221; report.</p><p>I conclude this short debate by saying that the bill is small but perfect, as the process that it has been through has shown.

Before that, I was the volunteer librarian at the Marie Curie Huntershill hospice in Springburn. After my son went to school, I was fortunate that the voluntary sector came to me and asked me to come and work for it. I worked in East Dunbartonshire Council for Voluntary Service, which is now East Dunbartonshire Voluntary Action as a result of the merger of Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire and East Dunbartonshire Council for Voluntary Service. I also worked in Carers Link in Milngavie. A lot of the comments that I will make today come out of that work, instead of my usual facts, figures and evidence.</p><p>It is interesting that Gavin Brown talked about the fact that there is no great evidence base for how we fund the voluntary sector, and I support the call for us to go out and get that evidence. Funding is important to the voluntary sector&#8212;the SCVO 2012 sector survey showed that. Funding, especially three-year funding, was recognised at paragraphs 7 and 8 of the 2009 joint statement on the relationship at local level between Government and the third sector. Each of those publications talks about something other than funding that my experience also supports, which is the third sector and the voluntary sector being recognised for what they are&#8212;skilled providers of services and support to the most vulnerable in our communities, as my colleague Gil Paterson said.</p><p>I was pleased to hear the cabinet secretary talk about another aspect that is incredibly important. The third sector and voluntary organisations are recognised as equal partners in the delivery of services, the development of policy and their role of advocating for the vulnerable communities that they support and serve. I was pleased to hear the cabinet secretary say that today.</p><p>When I was on holiday in Skye last year, the Cabinet was there and, at the meeting in Portree, the citizens advice bureau asked the cabinet secretary a question from the floor. People left that meeting having heard the cabinet secretary say how much he values and supports the third sector and how he sees third sector organisations as partners in delivery. I was pleased to hear that again today and I know that the third sector recognises that.</p><p>I am also pleased to see that such recognition is coming through in legislation, such as the proposed procurement reform bill. I was in the chamber for the debate on that and it was interesting to hear members and the cabinet secretary talking about it. It is important that that is recognised in the Scottish Government&#8217;s guidance note on community benefits in public procurement. I will not quote it, but I guide members to it to see how important it is.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government recognises and understands the importance of the third sector.

We were looking at closures of some of our best-loved properties and even at sales of some of them. At the same time, the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator criticised the governance of the National Trust for Scotland in &#8220;Who&#8217;s In Charge: Control and Independence in Scottish Charities&#8221;.</p><p>That all led to a major strategic review of the National Trust for Scotland in 2009 and 2010, led by our former Presiding Officer, Sir George Reid. In his report, entitled &#8220;Fit for Purpose: Report of the Strategic Review of the National Trust for Scotland&#8221;, Sir George pulled absolutely no punches about the state in which the National Trust for Scotland found itself. He talked about the &#8220;byzantine&#8221; governance structure: a structure that led to there being no strategic direction for the trust and, sometimes&#8212;even worse&#8212;an inability to tackle problems as they arose.</p><p>Sir George&#8217;s report, which covered a two-year period, followed, to use his words,</p><p>&#8220;a massive programme of engagement, participation and consultation&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, National Trust for Scotland (Governance etc) Bill Committee, 12 March 2013; c 15.]</p><p>I was impressed to see that, so well conducted and inclusive was that consultation that, at the National Trust for Scotland&#8217;s 2010 annual general meeting, the reforms proposed in the report were endorsed by a vote of 424 to two members of the trust. Therefore, when we began to consider the bill, we were reassured that it had the support of the people who really knew what it was about.</p><p>Since the 2010 AGM, many of the reforms have been implemented and there have been a good many benefits to the National Trust for Scotland. It now has a single governance structure with a board of trustees of 15 members. Previously, the two boards and two methods of governance had, I think, a total of 87 members. Members of the Parliament can understand why the trust was so unwieldy and unable to make strategic decisions.</p><p>The reforms that have been implemented since then have received OSCR&#8217;s approval. Perhaps most significantly for members of the public who, like me, are passionate supporters of the National Trust for Scotland, it now has reserves of &#163;21 million. I therefore hope that we will not look again at the dreadful situation in 2008, when the question was whether we would have to sell things off to manage. At the preliminary stage, we heard in evidence from Sir George Reid that the bill is</p><p>&#8220;the final milestone in the process of reform and revitalisation of the National Trust for Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>The current chair of the board of trustees, Sir Kenneth Calman, talked about its being &#8220;vital&#8221; as</p><p>&#8220;the last part of the jigsaw&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, National Trust for Scotland (Governance etc) Bill Committee, 12 March 2013; c 14, 23.]</p><p>Before I finish, I have to mention the National Trust for Scotland Order 1935, which set up the National Trust for Scotland.

I have talked about the National Trust for Scotland throughout and am sure that most of us who visit its properties call it exactly that.

In so congratulating Jackie Baillie, I would like to add a few personal thanks of my own.</p><p>I thank the Bearsden resource centre of Alzheimer Scotland. On a personal level, the staff there have supported me in my journey as a carer, and the carers group that they hold on a Tuesday evening is incredibly important to my constituents.</p><p>I also thank Tommy Whitelaw, whose journey has very much reflected mine. I will try hard not to cry at this point, because the first two times I met Tommy he moved me to tears. When he came to Parliament in 2011 to present to Nicola Sturgeon&#8212;then the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy&#8212;the letters that he had collected on his journey, I ended up crying in a toilet because I had become quite upset. On our second meeting, a few weeks later, when Tommy came along to talk to the annual general meeting of Carers Link East Dunbartonshire, I once again ended up crying in a toilet, because it is incredibly difficult, emotionally, to read those letters and hear about the difficult journey that people who care for people with dementia go on. I think that my getting upset at the time had to do with the fact that, at that point, I was at a difficult place in my personal journey as a carer, which is no longer the case.</p><p>My third meeting with Tommy was much more joyous. It was in Bellahouston park, on a sponsored walk that had been organised by Kris Rodden who works for the Bearsden resource centre of Alzheimer Scotland. I went along with my Dalmatian, Rhona, and we had a nice day out.</p><p>Those thanks from me are personal. However, as the MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, I say that looking after and supporting people who care for people with dementia is incredibly important. It is estimated that, by 2035, the number of people aged 75 and above in Bearsden will have risen by 88 per cent, from 9,000 today to more than 17,000. Given that more than 6 per cent of people aged over 75, and 20 per cent of those in their late 80s, are likely to have dementia, it is clear that a lot of people in my constituency will be caring for a lot of people with dementia.</p><p>That support for carers is absolutely vital. Someone who cares for someone with dementia is often that person&#8217;s voice, as they are the one who can delve inside and remember what the person with dementia would want to happen, even though they cannot say what it is.</p><p>Carers Link supported me as a carer and also had the courage to employ me as a peer support worker for nine months. Carers Link supports 932 carers. In recent years, it has realised that 44 per cent of those carers look after someone with dementia. Already, in my constituency, we can see the numbers rising.</p><p>I want to highlight Carers Link&#8217;s day cafe, where people who are caring for folk with dementia can come together every month to get support from each other and learn from each other&#8217;s journeys.</p><p>I will conclude by making a suggestion that I have made before during debates on dementia carers. We have talked about creating a card that young carers can use, because it is often difficult for a young carer to be recognised as such. Once again, I suggest that we have a dementia carers card because, no matter how many times I turned up in the accident and emergency ward, waving my power of attorney, I was not always recognised as the voice of the person who could not answer for themselves, especially in an accident and emergency situation. A wee card that says &#8220;I am caring for this person with dementia&#8221; would perhaps give us a bit more access to health professionals.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687267", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dementia Carers&#8217; Voices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is traditional to thank and congratulate the member who brought the subject of a members&#8217; business debate to the chamber.

No matter what Labour Party members want to say today, no revision of history can say that the war was a humanitarian one, because it was an illegal war predicated on lies.</p><p>Why did I march in February 2003 and why was I kettled in Sauchiehall Street in March 2003? Unlike Kevin Stewart and Elaine Murray, I am a pacifist. I know that violence is never the answer. In this Parliament, we have zero tolerance to domestic violence, sexual violence and bullying. Very few members would not agree with that statement of zero tolerance. Therefore, I say that war is never the solution. War dehumanises people. We have heard the statistics on the loss of life on and around the battlefield in Iraq in the past 10 years. More than 5,000 servicemen and women and perhaps 120,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed. War dehumanises and leads to torture. We have heard of the horrors in Abu Ghraib and we are hearing of other horrors through the Al-Sweady inquiry.</p><p>What does war do to women and children? It is not just bombs and bullets that affect women and children during a war, as they have the unique and hideous extras to contend with of rape, sex trafficking and prostitution. That is what has happened in the 10 years since the beginning of the war in Iraq. Another effect on women is that, in war situations, primary healthcare is replaced by casualty and trauma units, which leads to a rise in infant mortality. In war zones, infant mortality doubles and there is a rise in epidemics. We forget to immunise people, because we do not have time for public health. In war zones, tuberculosis quadruples.</p><p>Professor Patricia Hynes, formerly of Boston University, has said:</p><p>&#8220;a full accounting of the harm of war to civilian women is needed in the debate over whether war is justified.&#8221;</p><p>We have heard the statistics.

I will pick up on two aspects of the &#8220;Count us in&#8221; report: partnership working and challenging negative attitudes. I will marry those aspects to the national autism strategy, which the Government produced 18 months ago. My remarks will be based on the Asperger&#8217;s end of the spectrum, because I know quite a lot about that.</p><p>The parliamentary reception that Mark McDonald hosted and to which he referred was an affirming event to attend. At the reception, I met young men with Asperger&#8217;s. They were there, whereas most of the young men in their 20s with Asperger&#8217;s whom I know would find it difficult to get out and come to an intimidating place such as that reception.</p><p>It was really interesting to meet those young folk and hear about the support that the National Autistic Society is giving them. A couple of the young men were constituents of mine. Their parents were also at the reception, and I heard from the parents about the support that the society had given the young men to take them through school and through the transition to being young men in their 20s who, as a group, go to the pictures and can come to the Parliament on the train, for instance.</p><p>It is important to mention that, because folk do not understand what autism can do to people&#8212;people do not understand how isolating it can be for individuals who are on the autistic spectrum. In relation to partnership working, I am pleased that one goal of the third strand of the national autism strategy is to work towards meaningful partnerships, which are important.</p><p>Meaningful partnerships are also important in challenging negative attitudes. &#8220;Count us in&#8221; makes a big thing of talking about ensuring that we challenge negative attitudes in the public. Mark McDonald referred to the autism meltdown in the supermarket. Any toddler meltdown is awful, but that one is worse than most.</p><p>It is also important that we challenge negative attitudes among our services. Partnership working will perhaps lead towards that. I remember a way back when a two-year-old with undiagnosed Asperger&#8217;s and his parents were told by his nursery teachers that he was a rude boy. The labelling of any two-year-old as rude tells us something about the people who are working with that child but, when the child has autism, there is a fundamental issue. That should have been a trigger to make professionals say, &#8220;Wait a wee minute&#8212;what&#8217;s going on here? Should we investigate further?&#8221;</p><p>Twenty years on from those nursery teachers, I am sure that things are a lot better. With partnership working, I am sure that we can challenge negative attitudes in professions as well. I see that goal number 4 of the second strand of the autism strategy is that people with autism should be</p><p>&#8220;met with recognition and understanding&#8221;.</p><p>That approach cannot come quickly enough. I do not want to bring too much dissent to the debate&#8212;actually, what I am saying is not dissent. Under the welfare changes, people who are on the autistic spectrum and who receive incapacity benefit and disability living allowance will face reassessments by a computer-driven system that is run by Atos Healthcare, and they will find it incredibly difficult to have their needs understood.</p><p>I congratulate Mark McDonald and thank him again.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686991", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Count Us In (Autism)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my thanks and congratulations to Mark McDonald on securing the debate.

That is a hashtag for me, as walking is my favourite pastime. I have already mentioned the Campsie fells in my constituency. Next week, I will meet the Forestry Commission to hear about the work that it is thinking of doing at the back of Clachan of Campsie. I find it interesting that we are managing to get different agencies to work together on the theme of tourism. When I was young, the Forestry Commission was just about growing trees to cut them down and turn them into paper, but now when it does that core business, increasingly it also talks about trails, waymarks and so on, so that folk can be brought out to the countryside.</p><p>Then there is Wednesday 26 June and #water. Kirkintilloch is the canal capital of Scotland, so we will definitely be tweeting then.

It is fair to say that 423 sheltered housing properties will not satisfy the future housing needs of older people in my constituency.</p><p>It is also fair to say that we cannot expect public finances to build all the sheltered housing that we will need in my constituency.

There is a higher level of home ownership in that age group than in the general population. Most people in that age group want it to stay that way. As they progress through life, they want to remain as home owners, but they need homes that are fit and appropriate for them. Increasingly, many of them will want to buy their own sheltered housing. That would have a benefit at all levels of the housing ladder. The briefing from McCarthy and Stone tells us that, when an older person moves out of the family bungalow that they have lived in for many years, that frees up seven moves on the property ladder. I could give personal examples of that, but I will not stretch the Presiding Officer&#8217;s patience.</p><p>We need to look at planning conditions with a view to ensuring that we build now to provide a choice of appropriate homes for our older people.

In 2006, Help the Aged found that older people are three times more likely to become victims of property crime than of personal crime. We all worry about the old lady being mugged and having her handbag stolen, but property crime, which relates to cold calling, is more common. The Alzheimer&#8217;s Society found that 15 per cent of people with dementia had fallen victim to cold calling, scam mail and misselling.</p><p>In November 2009, in my constituency, it was reported that police had received calls about cold calls every day throughout the month.

Dave Thompson has extolled the virtues of trading standards officers, and I will do the same for the ones in my area, who have decided to trial an item called trueCall, which is a call-blocking system that can be added on to a telephone and which enables people only to receive calls from people from whom they want to receive calls. It is quite an expensive piece of equipment, but the trading standards officers have got some in so that older, more vulnerable people in my constituency can give them a try and see whether they help to keep them safer in their homes.</p><p>In March, in Bishopbriggs, the adult protection committee is going to hold a whole-day conference on financial safeguarding. That shows how seriously the issue is being treated. Trading standards officers have entered a year-long partnership with the police across my constituency, stopping and checking traders to determine whether they are legitimate and using intelligence-led policing to take patrols past vulnerable households where they know that old folk have been targeted.</p><p>I am terribly sorry, Presiding Officer, but I am not sure how much time I have left.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Property Maintenance and Repairs (Cold Calling)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Dave Thompson for bringing this incredibly important topic to Parliament.

There are a number of reasons for that. We talk about multiple morbidity. It is a fact that many of us are living longer, but we are living longer with ill health, which can often be mental ill health. Many people are living in loneliness and isolation, and many are living with financial worries. Mental ill health is a serious problem among the elderly.</p><p>I cannot read out all the facts and figures that I wanted to read out, but I will mention one statistic, which relates to something that Dr Simpson said. The highest incidence of suicide is in men aged over 75. Indeed, the incidence of suicide is 11 per cent higher in that age group than it is in young men&#8212;and we know that we have a problem with suicide among young men. It is a startling fact, which we should bear in mind when we talk about mental ill health in older people and its consequences.</p><p>I thank Dr Gillian McLean, a consultant in old age psychiatry, who gave a powerful and informed presentation to the cross-party group on mental health last week.</p><p>What can we do about mental ill health in the elderly? One of the first things that we must consider is the diagnosis of ill health in the elderly. I refer to our success in diagnosing dementia in Scotland&#8212;we are world leading in that regard. We need to build on that success in diagnosing other forms of mental ill health in the elderly.</p><p>We need to raise awareness of mental ill health as a problem in the elderly. As we grow old, there are many neurobiological changes, which can affect our mental health. We should not regard anxiety and depression as just a fact of old age&#8212;we must move beyond that attitude.</p><p>People take multiple medications nowadays, so we must train our medical workforce and carers to be aware of that. A person needs to be trained to watch out for signs of an impact on their mother&#8217;s or father&#8217;s mental health each time their prescription is changed or added to.</p><p>Many conditions mask mental ill health in the elderly. For example, urinary tract infections can cause confusion. However, when an older person is confused and forgetful, we must not always say that it must be a UTI or dementia; we should explore the person&#8217;s mental health and not regard the issue as just the effect of natural ageing and cognitive decline.</p><p>We should also alleviate external factors that can lead to depression and anxiety in the elderly. I mentioned that loneliness and isolation can be a contributory factor. That is a good argument for continuing to offer concessionary bus fares to the elderly, which is one way of alleviating isolation. There are also genuine financial fears. Old folk have always worried about the pennies, but we need to realise the effect on people of the coming welfare reforms and cuts and Labour&#8217;s talk of a cuts commission and a something-for-nothing society. We need to move away from using such language.</p><p>I would have liked to have had time to talk about social prescribing and the physical activity that SAMH promotes through its get active programme.</p><p>I will finish with a message that emerged from the cross-party group&#8217;s meeting last week: clinical mental health services should be delivered not on the basis of someone&#8217;s age but on the basis of their mental health needs.

We decided to review the code of conduct so that we could maintain that level of integrity.</p><p>The convener has already alluded to some of the revisions to the code of conduct that the committee proposes. One of the important ones about which he talked is section 6.1.1 of the revised code, in which we set out the general purpose of cross-party groups. Some people would ask why that is necessary after all these years&#8212;we are in our fourth session of the Parliament&#8212;but it is necessary to write down what a cross-party group is for.</p><p>Also, at section 6.1.2, we state what cross-party groups are not: they are not official committees of the Parliament. It is important that we lay that down so that people who come to the Parliament and engage with it through the cross-party group mechanism understand the informality of the process.</p><p>In section 6.3.2, we talk about the need to outline the issues that the cross-party groups plan to consider over the next year.

The minister and Rob Gibson, the convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, have already spoken about the importance of peatlands and biodiversity. The convener gave us a lot of figures on peatlands, and members should expect me to add to them, because the importance of peatlands must be recognised.</p><p>It is said that a third of the world&#8217;s entire terrestrial carbon deposits are held in peat bogs. Each peat bog can contain 5,000 tonnes of carbon per hectare, and each peat bog absorbs 0.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year. That shows just how important peatlands and peat bogs are in our fight against global climate change.</p><p>Of course, Scotland has a globally unique and important position in that regard. Four per cent of Europe&#8217;s total peat carbon is in Scotland, along with 15 per cent of the world&#8217;s blanket peat bogs. Of the 175 peatland nations across the world, Scotland is 12th. Those figures and facts further demonstrate how important our peatlands are to the world, not only to Scotland.</p><p>Of course, I cannot mention the subject without talking about my constituency&#8212;Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Across East Dunbartonshire, we have seven lowland peat bogs, and Strathkelvin and Bearsden has four of them. We have Lenzie Moss, which is a site of importance for nature conservation, or SINC&#8212;someone might have to help me on whether that is the correct term. In Bishopbriggs, we have Low Moss, High Moss and the smaller Cadder Yard.</p><p>I spend a lot of time walking on the mosses. People start to get affectionately close to their local peat bog, and then they learn about the threats to it. In the past, the threats included the extraction of peat for commercial use in our gardens. I learned about that 20 years ago and, as a keen gardener, I gave up using peat and used alternatives.</p><p>I have been involved in dealing with the encroachment of birch trees on Lenzie Moss. Our peatlands are not just natural and to be left to get on with it; we must manage them to ensure that they can do their job. Birch trees encroach incredibly rapidly on peat. I have been there and done that&#8212;I have tried hacking down birch trees and digging them up. That is a terrible job, but it must be done.</p><p>The threat in my constituency increasingly involves building on our peatlands, about which we have heard from others. We must ask why we are doing that. The issue in my area involves building housing. Nigel Don gave an example from down in England, but my problem is that somebody wants to build houses on Lenzie Moss.</p><p>When we look at such threats and problems, I always look at our priorities. What is the worth of the peatland or bog? Does it have worth for commercial profit or as part of global health? Increasingly, we should not look at commercial profit from such pieces of land, because they are worth more than they can ever make for housing. Their worth is in what they can deliver to help us to combat climate change across the planet. I recognise Scotland&#8217;s significant position in that regard.</p><p>To realise the worth of peatlands as carbon sinks, I have a suggestion, which I must tell the minister comes from my love of the bogs rather than my knowledge of how any such proposal would work. I will take the opportunity to make the suggestion and see whether it is possible.</p><p>Nigel Don gave an example of offsetting that sounded ludicrous, but I wonder about using our peat bogs for carbon offsetting and giving them a financial worth, so that they can become part of carbon trading. Those who wanted to preserve, say, Lenzie Moss could say to the folk who want to sell it for house building, &#8220;Okay&#8212;you&#8217;d make &#163;X million from selling the land for housing, but you could use it to allow the house builder to offset carbon emissions, which could make money to preserve the bog.&#8221; I do not know whether that idea is possible, but it sounds like a win-win situation.</p><p>I would like to make our aims happen, because peatlands and peat bogs are important for the planet and are good for local flood defences. They are a living natural archive of everything that has gone on for hundreds of thousands of years in our areas.

Of course, librarians of my generation are also called information scientists. The scientists and the researchers go out and find the evidence, and the big thing that we do is ensure that everybody can access the evidence so that we can have evidence-based public policy. I will, therefore, confine my remarks to how we access and use evidence&#8212;not necessarily just scientific evidence&#8212;in public policy. I hope that that is acceptable to the chamber.</p><p>What does the phrase &#8220;evidence-based&#8221; mean to those of us who are not scientists? It is interesting to look at the website of EBSCO, which is a major scientific literature publisher in Europe. It talks about the following meaning of &#8220;evidence-based&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;Conclusions can be based on the best available evidence only if the evidence is consistently and systematically identified, evaluated and selected&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>which is the role of the librarian. I was thinking of that when listening to Murdo Fraser&#8217;s comments about eugenics in the early part of the 20th century. In the context of the systematic evaluation and selection of evidence, eugenics may have had its day as a fad but it was never consensus science at any time in the scientific community. We should all understand that.</p><p>Why is it so important that we have evidence-based public policy? I came across some fantastic quotations from Paul Nurse, who won the Nobel prize in medicine. Professor Nurse commented in the New Scientist in 2011&#8212;I am sorry, but members must expect that I reference almost every quote that I give; I am in librarian mode and we must have the evidence&#8212;on the run-up to last year&#8217;s American presidential election and the use of &#8220;science&#8221; by many of the candidates to justify some of the more ludicrous positions that they were taking.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind what Professor Nurse was commenting on when we talk about using evidence to produce public policy. He said that</p><p>&#8220;the scientific process is such a reliable generator of knowledge&#8212;with its respect for evidence, for scepticism, for consistency of approach, for the constant testing of ideas.&#8221;</p><p>Is that not what we&#8212;as politicians&#8212;should always do?</p><p>When I was researching for the debate, I was struck by the fact that the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s work on minimum unit pricing last year could be taken in the round as an excellent example of the evidence base driving public policy. Originally, the Scottish National Party Government politicians looked at evidence in other areas of public health and saw that price affected the consumption and use of products. Having had a theory about minimum unit pricing, they then set out to see whether there was any evidence to back up that theory. They went to the University of Sheffield, which carried out theoretical modelling. We were fortunate that, at the same time, Professor Stockwell in Canada was finding empirical evidence based on more than 20 years&#8217; worth of statistics to show that the Sheffield model and the Scottish Government&#8217;s theory worked. We therefore had scientific evidence-based policy for minimum unit pricing.</p><p>When I was a member of the Health and Sport Committee, I was amazed when Labour refused to accept that evidence.

So, yes&#8212;Mr Campbell was correct. I am going to talk about book week Scotland.</p><p>I usually speak as a very high-tech librarian and talk about evidence, references and citations. However, I am also a book lover. As a result, I want to start with a quotation with which I agree utterly and which I was surprised the cabinet secretary did not use in her speech. In her press release for the launch of book week Scotland just a few weeks ago, she mentioned</p><p>&#8220;reading&#8217;s unique capacity for&#8221;</p><p>empowerment</p><p>&#8220;enrichment, education, solace, pleasure and growth&#8221;.</p><p>I am sure that everyone in the chamber agrees with that sentiment.</p><p>There are so many aspects to our first book week Scotland. The cabinet secretary talked about it being an inclusive and diverse celebration. I would like to highlight just a few of the areas of book week Scotland, which started on Monday and finishes at the end of the week.</p><p>Something I want to highlight as being most important is the league of extraordinary booklovers. I had lodged a motion through which I had hoped to get a members&#8217; business debate on book week Scotland. I had hoped to fly into the chamber for my members&#8217; business debate, replete with my league cape and mask, but of course that would not have been appropriate behaviour in a parliamentary chamber. However, I have them in my bag, so I will wear them later.</p><p>The league of extraordinary booklovers is a group of people who have been recruited in the past year and who will be online all this week. If members need any ideas about what to read, or need to find out about a particular genre or author, they should email the league. Its fingers will fly over the keyboard and make sure that members get back suggestions to keep them busy this week. I thank my constituent from Milton of Campsie, Lindesay Burton, who is one of that extraordinary league.</p><p>The cabinet secretary referred to the reading hour, which is at 11 o&#8217;clock on St Andrew&#8217;s day. I do not suggest that everybody stop working then, but it would be nice if we could all, from the long list of celebrations that the cabinet secretary read out, take a quiet moment at 11 o&#8217;clock on St Andrew&#8217;s day to read a piece of Scottish literature. Of course, in my members&#8217; business debate, I could have said, &#8220;Right, everybody, get your books out and read,&#8221; and we could have had a quiet 45 minutes.</p><p>I will also highlight something that I particularly like, which is the family pack of three books that will be presented to every primary 1 pupil in the country. It is so important that we start children reading at an early age and that we encourage their parents and carers to read with them and to introduce a love of literature. I have a constituency connection again: one of the books in the pack is &#8220;Jack and the Flumflum Tree&#8221; by the children&#8217;s laureate, Julia Donaldson, who is one of my constituents.</p><p>There are lots of local events in my constituency. On the theme of introducing Scottish literature to young folk, I am pleased that we are having bookbug sessions in Bishopbriggs, Lennoxtown, Lenzie, William Patrick and Westerton libraries. All the bookbug sessions this week will be on Scottish themes.</p><p>The cabinet secretary referred to the book, &#8220;My Favourite Place&#8221;. I, of course, have a copy with me, although I am not going to ask all members to read it now. We were all given copies of it. In a motion that I lodged in October, I suggested that although members should of course stay at home and read their copies, they should also think about where they could take them afterwards to donate to others. I have decided this year to take copies to care homes and sheltered housing in my constituency.</p><p>When I got the book, I saw that it could perhaps be difficult for someone with arthritic hands to read, so I spoke to Booktrust. There is an audio version of the book on its website, which it is happy for us to download on to a CD and take along to older or visually impaired people. We should make sure that literature is there and available to all of us.</p><p>In true librarian fashion, I turn to my bookmarked page in &#8220;My Favourite Place&#8221;. One entry that particularly caught my eye was &#8220;Island of (South) Rona&#8221; by Valerie Mcilreavy, which is about an island off Skye that I visit every year and which my Dalmatian dog is named after. It is a lovely poem to read.</p><p>Of course, members would not expect me to finish on anything other than Howard Swindle&#8217;s little ditty, &#8220;Mobile Library Man&#8221;. Please enjoy book week Scotland. It will be back next year, and I hope that I will get a members&#8217; business debate then.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew&#8217;s Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First of all, I refer members to my register of interests as the chair of the Scottish Library and Information Council and as a member of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals.

I also thank the members of the St Andrew&#8217;s Ambulance Association who are in the gallery and the many volunteers around the country who, in their own time, provide the many services about which we have heard.</p><p>One of the startling things that I have learned is the national figures for last year: 18,729 people were trained in first aid techniques and more than 3,000 events throughout the country were attended. That is a phenomenal number of volunteers giving up their time to do exceptionally good work.</p><p>In doing my research for the debate, I was delighted to find that there is a thriving St Andrew&#8217;s branch in my constituency&#8212;the Strathkelvin branch, which has a long history. The internet is a wonderful thing. I found that the Strathkelvin branch used to be called the Kirkintilloch section of the St Andrew&#8217;s Ambulance Corps. A man called James Gordon, who lived in Kerr Street in Kirkintilloch, joined that corps on 8 April 1933. On the internet, you can find an image of the booklet that showed that he was a member and a trained first-aider. The organisation&#8217;s history is quite amazing. To bring it completely up to date, this year the local branch attended&#8212;among other events&#8212;Kirkintilloch gala day, the East Dunbartonshire cycle festival in Bishopbriggs and the Bearsden and Milngavie highland games. The Strathkelvin branch would not, of course, have attended that last event; it would have been the Milngavie branch, which is not based in my constituency, but covers it.</p><p>One of the really nice things that I learned about the Strathkelvin branch is that it has a St Andrew&#8217;s cadets branch, which is a programme for 11 to 15-year-olds. They not only learn first aid but attend events as observers and helpers, which is a great way to recruit volunteers for the future.</p><p>I hope that St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid does not mind my mentioning two other organisations with which I work closely on first aid and emergency life support. The British Heart Foundation has made a call for emergency life support to be taught in every school, as Drew Smith mentioned. When it conducted a survey, it found that 78 per cent of children would like to do that training. I was at an event on ELS with the BHF in October. The next day, I was in St Machan&#8217;s primary school in Lennoxtown, where all bar one of the primary 7 pupils said that they wanted to do that first aid training and ELS training if it was offered to them. I tell Drew that one thing that I managed to do over the October recess was not only to sign up to the BHF call myself but to get the First Minister to do so. I hope that we are moving towards the realisation of that training in every school.</p><p>I will also mention another organisation of which I am a member&#8212;Lucky2BHere, which is based on the Isle of Skye. It was formed in 2007 by my friend Ross Cowie after he had a serious cardiac event. That voluntary organisation now has more than 23 defibrillators in public places throughout Scotland. However, it not only puts in defibrillators, but ensures through the heartstart programme that everybody in the local community is trained to use them in the event of an emergency. That is something that I intend to do. The next time I am on Skye, I will get my training and, I hope, become one of the band of volunteers who are confident to do first aid when it is called for.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678177", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish First Aid Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank James Dornan for bringing the motion to the Parliament for debate.

I found it fascinating to learn about the trust.</p><p>I wanted to be in the debate today more to listen and learn than to make a strong contribution, but when I tell members about the population statistics of my constituency, they will understand why I want to listen and learn so much about housing that will help us as we grow older. Presently, the numbers of 60 to 74-year-olds and people aged 75-plus in East Dunbartonshire, which encompasses my constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden, are 2 per cent above the national average, but the registrar general for Scotland&#8217;s projections for 2035 show a decline in all age groups in East Dunbartonshire except for 65 to 74-year-olds and people aged 75-plus. We are facing an explosion in the population of those aged 75-plus from the current 9,196 to 17,090, living well, long and healthy lives but requiring housing that is appropriate to their needs.</p><p>One of the things that struck me was that the number of households in East Dunbartonshire with someone aged 75-plus will have risen by 88 per cent by 2035. That tells us something about the housing needs in my constituency. Currently in Strathkelvin and Bearsden, there are 423 sheltered housing properties, but in 20 years&#8217; time there will be 17,000 people aged over 75. Members can see from that why I am interested in this debate and in what the Vivarium Trust does. I am so delighted to hear that there is going to be a project that we can all go along and see and learn from.</p><p>Reading up for this debate was so exciting, because I found out, for example, that 8 per cent of Danes live in co-housing&#8212;so it is happening already and in good numbers&#8212;and that there are 230 co-housing schemes in the Netherlands. It is therefore not just pie in the sky, because it is really working.</p><p>I got so excited the more I read about it and I think that a lot of my constituents will as well. The idea of an intentional community that combines the autonomy and privacy of the individual household with the mutual support offered through a degree of collaborative living is right up my street and the street of many of my constituents. I came across a lovely quote that stated that people have to start thinking about this when they are in their 50s and 60s, so that it is there for when they really need it.</p><p>I intend to go out with my dog-walking group, which is a bunch of women in their mid-50s who had the sense to have dogs and not late babies, and talk about becoming an intentional community and working on co-housing for our group. Of course, we might not want a communal house; we will want a communal kennel. I am being serious, because some of the things that I have learned are so exciting. The fact is that the inception, design, detailed planning, building and development of the co-housing property through to its on-going operation is managed by the members themselves in a fully participatory manner. That is right up my street and, I am sure, the street of many of my constituents.</p><p>It is interesting to learn that co-housing for older people is now incorporated as an option in the national housing policies of Denmark and the Netherlands. I hope to be able to explore the issue further with the Scottish Government with regard to the very particular needs of my constituency and its growing elderly population.

We found that, in general, 40 per cent of appeals against an assessment are successful and that 69 per cent of those appeals are successful when someone is represented by, for example, a citizens advice bureau worker or a welfare rights officer.

I appealed the decision and my appeal was upheld. I was assessed because I was unable to work due to depression. Some of the things that happened in that assessment included being asked to pick up a pen. Jamie Hepburn used other examples, but that was mine.

It was perhaps reflected in Gil Paterson&#8217;s speech when he talked about the risk of undue influence and coercion by family members if they became paid carers. In the evidence received by the committee, it was councils and organisations such as the Association of Directors of Social Work that, illogically, talked about the right of everybody who receives care to choose the care that they think best and then said that we have to keep in place the exceptional circumstances criteria for paying family members through direct payments. That contrasts with carers organisations and such organisations as Age Scotland, which in their evidence talked about the facts that most unpaid care is done by family members and that, when those family members are able to provide the care, it leads to better outcomes for the person who is receiving care.</p><p>Reflecting on the dichotomy in the evidence that we received on the topic, I thought that I would take members in the chamber on a personal journey.

This is not something that I&#8217;m doing well.&#8221; You set off on that route, but very quickly you learn about the limitations of the care packages that are on offer through local councils: the four times a day 15-minute visit, which is inadequate for anything&#8212;not just for cooking meals but even for giving company to somebody.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members have already heard about the vast army of 650,000 unpaid carers across Scotland who save the Scottish purse \u00a310 billion a year through their work.

Kirkintilloch is the canal capital of Scotland. It is also a walkers are welcome town. Bishopbriggs is one of the most cycle-friendly towns in Scotland. Last Sunday, I was honoured to open the third East Dunbartonshire cycle festival. One of the sponsors of the day, Samsung, said afterwards that it was one of the most successful days that it had had in its Olympic hope relay heroes campaign.</p><p>In Bearsden, we have the Antonine wall, which has been a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization world heritage site since 2008. I well remember studying Latin at school in the 1970s when the remains of the Roman baths at Bearsden Cross were discovered. I should, of course, point out that that is not in the constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden; it is across the road in the constituency of Clydebank and Milngavie.</p><p>I want to talk about the growth in tourism potential in East Dunbartonshire and Strathkelvin and Bearsden, where our businesses are taking things very seriously. In particular, I want to mention the rebound initiative in Lennoxtown, which I am sure I have spoken about before in the chamber. It is a social enterprise initiative that not only encourages cyclists to come to the Lennox forest for a day&#8217;s cycling but is aiming to build a purpose-built hotel. There will be cycle facilities for the people who come, but they will also be able to go out into Lennoxtown and use the pubs, restaurants and other facilities there, which will help to build the local economy. We know from the evidence that cyclists want to come for two or three days to fully explore the paths.</p><p>I finish by commenting on something that is very personal to me. Radical historians and people who enjoy knowing the radical history of Scotland should come to my leafy suburb. They will not believe it. In Bishopbriggs, we have the Thomas Muir trail, and Lennoxtown had the first co-op that gave a divvy, in 1812. In my home village, the Westerton garden suburb, which will be celebrating its centenary next year, was the first garden suburb in Scotland where everything was owned co-operatively.</p><p>I invite members to come with me in October, when I intend to have a staycation in my constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden.

There are three European directives that cover medical devices. Those directives have been implemented into UK legislation by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. They are there to regulate safety and performance and to include provision for mandatory CE markings. Under that EU framework, we have REACH&#8212;the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals. Under that architecture, we have the European Chemicals Agency, which is responsible for the CE marking. Parallel to that, we have the competent authorities in each member state; in the UK, the competent authority is hosted by the Health and Safety Executive. Under the competent authority are the notified bodies, which are appointed and accredited by the member states. In the UK, the notified body is the UK Accreditation Service&#8212;UKAS&#8212;whose role is to ensure that the design and manufacture of products make them safe and compliant.</p><p>Given that extensive regulatory framework, how was the fraud possible? I turn to the Howe report, which has already been quoted. Earl Howe said that the review found that the MHRA fulfilled its obligations regarding incidents that involved the implants, and that the MHRA&#8217;s work was hindered by a lack of complete or reliable evidence. Much of the information came from a manufacturer that has been found to have been working fraudulently.</p><p>Given all that, Howe concludes that there is nothing to suggest that the system for regulating medical devices is unsound and that the responsibility lies squarely with the fraudulent manufacturer. I must ask a further question: is the regulatory regime flawed? When I look to see what the REACH regulation was founded on, I find that it states that it</p><p>&#8220;places greater responsibility on industry to manage the risks from chemicals and to provide safety information on the substances.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669259", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: PIP Silicone Breast Implants"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Ms Baillie.

The figures for alcohol misuse in Scotland are both stark and frightening. Last autumn, Dr Peter Rice from the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland&#8212;he is in the gallery&#8212;gave a presentation to a group of MSPs. In the past 20 years, the rate of alcohol-related mortality has gone from 15 to 40 per 100,000 of the population, and the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver has climbed from 28 to 72 per 100,000 of the population. At the same time, affordability of alcohol through off-sales has similarly rocketed. Beer has become 135 per cent more affordable and wines and spirits have become 110 per cent more affordable in that period. As we see the correlation between low prices and alcohol-related ill health, so the international research going back over a century proves that raising the price of alcohol leads to consumption falling&#8212;and when consumption falls, the incidence of alcohol-related ill health falls.</p><p>Professor Tim Stockwell, who has been mentioned, looked back over 20 years of pricing of alcohol in Canadian states and was able to show that a 10 per cent rise in the cost of alcohol led to a 3.4 per cent drop in consumption. Most relevant in that research is how harm reduction increases as price increases. Jackie Baillie and Margo MacDonald both referred to that, and Bob Doris went a long way in defending it. I refer any member who does not believe in the harm-reduction effects of the bill to the work that was done in 2009 by Meier et al. The highlight of that research, for me, is the finding that the groups whose consumption is most responsive to a rise in the price of alcohol are young people and high-risk drinkers. Those are the people in Scotland whom I hope we all want to help and support out of alcohol abuse.</p><p>In 2006, Scotland was bold with its ban on smoking in public places.

I welcome its director, Delia Henry, and her staff who are in the gallery tonight. I have had a great year working with Action on Hearing Loss and celebrating its centenary. Last October, at the Scottish National Party conference in Inverness, I hosted an event for the organisation and ate birthday cake with its staff. A few months later, at a reception here in Parliament, I ate more birthday cake with them.</p><p>My experience with Action on Hearing Loss began much earlier in the year, on one of my first official visits in my constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden, when I visited its hear to help project in the Kilsyth Road sheltered housing. The three-year project is funded by the Scottish Government and the Co-operative. It is volunteer led and provides a maintenance service that&#8212;among other things&#8212;replaces batteries and tubing in hearing aids. One benefit of that is that it saves audiology specialists&#8217; time, but the most important thing that I learned from visiting the project is that it provides a personalised service for hearing aid users, either in their home or in a location that is convenient for them.</p><p>On my visit to the Kilsyth Road sheltered housing, I met a fantastic volunteer called Irene Fyffe&#8212;not forgetting Muffin, her hearing dog; I hope that Mr Q does not mind my referring to another support dog. I heard just recently from Action on Hearing Loss that Irene Fyffe&#8212;whom I so enjoyed meeting&#8212;won a champion volunteer award in the &#8220;champions the cause&#8221; category earlier this year. She also manages the service at the Golden Jubilee hospital in Clydebank, which was a runner-up in the Patient Experience Network national awards. It is evident that the volunteer-led personalised service from Action on Hearing Loss is not only doing great work for individuals in our communities, but is being recognised throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom for that marvellous work.</p><p>As members can see, I am finishing by trying out my BSL in order to say, &#8220;Thank you&#8221; to Action on Hearing Loss and to all the volunteers who are involved in it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667498", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Deaf Awareness Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jenny Marra for bringing the debate to the chamber.

It stated:</p><p>&#8220;Community radio stations are radio services which provide community benefits and run on a not-for-profit basis. Generally stations are focused on broadcasting to and involving their own particular community ... Stations involve local volunteers in providing the service, and bring community benefits such as training and community news and discussion. They generally have a small coverage area (usually up to a 5km radius).&#8221;</p><p>I wanted to quote that because it is a great introduction to East Dunbartonshire Radio in my constituency. East Dunbartonshire Radio is taking its first, tentative steps from the Bishopbriggs media centre, which is the home of Cue and Review&#8212;&#8220;Print Speaking to the Blind&#8221; and is where national newspapers and magazines are recorded. In October this year, it will celebrate its 30th anniversary. What better way of celebrating an anniversary than taking to the airwaves, rather than just with discs and tapes? At this point, we should pay tribute to the founding chairman of Cue and Review, Alastair McPhee.</p><p>In July, East Dunbartonshire Radio will begin broadcasting from 8 am until midnight every day of the week. There will be a trial in mid-May. I hope that many folk will listen to it, join in over the internet and send in their comments.</p><p>East Dunbartonshire Radio really is working hard to fulfil all the criteria in Ofcom&#8217;s description. It already has nearly 30 volunteers, who are working to get the station up and running in July. Audio, video and media graduates have volunteered and are using the skills that they have learned at university to pay back their community. The station also hopes to involve the pupils of Bishopbriggs academy.</p><p>One thing that delights me about East Dunbartonshire Radio&#8217;s work in my community is that it has worked with the East Dunbartonshire community volunteer service, which I worked for a few years ago. That has given it access to more than 400 voluntary organisations throughout my constituency. Like Ms Grahame, people in those 400 voluntary organisations will be able to put on their blue suede shoes and broadcast across my constituency to let folk know the good work that they do and the services that they offer to my constituents.</p><p>An exciting thing that East Dunbartonshire Radio proposes is the setting up of a Scottish radio training school in which there will be courses offered for complete beginners all the way through to advanced-level courses. The courses will be highly practical and will feature a mix of lectures, workshops and one-to-one coaching. East Dunbartonshire Radio is holding its hands out to the community and offering something back to it.</p><p>I wish East Dunbartonshire Radio well in its trial in mid-May. I hope that when it begins to broadcast in July, the people of my constituency and people throughout Scotland will enjoy the benefits of that radio station.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665517", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Radio"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will quote what Ofcom said in answer to the question, &#8220;What is community radio?&#8221;.

I want to give three examples from those areas from my Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency. I will talk about East Dunbartonshire&#8217;s Cycle Co-op, which is based in Bishopbriggs, the rebound initiative in Lennoxtown, and pedal on Parliament, which has already been mentioned. I thank Dr Brennan, who is a constituent of mine, for his work in making that happen next month.</p><p>East Dunbartonshire&#8217;s Cycle Co-op is a not-for-profit social enterprise team led by the redoubtable Mark Kiehlmann. It is a team of certified bike ability tutors and cycle mechanics. Those people have done many things. Among them, they set up the East Dunbartonshire bike library to assure parents that, when their children start to learn to cycle, they cycle on a bike that is fit for purpose.</p><p>Over the team&#8217;s few years of working, the most remarkable achievement it has seen has been Bishopbriggs becoming the first town&#8212;indeed, as far as I know, it is still the only town&#8212;in which every primary school has received a Cycling Scotland cycle-friendly school award. That achievement is even more remarkable in light of the fact that only 2 per cent of children in Scotland cycle to school. At St Matthew&#8217;s primary school in Bishopbriggs, 20 per cent currently cycle to school daily. Double the 2020 target is being achieved in Bishopbriggs in 2012. It is therefore not surprising that when the BBC and other media outlets are looking for someone to go to to highlight the benefits of cycling, they go to East Dunbartonshire&#8217;s Cycle Co-op. As a result, Bishopbriggs has received a lot more publicity than a small town of its size would perhaps normally expect to receive. I thank the many MSPs who supported my motion S4M-01910, which highlighted the work of East Dunbartonshire&#8217;s Cycle Co-op.</p><p>I turn to cycling for leisure and the rebound initiative in Lennoxtown. The plans are ambitious for a not-for-profit social enterprise. We want to see a cycle tourism hub in Lennoxtown that utilises the Forestry Commission tracks around it, and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;taps into the central Scotland cycling route network and uses the Forth-Clyde canal, which goes through my constituency. A community consultation was held in March, which more than 80 people attended. There were nothing but positive comments from the questionnaires and the ideas board that day.</p><p>I know that we are short of time, so I will conclude.

In that role, I am delighted to say that SLIC welcomes the bill overall and feels that it provides a platform to deliver a National Library of Scotland that is fit for the 21st century.</p><p>There are three aspects of the bill that I would like to comment on but, before I do so, as a librarian I cannot possibly give up the opportunity to say thank you to the many members who have extolled the delights and virtues not just of the National Library but of libraries in general.</p><p>Neil Findlay talked about the fact that libraries are cherished, and I am delighted that he realises that. I point out to him that, in 21st century libraries, we do not say, &#8220;Wheesht!&#8221;&#8212;we just chuck you out. In the last year, it has been demonstrated that libraries really are cherished, because borrowing figures and visits to libraries have increased. Libraries are powerful at all times, but especially in times such as these, when people are feeling financially pressed.</p><p>I cannot move on without saying to Mark Griffin that of course the National Library of Scotland holds our treasures, and &#8220;Oor Wullie&#8221; is definitely one of them.</p><p>I want to comment on three aspects of the bill.

I am therefore delighted by the cabinet secretary&#8217;s announcement, but I ask her to clarify whether the minimum number of nine means eight plus the chair or nine plus the chair. It will be interesting to hear the answer to that question.</p><p>On ministerial direction, I am sure that many members will know that librarians are proud and fierce defenders of the independence of their libraries. That is because our core function is the collection and dissemination of information. Our core function is to collect and disseminate everything for everyone without direction, fear or favour. As a librarian, I had a long, hard look at section 8(1), which says:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Ministers may give NLS directions&#8221;.</p><p>I am happy that that is tempered by section 8(2)(a), which focuses that ministerial direction on section 2(2)(d), which is on collaboration between libraries, and section 2(3)(c), which is on the promotion of diversity. I am pleased that the cabinet secretary said that a letter will go the committee to give much more of an outline especially of what is meant by section 2(2)(d) and the promotion of collaboration between libraries. I know that that letter will be eagerly awaited far beyond the committee, including in the library profession. I thank the cabinet secretary for her extra clarification.</p><p>A shiver goes up a librarian&#8217;s back when charging is mentioned, but I was reminded of the reality. My first job in a library was in 1975, when our collection was thought to be free and accessible for everybody to borrow, but it was not. In those days, we had the add-on of big clunky videos, which we charged for. It seemed appropriate to do that, as the service was an add-on to our core service. When computers went into libraries 20 years later, we initially charged for access to the internet, as that was a cost for libraries. The Parliament and successive Governments have to be thanked for our having free internet access in every public library in Scotland now.</p><p>I am pleased with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment, which she reiterated in the committee and today in Parliament. The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring free access to our collections. She has also said today that that free access cannot be interfered with by any ministerial guidance under section 2(1), which is on the general functions of the National Library, and section 2(2)(b), which refers to &#8220;making the collections accessible&#8221;. Statutory weight has been given to that commitment, and I thank the cabinet secretary for that.</p><p>On electronic legal deposit, there is the UK Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 but, nine years on, the librarian profession is still waiting for regulations. Libraries and librarians need those to allow us to do our jobs properly. I hope that the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport will heed the cabinet secretary&#8217;s approaches and give the committee report due respect.</p><p>I welcome the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by making two declarations of interest: as many members know, I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals; and, since November, I have been proud to be the chair of the Scottish Library and Information Council.

Members will not be surprised to hear that, as an ex-school librarian, I am delighted that the school library is involved in that project throughout the week to ensure that the young people receive evidence and not prejudice or misinformed stories, as can happen. The project is viewed within Kirkintilloch high school as an integral part of the respect agenda.

Information literacy is about ensuring that everybody understands how to access information, how to evaluate that information and how to apply that information in a way that brings the results and solutions that a person has set out to achieve. We could say that an information literate person is a super-googler. I use that phrase deliberately because one of the problems that we have nowadays is that people sometimes attempt to devalue the role of libraries and librarians in access to information simply because they think that through the internet we have access to everything there is to know about in the world.

As she mentioned, some of the centre&#8217;s staff, including Luisa and Carol, are in the public gallery this evening.</p><p>My first contact with the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire was back in 1999, when I was a regional MSP for the West of Scotland, but my contact has continued since then. When I worked with East Dunbartonshire CVS in 2004, I worked with the volunteer centre and, as a fellow professional, learned about the work that it did.</p><p>I hope that, by now, I have become friends with the staff at the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire. Like Annabel Goldie, I love to go to the office. She likened it to a glass of champagne, and she is right: the staff and the office are always fizzing and sparkling. The people there are full of great enthusiasm.</p><p>I was delighted to be able to go and present a cheque for &#163;50 towards the centre&#8217;s funds a few weeks ago. Many MSPs do market research for companies. They offer to pay us, but I always prefer&#8212;as I am sure most members do&#8212;to give the money to a local worthy cause. There cannot be a cause much more worthy than our volunteer centre.</p><p>I call them friends also because of what happened at the riding of the Parliament on 1 July. As I stood on the High Street watching the crowds go by, the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire representatives proudly came by behind their banner as part of the riding. I could not help myself: I jumped in and joined them behind the banner. What fun we had that day. It culminated in photos with the First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth, who is here to reply to the debate. We had a great time.</p><p>Why is it important that we talk about volunteers and volunteering in the Parliament? Annabel Goldie talked about what volunteers say they get out of volunteering. That is true, but I am glad that the debate gives us the opportunity to say thank you back to volunteers for what they give to local communities. In thanking all our volunteers, I extend my thanks to the staff at the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire.</p><p>The volunteer centre is one of only five partner organisations in the third phase of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s community partnership project. At the end of this month and into February, the centre will host a stall in the Parliament. I hope that as many MSPs as possible will take the time to stop by and see the work that it does.</p><p>I am glad that Annabel Goldie highlighted the volunteer champions work that we are doing in schools. It is the most fantastic thing. Having been a volunteer in my own day and having volunteered with young people, I think that it is important that we now work to encourage young people to come on board as volunteers.</p><p>Annabel Goldie also mentioned the work in Turnbull high school. Luisa has now taken that into Bishopbriggs academy, where the number of pupils who asked to work with the volunteer champions project meant that it was oversubscribed. That is largely down to&#8212;no, all down to&#8212;Luisa&#8217;s enthusiasm and the support that she gives the young people in their work.</p><p>Annabel Goldie also mentioned befriending. Volunteering continues for a long time. One of my friends, Sandra Renwick, began as one of the befrienders in Kirkintilloch, moved to Skye and is still befriending people in Kirkintilloch by phone from Skye.

Despite the constraints that the Presiding Officer has put on our ability to debate the issue&#8212;or should I say the constraints that the law has put on us&#8212;it is still important that we have the debate for our many constituents who have asked us to speak on their behalf. Given those constraints, I will put on my health librarian hat and discuss the research that has been done on the health of nuclear test veterans. I also refer members to my speech in the veterans debate on 3 November for background information.</p><p>From both her Nobel prize-winning research and death from aplastic anaemia in the early 20th century, we learned early on from Marie Curie of radioactivity&#8217;s applications and radiation&#8217;s risks. Despite that, when our nuclear test veterans&#8212;many of whom, as we have heard, were conscripts&#8212;were sent in to witness nuclear explosions, there was an almost cavalier attitude to their personal protection. Although they were given no protective clothing or respirators, they were sent in to the sites shortly after the bombs exploded, had to fly and sail through radioactive dust clouds and had to clean the craft afterwards, often with paper tissues. I said that the attitude was cavalier; I wonder whether it was negligent or, indeed, deliberate.</p><p>Given what those men were put through, it is not surprising that, since the 1980s, there has been a lot of research into their health. Of course, as a health librarian, I looked for information on that research on PubMed, a premier public access research tool run by the National Library of Medicine, itself part of the US National Institutes of Health. I was able to find 533 papers, but will quote from only one of them: &#8220;Blood money: the duty of care to veterans of UK nuclear weapons tests&#8221; by Sue Rabbitt Roff, which was published in the journal Medicine, Conflict and Survival. The abstract, which I have abridged, points to evidence of</p><p>&#8220;deliberate and repeated decisions not to provide adequate radiation protection ... even by the standards of 50 years ago ... to most of&#8221;</p><p>those</p><p>&#8220;who participated in the British&#8221;</p><p>nuclear bomb-testing</p><p>&#8220;programme. ... The evidence lies in the minutes and memoranda of the scientists, doctors and military leaders overseeing these tests&#8221;</p><p>and in</p><p>&#8220;Archival material in the United Kingdom Public Records Office and the National Archives of Australia&#8221;.</p><p>Despite that paper and the number of other papers on the topic, I have been unable to find any meta-analysis of all the work&#8212;and I have to wonder why.

In the past year, Carers Link East Dunbartonshire has identified and supported 285 new carers and has directly supported 689 carers. Each of those carers saves East Dunbartonshire Council &#163;17,242 per annum. That is a total saving to the council of &#163;11.9 million per annum. In saluting the workers at Carers Link East Dunbartonshire, where I used to work, as I should have said to begin with, and carers across East Dunbartonshire, of whom I am one, I want to look at two areas of the carers strategy: carers&#8217; rights and carer training.</p><p>The carers&#8217; rights charter, when it comes, will be very welcome, as it will enshrine the mantra, which we often hear, that carers are equal partners in the delivery of care. Like Alison McInnes, I am pleased that that mantra will have a legislative underpinning in the forthcoming self-directed support bill. If the bill ends the situation in which direct payments can be made to carers only in exceptional circumstances, and such payments instead become the norm, we will be able to tackle carer poverty for the first time. As Bill Kidd said, carers live in poverty. We cannot directly address the &#163;59.35 per week carers allowance&#8212;that pittance from the UK Government, to receive which someone has to be caring for 35 hours per week&#8212;but with direct payments to carers we can help them out of poverty.</p><p>With direct payments to carers, we will ensure also that we place carers at the heart of commissioning services and that they have access to appropriate training. Above all, we will acknowledge the reality that carers are doing the caring already. For most of those who are cared for by unpaid carers, be those carers family members or friends, that is who they want to be cared for by, not by the paid care workforce.</p><p>The evidence shows that, if we train our unpaid carers, not only are they able to give better care to those they care for, it is better for the carers&#8217; own confidence, ability and health. I make a suggestion to the minister that I have made on many previous occasions and will continue to make. Local authorities and health boards should include carers in their care workforce training, especially in medication management, and moving and handling. I was pleased to see in the carers strategy that the Scottish National Party Government has given &#163;281,000 to carers organisations and that the NHS boards will be asked to make a training offer to carers, because that underlines the fact that carers should not be paying to be trained to do their caring. Carers save Scotland more than &#163;7 billion per annum.</p><p>I love Siobhan McMahon&#8217;s idea of a carers card, which I was going to suggest in an earlier debate on the back of the young carers card, which I welcome. I am not a wee, shy carer, as I am sure most members will agree, but there are often times when I am admitting my mum into hospital when I would just love to have a card to hand over that would show that I was a carer and would list her conditions. She has certain conditions that I cannot refer to in front of her, because she does not appreciate that she has them. Obviously, I will not mention them on the record.</p><p>I know that I am short of time, Presiding Officer, so I will not go into detail about two local problems in East Dunbartonshire that I wanted to raise, but I will put them on the record. The Labour-Tory administration in East Dunbartonshire Council has decided that, for someone to get care from the council, their need has to be severe or critical, so the council has done away with supporting carers and those who need care in a preventative manner. Further, I heard just recently that it is being considered that respite transport costs will have to be met by those getting the respite. I welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement of &#163;2 million for short breaks for carers. I hope that East Dunbartonshire Council will think again about introducing transport costs for those accessing respite.</p><p>It is difficult to sum up in six minutes all that I have learned as a carer over the past 22 years, but I think that what we have heard in the chamber today will show that personal testimony in this area is powerful and instructive. I thank all those MSPs who have shadowed carers. Tommy Whitelaw has been referred to, and I urge members to look at his on-tour blog, which had me in tears&#8212;I had to run out of the committee room. He did it to me again last Friday at the Carers Link East Dunbartonshire annual general meeting, when he showed his blog again, and again I was out in tears. I also refer members to Kris Rodden, a young man of 28, who I went on a walk with on Sunday to raise awareness of dementia and to raise money for Dementia Awareness.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655398", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers and Young Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last Friday, I was at the Carers Link East Dunbartonshire annual general meeting.

Members can imagine my horror when I delved into the background of the subject. Between 1952 and 1962, the UK and the United States of America exploded more than 40 nuclear test weapons in Australia and the Pacific. Twenty-two thousand UK service personnel, most of whom were on national service, were drafted in to witness the explosions, although it would be more appropriate to call them guinea pigs rather than witnesses. Back in those days, the health and safety advice to those personnel was that they should turn their backs and cover their eyes. Even worse, Royal Air Force planes were sent to fly into the huge radioactive dust clouds within two hours of the explosions.</p><p>Since the 1980s, there have been numerous studies on the health of nuclear-test veterans. Looking across them all, the most common health problems to appear in that group of people are leukaemia and multiple myelomas. The most recent survey, which was published on Monday, was a self-response survey in which letters were sent to nuclear-test veterans and focus groups were used. Ninety-one per cent of those people reported diagnoses of serious or long-term conditions following their service in the armed forces. Of the reported diagnoses, 60 per cent were of musculoskeletal problems, cardiac problems, genito-urinary tract problems, digestive tract problems and cancer. Those five conditions are all known to be linked to exposure to radiation.</p><p>Members have spoken of the debt of gratitude that we owe our service personnel, and this is an area in which our debt is enormous, as the figures show. Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Russia and France have all acknowledged that debt to their service personnel. Not only that&#8212;they have also accepted that they owe them compensation. Sadly, as Kevin Stewart highlighted in his intervention, that is not the case in the UK. The case is live at the moment, so I cannot comment on it in detail. Nevertheless, I highlight the fact that, so far, the UK MOD has spent &#163;5&#160;million in legal battles to prevent the nuclear-test veterans from claiming compensation, instead of just paying it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "During the minister&#8217;s speech, Kevin Stewart intervened to raise the issue of the nuclear-test veterans.

However, I would first like to say that I am glad that Iain Gray apologised for his flippancy about the National Library of Scotland. It is a proud, world-renowned and modern institute&#8212;so modern, in fact, that this morning it began to follow me on Twitter. The reason why we need legislation is that the library&#8217;s governance was set up in 1925 and it wants to be a 21st century organisation.</p><p>I welcome the reintroduction of proposals on minimum pricing. During the election, I discovered that, in my constituency, it is possible to buy 3 litres of cider at 18p per unit. We need minimum pricing because 18p is a recipe for mayhem and alcoholism.</p><p>I am delighted about the children&#8217;s rights bill, which is on an issue that I championed when I was first in Parliament in 1999. That bill seems to me to be the logical conclusion to the appointment of Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People.</p><p>On self-directed support, I welcome the Government&#8217;s stated principle that the aim is to promote choice and control for those who are in receipt of social care and to promote the independence of those people. The First Minister referred to the independence generation. I would say that self-directed support will help to foster an independence generation.</p><p>I will focus on five aspects of the self-directed support bill. Given my background, members will not be surprised to know that one of them is on older people. I will also consider assessment, regulation, support and carers. We all know about the demographics and the rise in Scotland&#8217;s elderly population. My constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden is home to the largest rise in Scotland. We spend &#163;1.1 billion per annum on social care, but only 7 per cent of that budget is spent on care at home, although that is what most people want. Sadly, the uptake of direct payments is still lower among the older population, so I hope that the self-directed support bill will ensure greater uptake. The bill, with its promotion of independence and enablement, will be a preventative measure rather than a reactive one, as social care so often is for older folk. I hope that, if it works, that preventative measure will mean fewer admissions to acute care and more people living longer healthy lives at home.</p><p>Assessment is fundamental to the success of any self-directed support and of the preventative model. Assessments for social care must encompass not only people&#8217;s care needs, but their expectations for their quality of life. I am delighted that we are moving much more to considering the success of the outcomes of that assessment, rather than outputs.</p><p>The preventative criterion alone will ensure that care is always there when it is needed, rather than only when the situation becomes critical. As a constituency member, I raise the issue that if we are to ensure that the preventative element of self-directed support and care in the community is working, we must ensure that the bar for accessing care in the community is lowered so that care is provided before the situation becomes critical or substantial. That does not happen in many local authorities. If, as happens in East Dunbartonshire Council, we wait until a person is critical or in substantial need of care, we have probably missed the chance to use preventative measures to ensure that the person stays healthy. That point has been supported by WRVS in a recent report.</p><p>On regulation, I refer ministers to the current Health and Sport Committee inquiry on the regulation of care. One issue that is beginning to arise from the evidence is that we need to consider not only whether regulation is fit for purpose now, but whether it is fit for the future, when, we hope, more care will be delivered in people&#8217;s homes.</p><p>Many reports indicate that carers and care users find the idea of self-directed support a bit scary to begin with. I was scared when I first looked at direct payments for my mother. However, all reports show that, with support, things become manageable. We must ensure that such support structures are in place.</p><p>My final theme, members will not be surprised to hear, is carers. The importance of carers runs through all reports and evidence. I am delighted that, in the national strategy, the Government recognises carers as partners in care; I hope that we will see that move further. The only item that I am disappointed about in the national strategy for care is that there will be</p><p>&#8220;no drive to remove ... legislative limitation on employing family members as personal assistants&#8221;.</p><p>Three quarters of a million unpaid carers in Scotland provide services worth &#163;7 billion.

Here we are, 12 years later, and the situation has not advanced greatly in that time.</p><p>Vicky Nash, the director of Ofcom Scotland, has said that, in terms of connectivity, Scotland is a country of contrasts. Only 37 per cent of Scots have cable access, whereas the figure is 48 per cent across the UK. That leads to problems with fixed broadband not-spots, as they are called, most of which are, as members know, in rural areas. Yet, the demand exists for access to broadband. Through the broadband reach project that the cabinet secretary has spoken about, we can look at the statistics and find that there is equal take-up in urban and rural areas when broadband is available. That goes against the UK trend.</p><p>There is still much to do. We have heard about the &#163;50&#160;million from the Scottish futures fund, but it is vital that Scotland get its requisite share of the &#163;530&#160;million in the UK Government&#8217;s Britain&#8217;s superfast broadband future strategy. I say &#8220;requisite share&#8221; because, as we have less connectivity, we should get more than our population share of that money. Other members have referred to the fact that figures for mobile coverage and connectivity are similarly problematic. I direct members to how Norway has managed to provide mobile connectivity through NetCom, which is a private company there.</p><p>For me, this is not a technical exercise; it is about a means and a method of delivering services. I will concentrate on telehealth, to which a few members have referred. Telehealth is telemedicine and telecare in their totality. Last year, the Health and Sport Committee produced a report entitled &#8220;Clinical portal and telehealth development in NHS Scotland&#8221;, in which the committee made it absolutely clear that telehealth is of great value to Scotland and especially to our remote communities. The changing demographics of Scotland, especially our growing elderly population and the growing populations in our rural and remote communities, mean that telehealth is one of the ways of providing health and care services to the many people who need them.</p><p>The Scottish centre for telehealth has reported on some groundbreaking projects&#8212;the cabinet secretary referred to one in Moray. I draw folks&#8217; attention to the telestroke project that is centred in Orkney, the teledermatology project in the Western Isles and the telecardiology project in mid-Argyll. Those are all interesting projects that show the value of telehealth in looking after people where they live, but ensuring that they still have access to the highest level of consultants throughout the country. I have a friend in Skye who has a pacemaker in his heart that sends messages to Germany, which are sent back and analysed by his consultant in Aberdeen, who then tells his general practitioner in Portree how to treat him. That is the method and magic that we want to ensure everyone can access.</p><p>One of the most interesting ways that we can move on telehealth is towards the care of long-term conditions and the remote monitoring of conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. That will enable folk to remain in their communities while still being monitored and referred, as appropriate, to their local general practitioner.</p><p>Paragraph 78 of the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s report states:</p><p>&#8220;A key piece of infrastructural development necessary to support such telehealth services is the availability of high-speed broadband internet access. As with many other aspects of the public services, broadband access is especially important in remote and rural areas.&#8221;</p><p>It is timely that we are having this debate to ensure that we get connectivity throughout all our rural and remote communities, not only for the sake of it but to ensure that we can get high-quality public services to everyone in Scotland who needs them.</p><p>We have the vision for, and evidence of, what connectivity can deliver for our communities. Today I am speaking specifically about health, but we need that infrastructure generally. I hope that members on all sides of the chamber can work on that and agree to support the Scottish Government in its representations to the UK to ensure that we receive the necessary funding to get that connectivity.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Connectivity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is interesting for me to take part in the debate, because my first speech in the Scottish Parliament, in 1999, was as a librarian talking about seamless access to information for all.

In keeping with previous speeches, I wish my predecessor, David Whitton, well in his life outside Parliament.</p><p>First of all, I must declare an interest: for many years now, I have been the carer for my elderly and infirm mother, and I was an employee of Carers Link East Dunbartonshire. In those capacities, I want to thank the cabinet secretary for her personal commitment to the future planning for care of the elderly in Scotland.</p><p>Members have talked about demographics and mentioned various figures. The issue is particularly important in Strathkelvin and Bearsden and, indeed, across East Dunbartonshire, which has the fastest growing elderly population in Scotland. From a base in 2001, by 2016 the number of over-65s will have increased by 22 per cent and the number of over-85s will have increased by an astonishing 101 per cent. Although that is testament to the health, vigour and vitality of many of my older neighbours, for every one person like my father-in-law, who will be 99 in three weeks&#8217; time and still goes swimming twice a week, there are five older people like my mum, who need help with long-term chronic conditions.</p><p>I am delighted to hear the cross-party support for the emphasis on care in the community. It is what our older folk want and, as a health librarian, I know that the evidence says that it is the best approach. However, as a carer and having worked for Carers Link, I must stress the amount of planning and thought that needs to go into all of this. At the moment, the theory is great but the practice is not always ideal, and the crux to ensuring that practice becomes as good as the theory is the integration of social and health services.</p><p>For example, we have been talking a lot about nutrition. People who live at home can have their dinner made for them, but that means that someone will visit them for 15 minutes, stick a meal in the microwave and leave them to eat it and clean up. That is simply not good enough if we are talking about supporting older folk and ensuring community spirit; indeed, all it is good for is ensuring huge profits for Marks and Spencer, as that is where we go to buy microwaveable food for our older people.</p><p>There are also what are known as tuck calls, when someone comes any time from half past 6 to half past 10 at night to put people to bed.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Caring for Scotland&#8217;s Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a returning MSP, I have to say that it is a great privilege to make my first speech in what, to me, is a new Parliament.

After all, we want our older folk to be independent. As a Labour member has already pointed out, independence must mean that they are supported in their care, not left isolated in their own homes.</p><p>Some of the current problems with care in the community are leading many service users to move in the direction of direct payments, so that they can get their needs assessed and buy in what they need. However, the approach has huge limitations. Many of those who are looking for direct payments need support in completing the process and actually getting a personal assistant. We need to spend a lot of time looking at that area. One quite technical issue that I have come across and which I will take up later with ministers is the way in which the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 works with regard to personal assistants.</p><p>One in eight of us in Scotland is a carer, and we save the Government approximately &#163;6&#160;billion per annum. I very much want us to be seen as true partners in the care of the elderly people whom we look after when the integration of social and health care is being looked at. Please involve us in the planning and listen to those of us who support folk.</p><p>If I may talk about another place, I note that while carers are saving Scotland &#163;6&#160;billion per annum, the Westminster Government is giving people &#163;59 a week for a 35-hour week in a caring role. That has to be considered at Westminster.</p><p>Last week, I raised an issue with the minister for housing, whose reply I am delighted with. A long-term strategy will be considered to ensure that we have housing that is fit for elderly folk to stay in. Adapting someone&#8217;s current home is often not the safe answer to ensuring that they can remain at home.</p><p>On benefits and Westminster, finances are a big thing for old folk who live in their own home. The winter fuel allowance is welcome, but we have to make the point to Westminster that although everyone gets the same winter fuel allowance, it costs 20 per cent more to heat a house in Glasgow or Strathkelvin and Bearsden than it costs to heat a house on the south coast of England.</p><p>When I was outside Parliament, I was pleased to be part of the getting it right for every child programme.

The minister will not be surprised to hear me say that I would like the Executive to be a lot more ambitious. Based on the current figures and on the capacity that we are already planning for, it would be possible to achieve a lot more.

Similarly, communities could reap some of the direct economic benefits. That is already happening&#8212;I am aware that Evanton community council receives a substantial sum of money each year from the wind farm in that area. We could also consider setting up trusts, through which a community would receive, say, a penny per megawatt.

The bill is not exciting, but it is important, and it will be instructive to watch how a former committee member who knows the Transport and the Environment Committee's concerns translates them into amendments to the bill.</p><p>A stage 1 debate is about a committee's being able to highlight its areas of concern and, on reading the Transport and the Environment Committee's report, we see five areas of concern. One of those concerns stems from the Social Justice Committee's report, which I commend to the ministers, on fuel poverty and sustainable development. Members of that committee were also concerned about costs to local authorities, the role of private verifiers and, more important, the introduction of monitoring and auditing of those private verifiers. We also had concerns about the definition of an owner.</p><p>In my few minutes, I want to concentrate on the potential problem of the mandatory status of our new standards. The problem relates to the functional standards that we are about to introduce versus the technical standards that we have at the moment. Why is there a problem? For example, new functional standards for fire safety might say that building materials \"shall not spread fire\", which is a wonderful intention. However, the old technical standard would have set, for example, minimum times for fire doors to hold back fire and a minimum width for corridors, fire exits and stairways. That is the difference. The functional standard says, \"shall not spread fire\" but the technical standard ensures that fire cannot be spread. Similarly, the new functional standard will say that access to buildings should be convenient, but the previous technical standard would have set, for example, a maximum gradient for ramps. It is clear that there are issues that we must consider.</p><p>I am particularly concerned by the transfer from technical to functional standards. That transfer has happened in England and Wales and the Transport and the Environment Committee heard from people who experienced the transfer that they have reservations about it and how it is working in practice. In particular, the committee heard from the Disability Rights Commission and the Fire Protection Association about their concerns on the transfer and the mandatory level of the standards.</p><p>Before I go on to that, I return to the word \"convenient\", which the minister used and to which <place-holder colnum=\"16063\"/> Linda Fabiani referred in her speech. The DRC said that using the term \"convenient\" to describe access to a building is outmoded. In evidence to the committee, the then minister Hugh Henry said that it was okay to continue to use that term in the new standards because it was used in the Building (Scotland) Act 1959 and was understood as a technical term. I refer ministers to the DRC's evidence that said that if we are updating the standards, we should update the language as well in order to ensure that the terms that we use show fully what they are meant to achieve.</p><p>I want confirmation that the technical standards that we have at the moment will not be reduced when they become functional standards and that the mandatory nature of the standards will be enforceable in law. One of the minister's civil servants said in committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The expanded functional standards will still set a minimum that must be met and that the courts will be able to enforce. That minimum will be no lower than that which we set at present through regulation.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Transport and the Environment Committee</em>, 13 November 2002; c 3690.]</p><p>I want, as do many others, to hear on record from the ministers that that will be the case, because it is important. As both the Disability Rights Commission and Fire Protection Association pointed out, it is much more difficult to remedy accessibility or fire-proofing defects once a building is built than it is to ensure that it is built appropriately by meeting standards as it is built.</p><p>Mention has been made of standards that buildings have to meet in other legislation. That includes part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which will come into force in October 2004 and, in relation to fire safety, the European directive on construction products. If the functional standards in the bill do not meet those minimum standards, the buildings will not meet other legislation.</p><p>I also want assurance that the Building Standards Advisory Committee will include representation from fire authorities and disability groups to ensure that such organisations' concerns are considered.</p><p>In conclusion, I am concerned that much of the legislation's substance will come through regulation and guidance rather than be included in the bill. That presents Parliament with a difficulty in scrutinising and influencing legislation. Again, will the minister assure us that Parliament will be involved in the production of the regulations and guidance? Hugh Henry said that there would be many issues for ministers to deal with, including the appointment of verifiers. Will the minister assure us that Parliament will be part of that process to ensure that when the bill is passed, it works for everybody?</p>", "hdate": "2002-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13284814", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Building (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Nora Radcliffe began by saying that the bill is technical and by implying that it is boring.

The minister said that the bill is not a panacea and, at the Education, Culture and Sport Committee meeting on the bill that I attended, she said that she could not give 100 per cent guarantees on child protection. However, the bill advances our ability to protect children. I take issue with Ian Jenkins on one point. The bill is not about a loss of innocence, but about recognising today's cruel realities. The minister said that she is keen to hear the tenor of the debate. I will reiterate some of the committee's concerns, but the points bear repetition to ensure that the minister recognises that many members are concerned about the issues.</p><p>Voluntary organisations do not have a statutory duty to refer people to the list. My comments are informed by the evidence that the committee took on the issue, but they are also tinged by my experience as a volunteer. I will not go into my experience in a voluntary organisation in great detail, but I will say that we could have done with a lot more help and support at one time.</p><p>There is a lot of talk about the worry that the burden that the bill will put on voluntary organisations will prove to be onerous. Karen Gillon mentioned the SRU and Scottish Swimming. They do not regard the burden as onerous and do not want concern about that to outweigh the bill's intention to protect. The two organisations are doing much of the work anyway, never mind anticipating whether they will have to do it.</p><p>That brings me to the evidence that we have heard about the need for an advisory panel on advice, training and support for organisations. The point is worth reiterating. The minister said that she expects that if organisations do not have a statutory duty, they will see themselves as having a moral duty. That exhortation from the minister lends even more weight to the need for an advisory panel for voluntary organisations.</p><p>Another area that concerns me is the way in which \"child care position\" and \"an institution\" are defined in schedule 2. I do not want to address the large number of such points, but one example from the list in schedule 2 is a hospital that deals mainly with children. In Scotland, there are possibly only three such hospitals, yet clinics, <place-holder colnum=\"15514\"/> health centres, accident and emergency departments and the ambulance service all deal with children when they are most vulnerable. Therefore, we must reconsider the definitions of \"an institution\" and \"child care position\", as they apply to other institutions and positions.</p><p>We have already heard that teachers are covered by the bill, but self-employed tutors are not. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland has raised concern about that, and the matter would bear a little more scrutiny and more definition at stage 2. Folk have said that we do not want to get into too much definition because that allows for loopholes, but the definitions in schedule 2 already leave too many loopholes and loopholes that are too big. It would be worth reviewing the definitions in schedule 2.</p><p>Supported by evidence from ACPOS, I want also to address section 10(5), which is where employers have the defence of whether they reasonably knew that a person was disqualified before they employed them. ACPOS says that a way round that would be to place a duty on employers to check through Disclosure Scotland. If employers did that, that would ensure that they had taken all reasonable steps and followed&#8212;as the minister said&#8212;good practice in employment techniques.</p><p>In her opening remarks, the minister implied that she expected employers to follow the full Disclosure Scotland route. I would like that to be more definite, so that it is not an expectation but a duty. The route works for employers and employees, as it allows employers to cover themselves with the argument that they made all reasonable checks, and ensures that employees, before they are employed, have been fully checked through Disclosure Scotland.</p><p>I am not going to take up my seven minutes, Presiding Officer.</p>", "hdate": "2002-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13283518", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join other members in welcoming the bill as another measure to add to our toolkit of child protection.

In 1999, before the Scottish Parliament election, the SNP proposed using our schools as children's <place-holder colnum=\"14960\"/> centres and opening them for more than eight hours a day to provide facilities for young people. It is increasingly clear that that is an idea whose time has come. Recent research by MORI and the British Market Research Bureau on behalf of the Kids Clubs Network found that one in three 11 to 18-year-olds goes home from school to an empty house and one in four young people admits to hanging around after school with nothing to do. How can we turn our schools into centres where young people want to be not only for their formal education, but for much more of their social education, outside the hours of 9 to 4? I would like the Executive to give such flexibility much more attention.</p><p>That issue came through strongly in Children in Scotland's work with young people for the national debate on education. Young people said that they wanted their schools to be more than educational settings. Until we have a national network of youth clubs, which the minister knows I am always going on about, schools will be the places in which we can offer such provision.</p><p>The minister must think about not only how we use such buildings, but how we fund them. As members know, the public-private partnership method to fund the schools that the Executive proposes to build will cost us an extra &#163;400 million, according to Audit Scotland. That &#163;400 million could have built us another 90-odd schools, which we could have used as children's centres.

It is not only the SNP that has raised issues about the bill. Before the Transport and the Environment Committee could say that it was happy with the <place-holder colnum=\"14752\"/> principles of the bill, it sought reassurances from the Scottish Executive on some main points, one of which was the financial memorandum, which I will return to later. Another point related to the cost-benefit analysis method. The minister has convinced me that the bill could bring great financial and social benefits but the tenor of the debate, especially with regard to the financial memorandum, tells us that he has not yet convinced all the members here or, more important, the stakeholders outwith Parliament on the method by which the cost-benefit analysis will be carried out.</p><p>The committee wanted a clearer understanding that, as this is primarily an enabling bill, the affirmative procedure will be used in relation to the statutory instruments that we are relying on to implement the bill. The minister has come a long way towards that and we look forward to him moving even further at stage 2. However, the committee's report asks not only for the affirmative procedure to be used in relation to the statutory instruments, but for financial memorandums to accompany them. That does not happen as a matter of course at the moment, but given the financial implications of the instruments associated with the bill, we want them to have financial memorandums.</p><p>On participation, I do not think that the minister has come as far as we would have liked him to. Colin Campbell talked about the fact that the notion of participation is mentioned slightly in the bill, but many of us want much more progress in that regard. Making sub-basin advisory groups statutory would go a long way towards reassuring us in that regard.</p><p>The Transport and the Environment Committee, the SNP and others are concerned about the use of derogations. As yet, we have heard no great detail on that issue. We asked for greater detail on the connection costs policy in part 2 of the bill and we have heard from more than one member today about the impact that that could have on small rural developments. The minister has said that he will consult, but telling us that he will consult more does not answer Maureen Macmillan's questions. We need to know the Government's policy on small and rural development connections.</p><p>Des McNulty&#8212;I hate to call him \"Soapy Des\"&#8212;raised SUDS earlier. The minister has not come far enough on that point. We need to know who is responsible for ensuring that we achieve sustainable urban drainage systems.</p><p>A couple of members picked up on my next point. We want to ensure that, when we pass the bill and implement the water framework directive, we have joined-up government. That is a horrible term and we all hate it, but we must consider it. We have heard about the effect that the bill and <place-holder colnum=\"14753\"/> the directive will have on agriculture. That effect means that when the minister talks about strategies for agriculture and about agri-environment subsidies, he must consider everything in the round.</p><p>We heard from Colin Campbell about forestry and how it can help us. We heard about biodiversity. We look for better assurance from the minister that, when we implement the water framework directive, we consider not only its narrow implications&#8212;how it affects water&#8212;but its effect on all his Government's policies to ensure that we have sustainable, joined-up government. We know that the Executive talks about that, but we want it to happen.</p><p>I turn to the biggy that we have all addressed. Actually, there are two biggies: finances and flooding. I will consider finances. The Finance Committee and the Transport and the Environment Committee have criticised the financial memorandum. In fact, paragraph 107 of the Transport and the Environment Committee's stage 1 report makes it clear that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Committee is content to recommend to the Parliament that the general principles of the Bill are agreed to\"</p><p>only</p><p class=\"indent\">\"On the basis that these issues\",</p><p>including the financial memorandum,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"are addressed by the Executive\".</p><p>I will quote from the letter that the minister sent to the committee on 25 October, which I presume to be in the public domain. On giving the committee a robust financial assessment, the minister said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have done that to the fullest extent we can.\"</p><p>He went on to say that the report that WRc prepared, the financial memorandum and his letter of 27 September</p><p class=\"indent\">\"convey all the information that is available.\"</p><p>That is not enough for the Parliament to fulfil its duty of parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive and for members, not only of the Transport and the Environment Committee and the Finance Committee, to ensure that they have complied with their duty to scrutinise the financial memorandum. We are not satisfied with the minister's answers so far. We are not&#8212;and no member should be&#8212;able to vote for the financial memorandum.</p><p>I am sorry that, with only 30 seconds left, I cannot turn to the other biggy&#8212;flooding. The Transport and the Environment Committee and the Parliament will be left with a huge task at stage 2 and in future consideration of the statutory instruments that will enact the bill's provisions.

Low Moss is a category C prison for 300 prisoners.

There are also <place-holder colnum=\"14581\"/> problems with drug taking. If there is a prisoner who wants to come off drugs living with 29 other inmates who may not want to, it is much more difficult for that prisoner to make that decision and stay with it. We heard that in the evidence that the governor gave to the Justice 1 Committee. There are also problems with the bullying and intimidation of prisoners in a dormitory situation.</p><p>One of the things that struck me on a recent visit to Low Moss was that, although the education unit is excellent and its dedicated staff work hard with inmates, inmates can take part in the education programme only when they are in the education unit itself. It is much more difficult to find the peace and quiet to get on with work in a dormitory where there are 29 other inmates.

I intended to make a joke about being there in the very early days of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, when we first began to speak about the issue. That led me to conception and birth, but I did not think that a joke about that was a good idea. I hope that giving birth is not catching.</p><p>Conservative members have raised several questions. We will answer those questions. I know that Cathy Peattie will answer them on behalf of the committee, but I feel that I must review some of the things that Conservative members have said.</p><p>Why do we need a commissioner for children and young people? We need a commissioner because there is no direct or focused way for young people in Scotland to have their voices heard. The views that have been expressed by Conservative members make me realise how important it is to ensure that children are able to make their voices heard in a direct way. The commissioner must have sufficient standing to make the Parliament and all its members listen to what they say on behalf of the young people of Scotland.</p><p>I am proud that in the Parliament's three short years, the Education, Culture and Sport Committee has produced recommendations on how other committees should consult young people. I am pleased that the Scottish Executive has a ministerial task force on children and a national child care strategy. However, none of that takes away from the need to have a focused person with a clearly defined role who will ensure that young people's voices are heard with <place-holder colnum=\"14081\"/> authority.</p><p>Brian Monteith said that MSPs could be commissioners. He had a set-to with Scott Barrie. How many MSPs are approached directly by young people? The majority of young people do not see us as people who will listen and work for them. Many of us try to make a connection with young people but, on the whole, young people have not made such a connection with us. A children and young people's commissioner would fulfil that role, almost on our behalf.</p><p>I hope that a children and young people's commissioner would also be able to scrutinise the issues that young people have. The Conservatives have referred to children as individuals. Children are individuals, but they make up 20 per cent of our society and they bring to our attention a group of issues and problems that it is right to bring to our attention.</p><p>In 1996, the first report on the United Kingdom's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child made some specific criticisms of implementation in the UK. The second report is due shortly. Ten years after the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in this country, we know that the rapporteur will probably make some of the same criticisms again. We will be criticised for still not having proceeded with certain issues. I hope that the children's commissioner will bring focus to whether the work of the Parliament and the Executive complies with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p><p>One issue that has not been mentioned but which I feel quite strongly about is that the existence of the children's commissioner should help to ensure that the Executive and the Parliament produce in an easily accessible format the facts, figures and statistics on what is happening to young people. I know that we are making progress on that issue, but I am sure that if we had a commissioner demanding that, the facts and figures would have to be produced. That issue came to mind when I remembered how, for the Parliament's debate on mental health that took place a good two years ago, I had found it difficult to get statistics on mental health problems for young people and teenagers. Having a children's commissioner for Scotland could help us to achieve that.</p><p>Murdo Fraser said that the commissioner should not get involved in legislation, as that is for the Parliament and for MSPs. I am sorry but, although the Scottish Parliament has a better record on ensuring that our legislation is in some way child proofed, we do not have everything right yet. I hope that a children's commissioner would help us in that respect. The minister referred to child impact statements. When we talk about the <place-holder colnum=\"14082\"/> Parliament equality proofing legislation, the thing that comes to mind is the fact that the Equal Opportunities Committee considers every piece of legislation to see how it impacts on equal opportunities. At the moment, there is nobody anywhere to consider how legislation impacts on young people.

Given the arguments backwards and forwards during last week's debate on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, I am proud that the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, during its consideration of the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Bill, recognised that the bill impacted on young people. We commissioned consultation with the young people. We not only went out to consult the young people but brought them into Parliament in a way that they made them feel comfortable so that they could inform us.</p><p>The report on the stage 1 consideration of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill shows that, of the 59 submissions that were received, only four were from groups that represented young people. Last week's debate did not really take into account young people's views on the bill. Unfortunately, the situation was similar in the Parliament's consideration of the Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>I am glad that Karen Gillon said that the question of which powers were reserved and which were devolved has been dealt with. The commissioner needs to be able to comment on reserved issues because, as we have heard, asylum and social security issues know no boundaries.</p><p>Finally, let me quickly deal with the investigation of individual cases. A few weeks ago, we met Judith Karp, who is the UK rapporteur on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. She told us that it was important that we should not restrict the commissioner's role in such a way that the commissioner was blocked from ever taking up individual cases. We always need to leave a safety net so that, if the appropriate body&#8212;be that <place-holder colnum=\"14083\"/> private or public&#8212;has failed an individual, there is still someone to whom that individual can turn.</p><p>I am glad that the bill to establish a children's commissioner will be introduced. I am especially glad that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will underpin the role of the commissioner for children and young people in Scotland. Introducing such a bill is a public affirmation that the Parliament recognises that young people have a proud place in society in Scotland.

After hearing 15 minutes of his speech, I do not think that the public's confidence will be greatly restored.</p><p>I lived through that nightmare a few weeks ago, as someone who was affected by it, whose neighbours were affected by it, whose family was affected by it and whose constituents were affected by it. I was surrounded by people who did not know whether they could drink the water. Once they knew that they could not drink the water, they were worried about how long they had been drinking the water. That was a huge problem for a huge number of people.</p><p>Let me illustrate how badly the communication side of the outbreak was handled, through my experience as a member of the Parliament. When I phoned Scottish Water's helpline to ask what areas were affected, it took the operators quite a long time to work through postcodes and find out which parts of my constituency were affected. When I asked them whether bottled water would be delivered, they could not tell me. When I asked them where the bowsers would be sited, they could not tell me. When, eventually, I told them that I was an MSP and asked them to take my phone number and phone me back so that I could inform my constituents, they said that they could not do that. Is that the way in which we want to inform the public? It was an abject example of how not to do that.</p><p>We have to move on, and there are three things that we should ensure happen. I am a member of the Transport and the Environment Committee. First, that committee should immediately hold an inquiry into what happened and why it happened. That inquiry should examine the events of the outbreak and the quality of Scotland's water. It should consider whether the legislation that the Parliament has just passed and the bill that the committee has just started to scrutinise are up to delivering a high standard of water. It must reconsider the evidence that we were given that, if we accepted the medium level of investment, we would ensure the production of good quality water <place-holder colnum=\"13308\"/> in Scotland. Perhaps the enhanced option would have meant that we would have got quicker results or that we would achieve levels of water quality above those that are achieved in England rather than below them.</p><p>The inquiry must also consider how quickly things are happening. The minister has talked about the ad hoc reports and we have talked about the OCT report from last November. I live where I have always lived. Five years ago, West of Scotland Water did not know where the pipes from Burncrooks went. Now, in 2002, Scottish Water is saying that it does not know where the pipes from Mugdock go. How many five-year intervals do we have to go through before we can answer such questions?</p><p>Secondly, we need a strong, authoritative and powerful regulator, not a variety of them that would include a drinking water quality regulator and a water industry commissioner. We must have a strong voice and a champion for Scotland's customers, whose priority will be to balance charges against health&#8212;unlike that of the water commissioner who admits that his passion is efficiency rather than public health.</p><p>Thirdly, we must consider legislation. The Transport and the Environment Committee started work this morning on the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Bill. Will the minister take the opportunity that that bill affords to ensure that legislation on notification of, and possible prosecution over, contaminated water in Scotland is brought up to the same level as the legislation in England? If he is not going to take that opportunity, is he going to leave it to the SNP to take it?

Scotland has a reputation for quality and can never compete on the basis of quantity and mass production. Our country must continue to maintain that reputation now and in the future.</p><p>Indeed, that is what our customers want. Supermarkets know that Scottish produce can attract premium product labels and so premium prices. Producers know that Scottish produce is backed up by quality assurance schemes and so they can sell it on for quality-assured prices. In a survey, 79 per cent of 15,000 Europeans said that they did not want to buy genetically modified products. I ask the minister to stop jeopardising Scotland's reputation for quality by carrying out open-air experiments in this country.</p><p>I draw members' attention to a report by Sherwin Shih of Middlesex University entitled \"Regulating the Impacts of Genetically Modified Organisms on the Environment: A UK Perspective\". The report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"These trials follow the bizarre logic of finding out whether it is safe to release something into the environment by releasing it into the environment.\"</p><p>That is hardly a precautionary approach.</p><p>We need an evidence-based approach. I ask about the evidence behind the Executive's amendment. Despite what it says, there has been no \"step by step\" process in Scotland. We already have field-scale trials and flowering GM crops in Scotland, and are currently releasing genetically modified organisms into the Scottish environment. <place-holder colnum=\"12316\"/></p><p>Moreover, as the Minister for Environment and Rural Development made clear in a letter to the Transport and the Environment Committee, the crops are not being monitored for their effects on public health. I repeat my question: where is the evidence to back up the Executive's amendment?</p><p>Although the whole argument has been raging in the Parliament for many years, feelings have been running particularly high in the past three to four weeks in the Transport and the Environment Committee. Mr Finnie has insisted throughout that he has used scientific evidence in deciding to allow field-scale trials to go ahead, but he has ignored scientific evidence of gene flow between GM crops and others; of viable pollen transfer up to 5km; and of loss of biodiversity and organic status. I wonder how many members know that any organic product that they buy nowadays can be certified as only 99 per cent GM-free. Because of cross-contamination, we can no longer certify that our organic produce is 100 per cent GM-free.</p><p>There is much more scientific evidence that I would like to bring before the chamber. Members of the Transport and the Environment Committee know that I have already produced a large number of scientific articles, which the minister seems content to continue to ignore. Today, I would like to bring a few of them to the attention of members who might not be aware of the weight of scientific evidence that supports my motion.</p><p>One of the articles is Jorgensen and Andersen's 1994 paper in the <em>American Journal of Botany</em>, \"Spontaneous hybridization between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and weedy B. campestris: A risk of growing genetically modified oilseed rape.\" Another is Jim Orson's 2002 study, \"Gene stacking and herbicide tolerant oilseed rape: lessons from the North American experience\". I also draw the minister's attention to the European Environment Agency's report, which he says means nothing. It has 233 references at the end, drawing our attention to the scientific problems associated with growing GM crops in the environment. That report was dismissed by the minister and his advisers at the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment, who claimed that it said nothing new, despite its referring to 233 items of scientific research.</p><p>That brings me to ACRE, upon whose experts the minister relies heavily. Perhaps members should be aware that eight of the 13 original members of ACRE had links to the biotechnology industry. The minister will probably be delighted to tell me, \"But those eight people have now been replaced.\" However, those eight were in place when the Munlochy application was passed to the minister for consent.</p><p>ACRE's remit does not cover strategic, ethical or public acceptability issues. ACRE itself accepts <place-holder colnum=\"12317\"/> that its advice is not the only advice that ministers need consider. I have already quoted in Parliament from a letter of 31 July 2001 from Adrian Butt of the ACRE secretariat, and I shall quote it again:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Ministers are not obliged to take ACRE's advice nor is the Committee's advice the only consideration for ministers when issuing a consent.\"</p><p>So what powers does the minister have to protect Scotland's environmental future? I would like to take members through the three powers that the minister could have used and could still use today.</p><p>Article 4 of the 90/220/EEC directive states that member states must</p><p class=\"indent\">\"ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment\".</p><p>That brings me back to the Shih report. How can the minister be sure that all appropriate measures have been taken when he is releasing crops into the environment to find out what happens? The minister himself has told us that the Munlochy experiment is not assessing the effects on human health. Munlochy is simply a trial to see how farmers manage the crops. It is not a trial of their effect on the environment or on human health. The trials must stop now before they damage the environment and public health.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13275164", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Genetically Modified Crops"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At the outset, I want to make it clear that we are debating the future quality of Scotland's agriculture, produce and environment.

When I saw it in the business bulletin, I thought that the Government might give us its targets at last. We have been waiting for those targets since the Executive published its waste strategy in 1999. Three years on, the minister says to us, \"Maybe by Christmas, maybe by the end of the year I will give you some targets.\" We are having a very short debate on a very important topic, but we are not moving the issue on one iota.</p><p>The topic is very important. It is estimated that each household in Scotland produces 1 tonne of rubbish per annum&#8212;an enormous amount. As the minister pointed out, something like 94 per cent of that household rubbish goes straight into holes in the ground. That is not a sustainable way to manage our country's waste. It raises health concerns, of which I am sure the minister is aware. At least two reports have been produced recently on the effect that living near a landfill site has on health, especially the health of children. That is one of the drivers for saying that we must move on from landfill. There are also many worries about environmental degradation and damage, with leachates from landfill sites going into our water courses.</p><p>It is not only an important topic, but an urgent one. The landfill directive has to be met by 2010, which is less than eight years away. The minister and his colleagues have been the Government for three years, but we have not moved forward at all, so how can we expect him to make such a huge leap in the next eight years?</p><p>The Lothian and Borders draft area waste plan states:<place-holder colnum=\"12055\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"By 2020, municipal solid waste in the Lothians and Borders could increase by 60%\".</p><p>For that reason, we cannot keep putting things off, talking about next year or next month. We are already living with the consequences of failing to understand the EC directive on fridges: we have a fridge mountain.</p><p>I ask the minister a simple question: with the commitment to waste minimisation and to moving away from landfill, why is Scottish Enterprise not actively seeking to support facilities here in Scotland in order to deal with those fridges? We have a nonsensical, absurd situation in which fridges are sent from, I think, either Aberdeen City Council or Aberdeenshire Council down to Manchester, but not to be disposed of&#8212;simply to be stored.

Unfortunately, it had to be cancelled after the tragic events of 11 September last year. Those tragic events led to a new political climate and to new political tensions throughout the world. In that new political climate, it is even more important that young people's voices are heard.</p><p>Conflict affects young people in many ways. Conflict affects young people directly&#8212;it kills them. Conflict bereaves young people when their parents and relatives are killed. In too many instances around the world, it directly affects young people and children who are enlisted as soldiers. If listening to young people is accepted and becomes the norm, we will not forget in times of stress and chaos that we should listen to young people and that they should be heard.</p><p>The UN special session in two weeks' time, from 8 to 10 May, should be considered the norm. At that special session, young people will sit alongside heads of state, heads of Government and Nelson Mandela. We hope that, at the end of the special session, the heads of state will ratify the statement, \"A world fit for children.\" The statement has been prepared with input from young people all round the world.</p><p>It is appropriate for the Parliament to thank Save the Children for its preparatory work in Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"11225\"/> through its video and information pack, which allowed organisations to help young people to express their opinions. Save the Children will pass those opinions on to the UN special session. Save the Children will also further reinforce that when it holds its special link-up in Edinburgh on 9 May, when young people from throughout Scotland will talk to our young representative at the special session, Ellen. That will ensure that the discussion is informed from Scotland and that the discussion informs our thoughts in Scotland.</p><p>In 1990, a world summit was held on children's issues. Scotland can do better. We should not have to wait 12 years while the world thinks about holding another summit or special session. I hope that the minister will agree with me and many of the members who will speak that the Parliament should have an annual report&#8212;a state of the nation statement&#8212;of what the Parliament has done for young people and what it proposes to do. In addition to an annual report and an annual debate on that report, I hope that we will hold an annual meeting with the young people of Scotland, at which they can say, \"You've got the statistics and the facts, now hear what we've got to say and our report card on what the Scottish Parliament is doing each year for the people of Scotland.\" It is sad that Scotland still has to do better. In 1995, a report was published on the UK's&#8212;I admit that it was not entirely Scotland's&#8212;contribution to and compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I will highlight from that report three issues on which the UK and Scotland fall down in their compliance with the convention&#8212;physical punishment, immigration and asylum policies and the age of criminal responsibility. We must do more. The best thing that we can do to ensure that those three issues and others are dealt with is fully to sign up to and implement article 12 of the convention.</p><p>Article 12 says that we must listen to young people, but we must go further than that. We must act on what young people tell us are their concerns. Young people have made their views on some matters clear. The 1995 report to which I referred pointed out our lack of provision for ending the physical punishment of children. The Parliament is engaging in a debate on the Executive's proposals to end smacking, with some provisos. In Save the Children's consultation on the Executive's proposals, more than three quarters of young people said that smacking is unacceptable.</p><p>The cross-party group on children and young people has held consultation events with young people. A theme that has run through those events is that young people say, \"We need somewhere to go. We need somewhere that is our space.\" I would like the minister to say that he has not only <place-holder colnum=\"11226\"/> listened to those young people, but acted on what they have said and will produce a strategy on the provision of what we might call youth cafes for the young people of Scotland.</p><p>I commend to the minister the 76 Church of Scotland children's forums, which were established recently. Those forums are for eight to 14-year-old members of the Church of Scotland. The forums allow their members to get together to discuss what they want their church to do.

The minister asked whether we welcome the deal. I have pushed and pushed on the issue and the Executive has moved and moved, so of course we welcome it. However, the problem is that it takes us back to special pleading. Two members have talked about hospices. Because of the special pleading on hospices, the Executive said at stage 2 that Malcolm Chisholm would ensure that the money that hospices receive from the Government covered water charges. Do we have to keep making special pleas for different charities? The new hardship fund is a case of more special pleading, making more special cases and having charities tied up in bureaucracy to plead with the Executive to pay their water bills. It is not appropriate and it is not right that we ask charities to do that.</p><p>Amendment 1 is not ideal, although we will support it because it is better than nothing. However, the issue is not conservation and the amendment will affect disproportionately charities that need to use water to deliver their services, such as hospices. We cannot support amendment 102 because fee-paying schools are not just private schools. The seven grant-maintained schools&#8212;Donaldson's College, the Craighalbert Centre, the Royal Blind School and so on&#8212;are charities that provide a national service.

If the commissioner is to be the customers' champion, as we hope he will be, he must surely take on board customers' views on charges, as charging is one of the most fundamental activities that Scottish Water will undertake for each of its customers. Even if the water industry commissioner is simply to be an economic regulator&#8212;I say that because, when the committee took evidence at stage 1, and again during stage 2, the ministers referred to the water industry commissioner as an \"economic regulator\"&#8212;he should take on board customers' concerns, as the deputy minister conceded during stage 2. The water industry commissioner is to be the customers' champion and is to be concerned with customers' interests, so it is important that the commissioner takes cognisance, through the water customer consultation panels, of customers' views, because it is a fundamental fact that charges will affect them economically. If the water industry commissioner had to seek approval for charges through the customer consultation panels, that would strengthen his advice.</p><p>Amendment 88 is about publication of the charges schemes. It should be an absolute given that every customer has access to the full contents of a charges scheme, not just to an amended or an abbreviated version.

They will wonder what the minister, the water industry commissioner or Scottish Water is trying to hide from them.</p><p>Amendment 89 relates to section 32, on the commissioner's advice on charges.

It is important that the Scottish Parliament takes this opportunity to show that recycling, sustainable employment and so on are not woolly concepts, but realities. If we invest in those areas now, Scotland will reap the economic and environmental benefits.</p><p>Members will not be surprised that I start my speech by giving some statistics from abroad. As everyone knows, the SNP likes to benchmark Scotland as an independent country against other independent countries.</p><p>Before that, however, I will deal with some information from the UK. Waste Watch, an organisation that is sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has said that if we can increase the amount of recycled waste to 30 per cent, we could produce 45,000 <place-holder colnum=\"5725\"/> jobs. There are only 17,700 jobs in waste management at the moment. That shows that sustainable employment based on environmental practice can reap rewards.</p><p>In Denmark, 35 companies recycle 60 per cent of the country's domestic waste. Scotland could do with having 35 long-term, sustainable companies. In New York, a recent study on waste management found that a move to composting and recycling would create 890 permanent jobs as opposed to 350 in conventional incineration and landfill practices. The Bureau of International Recycling tells us that, in 50 countries across the world, 1.5 million people are employed in recycling activities. That business has a $1.6 billion annual turnover. Those statistics show that it is possible to invest in environmentally safe practices and produce sound and sustainable employment.</p><p>International comparisons are all very well, but I want to highlight a well-respected local organisation that, in two weeks' time, will tackle the problem that Andrew Welsh raised: the de-gassing of fridges. As we know, from 1 January this year, the process became much more complicated because of European Community regulations. I did extensive research before 1 January and found out that there is no facility in the UK that is capable of de-gassing fridges to conform with the EC regulations. On Monday, I visited Remploy in Clydebank and was told that, in two weeks' time, the new Remploy site that the First Minister opened in Wishaw will start to de-gas fridges from local authorities, beginning with South Lanarkshire Council. Remploy has seen an environmental opportunity and is using it to create sustainable jobs.</p><p>That is not the only good news that I heard on my visit to Remploy. I was also told that the company hopes to open new sites in the north and the north-west of Scotland. That particularly excites me because Aberdeenshire Council recently told me that, from 1 January, the only thing that it could do with its old fridges was send them to Manchester for storage. It is absolutely fantastic that a local organisation will provide sustainable employment in environmental management practices in Scotland.</p><p>Remploy has based the scheme on a previous scheme that it ran in Leeds that was worth &#163;500,000 and employed 35 people. That scheme involved working in partnership with Comet to recycle white goods by passing them on to needy communities. That is the sort of sustainable employment that we must have in this country.</p><p>Sustainable employment is good for the environment. Recycling paper produces 35 per cent less water pollution and 74 per cent less air pollution than making paper by conventional methods.<place-holder colnum=\"5726\"/></p><p>With regard to the Government's record, I am sure that Labour and Liberal Democrat members are aware of last year's report card from WWF, which said that, in nearly three years of Labour government in Scotland, there has been no progress toward placing sustainable development at the heart of the Executive's plans. How often has the ministerial group on sustainable development met in the past three years? What has it done?</p><p>We have, in Scotland, an unsustainable industry that provides unsustainable jobs: nuclear power generation. It has a limited lifespan&#8212;our three power stations will be gone by 2015&#8212;but the lifespan of the deadly radioactive waste that it leaves behind is unlimited. Does the Government support new build in that unsustainable industry?</p><p>Germany has shown that it is possible to help create sustainable employment in environmental industries with the help of interest rates and investment subsidies to companies.

Is the minister prepared to put his money where his mouth is?</p><p>I move amendment S1M-2635.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and agrees that these objectives, amongst others, should be considered for inclusion in a national environment plan for Scotland.\"</p>", "hdate": "2002-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13265207", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Environmentally Sustainable Employment and Recycling"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the minister said, we must congratulate Robin Harper on securing the debate.

I am an associate member of the Library Association.</p><p>I thank the many members who signed my motion and who are in the chamber. I also thank the many people in the gallery who have lobbied long and hard about the crisis that faces science and business information in Scotland today.</p><p>The Scottish science library opened in 1989 to international acclaim but, without Executive intervention, it will close in 48 hours. Tonight is the last late opening of the library. Staff and users are, I know, watching us on the webcast. Why is the Scottish science library being closed? It is all for the paltry sum of &#163;400,000. I call that a paltry sum because it pales into insignificance when we consider the &#163;3 million that Scottish Opera was given as a bail-out with hardly the bat of an eyelid. The underfunding of the National Library of Scotland is a national disgrace. For 2001-02, its budget is &#163;9.2 million. That is in an era in which library inflation is running at 10 per cent to 15 per cent per annum.</p><p>I move on from talking about money&#8212;I will return to it&#8212;to talking about the importance not only of the Scottish science library and the Scottish business information service but of libraries in general. As a librarian, I feel that I must inform the chamber of that because of preconceptions about what libraries are. Libraries are not only book deposits and the National Library is not just the biggest and bestest book collection in Scotland&#8212;libraries are gateways for information.</p><p>If we want to live in a Scotland that is part of the knowledge economy and in which information is open and accessible, we can say only that it is a national disgrace that we underfund our national <place-holder colnum=\"5005\"/> library service to the extent that we are about to lose the Scottish science library and the Scottish business information service. The Scottish science library and the Scottish business information service are key to the promotion of Scotland as a knowledge economy. It is not only librarians and I who believe that; the Government believes that science and business are key to the promotion of Scotland. Over the past two years, we have seen strategy after strategy from the Executive. We have science strategies. We have knowledge management strategies. We have digital Scotland strategies. We have enterprise strategies. I will quote from \"A Science Strategy for Scotland \", which was published this summer. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"<strong>the Executive will:</strong></p><p><ul> <li> promote Scotland as a <strong> centre of scientific excellence </strong> in which to buy or do science\". </li> </ul> </p><p>Those are fine words, but words mean nothing when we cannot support scientists in their work and we cannot support businessmen in their exploitation of that scientific research.</p><p>The Scottish science library and the Scottish business information service have 26 per cent of the National Library of Scotland's readers. That gives the lie to the information that has been put out that those services are peripheral parts of the core service, which is the National Library of Scotland. One in four users of the National Library of Scotland has a scientific or business background. One in four users of the National Library of Scotland uses it for scientific and business information. In addition, the social science collection of the National Library of Scotland is held in the Causewayside building and 21 per cent of the National Library of Scotland's readers are social scientists. All that means that almost half the users of the National Library of Scotland use the Scottish science library in Causewayside. It is inconceivable that almost half the library's users are not core users of that library. Those users should have their service preserved for them.</p><p>Last year alone, the Scottish science library dealt with 17,000 inquiries. Those were 17,000 inquiries from scientists and businessmen who want to develop in Scotland and export from Scotland. Without the Scottish science library and the Scottish business information service, those 17,000 inquiries would not have been answered as fully as they were. It is only with full information and the back-up of subject specialists that we will provide the service that those businesses and scientists deserve.</p><p>Business in Scotland is something that we all promote&#8212;not just the Executive, but every member of the Parliament. Scottish Enterprise, through its small business gateways, acknowledges the fact that businesses need <place-holder colnum=\"5006\"/> information. Those small business gateways often refer users to the Scottish business information service because of the specialist knowledge that is kept there.</p><p>The incubation period of a small business is most vital in ensuring that small business's longevity. If we close the services, we will cut off a vital source of information, which nourishes those businesses at their most important time&#8212;their start-up period.</p><p>I refer briefly to the manner in which the information about the Scottish science library and business information service has come out. The National Library of Scotland's board of trustees ignored its own consultant's report. The consultant's report did not say that the Scottish science library should be closed, but the board of trustees chose to ignore that fact. They have not just ignored the Scottish science library's advisory committee, they have disbanded it. In a letter of 2 October, Professor Anderson announced to members of the advisory committee that they should not turn up for a meeting on 25 October, because the advisory committee no longer had a role to play as there was not going to be a Scottish science library. That is appalling.</p><p>The Executive's answer to the crisis has also been appalling. Allan Wilson said in the cultural strategy debate of 25 October that the alternatives that were being proposed were sufficient; they are not. From a specialist staff of 13, only two business specialists and one scientific specialist will be transferred to the reading room on George IV Bridge. Is that what we as a nation consider to be adequate support for business and science in Scotland today?</p><p>I have a few questions for the minister. I say to his deputy that she, as a scientist, knows that the Scottish science library service is vital. To the minister I say that he has the power to do something. His deputy signed Robin Harper's motion, which decried the science library's closure. I hope that the minister will use his power to ensure that the library will not close. He need not sign his name to a motion&#8212;he has the power to do something about the matter.</p><p>The sum we are talking about is &#163;400,000, which is less than 1 per cent of the minister's annual budget for all the national institutions. I ask the minister how much end-year flexibility he got this year. Could not he have used that to buy time to conduct a full-scale review of the National Library of Scotland's funding to ensure that the Scottish science library was kept open in the interim? It is laudable that he found &#163;5.7 million to abolish entrance fees to museums. For the sake of &#163;400,000, he is about to prevent access to the core collection of scientific literature in Scotland. I ask the minister to talk to the Minister for <place-holder colnum=\"5007\"/> Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning. This is not just a cultural issue; it is also an enterprise and science issue.</p><p>Surely the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport and his deputy, between the two departments that are covered by their portfolios, can find the paltry sum that is needed to save a vital institution.</p>", "hdate": "2001-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13263229", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Science Library and Scottish Business Information Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I open my remarks by declaring a registered interest, because I will talk about libraries.

That is what Unison is asking for. I take the minister back to the Strathclyde referendum, when 97 per cent of the people of Strathclyde said clearly that the water authority must remain a public body.</p><p>Another area of the bill that we must consider more carefully at stage 2 is debt and charges. We have heard about the &#163;1.9 billion debt that Scottish Water will carry over. Why cannot we <place-holder colnum=\"4589\"/> have the green dowry for our &#163;1.9 billion of debt that the English authority had for its &#163;9 billion debt? A &#163;700 million commutation a few years ago is not the same as getting rid of &#163;1.9 billion of debt. The point of carrying the debt is that the Treasury wins and customers end up paying higher charges. Getting rid of the debt is about ensuring that everyone pays as little as possible.</p><p>I turn to relief for voluntary organisations. Ross Finnie did not just prevaricate in his replies to some interventions, but tended towards obfuscation. At the end of one of the minister's replies I was unsure whether he was saying that under section 37 of the bill the Executive would ensure reduced charges or relief for voluntary organisations. We have heard from the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the churches and Women's Aid, and members have given examples of how crippling to charities in Scotland will be the loss of relief. If the minister believes in the compact with the voluntary sector and in social justice, he must tell us that there will be relief for charities in Scotland.</p><p>Jobs is another area of concern. We could lose one sixth to one third of the work force. Adam Ingram gave clear evidence of the catastrophic effect that such huge losses would have on the industry. We want Scottish Water to be an industry that is fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We do not want it to be stripped of skills and jobs, as Railtrack and Transco were. The same thing happened to Welsh Water, which went in a matter of years from having 1,000 employees to having 100 employees.</p><p>Democracy is one of the other elements about which the SNP and the general public are greatly concerned. Scottish Water will be the biggest quango in Scotland and we must ensure that all appointments to the non-executive board and the appointments of convener of the customer panels and the water industry commissioner are approved by the Parliament.

They are about this Parliament's power to deal with GM crop field trials under the EC directive 90/220/EEC, which Andy Kerr mentioned. My colleague Bruce Crawford will deal with recommendation 63, which is about a separate Scottish advisory body.</p><p>As Andy Kerr said, GM crop trials are of huge interest to the public. That is primarily because genetic modification is a new science, which has not only the potential to produce enormous benefits for agriculture in this country, but the potential to endanger human and environmental health. That is why the public is interested in GM crops and has concerns about them. The committee's report is timely and its recommendations should be accepted by the Government. The Parliament should be aware of people's concerns and should accept the recommendations of the committee to show the Scottish people that we understand their concerns.</p><p>Recommendations 25 and 35 rest upon the interpretation of the EC directive. The Scottish Executive has said that it cannot restrict GM crop field trials, because the directive requires that Governments should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"not unnecessarily restrict the release of GM crops if the release was safe for human health and the environment.\"<place-holder colnum=\"330\"/></p><p>The key point is whether at this time GM crop releases are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"safe for human health and the environment.\"</p><p>Andy Kerr alluded to the fact that there is not a consensus view on the safety of GM crops within the committee, society in general or the scientific community. A quick scan of the enormous amount of literature on the safety of GM crops will back up that view. For example, the Royal Society of Canada's expert panel examined this issue&#8212;Canada is the third largest GM crop-planting nation on the planet&#8212;and concluded that there was no full evidence that GM crops did not cause harm. Dr Ulrich Loening told the committee that there has been insufficient research on the long-term effects of GM crops. Furthermore, a British Medical Association report entitled \"The Impact of Genetic Modification on Agriculture, Food and Health\", which was published in 1999, contained 19 recommendations, including a moratorium on GM commercial planting and the statement that there should be no releases of GM material into the environment.</p><p>It is therefore important to point out that, instead of ensuring the safety of GM releases, the Scottish Executive is looking for a supposed lack of evidence of harm. Any approach should be the other way around; safety should come first.</p><p>I will turn from the consideration of the scientific arguments to a further investigation of the EC directive. Article 4 of the directive states that Governments must</p><p class=\"indent\">\"ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the deliberate release ... of GMOs\"</p><p>which can be interpreted to mean that safety must come first.</p><p>The SNP believes that article 4 enables the Parliament to prevent GM crop field trials.

Sustainable development applies to debates too. I will follow up Murray Tosh's concluding remarks by saying why the debate is important. We can relate the debate to real lives by considering current events, such as yesterday's weather chaos. Many weather patterns that we suffer nowadays can be attributed to climate change. Furthermore, the introduction of industrial practices into a natural process could be part of the explanation&#8212;although it is not entirely to blame&#8212;for the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. Just last night, I learned that 70 per cent of food in the United Kingdom is produced on only 20 per cent of farms. Society is turning its back on nature, <place-holder colnum=\"50\"/> and nature is giving us our due.</p><p>We must go beyond words and ensure that action is taken. Several members have discussed many of the Government's commitments, so I will not go into great detail on them. The advisory group on sustainable development's 10-point action plan was also mentioned. It was encouraging to hear that&#8212;two years after that plan was produced&#8212;the Government will finally take up most of those 10 points.</p><p>\"Making it work together\" and \"Working together for Scotland\" referred to sustainable development. We have heard that the Executive has a commitment to sustainable development and that that is central to its policies, particularly on transport and the environment. That was in \"Making it work together\", which was published in September 1999. That document preceded the Transport (Scotland) Bill, which the SNP and the Green party tried to amend to embed in it sustainable development in transport. The Executive refused to accept that change.</p><p>If the Executive says that it is committed to sustainable development then fails to put those words into practice when it has the opportunity, that tells us that the Executive believes in words rather than action. Today, the minister said that sustainable development would be embedded as a central policy of the Government. I am pleased to hear that, but I hope that that was not another of the minister's technical terms, like those that he used this morning when he gave evidence to the Transport and the Environment Committee. I hope that we get action, rather than embedding Government commitments.</p><p>Many members referred to the ministerial working group and asked questions about it. They asked about when it has met, what it has done and when the Parliament will hear about it. It is essential that members become part of that process and hear what is happening. Talking about a ministerial working group on sustainable Scotland but not reporting to Parliament on it shows that the Executive is all talk and no action.</p><p>What happened at that ministerial working group in regard to the indicators that we are all waiting for? We have heard how long we have had to wait for those indicators. Today, the minister came close to telling us that we might get 40 indicators and that we might get them some time. We would like to know when we are going to get them and what they will be. We want to know whether the ministerial working group has provided guidance on how business in Scotland should take sustainable development into account in its everyday working practices.</p><p>I was surprised that no other member raised the Friends of the Earth Scotland report card, which I <place-holder colnum=\"51\"/> am sure we all received today and which would not make happy reading for the minister. I pick a few issues that have been given unhappy, unsmiley faces. Mixed waste incineration for energy has been discussed, and it is accepted that that is not a sustainable way of producing energy, yet it is still under consideration in the renewables obligation (Scotland) consultation. The SNP will say no to mixed waste incineration as a form of renewable energy.</p><p>The FOES report card talks about indicators&#8212;almost everyone has raised that issue today. The SNP amendment is there to ensure that we have a timetable, and that we no longer talk about or fantasise about indicators but produce them. That will mean that we get some work done. In government, the SNP would take that further. We would say that we should start with an audit of the environmental practices in this country, at the end of which we would produce a national environment plan, which would include indicators, targets and the dates by which we would achieve those targets. We could easily put \"Must do better\" at the end of the FOES report card. We must set dates and targets. We have to act now for the future, not in the future when it is too late.</p><p>The Tory amendment talks about further consultation. The SNP would say, \"We are sorry&#8212;we want action, not further consultation.\" Murray Tosh talked about the minister repackaging. We do not need more repackaging&#8212;we need action and we need it now. I was surprised that the targets in Robin Harper's amendment were not more ambitious, although he upped the ante on them in his speech. Scotland could be far more ambitious in the targets it sets. On the motion, I am sorry, but no commendation can be given for lots of words and no action. There is no amendment from the Liberals. I presume that, in their sustainable fashion, they will vote for the Government's motion. However, George Lyon spoke to our amendment, so we could look forward to the support of the Liberals for it in the vote.</p>", "hdate": "2001-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13246285", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sustainable Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Certainly.

I am afraid that, with members' permission, I will quote many facts and figures, as it is important to realise how many young people are affected by those problems.<place-holder colnum=\"1388\"/></p><p>In 1998-99, 1,228 young people were referred to the children's reporter for alcohol, drugs or solvent abuse. Of the 1,193 who were referred for alcohol and drugs misuse, 17 per cent were then referred on to a hearing; 9 per cent were given voluntary support; and 74 per cent received no intervention. That 74 per cent represents 882 young people who, although identified as at risk, received no help at all. How did such a situation happen?</p><p>That might have happened because one of the grounds for referral to a children's hearing is that the hearing must include positively beneficial outcomes for the child. Sadly, it has been accepted that the children's hearings system cannot always have such positively beneficial outcomes. The principal reporter of the Scottish Children's Reporter Association, Alan Miller, has identified one of the problems as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the low availability at present of drug treatment services dedicated to the under-16 age group\".</p><p>I have raised the issue before in parliamentary debates and, a year on, I see no great evidence that the Government has supported enough specific projects for young people under the age of 16 suffering from drug, alcohol and solvent misuse.</p><p>Many mental health problems among young people exhibit themselves in such misuse. In 1998, there were 114 suicides in the nought-to-24 age group, which is a dreadful figure for Scotland. In 1997-98, there were 15,025 NHS attendances for child and adolescent psychiatric hospital appointments but, in that period, only 100 day-patient beds were available in Scotland for child and adolescent psychiatric patients. That figure has risen since 1997-98 to 108 day-care beds, but that is still only 108 beds for 15,025 NHS attendances. We must recognise and examine the problem, and we must ensure that the means are made available to tackle it.</p><p>I highlight an innovative cross-sectoral project that is exactly what we are talking about today&#8212;the mental health development fund initiative for looked-after children and young people in East Dunbartonshire. In 1997, a one-year pilot project was set up with &#163;140,000 to cater for 200 young people who were looked after or accommodated. It was supported by East Dunbartonshire Council, Greater Glasgow Health Board and the NHS mental health trust in the area, in an excellent example of cross-sectoral working. Sadly, that pilot scheme ended at the beginning of this year. The internal evaluation of that project states that residential staff and foster carers benefited immensely and were able to deliver higher-quality care by having consultation with mental health professionals who were able to inform and, crucially, to legitimise their practice. The evaluation also stated that it was hoped that, if the <place-holder colnum=\"1389\"/> project could be sustained and further developed, it might provide a Scottish demonstration site for a mental health vision for looked-after and accommodated young people. That is most important in East Dunbartonshire, with Kenmuir St Mary's School, which is the national secure care unit for young people.</p><p>I end my speech with a plea to the minister. The project has approached the Scottish Executive for funding for an external evaluation, to ensure that it can become a national demonstration project. I ask the minister to ensure that the project receives that funding.</p>", "hdate": "2001-02-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13246125", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: First Minister's Question Time &#8212; Scottish Executive: Scottish Qualifications Authority"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This afternoon, I will raise the issue of teenagers, who form an often forgotten group within the designation of children and young people.

Numerous academic studies support that. There are also international comparisons with countries such as Denmark, which Robin Harper made. Denmark employs 15,000 people in renewables. Scotland also has a track record in renewable energy engineering, such as the wind turbines that are made by James Howden &amp; Co Ltd in Glasgow and the ducks for wave power that were invented by Professor Stephen Salter&#8212;professor of engineering at the University of Edinburgh. We should remember that track record and progress it, rather than do what we have done in the past.</p><p>There are lots of different renewable energy sources that we must examine. There is hydroelectric, in which we also have a track record. Sadly, in recent years, it has been starved <place-holder colnum=\"1051\"/> of finances and almost of a future. I hope that the minister will, when he winds up, make a commitment that hydroelectric schemes will be eligible for grants under the ROS scheme, especially for refurbishment schemes.</p><p>Let us consider the energy that could be produced from different renewable energy sources. Hydroelectricity in Scotland could produce capacity equivalent to 250MW. It currently accounts for 11 per cent of capacity, but it could be a great deal more.</p><p>Onshore wind could produce 420MW, offshore wind could produce 200MW, wave power could produce 200MW and I could list other energies. By 2010, we could produce 50 per cent of our energy in Scotland from renewable energy.</p><p>If we put that against a background of a plan to increase coal generation of electricity by 1,200MW within 10 years, it is clear that renewable energy can produce what we need and that it can produce it more cleanly. We should put our energies into that.</p><p>As Scotland has greater potential for renewable energy, the SNP believes that we should set greater targets. We owe that to ourselves and to the environment. The UK's target of 10 per cent is miserly compared with targets throughout the European Community. The Scottish Executive's target of 18 per cent&#8212;starting from a base of 13 per cent&#8212;is not very exciting. The EC has set a target of 22.1 per cent but, given the figures that I have quoted, the SNP would set a target of providing 25 per cent of electricity from renewable energy by 2010; we could easily achieve that target.</p><p>We can achieve the target only if we accept that there are Scottish solutions to Scottish problems. A lot of the effort that is going into renewable energy is about large-scale production. That has its place, but Scotland is a small country so we should concentrate on small-scale solutions.</p><p>The problems with the grid have been mentioned. My colleague, Kenny MacAskill, will address those. One of the ways round the problem is local production of renewable energies for local consumption. That would not only contribute to meeting renewable energy targets, it would take us into the ecological and environmental argument that small is beautiful. Farmers could harvest energy and fabrication yards could build plant for renewable energy production, as Robin Harper said.</p>", "hdate": "2001-02-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13245085", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was clear from Robin Harper's opening speech that the debate is not only about renewable energy, but about Scotland's future and environment.

I will introduce another country into the debate, as Jim Norton told us that Norway was the world leader in e-business&#8212;not the United States but Norway, which is the same size as Scotland and which is on the geographical periphery, just like Scotland. I ask ministers whether Scotland can emulate Norway and whether the framework will put Scotland in front, instead of playing catch-up.</p><p>We must consider what the Government has done in two crucial areas over the past 18 months. <place-holder colnum=\"588\"/></p><p>I bring members back to digital Scotland, which is an area that I constantly mention in debates in the Parliament. I make no apology for that. If we do not achieve digital Scotland, we will not do e-business this year, next year or in 10 years' time. I remind the chamber that we debated digital Scotland more than a year ago. Six months later, in May 2000, a task force report on digital Scotland was published. Four months later, on 14 September, we had the Executive's response to the digital Scotland task force report: the Executive agreed to all 68 recommendations.</p><p>But where are we, what have we done and what has the Government achieved a year after the debate? Even the framework document mentions broadband provision, when it says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is already a consensus that investment in high quality broadband telecommunications throughout Scotland would be an important contributor to the building of a knowledge-based economy.\"</p><p>But where is that broadband provision? Where is Scotland's direct access to the north Atlantic cable, which would allow broadband communications throughout Scotland? The south-east of England has such direct access, but Scotland does not. Where is the feasibility study into broadband communications for Scottish schools? That study was due to be published at the end of September, but we have heard nothing. It goes on and on. We must ensure that we achieve and do not just talk. We have a wonderful glossy document, but we need the action and we cannot keep waiting for it.</p><p>One of the key points that the digital Scotland task force and the knowledge economy action group talked about was leadership for digital Scotland and for the e-economy. They talked about energetic leadership and about appointing a Scottish e-envoy and a Scottish Cabinet minister for the information age strategy. I refer the minister to recommendation 17 of the digital Scotland task force report. Where is that person? Where is the leadership?</p><p>Without wanting to get too personal, Peter Peacock has been the minister responsible for digital Scotland. If we were conducting a performance review and were measuring Peter's application to digital Scotland in the past year, we would have to question his results. Where is the action plan that the EU said that we should have produced by June 1999? We need action and we need it now.</p><p>In closing, I was going to say to Wendy Alexander, \"Wendy, we need action and I hope you'll lead it.\" However, given her responses to some of the questions that were put to her earlier, I am very disappointed that our minister is someone who thinks that three months' work is sustainable employment for young people and that <place-holder colnum=\"589\"/> words, not funding, are the way of achieving an e-Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13240051", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Any framework for economic development at the beginning of the 21 st century must give due cognisance to the fact that future development will be based on e-business and e-commerce, both of which will grow from the knowledge society.

We have an aging population. Medical advances keep many of us alive much longer than was previously the case. However, those medical advances bring their own problems in the need for palliative care at the end of life. We must be careful not to medicalise the end of life.

I am therefore delighted that today the minister emphasised the needs of our children and young people. I am pleased that members welcomed the points that Irene Oldfather made and I am sure that the minister will take them on board.<place-holder colnum=\"543\"/></p><p>I would like to concentrate on three areas in which the health of young people is a problem. Yesterday and today we heard the dreadful statistics on teenage pregnancy in Scotland. We have the highest level of teenage pregnancy in Europe. We heard that there are 9,000 teenage pregnancies every year, more than 4,000 of which end in abortions. That means that more than 4,000 young women each year go through a medical procedure that they should never have needed. We must take cognisance of that.</p><p>Recent reports tell us that a third of 15-year-old girls have already had sexual intercourse. As a Parliament, we must raise the profile of such problems and support the minister in tackling them. I whole-heartedly support the minister's initiatives and I congratulate her on the high profile that she has given to that aspect of health. I hope that every member in the chamber will join me in rejecting the e-mail that we got last week from Precious Life Scotland, which said that it had taken great pride in handing out leaflets showing pictures of aborted foetuses, after the minister launched the Sandyford initiative. I rejected that e-mail and wrote back in very strong terms. Four thousand young women in this country should not have to have abortions. If they cannot get access to proper, sustained contraceptive advice, that figure will not come down. We must lead in that battle.</p><p>The matter is urgent, which is where I take issue with the minister. It took more than a year to set up Healthy Respect in Edinburgh. We cannot wait another year and another 9,000 pregnancies. The minister mentioned demonstration projects. We want the sexual health initiative and strategy to be in place as soon as possible.</p><p>We have talked today about joined-up government. Last week I was in Greenock to hear about SHIFT&#8212;the sexual health information for teenagers project&#8212;which is doing great work in bringing down the number of teenage pregnancies in Greenock. However, while I was there I heard that Inverclyde Council's community education budget had been halved since 1996. If we are to have joined-up and sustained approaches to working with young people, we must address such problems.</p><p>In the drugs debate that we had earlier this year, I highlighted the fact that there were no specific under-16-years projects to support young people with drugs problems. Mary Scanlon emphasised that again today. Again, that is a matter of urgency. I asked some parliamentary questions about volatile substance abuse, and I was disappointed to hear that 15 of the 22 drug action teams do not refer specifically in their action plans to how they will deal with VSA, even though that is a required point in their remit. Angus MacKay said <place-holder colnum=\"544\"/> that the Executive would consider what further action was required. We know what further action is required; we need to see it being taken.</p><p>In the few seconds that are left to me, I would like to address the issue of smoking, which many members have raised today. I ask the Executive, when it is drawing up the Scottish tobacco enforcement protocol&#8212;which I know is coming&#8212;to examine the Crown Office guidance that does not allow test purchasing of tobacco products by under-16-year-olds in Scotland. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland that is permitted, and it has been found that when retailers are prosecuted, they stop selling tobacco to under-16s. That initiative has a 100 per cent success rate. In Scotland, there have been no prosecutions in the past year for selling tobacco or volatile substances to the under-aged.</p><p>I welcome the minister's commitment to helping young people, but I would like to see some hard initiatives being taken.</p>", "hdate": "2000-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13235284", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The previous time that I spoke in a health debate I was the last speaker, but I am sad to say that I was the first to mention child health.

In a recent survey of women returners, to which my colleague Nicola Sturgeon has referred on previous occasions, it was found that the high costs of child care were still a disincentive to women's returning to work, training or education. In the stage 1 debate on 25 <place-holder colnum=\"880\"/> May, I asked the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning about the &#163;8 million that Henry McLeish had announced for child care at further education colleges. At that stage, the minister was unable to indicate clearly that that &#163;8 million would be accessible by people with individual learning accounts.

That is a situation which we must address.

At one meeting, we learned that, south of the border, the Minister of Sport has given &#163;1 million to facilitate the investigation of supporters trusts. The day after that meeting, there was a debate in this chamber on sport and social inclusion, during which several members asked the minister, Rhona Brankin, to address that point. The minister has also been asked at question time about giving financial backing to supporters trusts. Sadly, she has continually said that the Scottish Executive will not provide funding to investigate the possibility of supporters trusts in Scotland. I hope that, given the evidence that she has heard tonight about just one football club, she will examine the issue in more detail and come up with a funding package to support supporters trusts. That might ensure that, each week, fans from different football clubs will not have to come to the Parliament to try to save their club from the clutches of directors who are simply out to make money.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13231083", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greenock Morton Football Club"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will try to keep my remarks brief.

Members are always talking to people who provide child care.</p><p>The debate has provided an opportunity to acknowledge all the work that has been done and the Scottish National Party recognises the work that has been done by the Executive. However, the intention of the SNP's amendment is to bring into focus the fact that the work that has been done on child care often raises as many questions as it answers. The idea behind the amendment is to ensure that any future funding and policy by the Government is directed at addressing the problems that were raised in the debates in November and today and that are raised when we discuss child care in our constituencies.</p><p>I would like to touch briefly on a few points that have been raised and pose questions on them for the Deputy Minister for Children and Education to <place-holder colnum=\"438\"/> answer in his response.</p><p>Children with special educational needs cost more in terms of out-of-school care and pre-school care&#8212;that is a simple fact of life. Capability Scotland ran a two-week summer scheme last year for 20 children, which cost &#163;20,000. By my reckoning, the &#163;2 million that the minister mentioned at the beginning of the debate for special educational needs requirements means that we can provide facilities for 80 children with special needs for one year. That would not go anywhere near addressing the problems that are faced by those children. There is similarly patchy provision for children with special needs in pre-school, so we must consider the matter seriously.</p><p>Transport has been mentioned more than once. Peter Peacock has been more closely involved in the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Bill than I have, but I do not remember anything in the bill that says that now we have to provide pre-school places for three and four-year-olds, we must also provide them with transport to pre-school. Can he confirm how local authorities, especially in rural areas, will meet the transport needs of the 68 per cent of three-year-olds who attend pre-school facilities?</p><p>Funding was mentioned in the November debate and again today. I do not want to keep asking the same question, so I hope that we will get some answers today. The sustainability of funding concerns pre-school providers and especially those who provide after-school care. One-year funding is insufficient to set up a service and ensure its continuity. I have direct experience of that in my constituency. A parent planned to set up after-school care provision, but when she told people that she could apply for only one year's funding, 20 or so parents said that they would look elsewhere because they did not want to make annual arrangements for out-of-school care for their children.</p><p>Qualifications have been mentioned. Nicola Sturgeon has already asked twice about the update on the 5,000 new deal training opportunities. This is an appropriate moment for the Executive to answer those questions. When will the Executive respond to the SPRITO Scotland and Play Scotland joint initiative to set up a play-work, education and training unit? Those organisations had hoped to do that by April this year, but they have still not been given the go-ahead or any advice from the Executive.</p><p>Sam Galbraith announced a total of &#163;8 million today. Am I correct in thinking that &#163;2 million of that sum had already been announced as part of the &#163;49 million? I thought that he said that &#163;2 million would be allocated to local authorities from the existing &#163;49 million. If that is right, today's announcement is of &#163;6 million, not &#163;8 million.

However, he implied that future developments of ILAs might lead to a need for bank accounts. I would like the minister to clarify that, because a problem in Scotland is that about 20 per cent of the population have no bank account. When we consider rurality and the increasing number of closures of bank branches, the issue of bank accounts will have to be addressed in both the short and the long term.</p><p>If we want to promote access to learning, we must ensure that that learning is provided throughout the country and is accessible to anybody who wants it. We cannot say that a person who lives near a big city will have access but that a person who lives near Fort William will have access to one college and one college only. We have to consider where the providers of lifelong learning are.</p><p>Duncan McNeil mentioned the time that is available for learning and the problems of shift workers. I know that it is a reserved issue, but we must address the fact that, in Scotland, we have the longest working hours in Europe. We have a 48-hour working week, unlike France, where there is a 35-hour working week. We should examine that. Lifelong learning is something that we need time for. We must open up the time that is available for people to obtain access to lifelong learning. Child care has been mentioned; the minister referred to the &#163;8 million that was announced yesterday. I want an assurance from <place-holder colnum=\"1170\"/> him that the &#163;8 million for child care costs, for those in further education, will be available to people undertaking other forms of lifelong learning, such as short courses that are available through other providers.</p><p>The Scottish Enterprise Grampian pilot identified only one group within the 2,000 learners whom the minister has spoken about as being given assistance. That was assistance with child care through their local authority and their union, Unison. We must address that enormous issue.</p><p>It has been mentioned already that the Scottish Enterprise Grampian pilot identified that the people who were most in need of lifelong learning were those least likely to follow up the individual learning accounts. We must see more clearly how the Executive will resolve that. If there is a 100,000 target in the first two years, we want those most in need of lifelong learning to be within that 100,000 in the first two years, so that they benefit from the &#163;150 incentive rather than the discount.</p><p>Duncan McNeil has already picked up on the point that there are individuals to whom &#163;25 will be an insurmountable barrier. We must examine ways of releasing funds from unions or voluntary organisations, perhaps, to allow those individuals to open their learning account.</p><p>I was at a special educational needs school this morning. That brought to mind the thought of where and how we will ensure that the special needs of adults with learning difficulties are accounted for. Their needs will always mean that education and training is more expensive for them or for the provider. Where will we ensure that that is resolved for them?</p><p>I will discuss my hobby horse of the plethora of initiatives, which we have heard about already. A key element of SUFI is that its learning providers will provide learner support, yet we read that that will be one of the key aims of the customer services provider, a private company. The Executive has set aside &#163;6.5 million&#8212;25 per cent of the individual learning account budget&#8212;for the customer services provider. How much of that money is being duplicated by services that are already provided by SUFI?

The amended paragraphs 13(2)(b) and 13(2)(c) use words such as \"incompatible\" and \"significant public expenditure\". Surely such language should find no place in a presumption in favour of inclusive education. Last year, I attended the equity conference in Edinburgh, at which I heard evidence from the United States showing that children with the most severe physical and mental disabilities can be taught in mainstream schools with exceptional results for all pupils at the school.</p><p>Many organisations working with children with special needs will also be disappointed with the Deputy Minister for Children and Education's response to the amendment seeking to co-ordinate assessment undertaken under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The minister should remember that children do not live their lives in compartments or in local authority departments. Their needs are educational, social, personal and familial. We should be pushing streamlining as well as mainstreaming. Although the amendment would have been a start towards that aim, the Government rejected it.</p><p>I want to return to the phrase \"significant public expenditure\". When we consider the provision of special educational needs, we must also examine the current settlement provided to local authorities by this Government to find the reality rather than the rhetoric, as Duncan Hamilton said. For example, in my constituency, East Renfrewshire Council has been praised in the past by parents, amongst others, as an authority committed to mainstream provision. However, the phrase <place-holder colnum=\"624\"/> \"rationalisation of SEN support\" appeared in this year's budget settlement with a saving of &#163;80,000. This innocuous phrase meant the withdrawal of SEN auxiliaries from primary schools.</p><p>The parents of pupils who would have been left without their support were well nigh desperate when they contacted me.

Two of the most deprived local authority areas in the country, West Dunbartonshire and Inverclyde, have received respectively four awards and seven awards from sportscotland's sports facilities awards scheme. They have each received &#163;700,000, which represents 0.8 per cent of the total sum spent on sports facilities in Scotland by sportscotland. Over the same period, merchant company schools in Edinburgh received a grant of &#163;2.3 million.

They are similar to those that Cathy Jamieson has already given us. Last year, 27 employees lost their lives in accidents in the workplace. Several thousand more were injured or suffered ill health as a result of their work. That will have long-term consequences for them. Some of those events resulted in prosecutions followed&#8212;on conviction&#8212;by fines, but most did not.</p><p>The difficulty in examining stark figures is that counting accidents, even fatal ones, is not an especially good method of determining whether a job, or a workplace, is dangerous. Focusing on accidents concentrates the mind, but it is like driving a car by looking only in the rear view mirror&#8212;the driver knows only where they have been; they cannot tell where they are going. Other techniques are much better suited to predicting where and how accidents might occur.</p><p>As Cathy Jamieson said, the Health and Safety Executive is the primary safety regulator in Scotland. It rightly concentrates on other techniques of safety performance measurement. Its field operations division in Scotland enforces several hundred acts of Parliament and sets of regulations in a work force of 2.3 million people in many thousands of workplaces. Cathy Jamieson has already mentioned that it is funded to the tune of &#163;8 million per annum. No doubt London feels that that is sufficient; I hope that the minister will agree that it is insufficient to provide for safety services in Scotland.</p><p>In the UK as a whole, there is a clear downward trend in the number of fatal accidents at work but, as Cathy Jamieson said, the rate of fatal injuries is higher in Scotland and Wales than it is in England. Because of the relatively small numbers involved, however, we must be careful about what conclusions we draw from the figures. The question therefore&#8212;once statistical variation has been ruled out&#8212;is what might the reasons be for the difference. If Scotland is faring worse than might be expected, what must we do about it?</p><p>As Cathy Jamieson said, the root cause of most accidents at work is acts or omissions by management. The likely remedy is to improve the management's understanding of safety in the workplace and to make management accept its <place-holder colnum=\"1274\"/> responsibility. The way in which to achieve that is to enable safety regulators to explain to employers what is required. HSE can do that only if it is able to spend more time performing its inspection duties. Deciding whether to prosecute or refrain from prosecution is currently a policy matter in the HSE. The question for the Parliament is whether that policy is relevant and effective in Scotland.</p><p>There are reasonable questions for the Parliament to have answered, such as whether the working man or woman is more likely to be killed or injured at work in Scotland than elsewhere. Is the safety regulator able to do its job effectively? Does our civil administration and judiciary take these issues seriously enough? We should welcome open debate on health and safety at work and support the call for a standing commission. I hope that the minister will agree with us.</p><p>The proposed standing commission must be given access to all the necessary data and individuals who can assist in its task. It must be charged not only with examining the current situation but with developing strategies that will drive real improvements in workplace safety in Scotland. However, this entire endeavour will fail if resources are not made available to ensure that the remedies are implemented. I therefore call on the minister to assure Parliament that resources will be found to ensure the safety of Scotland's workers.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13225258", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health and Safety at Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Cathy Jamieson for bringing this matter before Parliament and giving me the opportunity to speak on a matter in which my family has a long-standing interest as my husband has spent his whole professional life in the safety services.

The 1997 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development international adult literacy survey puts 20 per cent of Scots at level 1 for literacy&#8212;the lowest level possible&#8212;yet, at the same time, funding and support for the improvement of adult literacy has been cut. From 1992 to 1998, there was a 40 per cent drop in the number of adults who participated in basic adult education courses. We must consider what the Government is doing to promote literacy and skills.</p><p>While participation in basic adult literacy courses is dropping, education departments are under threat; not necessarily the school education department, but the education department that <place-holder colnum=\"876\"/> helps with literacy skills and community education. My local authority, East Dunbartonshire Council, is contemplating doing away with community education to make up a 15 per cent budget overspend.</p><p>We must start to say that lifelong learning begins in school and does not start at 16. We should be equipping our children with transferable, adaptable skills: the skills that are embodied in information-handling techniques, but there is no statutory provision for a department of a school&#8212;a library service&#8212;that can teach that. We have heard mention of the national grid for learning. At the moment, eight local authorities in Scotland are not ready even to take up the information and communications technology training that is about to start in April. A quarter of Scotland's local authorities are unprepared&#8212;for infrastructural or visionary reasons&#8212;to start to train their librarians and teachers to skill the pupils for the future. That means that up to 50 secondary schools in Scotland are unable to start on the national grid for learning.</p><p>We must also talk about up-skilling adults now. How many of Scotland's small or medium enterprises have been consulted on releasing staff to access the Scottish learning network that we have heard so much about? In the debate on the Scottish university for industry, &#163;4 million was pledged for learning centres, yet in Scotland we work the longest hours in Europe.

I was pleased to read in the Executive's document \"Action in Partnership\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are, of course, inextricable links between drug misuse, smoking and alcohol misuse. Tobacco and alcohol use often provide a gateway into illicit drug use.\"</p><p>I am glad that this Parliament and the Executive realise the problems that our young people face. I was going to give some statistics, but we have heard them. My question, therefore, is: what are we doing about our young people's problems with drug misuse?</p><p>The most recent report from the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration&#8212;the first since drug and alcohol misuse became causes for referral&#8212;showed that in the year covered by the report there were 1,114 referrals for drug, alcohol or solvent misuse by young people. The chief reporter went on to say that the low availability of drug treatment services dedicated to the under-16 age group was probably the cause of the under-reporting to the children's panels at the time.</p><p>That statement&#8212;that we do not have dedicated services for under 16-year-olds&#8212;is repeated again and again by all the voluntary and professional organisations working in the field. If we want to prevent continued drug misuse, we must consider how we are going to help the youngest and most vulnerable users.</p><p>The key task for any drug misuse strategy for young folk is to develop responsive services. The <place-holder colnum=\"332\"/> problems faced by young drug misusers are not the same as those faced by adults. It is also in this area that it is most important to examine user involvement in the services that we provide.</p><p>Young folk's reasons for and choice of addiction tend to swing much more according to fashion than those of long-term and older addicts. In the case of solvent abuse, there is an average of 10 deaths a year in Scotland, but that figure rises dramatically in some years and falls away in others. With young people we must have services that can respond to needs as and when they arise.</p><p>Education is another important area where there are swings and roundabouts, fashions and fads. We must evaluate our services and invest for the future in those that work for young people. There is no point in saying one year, \"Just say no,\" and the next concentrating on harm reduction.</p><p>I recommend that we examine two areas: alternatives for young people and peer-led services. We must consider alternatives to drug abuse. We must ask why our young people are becoming involved in drugs. Why are we hearing such terrible statistics?</p><p>One of the biggest reasons is the sense of alienation that young people across all levels and classes in society feel. Young folk do not see a future, so when they are offered an alternative to boredom and no hope at 14, 15 or 16, they will take it. The worry is where that leads them. We must consider offering alternatives through community-based initiatives.</p><p>Another area that concerns me greatly and about which we have heard little is the issue of children who have drug-abusing parents. We must consider how we can support those children, who, when they are a bit older, often take on care of the drug-abusing parent. We learned in the news last night the effects that a chaotic drug-abusing parental household can have on a child, and we have to invest in research to tackle such cases.</p><p>We have to applaud aim (i) in \"Action in Partnership\", which is to prioritise young people. On aim (iv), which relates to the availability of illegal drugs, why is the Scottish Executive not following the UK line, which is that the key objective will be to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Reduce access to drugs amongst 5-16 year olds\"?</p><p>Perhaps a cross-cutting committee would ensure that young people are considered at every turn and under every objective.</p>", "hdate": "2000-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13218801", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drug Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to follow a number of members who have highlighted the problems of drug misuse among young people.

The debate is about discrimination, or doing away with discrimination&#8212;young men are being discriminated against and their rights under various United Nations conventions are being denied.

It is beyond a joke that 16 and 17-year-old boys, on the threshold of adulthood, have to deal with the problems of discrimination, on top of which they have to deal with mental health problems.

We will be supporting the Government in today's vote. The SNP's amendment expresses a very real concern&#8212;a concern that has been expressed today in the chamber, but more especially by concerned professionals and volunteers who are working with children leaving care.</p><p>The minister said that the majority who replied to the consultation process supported the transfer of Department of Social Security benefits. That is not my understanding from reading the papers that were submitted to that consultation. I would be <place-holder colnum=\"47\"/> grateful if the deputy minister could enlighten me further on how many, and which, organisations support the transfer of DSS benefits.</p><p>It is an important issue, which is why the SNP has put forward this amendment and will continue to argue the case on the transfer of DSS benefits on behalf of these young people. That transfer further marginalises young people. At the start of their adult life, it labels them, yet again, as different. In order to receive benefits, they have to go to a social worker; they cannot go along, as other adults do, and be treated as adults. That is important and it is why we are putting forward the amendment.</p><p>As with all children, the needs, concerns and, indeed, rights of these children would be better safeguarded and highlighted by two simple steps: the incorporation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into the practices and policies of the Government and the appointment of a commissioner for children and young people. Those two SNP commitments should be considered urgently by the Government.</p><p>In today's debate, we heard the minister tell us of his anger at past practices and his promises for the future. The SNP welcomes those promises, but we and others have raised a number of practical issues in this debate, which I hope that the deputy minister will address.</p><p>Why has the Government not accepted and implemented the recommendations of the Kent report? We also raised the issue of the registration and training of social workers and those involved in looking after children. There has been an announcement of &#163;3 million for training, but how long is that training to take and when will we have a fully trained work force? Is that &#163;3 million it, or will more money be forthcoming?</p><p>Another issue is the move towards foster care. As Nicola Sturgeon said, most of us feel in our guts that foster care is better than residential care, but we need to ensure that the practice that we put in place for the 21<sup>st</sup> century is evidence based and that it is what young people need. We need a needs-led care system and not a finance-driven one. We must examine research that has already been done among foster carers, and look to putting in training and support for foster carers. Two of the key difficulties that foster carers say make them leave foster caring are lack of training and lack of support.</p><p>I will finish by reminding members that the people we are talking about are the young people. We should not be talking about them, but talking with them. I always come back to the theme that we must involve young people in discussions about their future. We must consult them. We talk about an &#163;800,000 grant to extend the advocacy <place-holder colnum=\"48\"/> network, but we must ask the young people what they want out of that. As well as advocacy, they want adjudication. They do not want someone just to talk to or for them, but they want somebody who will adjudicate their case and take it forward for them.

I ask the Executive to examine that possibility in the interim.</p><p>We also have to consider local authorities' children's service plans and ensure that, at every stage, the needs of the young carers are taken into account. That includes their education and, for those in employment, the right to take time off. We have to examine how young carers go through their education&#8212;they are taking time off it now because of their caring duties. We cannot tolerate instances such as one that I heard about recently, in which a young carer attended a carers meeting and returned home to find that the truancy officer had been to find out why she was not at school. That is an unacceptable burden to put on young carers.</p><p>Training for guidance teachers has already been mentioned. We need to provide it now, not to the directors of education, but to the guidance teachers. We have to consider the support that we give young carers. They need training in how to get advice, how to get information and in the physical work they do, including lifting techniques. <place-holder colnum=\"1024\"/></p><p>It is sad that we have to talk about this, but we do. We must not put physical burdens on young carers by not training them correctly.</p><p>I notice that the carers strategy mentions conducting training through GPs, but I do not think that general practices provide the correct forum for training young carers in lifting techniques. The strategy also mentions respite for young carers. That is a particular issue, and it does not mean a fortnight off once a year. Carers do not want that; they want time off with the family they care for. A young carer needs regular breaks, almost every day. If a young carer goes to a homework club, they should be assured that there is respite care: that someone else will care for their parent or sibling while they are at the club.</p><p>We are talking about coherent, integrated services for young people. We cannot ask them to go on their own to social work, health, community education and leisure departments&#8212;we should be addressing leisure and transport issues too&#8212;they need someone to go to; an advocate to help them through. We cannot, unfortunately, get away from money, which is necessary to provide the services. East Dunbartonshire young carers project has a &#163;5,000 grant for a one-year project. Young carers do not, however, have one-year care burdens&#8212;their burdens go on for longer.</p><p>I remind the Executive again that we have to ask young carers what they need. We have to listen to what they want and support them. Ultimately, we have to give them back their childhood.</p>", "hdate": "1999-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13215931", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the fact that we have highlighted young carers today and I wish to confine my remarks to that subject.

I was about to mention the plethora of initiatives, of which the national grid for learning is one. Peter <place-holder colnum=\"776\"/> Peacock spoke about those initiatives; a good eight minutes of his speech was taken up with them. It is not the initiatives per se that bother us, but the lack of integration and coherence. It is all very well to have a national grid for learning, so long as it fits in to a coherent, co-ordinated national information strategy. I hope that that answers Maureen Macmillan's question.</p><p>I had planned to list the plethora of initiatives, but Peter Peacock did that so I will not waste time by doing it again. In a previous speech in the chamber, I referred to the fact that, as a librarian, I should be happy about those initiatives. However, the profession is concerned that &#163;144 million has been committed to them so far. On a good estimate, we could probably do the whole thing for a third of that cost.</p><p>As Peter Peacock said, we must also consider content and digitisation. We have not looked at those areas yet. Government money must be put into initiatives in a co-ordinated, coherent and integrated fashion, but first we must have a strategy. I attended a meeting last week at which one of the librarians who was present said that no one had invested so much money in libraries and information, over such a short period of time, since Andrew Carnegie. I remind members that the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust set criteria and standards to ensure that the public library service that it funded became exactly that&#8212;a public library service that was free, with equal access for all. That is what today's debate and our amendment are about.</p><p>The big but behind all those initiatives is that we must have integration and coherence and we must set national standards. I will quote from the Scottish Library and Information Council's 1999 publication \"Enabling Seamless Access\".</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Yet without co-ordination, the continued growth of separate networks may in the long-term prevent the development of 'seamless access' to information and knowledge.\"</p><p>That is what we must guard against.</p><p>I will make some international comparisons. I said that Scotland is the right size to become a knowledge nation. Other countries are going down that road and have been doing so throughout the 1990s. For example, Denmark has the information society for all initiative, which I am sure that Peter Peacock knows about. It also has a Ministry of Research and Information Technology, with a division for IT and society. That is what Scotland must aim for.</p><p>Ireland has the Information Society Commission, which, in its second annual report this year, talked about the fact that we have to look at awareness, infrastructure, learning, enterprise, legal issues, Government services, social inclusion and priority <place-holder colnum=\"777\"/> areas of focus. That is what we are talking about. I know that that is what Peter Peacock also talked about, but those countries are using action plans to produce the required coherence and strategy to ensure that all the initiatives work towards one aim: producing an information society.</p><p>We should also look at Finland, which I know the minister recently visited. Finland realised in the early 1990s how important being an information society would be to its future. Three per cent of the annual gross domestic product was channelled into establishing Finland as an information society. They also ensured that they had an action plan, a national information strategy, which means that the money that was put in produced results. One in five people in Finland regularly accesses e-mail, one in three regularly uses the internet and every second person has a mobile phone. We might dread the mobile telephone, but the technology is developing to allow us to access the information society with mobile telephones. Finland has done it, and we must do it too.</p><p>We must not examine only other countries. We must also look at Scotland within Europe. Last year, the European Union produced a report that said that a piecemeal and sporadic approach to information society initiatives will not remove the obstacles that have been identified. The Commission considers that decisive and concerted action is needed. That shows how seriously the EU takes building the information society. I hope that we in Scotland will take it that seriously.</p><p>The European Commission also recommended that by June 1999 member states should submit comprehensive national strategies. Did we submit a comprehensive national strategy by June 1999? I am not aware, even through my professional background, that we did. This will be on the agenda for the meeting of the European Council in December. Will we have to put up our hands and admit that Scotland does not have a national action plan?</p><p>I am short of time and my colleagues will cover infrastructure, content, access to information and the skills that are necessary for us to become an information society, but I would like to conclude by stressing urgency. Urgency is behind what goes on in the countries I have been talking about. Those countries have been working on this since the early 1990s. Most of them have had national action plans in place since the mid-1990s. We are about to enter the knowledge century and we have no national action plan. The SNP amendment asks for that to ensure that we produce more than nice, warm, woolly words.</p><p>The SNP cannot endorse the motion as it stands because it does not provide the clearly defined agenda that we need to ensure Scotland's place at <place-holder colnum=\"778\"/> the forefront of the knowledge century that we are about to enter. If the Government does not accept our amendment, then it will have failed to take cognizance of the clearly stated views of the professionals that are out there.</p><p>The minister talked about those whom he has involved in the task force. I am pleased to see that he has recommended that suggestions be made as to who that task force should include, but I must point out that the task force is dominated by the telecommunications industry, which comprises 45 per cent of it. The task force is about producing a national strategy, not about looking only at the telecommunications infrastructure. The task force must move beyond that; it must make the vision a reality. If that does not happen, we will be letting Scotland and its people down.</p><p>Perhaps the minister should have attended the Information for Scotland seminar that was held last week at the University of Edinburgh. The leading lights in this field were assembled in one room. Had the minister attended he would have heard the message loud and clear that we need a national information strategy and we need it now. If he had attended the meeting, he would also have found the task force that he needs to produce the strategy&#8212;a task force that could produce the strategy in time for us to enter the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>I commend the amendment to all members and hope that they will view it in the light in which it is intended to be viewed.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-295.1, to delete from \"help develop\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"produce an Integrated Information Strategy for Scotland which aims to influence the global development of the information society, ensures the development of an information society at national level and supports regional and local information society development in Scotland, which ensures the implementation of the strategy in and across every sphere and sector of Scottish society, and which will produce a National Action Plan in line with the European Commission's Information Society Action Plan that addresses the priority areas for action and has a clear timetable for achievement and progress.\"</p>", "hdate": "1999-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13215280", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Digital Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will put that into perspective.

Mr Galbraith's opening remarks gave no indication of a Government that was prepared to learn or to move on. He dismissed the SNP's amendment because it includes the dread word funding, but today that issue has been raised repeatedly by members of all parties and the minister has signally failed to deal with it.</p><p>The SNP has long been committed to nursery places for all three and four-year-olds whose parents want them. However, we have taken a holistic, child-centred approach with our plans for children's centres. A child care strategy must provide an integrated service that caters for all the child's needs.</p><p>We must give all children a suitable and stable environment that gives them, and their parents or carers, access to all the services that they need in one place, with no shuttling between breakfast club, pre-school care, childminder, play scheme and health visitor. Children need a centred approach to life; they do not need to be on a conveyor belt.</p><p>The minister mentioned sure start Scotland and how it will apply to children up to the age of three. It will bring services to the child. As part of the vision, it would be nice if that could be broadened out to include all our children.</p><p>Children's centres would be one-stop shops for child care and could be managed as such, ensuring that all aspects of a child's life were in <place-holder colnum=\"662\"/> balance, and that the funding could be assured and long-term. One of the SNP's main criticisms of the child care strategy as it is constructed at present is the precariousness of the funding. That is a big problem. Using lottery funding to fund child care is not a sign of commitment. Using one-year lottery funding is putting many providers in jeopardy. There was almost universal condemnation of that funding mechanism in the submissions to the consultation process, and the chamber has heard nothing from the Executive today that will reassure local groups and businesses that they can plan for a secure future.</p><p>Relying on the working families tax credit for the sustainability of out-of-school care seems to me to be in the same vein as the discredited voucher scheme of the Conservative party. It means that the carers have to have the money to spend first, and it therefore excludes many people from out-of-school care&#8212;people such as students. It does not allow services to have clear and assured funding that allows them to plan for the future, as is essential.</p><p>Another point that is often raised by those actively involved in child care is the management of the service. A truly integrated statutory service would relieve the management burden on parent and volunteer committees. Meeting a national child care strategy through those people's free time is unacceptable.</p><p>In conclusion, I again welcome the Scottish Executive's commitment to a child care strategy for Scotland. But the strategy as presented to us today leaves much to be desired in meeting the needs of all children in a flexible and fully funded manner. The minister told us that it has taken two and a half years to get here.

As John Swinney said, the so-called millennium bug is actually nothing of the sort. It is a problem that could recur intermittently on 1 April and 1 September over the next few decades up to 2035. The phrase \"date discontinuity\" better indicates the general nature of the problem and helps to identify what types of microchip could be affected. It especially helps us to appreciate that, whatever happens at hogmanay, the problem will not be over then but will resurface for many years to come. I ask the Executive what it proposes to do about those future critical dates&#8212;in his statement, the minister reassured neither me nor the chamber that any plans had been made to deal with the longer-term implications.</p><p>Such planning is important for Governments and local authorities. It is vital that organisations such as the utilities and emergency services are fully in control at all critical times. The BCPs that we have heard about&#8212;I thought that I would be the first to introduce acronyms&#8212;should be able to cope with whatever emergencies arise at the turn of the year. We all hope that there will be minimum disruption.</p><p>However, what will happen on the other predicted or potential critical dates? Will the same BCPs be effective in nine months' or two years' time? A good BCP tells an organisation how to keep its business running when problems of any sort arise. However, any management plan or routine left by itself will deteriorate over time. Although it is all very well to have emergency co-ordinating offices such as SILC&#8212;or, as I gather it is called, the bunker&#8212;in operation over hogmanay, if such date discontinuity problems arise in the foreseeable future, I have to ask whether the Executive has issued advice on on-<place-holder colnum=\"518\"/> going preparedness.</p><p>What is the Executive's advice to organisations which choose to switch off vulnerable systems or equipment over the millennium while we are all having a five-day holiday? What will happen when those systems are switched on after 5 January&#8212;after SILC has stood down&#8212;and they malfunction?</p><p>Although the millennium operating regime will probably work well over the millennium holiday, if too many organisations choose to suspend operation of vulnerable equipment at that time, many of them will find that they have only delayed the onset of these difficulties. That is worrying enough for the owners of small businesses. However, if there any chinks in Scotland's national armour and problems become manifest later, our preparations will have been inadequate.</p><p>The day-to-day emergencies suffered by our society can be uniformly addressed. We have a framework of legislation identifying the emergency services that can be called into play on occasions such as cases of fire or murder. As the date discontinuity problem could be with us for many years, the country must decide to cope with it in a similarly coherent and sustainable way.</p><p>Scotland needs to develop mechanisms to manage effectively and reliably its knowledge base&#8212;how we hold, distribute and analyse information.

I welcome the Scottish university for industry development if it will assist in contributing to that aim through the development of lifelong learning in Scotland.</p><p>I welcome the commitment to use a wide and innovative range of locations&#8212;such as libraries, community centres and colleges&#8212;as learning centres. However, I remind the Executive that we already have almost 3,000 learning centres in Scotland. They are called schools and they are in the heart of our communities.</p><p>My concern is increasing that, as various departments and individuals in the Executive <place-holder colnum=\"172\"/> hurtle towards the knowledge economy finishing tape, there is, as John Swinney said, a lack of a strategic approach. If SUFI is to enable our communities to participate in, and benefit from, lifelong learning, it needs to be integrated into a coherent strategy. That means that we need an integrated information strategy for Scotland.</p><p>As a first step, I suggest that we require a national audit on the preparedness of our telecommunications infrastructure for SUFI and the plethora of other initiatives. Are there still pockets of communities without access to digitised telephone exchanges? If so, the vision of lifelong learning being accessed through technology is little more than a pipe dream.</p><p>As well as facilitating a knowledge-driven society, SUFI should be structured so that it provides an opportunity to manage knowledge, be it that of an individual, a community or society as a whole. One way of achieving that is by creating an electronic learning environment that is accessible by everyone and from everywhere. Coherence and integration are essential if we are to ensure that any person can have access to information, no matter what their social or economic circumstances are or where they live.</p><p>In providing that access, we must ensure that the right tools are used. The search engines that are employed will be one of the most important tools in the technological environment of SUFI. If we had an integrated information strategy for Scotland, specifications in those technological areas would be clear, and we would not have to look at them individually for each initiative.</p><p>Copyright is another area where co-ordination and clear guidance are required. That is a complex legal issue, which sometimes baffles even the professionals&#8212;I admit that having been one myself. The issue is likely to become more complex, but it has to be considered now, in an integrated fashion. Recently, the Copyright Licensing Agency issued the first digitisation licences, but only to higher education institutions. We must find ways of licensing material in both print and electronic formats if we are to facilitate the widest possible access to information without prohibitive costs. That issue has a bearing on SUFI's ability to commission learning materials.</p><p>There should be a national strategy that not only assembles the policy framework to manage the development of our information-intensive society, but co-ordinates access, infrastructure and the content of the knowledge economy and society's initiatives. To deliver that strategy, there should be a national body to oversee the creation of our knowledge society. If SUFI is to succeed&#8212;and thank goodness the name is being changed; RIP SUFI&#8212;in meeting people's aspirations and raising their expectations of what learning can do for <place-holder colnum=\"173\"/> them, it must be an integral part of an integrated approach to delivering a knowledge-driven society and economy.</p><p>I hope that this document is not just another glossy contribution to the imminent information gridlock that Scotland faces.</p>", "hdate": "1999-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13213449", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish University for Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In line with the spirit of the words on the first page of the document, I would like to impress upon Parliament the fact that, if Scotland is to become a knowledge-driven economy in the next century, it must first become a knowledge-driven society.

That committee must set priorities, and I would have hoped that Brian would agree that our children's education should be the highest priority.</p><p>The SNP condemns the Labour Government's hypocrisy of constantly repeating the mantra of lowering class sizes, first stated in its election manifesto, while forcing COSLA to abolish the maximum class size for composite classes. Currently nearly 3,000 composite classes in Scottish primary schools&#8212;26 per cent of Scottish classes&#8212;have between 21 and 25 pupils in them. If that number is raised to 30, as proposed, on a conservative estimate, nearly 7,000 pupils in Scotland will be forced into bigger classes at a time when, we are told, it is the Government's mission to reduce class sizes. How will that help all children to get the best start in life?</p><p>When I questioned the minister on that at the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, he asserted that there was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"no educational reason why composite class sizes should be any different from non-composite class sizes\".&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Education, Culture and Sport Committee, </i>8 September 1999; c 44.]</p><p>He failed to answer me then, so I will ask him again now where his evidence for that statement is. If he has the evidence, why has COSLA stated that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the abolition of composite classes is a key target\"?</p><p>Why does the Scottish Parent Teacher Council say that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the teachers' determination to stick to a maximum of 25 in composite classes is very much in line with parents' views\"?</p><p>Why does a literature review of the subject reveal that policy makers should not</p><p class=\"indent\">\"adopt the multigrade form of classroom organisation . . . because of economic or cost saving reasons\"?</p><p>I can give Sam the references.</p><p>Teachers' concerns about composite classes include the lack of time to cover course work, an increased work load and less individual attention for pupils. How does that accord with the Government's stated aim of earning a world-class reputation for the Scottish education system? International comparisons show that in Norway the average number of pupils in a composite class is 9.1 and in Slovenia it is 12.23&#8212;and in Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"896\"/> we are proposing to raise the number to 30.</p><p>The situation in our small, often rural, schools is special. Peter Peacock told the Education, Culture and Sport Committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Most of the kids\"&#8212;</p><p>Peter's words, not mine&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in rural areas will remain in exactly the same situation.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report,</i> <i>Education, Culture and Sport Committee, </i>8 September 1999; c 44.]</p><p>In Dumfries and Galloway there are 287 composite classes. If the class size is increased to 30, 30 fewer teachers will be needed. What will that do for teachers' morale? Castle Kennedy School near Stranraer has two teachers. That means that the head teacher must teach a composite class and still perform all the duties of a head teacher. If the number in her composite class continues to rise, how is she expected to cope? How do the school and the pupils cope, Peter? The proposal will disadvantage pupils and further stress teachers&#8212;and all for an efficiency saving of &#163;20 million. How many billions does Chancellor Brown have stuffed in his war chest, Peter?</p><p>I conclude by reminding the minister and the Parliament that it is the pupils who are in the middle of this mess, and no one is asking them what they think.

It may sound boring, but I urge all members to read it and the Scottish Parliament information centre's research note 99/8 entitled, \"The Parliament's information strategy\".

The public libraries network, which would allow constituents access to parliamentary information at the branch library closest to them, does not yet exist, and it looks increasingly unlikely that the target date of 2002 for its launch will be met. </p><p>Even if such a network were in place, it must be remembered that the internet is not always the best solution to people's information needs. Skills are needed to use the technology and money is needed to pay the charges that most libraries are forced to levy.
