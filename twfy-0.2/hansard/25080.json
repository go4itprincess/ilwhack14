Nelson Mandela&#8217;s journey from prisoner to president, which was watched around the world, spanned the decades, and the years of that journey are clear in this chamber.</p><p>The First Minister and, to a greater extent, the leader of the Labour Party have talked about their memories of the apartheid struggle and how it impacted on their political consciousness and the politics and world view of those around them, but my memories are, by necessity, only of what came after.</p><p>When The Specials charted with &#8220;Free Nelson Mandela&#8221;, I was five. When the world watched the man walk free from prison, I was still at primary school. My political consciousness was not really formed until I was in my teens, and by then he was already president. By the time that I reached voting age, he was more than halfway through his term of office and had already indicated that he would step down. So I do not remember the struggle. For me and people of my age, it was something to be viewed almost in the rear-view mirror of modern history&#8212;as anachronistic and wrong as American segregation or communist rule across Europe.</p><p>My view of Mandela was of a man who was greatly wronged trying to heal his broken country and lead it from darkness into light. He said:</p><p>&#8220;No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.&#8221;</p><p>On leaving prison, with more reason to hate than anyone, Mandela showed people how to love and how to forgive. Mandela taught the world that reconciliation was more powerful than retribution. Despite terrible provocation he never answered racism with racism; instead, he chose to build a rainbow nation. He lived his philosophy every day and sometimes at great personal cost.</p><p>It was only a number of years after the fall of apartheid that I started more fully to appreciate that the transition that occurred from oppression to equality under the rule of law was not an inevitability and not simply the right and proper or even the obvious way that things could have happened by natural political evolution; rather it was as a consequence of one man&#8217;s courage, conviction and conscience.</p><p>As a young reporter, I was invited to hear FW de Klerk speak at the University of St Andrews. It was only then, when I heard at first hand but from the opposite side the difficulties entrenched in their shared land, that I understood just how big a gap had been bridged: the pressure on Mandela from newly emancipated black South Africans to hit back at their oppressors for every wrong that they had endured; the moral courage required to stand up and show that there was another way&#8212;that truth could lead to reconciliation.</p><p>Mandela&#8217;s words</p><p>&#8220;to be free is not merely to cast off one&#8217;s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others&#8221;</p><p>describe the simplest of concepts but the hardest of tasks, especially given that he had to work with leaders of an establishment that had taken a third of his life and subjected a whole people.</p><p>Back in those dark days of strife, turmoil and challenge, many struggled to understand the potency of what was unfolding, not least those in my party. I am pleased that the opening of the Thatcher archive shows that Margaret Thatcher lobbied PW Botha for Mandela&#8217;s release repeatedly and with vigour. She told him that such a move</p><p>&#8220;would have more impact than almost any single action you could undertake.&#8221;</p><p>That knowledge and the subsequent acknowledgement of the unique greatness that was Nelson Mandela does not change the fact that many members of my party did not recognise apartheid for the grave violation of human dignity that it was and did not back the struggle to end it. That is a stain on our party, and those members have found themselves on the wrong side of history. As someone who is a generation behind, it is almost incomprehensible to me how their judgment could have been so wrong.</p><p>Following his release, Nelson Mandela showed the world what could be achieved by offering a hand of friendship, shared endeavour, trust, forgiveness and love. His example gave hope not just to his country or his continent but to all people. Describing himself, he said:</p><p>&#8220;I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair.&#8221;</p><p>That action&#8212;that refusal to give in to rancour and</p><p>the persistence to keep putting one foot in front of the other and to guide his nation in its journey from division to unity&#8212;increased everybody&#8217;s faith in humanity. All nations were represented at his memorial today because Mandela spoke not just for South Africa but to the world.

On Friday, we saw people who had escaped the wreckage of the building turning around and going back in to help others. We saw passengers stop their cars and residents come out of their homes to join a human chain to help people to safety. We saw ambulance crews, fire officers and members of the police work through the night, the next day and the day after, sometimes at great risk, to save the living and recover the dead, knowing that their colleagues were in that wreckage.

Negotiations with the UK will be completed in time to start a formal membership application, which would require each of the institutions of the EU and every one of the 28 other member states, each one holding a veto, to agree to change the founding treaty, to open up and amend a number of other treaties, to agree all the opt-outs that Britain has secured that the SNP wants to keep, to add to the commissioners and to add to the voting.

Although we in this place are rightly talking about Helen&#8217;s contribution to politics and public life, I recognise that it is undoubtedly as a wife, a mother, a grandmother and a friend that her loss will be most keenly felt. I extend the thoughts and prayers of myself and my party to Helen&#8217;s family in supporting the motion of condolence.</p><p>In all the tributes to Helen Eadie over the past few days, two themes have emerged. The first of those is Helen&#8217;s fundamental care for people. Although I did not know her as well as other members did, it was evident to me that she was driven by a deep concern for others, be they her constituents, her colleagues or her family. That care for people and desire to help others shaped much of her career and many of her views. She was a vocal opponent of the local government reorganisation that introduced multimember wards largely because her experience as a councillor in Fife taught her that smaller wards allowed her to represent the interests of her constituents more effectively. Whether she was campaigning to improve the care of pensioners in Fife or working on behalf of the Polish and Bulgarian communities, Helen&#8217;s priority was always her constituents rather than her career or status as a politician.</p><p>I was telling Johann Lamont that, when I first arrived here as an MSP, I was a little intimidated by Helen, which seems strange in retrospect. I knew that she had resigned from several committees in protest that a Conservative could take any sort of leadership role in equal opportunities. I had watched as Helen would raise herself in the chamber, trembling in paroxysms of anti-Tory ire on&#8212;well, actually, on almost any given subject that one cares to mention.</p><p>Helen caught me in the corridor a few weeks after I became leader and I have to say that I thought that I was for it. However, I was not, because in private Helen was both warm and kind hearted. She had stopped me to ask whether I would pass on a letter to a United Kingdom Cabinet colleague, because she needed help to help others in her constituency and wanted to know whether I would oblige.</p><p>That was not the only time that Helen asked me to help intervene on one issue or another on behalf of her constituents. I always did help, because her requests were so modest and her wish to help was so heartfelt. They almost became personal missions to her and she was always on the side of the weak and the poor&#8212;the people who just needed a big sister to wrap an arm around them and tell them, &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we can&#8217;t make this better.&#8221;</p><p>Neither the letters exchanged nor the back-door channels ever made it into the press, even when the situation was not resolved to Helen&#8217;s liking. She was much keener to do whatever it took to help than to grandstand or gain credit just for trying. Not everyone in the chamber can say the same thing.</p><p>It has been said in newspaper tributes, at yesterday&#8217;s funeral service and here again today that, even when Helen was confined to her hospice bed, she insisted on carrying on her duties as a local MSP, replying to correspondence and sending instructions to her colleagues&#8212;I hope that members have all done what she asked. That sort of dedication is remarkable, but I did not think that it surprised anyone who knew Helen, as they would not be able to imagine anything else. Her life and career were characterised by absolute honesty, decency and integrity.</p><p>We have lost too many of our class of 99 this year. With every Scottish election, new people have the privilege of taking their seats in the chamber. Helen was an example to all who came after of what a people&#8217;s representative should be and of how to put your constituents first. She showed that, although one can put one&#8217;s argument with force and passion in the chamber, one can work with others as colleagues&#8212;no matter what party&#8212;to make a difference.</p><p>The story of Helen&#8217;s indignation and subsequent resignations at my colleague Margaret Mitchell taking on the convenership of the Equal Opportunities Committee is legend and, as the First Minister mentioned, it came with a withering comment about Attila the Hun. Less well known is that under Margaret&#8217;s guidance, that same committee produced an in-depth report on women in prison and their rights and treatment. Helen sought out Margaret especially to tell her what a fine and important piece of work that was. That was Helen&#8217;s other side: completely supportive and generous with her praise when she saw someone else standing up for the overlooked, the oppressed and the vulnerable.</p><p>Helen had unshakeable political convictions and passion for expressing her beliefs with full force. One would be hard pushed to find a more decent, honest or principled parliamentarian than Helen Eadie. For me, her most abiding quality was to care: to care for her constituents, to care for the difference that she could make and to show care and respect for her opponents as well as her friends.</p><p>As our thoughts and prayers go out to Bob, Jemma, Fiona and the wider family at this time, we remember with affection one of Holyrood&#8217;s most honourable members.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752423", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Motion of Condolence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The shocking suddenness of Helen&#8217;s illness and loss has deprived Fife of one of its most dedicated servants in the chamber and of one of its most principled parliamentarians.

I believe that marriage is a good thing. I saw the evidence of that every day growing up in a house that was full of love. My family had the stresses and strains that are common to all, but there was never any doubt, question or fear in my mind that our togetherness was in any way insecure.</p><p>The bedrock of that stability and security was my parents&#8217; marriage. That stability helped me and my sister to flourish and have confidence that we could be whoever we wanted to be. After more than 40 years of marriage, my parents still love each other.

That recognition matters.</p><p>Presiding Officer, from childhood, you have known without even thinking that if you found someone you loved and who loved you in return, you would have the right to marry them. The same unthinking right to marry extends to the cabinet secretary, the Labour Party leader and the Liberal Democrat leader. I want that right to extend to not just me but the thousands of people across Scotland who are told that the law says no and that they cannot marry the love of their life. They are not allowed and, unless we change the law, they will never be allowed.</p><p>It does matter. It matters that a whole section of our society is told that they can have the facsimile of civil partnership but they cannot have the real thing. It is not for them. Their love is something different and something less. Their commitment is denied.</p><p>I do not want the next generation of young gay people to grow up as I did, believing that marriage is something that they can never have.

We have helped to build a UK economy that is capable not just of withstanding shocks that have holed other European nations, but of long-term growth. We have prospered through our partnership with the other home nations and we continue to do so. Scottish businesses benefit from being part of a single UK market. We export twice as much to England as to any other part of the world&#8212;&#163;45.5&#160;billion annually.

If we were to leave the United Kingdom, it would inevitably mean different rules on the different sides of the border&#8212;there would be different financial regulations, different employment laws, different insurance requirements, different tax authorities and different accreditations and qualifications, and small companies would be obliged to contend with that.

I knew David for only a few short years; others in the chamber&#8212;those from the class of 99&#8212;knew him far better and far longer than I did. Among my colleagues on the Conservative benches, there were friendships with him that lasted half a lifetime.</p><p>As we remember David&#8217;s political achievement and remark on the size of his contribution to the life of the chamber and the democracy of our country, we must remember that politics was not his first love; it was not even a close second. David&#8217;s priority first, last and always was his family. Our condolences go out to his wife, Sheila, his son, James, his mother, Rena, and their wider family, many of whom we welcome to the chamber gallery today.</p><p>David was a man who was shaped and forged by his family, background and city. He was an Edinburgh boy who was brought up near Meadowbank. He started out at Leith academy primary school before he won a bursary for George Heriot&#8217;s. There he attended the literary and debating society, although it was a portent for things to come that he claimed that his membership was only an excuse to sneak out to the nearby Captains Bar for a pint after.</p><p>David then did law at the University of Edinburgh&#8212;he was the first of his family to receive a higher education. In 1975, he was selected as the Conservative candidate in Edinburgh Central. A general election was anticipated in the following year, but that election would not come for another four years, of course. That gave David the opportunity to work with his Labour opponent&#8212;the MP Robin Cook&#8212;on the no campaign of 1979. David never tired of highlighting the irony of that in later years.</p><p>David completed his legal training at Shepherd and Wedderburn and joined Tods Murray in 1980, where he became a partner and established himself as a highly regarded expert in the field of tax planning, trusts and estates. David brought to the Parliament when it was established in 1999 that legal training, intellectual rigour, attention to detail and discipline. My colleague Mary Scanlon speaks for all of us when she says that she always felt like a 10-year-old taking her jotters to the headmaster and waiting to see whether a red pen would be scored across the page. Indeed, I fear that there is a great irony and&#8212;dare I say&#8212;an impropriety in Parliament&#8217;s tribute today. I can almost feel the spirit of David, who was always quick to castigate those who worship the false god of consensus, clamouring for an amendment to the motion, if only to correct a grammatical error.</p><p>Since David&#8217;s death, much has been made of his contribution to the party and Parliament as Conservative leader; the strength that he showed in 1997 after our electoral wipe-out in stooping to build up our party with worn-out tools; the resilience to keep speaking his truth clearly, knowing that there was a space and a need for a right-of-centre voice in public debate; the reward of outperforming pundits&#8217; predictions in 1999 and establishing a sizeable Conservative group in the Parliament; and the personal pride that he rightly took four years later in winning his own Edinburgh Pentlands constituency under first past the post.</p><p>Despite the other leaders having parliamentary experience that far exceeded his, David was a debater of the first order who would often come out on top. A personal highlight for me as a young journalist who followed the fledgling Parliament was his contribution on the appointment of Des McNulty as a junior minister in 2002. During his speech, David managed to remind members that there were but 123 reshuffling days left until dissolution; console the mere seven Labour members who had not yet been given a job in government; comment on the illegitimacy of John Reid, as remarked on in a taped conversation between Henry McLeish and Helen Liddell; score several substantive points on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill; and crack a fine joke about Jim and Dr Richard&#8217;s Wallace-Simpson partnership leading to an abdication. He did all that in less than two minutes; it was a tour de force.</p><p>David&#8217;s contribution did not stop when he resigned the leadership. Indeed, his period as chief whip and business manager during the previous parliamentary session tested his political gifts. His robust but honest approach gathered him many plaudits. David played with a straight bat; he always did what he said he would do.</p><p>It was in no small part David&#8217;s skill, judgment, ability to work with others and determination that this Parliament and this legislative process should proceed that ensured that the fragility of a minority Government did not result in political paralysis. During that period, his long-standing personal assistant, Ann, would often hear him speaking on the telephone to other business managers, eloquently and logically outlining the Conservative Party position and, consequently, how he would vote. In the very next breath he would continue, &#8220;And may I say that your voting position on this is totally at odds with your policy,&#8221; and a lecture on inconsistency would follow.</p><p>David was not above trying to whip the other parties either. Once he was sure that his group was accounted for, he would ask the other business managers whether all their MSPs were present and correct. Given David&#8217;s propensity for checking every detail, he often questioned the assurances that he was given. He would ask, &#8220;What about so-and-so? I thought that they were away for the day.&#8221; On more than one occasion, he dispatched his parliamentary researcher, Martin, behind enemy lines to chat with friends on other corridors just to make sure. In many respects, David was the first-ever cross-party chief whip.</p><p>David&#8217;s contribution to Parliament was not just in the chamber or the committee rooms, as significant as those contributions were. He was clubbable, personable, generous with his time, anecdotes and stories, and generous with a drink at the bar and a friendly conversation with someone whom he may well have just eviscerated in the chamber. He added to the life of the Parliament, not just its business.</p><p>David was no machine politician; he also had a life and interests outside of this place, including his family, golf and his beloved Heart of Midlothian. A regular Tynecastle attender, he would gently tease opponents such as the First Minister and John Swinney for being so-called plastic Jambos by asking when was the last time they had made it to a game. At David&#8217;s death, the Hearts message boards were filled with tributes. My favourite said:</p><p>&#8220;he came across as a great Jambo and a real gentleman.&#8221;</p><p>The message was right on both counts.</p><p>I was thinking of the best words in which to describe David: intelligent, forensic, principled, generous, humorous, loyal, pedantic, irascible, curmudgeonly and combative. However, he had a charm and warmth that drew people to him and took people with him. I settle on brave as the word best to describe him. David was brave to pick up the reins of the defeated party; he was brave to stand his ground, speak his truth and defy consensus; he was brave to bear the death of his wife and to give strength to his then teenage son; he was brave to love again; and he was brave in the face of his illness.</p><p>I know that David would not want today to pass without due recognition given to the Presiding Officer and the parliamentary staff whose support allowed him to attend this place until so recently, and long past the time that many would have been able to do so. That attendance and service took a bravery and strength, too. I thank you for allowing that to happen.</p><p>I thank also the many members of this Parliament, past and present, who have contacted me and my Conservative colleagues to give their sympathies and share their memories of David. He had friends on all sides of the chamber, and it is a mark of his decency and generosity that some of the warmest tributes have come from his fiercest political opponents.</p><p>In David&#8217;s death, the Conservatives have lost a leader and MSPs have lost a colleague. We have all lost a friend. David McLetchie was the best of parliamentarians and the best of men, and this Parliament and country is the poorer for his passing.</p><p>It is with great sadness but with great pride that I move,</p><p>That the Parliament expresses its deep regret and sadness at the death of David McLetchie CBE MSP; offers its sympathy and condolences to David&#8217;s family and friends; recognises the high regard in which he was held by so many colleagues; appreciates his significant contribution to civic life through his legal career, and acknowledges his distinguished record of service, both in this Parliament and to his constituents in the Lothians.

The UK delivers for Scotland, yet it chokes the First Minster to admit that we are moving in the right direction, thanks to the action of the coalition in Whitehall. Despite that, in the same breath he said that he would keep the economic underpinnings of the pound sterling and the Bank of England.</p><p>It is with deep irony that a legislative programme has been presented that will mean that the parliamentary year will be marked not by the introduction of new laws to materially improve the lives of Scots, but by the Scottish Government&#8217;s obsession with the break-up of the United Kingdom and its white paper on independence, so this parliamentary session will be dominated by something that could not possibly be considered until more than a year from now. Clearly, I hope that it will never be considered.</p><p>We await the white paper&#8217;s appearance with interest. Planning for the break-up of the most successful political, economic and social union that the world has ever seen will take some time, but from the evidence of the Government&#8217;s programme, there has been time for little else, and the governance of Scotland is all but on hold. For unionists like me, that is the great tragedy of the referendum campaign, because at a time when we should be getting on with the job that the vast majority of the people of Scotland want us to do&#8212;working together to make Scotland a better place&#8212;valuable Government time is being spent on planning for something that even large numbers of SNP voters reject.</p><p>If we glance back at the SNP&#8217;s manifesto for the 2011 election, it shows us how many promises the party still has to honour. We should remember that we are talking about an Administration that has an overall majority that allows it to do anything that it wants with the powers at its disposal.</p><p>What happened to the grandiose promises to help to create new retail banks and to support social banking? Nothing. What about the promise to create the UK&#8217;s most competitive business taxation system? It has resulted in a new retail tax that will instead burden Scottish businesses with a &#163;95&#160;million disadvantage. There was also a pledge to create a simple town centre regeneration fund. I am sorry, but that is still under generation.</p><p>What about the promise to increase Scottish exports by 50 per cent in six years? The daddy of them all is the non-profit distributing scheme, which, it was promised, would in its first two years deliver up to &#163;500&#160;million of investment in building projects such as schools and hospitals, but which has so far produced only about &#163;20&#160;million of investment.</p><p>From what I can see from the programme that has been presented today, there is no intention to make good on those pledges any time soon. Instead, we have two new bills about the governance of public bodies and four bills on technical changes to the administration of law.</p><p>The proposed community empowerment and renewal bill makes great play of strengthening community voices, but will that mean that the Scottish Government will stop riding roughshod over communities when it comes to wind farm applications? Although the bill talks about streamlining community right to buy in the accompanying housing bill, that right is being taken away from individuals. In fact, in that housing bill we will see the abolition of the right to buy, which was the most empowering legislation passed in this country for a generation and which created a property-owning democracy. The First Minster talks about what is democratically right for this country, yet he seeks to deny its people the one thing that gave them real economic and social freedom. Thanks to the Conservative Party, thousands of people took control of their own lives, unshackled as they were from the whims of local authorities&#8217; determination to control every aspect of their lives.</p><p>Indeed, it is also thanks in large part to the Conservative Party that the proposed revenues Scotland and tax powers bill is necessary to establish a system for dealing with the new tax-raising powers that will come to the Scottish Parliament in 2015. That is in response to the Scotland Act 2012 and the biggest transfer of fiscal powers for 300 years, which has been enacted by a Conservative-led UK Government.</p><p>It is thanks, too, to the Scottish Conservatives that we have those 1,000 police officers of which the First Minister spoke. It is also thanks to the Scottish Conservatives that the council tax freeze happened. We also called for action to improve the care for pre-school children and we are glad to see some recognition of the problems in that crucial phase of life in the continuing passage of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>It is therefore to be regretted that amidst the rhetoric about a commitment to education there is nothing in the programme that directly addresses the continuing underachievement of the thousands of young people who are leaving the education system unable to read, write or count properly. It is a stain on this country, with its once proud reputation for educational excellence, that approximately a fifth of our young people leave school functionally illiterate. Apart from improving life chances and employability by putting in more effort to tackle illiteracy, it would make us better able to tackle the challenges that are faced by the police and justice system in dealing with offenders.</p><p>Today, we have learned from the First Minister that the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will now include the abolition of automatic early release for serious offenders. He rightly says that that practice no longer commands public respect. It is something about which the Scottish Conservatives have been ceaseless in our criticism. Unfortunately, despite promises not just in the First Minister&#8217;s 2011 manifesto but in his 2007 manifesto, the change will not extend to all offenders. Indeed, long-term sentences of over four years, which the First Minister talked about, accounted for just 3 per cent of sentences handed down last year. So, when 97 per cent of custodial sentences will be untouched by the change, it should be no surprise to the First Minister that we will continue to argue that the reduction of prison terms passed by our courts should in principle be a reward and not a right.</p><p>As one welcome measure is introduced&#8212;albeit taking baby steps&#8212;a fundamental liberty could be at risk from another bill. It is the plan under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill to abolish the safeguard of corroboration in criminal trials without a full review of the law of evidence&#8212;something that we believe is essential if the change is not to lead to miscarriages of justice in the future. The precious principle of innocence until guilt is proved must be protected, but there is a real risk that it will be sacrificed to secure more convictions, in particular for sex crimes. Of course, we all want all offenders to be caught and punished, but the price must not be the removal of liberty from the blameless.</p><p>I urge the First Minister, if he will not listen to members of this Parliament, to listen to the Scottish legal profession. The Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates have argued that the proposal will lead to miscarriages of justice without significant change in criminal procedure. Removal of corroboration from Scots law will potentially leave Scotland with one of the lowest levels of protection against wrongful conviction in the western world. So, we urge the Scottish Government not to introduce the change without undertaking a wider review of the law of evidence.</p><p>The First Minister says in his programme&#8217;s foreword:</p><p>&#8220;It is now time to extend the advantages of self-government&#8221;.</p><p>I agree with that but, sadly, the programme is notable not for what it achieves but for what it does not achieve. It does little to extend the advantages that he has, because it is not in his interests to make devolution work as we believe it can. It is in his narrow self-interest to hold back this country, to limit its ambitions within the framework of the United Kingdom and to present a deliberately negative and uninspiring picture of Scotland. We do not recognise his view of a nation that is trodden on by its bigger neighbour, but we do see a thriving nation that is playing a crucial and enthusiastic role in the continued development of the fully integrated family of nations of these islands.</p><p>The First Minister says that he is ambitious for Scotland but, sadly, this programme shows that that ambition is more for him than for his country.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps we should not be surprised that in the same breath as the First Minster celebrates the success in tackling unemployment in Scotland, he claims that the UK Government's approach, which is fundamental to delivering economic growth, is all wrong for Scotland.

As participants in it are acutely aware, Glasgow has an honourable tradition of electing gobby women. I think that Mary Barbour is at the root of that tradition, but her contribution to the lives of the people of Glasgow has had insufficient recognition until now.</p><p>I am happy to welcome Glasgow City Council&#8217;s decision to approve a statue of Mary Barbour, which I hope will find a place in George Square with some of Glasgow&#8217;s other notable monuments. As we heard, and as those of us who are from the city know, only three named women are commemorated by statues in Glasgow: Queen Victoria; Dolores Ib&#225;rruri&#8212;La Pasionaria&#8212;who was a prominent Communist leader in the Spanish civil war; and Lady Isabella Elder, who created Elder park in memory of her husband and is the only local woman to make the grade. Until now, Glasgow has rather neglected its famous women, but a statue of Mary Barbour is a starting point for remedying that neglect.</p><p>It might seem strange to hear a Conservative leader argue for such recognition for a Labour figure, but I think that Mary Barbour&#8217;s achievements were substantial and that it benefits public life in Scotland if we can acknowledge party-political differences while making a neutral assessment of impact and standing. It does no one any favours if we retreat to the sort of schoolyard politics that would try to block a legitimate proposal to celebrate someone who fought for their beliefs and changed the face of the country, for no reason other than that the proposal comes from a political opponent.</p><p>That is why I am happy to say that Mary Barbour was no ordinary politician. She was a campaigning force of nature, and forcing a change in the law to stop the exploitation of ordinary people by private landlords during the first world war, thereby protecting vulnerable families from war profiteers, is a significant achievement that deserves to be acknowledged.</p><p>As we heard, Mary Barbour did not stop there. She went on to become Glasgow&#8217;s first female Labour councillor. She was associated with organisations such as Glasgow Women&#8217;s Housing Association, which was established to fight the rent rises that had been cynically brought in while Glasgow&#8217;s menfolk were at the front. Mrs Barbour was so involved in the resistance to evictions that her followers became known as Mrs Barbour&#8217;s army. It is staggering to think that she was able to attract 20,000 people on to the streets of Glasgow in November 2015, to demonstrate in that cause.</p><p>The rent restrictions act, which was passed shortly after that, brought order to a chaotic housing system and protected thousands from unfair eviction. At such a time, it was clearly in everyone&#8217;s interest to prevent civil unrest, so Mary Barbour&#8217;s actions not only helped ordinary people but contributed to the war effort.</p><p>Anne McTaggart talked about Mary Barbour&#8217;s other political successes, such as helping to found the women&#8217;s peace crusade, being elected to the town council as the first female Labour councillor and becoming the corporation&#8217;s first female baillie and one of the city&#8217;s first female magistrates.</p><p>Mary Barbour campaigned on many issues: municipal banks; washhouses, laundries and baths; free milk for all schoolchildren; child welfare centres and play areas; home helps; and pensions for mothers. Most progressive was her commitment to and chairmanship of the women&#8217;s welfare and advisory clinic&#8212;Glasgow&#8217;s first family planning centre&#8212;which showed that she was brave in the face of controversy and was not afraid to be bold and challenging, if she thought that that was the right thing to do.</p><p>Mary Barbour loved the city of Glasgow but knew that many of its poorer citizens had never seen beyond its boundaries, so in her later years she helped to set up organised seaside outings for the children of disadvantaged families.</p><p>I might have very different politics, but I recognise in Mary Barbour a courageous, compassionate and campaigning woman, who was set on improving her city and the lives of its people.

They do not see the respect that is fostered and the friendships that exist between MSPs of different parties, or that a person can spend a lifetime fighting for something that someone else will spend a lifetime fighting against, but still recognise their conviction, truly held belief, honesty and principle.</p><p>Brian had friends on every side of the chamber and was as decent, diligent and principled a member of the Parliament as we have seen. He believed in service, and he loved representing the people of Aberdeen.</p><p>Before the debate, I talked to my colleague Nanette Milne, who served with Brian on Aberdeen City Council before they made their respective ways to Holyrood. She said that, during much of his time there, he ploughed a pretty lonely furrow as the SNP&#8217;s only representative, but she recalls the unfailing diligence with which he represented his constituents and his party. He took a keen interest in the financial management of the council, and every year, without fail, he would produce a full set of budget proposals, knowing that they would never see the light of day. He did that anyway because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>Brian&#8217;s move from Aberdeen City Council to Holyrood in 1999 was an obvious one. He helped to grow the SNP council group from just one member in 1988 to 15. It would be fair to say that the SNP&#8217;s rise in Aberdeen and the wider north-east was in no small measure down to Brian Adam&#8217;s efforts and his example.</p><p>Nanette Milne and other MSPs knew Brian for decades, and often caught up with him in conversations on the train back to Aberdeen. I never had that privilege. I came to the Parliament as a new member in 2011. Brian always had a soft word for me, a bit of encouragement to offer, a chat in the lift and a comment in the corridor. That time taken and that generosity of spirit were not reserved just for new members, whatever their party.</p><p>Brian believed in democracy, and in others benefiting from being part of it and seeing it up close. That is why he instigated one of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s regular internship programmes with Brigham Young University in the United States. Although MSPs across the chamber have hosted college interns, I have a sneaking suspicion that hundreds of young American graduates have a bit of a soft spot for the Scottish National Party because of the influence of Brian Adam.</p><p>Possibly Brian&#8217;s most significant achievement in this place was in his role as chief whip during the SNP minority Government of 2007 to 2011. Few people thought that such an arrangement could last, and it was largely down to Brian&#8217;s exceptional abilities that it did. My colleague and his opposite number, our chief whip at the time, David McLetchie, appreciated Brian&#8217;s honesty and square dealing. Their trust in the other&#8217;s integrity and their ability to do business helped them to navigate those uncharted waters successfully.</p><p>I do not think that there is anyone in the chamber who was not struck by the courage that Brian showed when facing his illness. Knowing the full extent of it, but not speaking to more than a few close confidants, he carried himself with optimism and resolve to continue to do good service. Serve he did, right to the end.</p><p>Brian Adam&#8217;s death has robbed the Parliament of one of its key figures. It has robbed the city of Aberdeen of one of its proudest servants. It has robbed his family and friends of a thoroughly decent man.</p><p>While the greatest pain at this time will undoubtedly be for Brian&#8217;s family and close friends, they should be proud and they should take strength from the knowledge that he was an outstanding servant to his city, his party and his values.

I am pleased to be able to explore some of the important issues that it raises.</p><p>It is important to begin, as other members have done, by recognising the important place of live music in our culture. The motion focuses on professional musicians in Glasgow and across Scotland. The issue is important precisely because we have such a proud tradition of live music in our country. From major international acts to traditional musicians, singers and performers, Scotland has a vibrant and diverse music scene.</p><p>The public perception is often that professional musicians play to crowds of thousands and are among the highest earners in our society. Although that might be true for a small number of performers who are in the public eye, the reality for most professional musicians is very different. Indeed, recent research that was conducted by the Musicians Union highlighted the issue as one of the main challenges that face those who seek to make a living from music. According to the research, more than half of professional musicians earn less than &#163;20,000 a year, with many taking home considerably less than that.</p><p>It is worth identifying the difference between those who perform for enjoyment and those who perform to try to make a living. We should note that musicians have a variety of motivations for performing. Those who play for enjoyment are often in competition with those who are trying to make a living from music. Others are somewhere in the middle, and use music as a means of earning a bit of extra cash alongside another job.</p><p>Often, for people who are just starting out and trying to make it as professional musicians, free gigs might give them the exposure that they need early in their careers. However, other musicians who are playing for free, possibly on the same bill at the same venue, might have no such desire. Therefore, it is hard to differentiate between professional performers and those who play as a hobby, as they often play on the same stage.</p><p>That does not mean that there are not real issues that need to be considered. The work not play campaign has highlighted that, in some areas, there seems to be a culture in which venues or promoters take advantage of aspiring musicians. If someone is making money from the playing of music, be it a promoter, bar owner or venue manager, it is only fair that the profit is shared with the musicians. That issue is challenging enough to address properly at local level, but I am also aware of concerns about professional musicians being asked to do unpaid gigs that were attached to last year&#8217;s Olympic games. The organisers of Glasgow 2014 will want to be aware of those concerns as preparations for the Commonwealth games continue.</p><p>Common sense suggests that, in that situation, musicians should be remunerated for their work. However, there will be events that might not break even and for which profit was never a primary concern. In such circumstances, it would be difficult to expect a promoter, who might be investing their time, effort and money into an event, to pay out of their own pocket if there was never an agreed commercial contract.</p><p>The campaign website that the motion refers to includes the experiences of a number of musicians, some of whom describe being pressurised into performing at charity events for little or no pay. Clearly, bands might wish to offer their services for free to a charity that they support, or for other reasons. That could range from bands supporting national campaigns such as Live Aid to a ceilidh band waiving a fee for performing at a friend&#8217;s wedding. However, using guilt to compel musicians to play for free is a worrying road to go down&#8212;playing for free should always be at the behest of the musicians.</p><p>We also need to be aware of charitable gigs that are not so charitable after all. There are a number of reports of events that have been billed as charity events with high ticket prices but with very little money actually going to charities. Those often involve organisers and promoters taking their usual fee whereas the musicians are expected to play for nothing. The key thing is that musicians should not be exploited by unscrupulous promoters.</p><p>If musicians are happy to perform with no fee, that is their right, but nobody should be pressured into working for free. It is good that the work not play campaign is raising public awareness of the issues. Members of the public might often believe that musicians are being well paid when the opposite is true. Years, often decades, of hard work go into becoming a professional musician, and musicians should expect to be paid fairly for their work.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683226", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Musicians Union Work not Play Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Drew Smith on securing the debate.

The future of the day centres in Glasgow is of great importance to the people who use and work in the centres and he has spoken passionately about the work that is done and the services that are offered in them. He has set out his concern about the potential impact on services of a reduction in their number.</p><p>Like Mr Doris, I have been contacted by constituents who are concerned about Glasgow City Council&#8217;s proposals. At the outset, it is worth reflecting on the centres&#8217; importance for the individuals who use them and their families. As well as delivering educational and leisure opportunities, the day centres provide users with a place where they can develop social interaction and build friendships with other users and staff. For many vulnerable adults, a safe and secure environment in which to build such relationships is invaluable and significant trust is built up with staff over not just weeks and months, but years. For parents, families and carers of adults with learning difficulties, the centres provide a comfortable and secure environment, where they know that users will be supported while they are at work.</p><p>The structure that the centres provide in the lives of the vulnerable adults who benefit from them should not be underestimated. Often, the programme of activities, the supportive environment and the provision of regular, nutritious meals makes a real difference in the lives of users, as Mr Doris said. One of the carers who wrote to me about their concern said that the centres that have been earmarked for closure are</p><p>&#8220;central to the health and wellbeing of hundreds of learning disabled adults in the city&#8221;.</p><p>It is important to pay tribute to the hard work of staff at the centres. Mr Smith made a good point in that regard, although he was running out of time in his speech at that point. In many cases, it is the relationships that have been built up between staff and users that demonstrate the day centres&#8217; benefit and impact on users&#8217; lives. Given the value of the centres, it is difficult to see how the proposal to reduce their number from seven to four could have anything other than a negative impact on the service that is available to users.</p><p>There are specific concerns about the services. Some carers are worried about the impact of changes to the way in which the council allocates resources to vulnerable adults. Members discussed self-directed support at length in the Parliament and the approach received broad support, but many vulnerable individuals would not cope with the responsibility of managing their own budgets.</p><p>There is also concern about plans to cut transport for learning-disabled people, who are being pushed towards public transport and other alternatives. Sometimes that might be appropriate, but in many cases it is likely that the transport that is currently provided is the only suitable means by which an individual can get to a day centre. I share some of those concerns. It is important that changes are managed as sensitively as is humanly possible.</p><p>As members know, Glasgow City Council&#8217;s social work services sought views on the changes. Many people contributed to the consultation, including some of the 520 adults with learning disabilities who currently attend the day centres. I hope that people&#8217;s views will be taken on board as the council takes forward service reform.</p><p>Given the pressure on local authority budgets, it is clear that councils, including Glasgow City Council, must make difficult decisions about the services that they provide. They must balance their responsibility to provide effective services with their duty to deliver value for money for council tax payers. I hope that, in the situation that we are considering, the right balance can be found, which minimises the impact on the vulnerable adults who have benefited from the centres.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681830", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Day Centre Reform (Glasgow)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Bob Doris on securing the debate.

It was inevitable because the people who matter most in all this&#8212;the public&#8212;had lost faith in a system that was meant to ensure that journalists&#8217; behaviour was kept within the bounds of reason and decency.</p><p>We now have an opportunity not only to restore faith in the regulation of the press but to put the public interest back at the heart of everything that the press does. We all agree that there cannot be a return to the free-for-all that existed before 2006. It is, however, also in the public interest that the Government and politicians are kept well away from control of the press and the freedom of journalists to report, investigate and express opinions.</p><p>After an investigation lasting over a year, it was inevitable that Lord Leveson would recommend a major upheaval of our regulatory system. Indeed, major change is already on the way. Under Lord Hunt, a significant toughening of press regulation is under way, including a new investigations arm, the ability to negotiate compensation and the power to levy fines for the worst offences. Today, the Prime Minister has sent a clear message to editors that those reforms must be introduced with urgency.</p><p>Last week, there was a certain sense of urgency in this chamber, too&#8212;such urgency, in fact, that the First Minister abused First Minister&#8217;s question time to make an unannounced statement on the Leveson report before he knew what it contained. Most sensible people would have waited to see what the report said before pronouncing, but the First Minister had already made up his mind that it would be introduced in Scotland. What he announced was a judge-led implementation body that would</p><p>&#8220;consider how best to implement the Leveson proposals in the context of Scots law and the devolved responsibilities of the Parliament.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 29 November 2012; c 14119.]</p><p>Seemingly, the First Minister had already decided to introduce something that he had not read. He said that the Opposition leaders were being invited to talks because he wanted consensus on a way forward, and then he pronounced on what much of that consensus must be.</p><p>The truth is that the First Minister is in a corner of his own making. He says that he wants</p><p>&#8220;a particularly Scottish suggestion and solution that meets our responsibilities&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 29 November 2012; c 14122.]</p><p>However, the speech that he made a few moments ago shows that he misunderstands the position for newspaper publishers in Scotland.</p><p>First, newspapers here are well used to dealing with differences in Scots law while operating under one UK system of regulation, no matter how discredited that system may now be. Indeed, if there were problems with the Press Complaints Commission, they were not limited to one part of the United Kingdom, even if the most flagrant breaches of its code of conduct were committed by Fleet Street titles. The PCC has always had strong representation from Scotland, and until recently four of its 17 commissioners were Scots. Scottish legal advice was readily at hand to inform its decisions. There is nothing in the Leveson recommendations for the new regulatory body that requires a different system of regulation here.</p><p>Secondly, tinkering with Scots defamation law as an incentive for newspapers to join a new system is not necessary. The protection against heavy damages for defamation that Lord Leveson thinks his kitemark system could produce would have little impact in Scotland, where defamation damages have long been limited. Unlike in English law&#8212;the First Minister is right to point this out&#8212;there is no such thing as exemplary or punitive damages under defamation in Scots law.

I am delighted to be given the opportunity to speak about an exciting event that can bring the nation together in a positive way, behind a common purpose, in 2014. It is an event that will give Scots across the nation an opportunity to express what is great about this country, and the opportunity to promote our national identity while celebrating competition with and respect for our friends in the home nations.</p><p>When John Mason listed venues and what was happening at them, I was mentally ticking them off. I have played table tennis and badminton in Scotstoun, done a bit of crown green bowling at Kelvingrove and used the ranges at Barry Buddon for shooting in my previous life in uniform.</p><p>Although I am, like most Scots, a very far cry from Commonwealth standards, it will still be a thrill to be able to see those venues being used on the television and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been there, I&#8217;ve done that.&#8221; I think that people throughout Scotland will share that thrill.</p><p>The motion notes the latest progress on the games from the Commonwealth Games Federation co-ordination commission and I am pleased that it reports that a number of venues are either completed or are nearing completion and that the CGF has confidence in the ability of Glasgow to deliver a successful games. I share that confidence&#8212;the new facilities speak for themselves.</p><p>We have, I believe, 622 days to go and we appear to be ahead of schedule. I am sure that Scotland&#8217;s largest, friendliest city&#8212;my home city and one that I am proud to represent&#8212;will step up to the challenge of filling the 15,000 volunteering spaces that are needed to help run the games. I concur with Ms Ferguson that perhaps a cross-party group of MSP workers could be attached to that volunteering project.</p><p>Glasgow 2014 will be a global event. It will involve 71 nations and territories representing one third of the world&#8217;s population and it will attract an estimated television audience of more than 1.5 billion people from across the globe. Just yesterday, it was announced that Emirates Airlines is to be one of the major sponsors of the games, which is again a reflection of Glasgow 2014&#8217;s international reach. The games will be good for Glasgow and they will help to cement its reputation as a truly world-class city.</p><p>I note that the para-sports programme will be fully integrated in the games, which will help para-sports athletes achieve greater exposure on the international sports scene. We are fortunate in many ways that the Commonwealth games can learn from and build upon the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in that regard. At the recent Commonwealth games reception, which has been referred to several times, I was struck by how appreciative the Glasgow 2014 organisers were of the access, the support and the co-working with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games that has been on-going. We know that 41 per cent of Scots are more interested in the Commonwealth games because of London 2012 and we need to build on that.</p><p>For me, the games will be much more than a sporting event. They represent a real opportunity to use sport to benefit businesses, organisations and communities across Scotland and to instil a lasting legacy for young people in Scotland. The venues will continue to be used after the games by a variety of athletes, from elite competitors to young people who have been inspired by the games to take up a new sport. EventScotland&#8217;s games for Scotland initiative has already seen 40,000 people trying Commonwealth games sports and activities in 2010 and 2011, and I hope that that trend continues.</p><p>The legacy of the games can and should extend beyond the physical infrastructure of the houses, the events and the venues. Every person who gets off the sofa, every child who is inspired to try a new sport, every Scot who is proud to cheer on our athletes and every inch of progress that we make as a nation to see and practise the benefits of exercise in our own communities is a legacy worth competing for.

Quite the contrary is true: it is a bill that cannot even decide on the number of questions. I, Johann Lamont and Willie Rennie have tried to help the First Minister. We commissioned a panel of respected independent experts to draft a fair, legal and decisive question for the referendum. We have even written to the First Minister about the panel&#8217;s recommendations and have offered to meet him to discuss them and to help him to proceed with the issue. What have we got? We have a flat refusal. His shilly-shallying around talks to thrash out the issue with the UK Government shows his reluctance to take a single fair question to the people of Scotland.</p><p>What of the 26,000 consultation responses that were promised to us by the end of the summer? Here we are in September and we have not heard a peep. His national conversation has turned out to be little more than a national monologue.

I am pleased to see that the Scottish National Party has found room for measures to reform the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. Perhaps, in the future, we might even see the Scottish Government accepting the rulings of the freedom of information commissioner rather than mounting costly appeals to try to block the release of information on whether ministers hold legal advice on the status of an independent Scotland within the European Union&#8212;all at the taxpayer&#8217;s expense.</p><p>The proposed equal marriage bill has been largely debated through the media and it now will be aired in the chamber. I hope that the issue, which ignites passions and reveals firmly-held views, can be debated freely and in a manner that shows courtesy and respect to members from all sides of the debate, thereby demonstrating the Parliament at its best and ensuring that the level of debate is elevated, and not diminished. It will also be a vote of conscience for MSPs from the Scottish Conservative Party.</p><p>On the criminal justice bill, Lord Carloway should be commended for his work, but changes to corroboration should be part of a wider review of the law of evidence and should not be considered in isolation.</p><p>However, I am surprised by the First Minister&#8217;s repeated reference to university applications.

When the first Scottish Parliament for several centuries convened less than a mile from here, the Queen presented at its official opening a mace hammered from silver and carrying a band of gold that was panned from Scottish rivers, signifying a Parliament that is wedded to the people of Scotland. It sits before us here in the chamber, bearing its legend: wisdom, justice, compassion and integrity. Those are the qualities that Scots desire and demand from those who make their laws. It is, as well as for we who received it, a fitting legend for the giver: for Scotland&#8217;s unelected leader and monarch.</p><p>For 4 million of Scotland&#8217;s people, the Queen has always been there as a constant&#8212;gaining succession in 1952 and being crowned the next year, and beginning a life of service before many of us were born. Those of a more mature vintage remember the vibrant 26-year-old, who had already started representing her father on state occasions, taking up office in a time of grief and dedicating herself to the demands that the role dictates.</p><p>Although there is, rightly, a separation between Parliament and palace, and between politics and monarchy, the Queen is head of state and is an integral part of the process of government. From Winston Churchill to David Cameron, and now taking in Alex Salmond, Peter Robinson and Carwyn Jones, the Queen has been a source of wisdom and reference for the UK&#8217;s political leaders, and her reach and resonance extend far beyond these shores.</p><p>President Obama, in his recent state visit, remarked that when it came to US presidents and UK prime ministers, the Queen had seen off about a dozen of each. He concluded that it made her</p><p>&#8220;a living witness to the power of our alliance and the chief source of its resilience&#8221;.</p><p>As the son of a Kenyan economist father and an anthropologist mother, and as someone who has been described as being of Scottish, German, Irish and Welsh ancestry, President Obama may have more insight than most regarding the global resonance of the current Queen. She has worked tirelessly in an ever-changing world to promote the ideals and alliances of the Commonwealth.</p><p>We must remember that she is not just our Queen. As head of a Commonwealth of 54 independent states, she plays a leadership role to 2 billion people from all regions of the world, and of all faiths and ethnicities. No monarch has travelled as widely nor met as many citizens of the world as our current Queen has in spreading the Commonwealth ideals of democracy, freedom, peace, the rule of law and opportunity for all, with Prince Philip ever at her side.</p><p>We speak today of the great history of service that the Queen has given, but we must not allow Her Majesty to be treated purely as a living history: her place in the world has a resonance and relevance that continues and endures.</p><p>Half of all Commonwealth citizens&#8212;a full billion of the world&#8217;s population&#8212;are under the age of 25, and the Queen speaks directly to them. She speaks to the people of Rwanda, the newest addition to the Commonwealth family, which was admitted only in 2009. Like Mozambique, Rwanda is a country that has no historical links to Britain, but it sees membership as being a mark of political development and the Queen as a beacon of public service the world over.</p><p>The Queen speaks to the soldier joining the British Army, the sailor signing up for the Royal Canadian Navy and the airman enlisting in the Royal New Zealand Air Force today. They pledge an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, and her heirs and successors before ever being allowed to wear a uniform.</p><p>Here, too, in the Scottish Parliament, we take our own oath. With every new intake of MSPs, with every official opening presided over by Her Majesty, with every speech and every debate, and with every pledge to be the best representatives of the political life of Scotland that we can be, we stand before the mace, which was gifted to the Parliament by the Queen, and read the words: wisdom, compassion, justice and integrity. They are the guide for how we should aspire to act in the chamber and in the world, and they are the qualities that have been perfectly espoused and embodied for 60 years by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>I am proud to support the motion&#8212;not just to congratulate Her Majesty on the occasion of her diamond jubilee, but to express gratitude.

I feel that it is incumbent upon me to explain why that is the case.</p><p>We have always appreciated that many problems arise from the irresponsible use of alcohol. My area of Glasgow suffers from some of the most acute alcohol-related health and social problems in the United Kingdom. The fact that there is an issue that needs to be addressed is not seriously in dispute in the chamber, but when the state enters this arena, we should be mindful that many of the policies that we propose will come to very little if society is unwilling to move with them. We need a change in the attitude and relationship that many Scots have with alcohol. Price has a part to play&#8212;but only a part&#8212;and we hope that once minimum pricing is resolved we can move the debate on much further to changing the culture. That is why we must view minimum pricing not in isolation, but as a building block in a wider range of initiatives.</p><p>In 2010, Scottish Conservatives were sceptical. After all, new powers over alcohol misuse had recently been introduced, with little time to come into effect. The evidence that was presented to the Health and Sport Committee on the minimum pricing proposals was less than convincing. However, the updated Sheffield study goes some way towards demonstrating that the bill before us has the potential to provide meaningful benefits to Scottish communities. In addition, I recognise and welcome the evidence from Canada, which has been useful in providing some empirical rather than theoretical support for the Scottish Government&#8217;s position.</p><p>While the suggested benefits to Scotland are difficult to prove, conversely it is extremely difficult to suggest that minimum pricing will have no clear benefit for health and social problems. The case suggesting that lives may be saved, or that there may be a reduction in the enormous number of acute hospital admissions linked to alcohol, is worth pursuing. With such high stakes, it is reasonable that we are open minded.</p><p>In 2012, while we remain sceptical, we are prepared to support the bill, subject to several important caveats. First, we intend to introduce a sunset clause amendment at stage 2, which the Scottish Government has indicated that it will support. A five-year period will allow us all to examine whether minimum pricing can have a material impact in Scotland and will give us the data that Dr Simpson wants to see. However, that will happen only if we are prepared to allow a robust study of the policy&#8217;s impact. We have proposed that outcomes be measured against a control group from a similar area elsewhere in the United Kingdom where minimum pricing has not been implemented.</p><p>We must give the bill every chance to succeed in helping with Scotland&#8217;s alcohol problem and assess its benefits rationally, based on the evidence. If minimum pricing does not make the difference, the legislation should not be left on the books; if it does, the Parliament will have the opportunity to refresh it in the next session.</p><p>Are the proposals legal within EU law? The Scottish Government has stated that it is confident in its position that minimum pricing is entirely legal, but we favour further evidence rather than assertion, given the previous case load of the European Court of Justice and statements that the European Commission has made on the subject. We have therefore proposed that minimum pricing be subject to voluntary notification to the European Commission, which will in turn offer an opinion on its compliance with EU law. We are under no illusions that that opinion will be the last word on the matter. That certainty can be provided only by the European Court of Justice.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Despite the cabinet secretary&#8217;s sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the Scottish Conservatives approach this debate rather differently from our approaches to previous debates on minimum pricing policies for the 2010 Alcohol etc (Scotland) Bill.

This is not a side issue. I hope that the Government, having agreed to voluntary notification, will get on with it.</p><p>I have dealt with technical and procedural matters; let us turn to the substance of the proposals. Even if we assume that the policy will have a measurable impact, we are under no illusion that it will be a silver bullet. Underage people will still consume alcohol, there will still be crime and disorder, and drink-fuelled domestic abuse will still be a blight on our nation. There is no panacea for those issues, and we have realistic expectations of what can be achieved, even if minimum pricing is successful in meeting its objectives.</p><p>That is why, in the discussions and correspondence involving our health spokesman Jackson Carlaw, myself as the party leader, and the cabinet secretary over many weeks and months, Jackson Carlaw and I have sought to highlight the Conservatives&#8217; commitment to further working in areas of education and community support and on further public health measures in order to effect a cultural shift across Scotland in relation to alcohol. I thank the cabinet secretary for her straight dealing with both of us in that time and for her recognition of our good faith while the discussions continued. We sought assurances from her that we can look beyond price and work on other measures to address the alcohol culture in Scotland.

We have heard a number of speeches today on a great many rail issues around the country that are raised by the Transport Scotland consultation document and the accompanying fact sheet. My colleague Alex Johnstone spoke at length about the sleeper services, as did Richard Baker.</p><p>Although it is right that rail changes are discussed in the round, I am pleased that the lion&#8217;s share of today&#8217;s debate has been based on the perceived threat to the 11 stations in Glasgow that are within 1 mile of another station and are on the list. As a Glasgow MSP, I have received a number of representations on this issue, as have others. Glasgow residents have real worries over any doubts about trains on the Maryhill and Paisley canal line.</p><p>As they stand, the consultation document and the accompanying fact sheet make it look as though stations throughout Glasgow are under threat simply because they are within 1 mile of another station. There are 14 stations in that category, and I can assure members that Glasgow residents are alarmed by any prospects of closure. That concern is not manufactured; it is real.</p><p>More than half a million journeys are made on the Maryhill line every year, and there has been continuous annual traffic growth at all stations. The line serves some of the most deprived areas of Glasgow&#8212;areas where other modes of transport are frequently not available.</p><p>Bob Doris mentioned my local station&#8212;Kelvindale&#8212;and said that, despite the high car ownership in the area, the station is well used. It is worth remembering that Kelvindale opened only in 2005, and that it has been a great benefit to local residents. How on earth can it be sensible to close the station now, when passenger numbers are rising year on year, and car ownership is going down?</p><p>We can consider another station on a different line. Nitshill is in a deprived area of Glasgow, and it appears that the station could be under threat, as it is one of the stations on the list. The area is poorly served by buses&#8212;recently, the 45 route was shortened&#8212;and the level of car ownership is low. That may explain why the number of rail passengers has increased by 50 per cent over the past five years. Given that the station not only serves the people of Nitshill but affords access to the Glasgow museums resource centre, which is visited by more than 11,000 people every year, surely what Nitshill needs is investment to provide step-free access to the southbound platform, and certainly not closure.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661478", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Services (Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "With today&#8217;s debate, it feels a little as if we have been here before.

It means answers to the big questions about just what independence would mean. It means an honest debate in which differing views can be honestly expressed, and a contest in which people can advance their arguments without being shouted down just because they do not agree. It means robust debate, not personal abuse.</p><p>It means recognising that we all want the best for our country, even if we do not agree on how that can be achieved. It means acknowledging that the debate is about the very future of our country and that both Scotland&#8217;s Parliaments and both Scotland&#8217;s Governments have a rightful interest in the matter.

I start with the terrible admission that I am not a graduate of the University of Glasgow. Unfortunately, I did my degree 40 miles away in Edinburgh although, as a redeeming feature, I did half of a masters at Glasgow before politics got in the way. I did development studies with a focus on international development of the poorest countries in the world, so a high proportion of my classmates were international students. Joan McAlpine might be interested to hear that several of our lectures were conducted on two sites and by videolink between the Crichton campus and the west end campus in Glasgow. I therefore recognise that the university&#8217;s reach goes beyond Glasgow&#8217;s city boundaries. However, I will talk about the contribution that the university makes to Glasgow.</p><p>As a resident of the west end, I know that the 4,500 foreign students from 130 countries who come to the city are a huge bonus to the life of not only Byres Road but the greater west end. Although those students might not be Scottish when they arrive, they are most certainly Glaswegian by the time they leave, because Glasgow is a city with which it is easy to fall in love. Those students bring a lot to the life of the city. Glasgow used to revel in the title of the second city of the empire. In the post-colonial age, although we might not use such outdated and outmoded terms, we can say that Glasgow truly is a global gathering of people. Institutions such as the University of Glasgow, the University of Strathclyde and Glasgow Caledonian University are some of the great draws that bring people from throughout the world to Glasgow.</p><p>It is worth talking about the contribution that the University of Glasgow has made to the life of Scotland down the ages. Alumni of the university, including Adam Smith, James Watt, Lord Kelvin and John Logie Baird, used their ideas, discoveries and inventions to change not just Scotland, but the world. In the political context, people such as John Smith, Donald Dewar and Charles Kennedy came out of that famous institution. I would have liked to have seen a few more Conservatives, but I believe that the university holds the distinction of having the largest number of graduates in the Scottish Parliament. The university has a Conservative association that I must big up at this point. It is one of the oldest such associations in the country and is celebrating its 175th anniversary this year. It was founded in 1836 and continues to go from strength to strength.</p><p>The 4,500 people who come to Glasgow would not come if they did not get a good educational experience. Sandra White and Drew Smith took us through the figures on the success that the university has had in many areas. That success comes from not just teaching quality, although that is imperative, but the quality of social life, extracurricular activities and research. Those figures do Anton Muscatelli and his team great credit.</p><p>Drew Smith has drawn our attention to Glasgow Caledonian University&#8217;s proud record in the survey, and we have noted the University of Glasgow&#8217;s success this year. I hope that that will foster greater competition among all Scotland&#8217;s universities, including my alma mater in Edinburgh, and encourage them to step up to the plate and offer students from every country in the world the best possible experience when they come to Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657763", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: University of Glasgow"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Sandra White on securing the debate.

Parliaments should not be afraid of difficult issues, nor should they shy away from tough questions. No Parliament serves its country by picking only the low-hanging fruit.</p><p>I, like others, recognise and welcome the First Minister&#8217;s decision to give Parliament more time to scrutinise the bill, to take evidence and to attempt to navigate the difficult waters that such legislation entails. I hope that the Government recognises that the chamber is united in the goal of tackling sectarianism. Not one member&#8212;not one&#8212;wants to see a Scotland where vile, offensive and criminal acts are perpetrated against other Scots simply because of the football team they support or the faith they profess. I have seen today neither Humza Yousaf&#8217;s opposition for opposition&#8217;s sake, nor Neil Findlay&#8217;s assertion of a Government attempt to demonise all football fans. If the time that the Parliament has taken had made huge material improvements to the bill, I believe that the debate would have taken a different course. That is not the case, however. The Government has failed to convince many that the changes that it proposes will improve the situation rather than simply muddy the waters.</p><p>Such worries have been raised in the chamber before. Both Annabel Goldie and Iain Gray have done so at First Minister&#8217;s questions and the response was disappointing. The messengers were attacked, as were the people who had raised legitimate concerns. There was no acknowledgement that more work might need to be done. Raising such worries is not about party politicking. We need to ensure that we get such things right, as they are too important to get wrong.</p><p>It is not a case of just the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green parties saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s proceed with caution and consideration&#8221;; the same is being said by the Law Society of Scotland, the Scottish churches and the ordinary people of faith who have been writing to their MSPs because they are genuinely worried that their Christian teaching and debate might be in jeopardy because of the second part of the bill.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the Government has given an indication that it will look at freedom of speech concerns but, as with other elements of the bill, there is a need to provide clarity rather than confusion. That takes us to the nub of the issue, which is the need to have in place a legislative framework that is clear, proportionate and easily enforceable. On each of those three fronts, the Government has failed to make the case that the new offences that are contained in the bill are required.</p><p>On the issue of clarity, Aidan O&#8217;Neill QC, who is a leading human rights lawyer, has described the bill as</p><p>&#8220;the worst drafted Bill I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;</p><p>The Law Society made several points about the fact that we do not have a clear definition of what constitutes an offence, which have been echoed by David McLetchie, Neil Findlay, Hugh Henry and Patrick Harvie. The minister even said, when she was asked by my colleague John Lamont whether singing the national anthem constituted an offence, that it depended on the circumstances.</p><p>We do not have a clear definition of what &#8220;in relation to&#8221; a match includes. Does it apply just to people who are at the ground, to those who are wearing football colours or to those who are in a pub that has football on? Does a person have to be watching the football while it is on? Does it have to be a live transmission feed? Is it possible to prove that someone is watching the football while it is on? We also have no clarity on what constitutes causing offence to a reasonable person.</p><p>The continued prevalence of sectarian incidents and the worrying events that took place in the most recent football season in my region of Glasgow rightly focused minds across the chamber. Everyone in the Parliament wants to get to grips with the issue, which should not be allowed to fester in a 21st century Scotland.</p><p>Patrick Harvie and Graeme Pearson&#8212;who is possibly the most qualified person in the Parliament to comment on operational issues&#8212;have raised real fears that the wish to get things done has taken the Scottish Government down the route of viewing the creation of new offences as the only option, rather than looking across the piece to see what is the best option. That is why I must echo the point that James Kelly&#8217;s amendment makes, which is that, as the bill moves forward, greater consideration should be given to the use of existing laws.</p><p>There is more work to be done within football, as Christine Grahame, James Kelly and Colin Keir said. It is not acceptable that, when the governing bodies of the game and the league are asked by the Parliament to step up to the plate on sectarianism, the rallying cry of &#8220;It wasnae me&#8221; is all that is heard.</p><p>Throughout the debate, the minister and others have asked for constructive comments. Despite Humza Yousaf&#8217;s assertion, I counted more than a dozen from Graeme Pearson alone about changes that could be made that would have positive outcomes.</p><p>We have seen hundreds of successful prosecutions for breach of the peace at football matches and beyond under the existing legislation. Provision is made for religious prejudice as an aggravating factor in prosecutions. We have seen successful prosecutions, such as that of Stephen Birrell, for threatening communications. That is what we already have. We need to consider greater use of those laws, plus others, such as those that relate to football banning orders, which are underutilised. In addition, we need further preventative measures such as education and early intervention. Most of all, we need the football authorities to step up and the culture to change.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill (Stage 2 Report)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s debate has been vigorous, with flashes of passion and even temper, but it has also been welcome.

Look&#8212;my acknowledging that shows that the consensus has already started.</p><p>There is no doubt that rogue traders present an issue not just in Rutherglen, Cambuslang and Blantyre, as Mr Kelly acknowledged, but throughout my parliamentary region of Glasgow and throughout Scotland. The problem is not trivial. Trading Standards Institute figures show that rogue traders steal about &#163;170 million from households across Britain every year&#8212;Mr Kelly brought that figure to our attention.</p><p>At the simplest level, traders might offer to do cash-in-hand jobs and thereby avoid VAT and a paper trail. The Federation of Master Builders estimates that the UK&#8217;s housing repair, maintenance and improvement budget is about &#163;22 billion a year, but a further &#163;9 billion of work is estimated to be done in the informal economy. That has a significant impact on VAT and damages the legitimate economy and honest traders&#8217; work.</p><p>The problem of rogue traders runs much deeper than just avoidance of taxes. As the previous two speakers said, such traders specifically target the vulnerable, the elderly and the infirm. They cold call and tell householders that their roof needs to be repaired or that their chimney needs to be repointed&#8212;always something that such householders cannot check for themselves. Rogue traders offer to fix the problem cheaply. If a home owner can be persuaded to cough up some or all of the money up front, the trader will often leave without doing any work at all; if not, costs often spiral during work, which lands the home owner with a large bill for what is at best poor work. That affects the bank balance of the person concerned and plays on the fear of householders in their own home.</p><p>Consumer Focus Scotland reports that about 13,000 complaints about uninvited traders are made annually, almost half of which concern home maintenance work. As I said, the most common complaints are to do with roofing, but other common issues are about tarmacking and, more recently, insulation. Regardless of the specifics of the work, the modus operandi is always the same: the rogue traders create fear on the part of vulnerable people by persuading them that the work needs to be done and then abscond, leaving behind either bad work or no work at all. It is estimated that that sort of rip-off affects about 89,000 people in Britain every year.</p><p>As the majority of rogue traders target the housing maintenance and improvement sector, it is good to note that, as the previous speakers have acknowledged, the Federation of Master Builders takes the problem seriously. I echo the praise for the measures that the federation is taking to try to stop the practice. There are measures that we can consider, such as proper identification of tradesmen and increasing public awareness, including community awareness of when rogue traders are operating in an area.</p><p>Members of the federation are in danger of being undermined by traders who leave with customers&#8217; money after failing to do the work that they promised to do or doing a shoddy job that requires remedial work. Along with the Trading Standards Institute, and through the nail the rogues campaign, the federation is working to raise awareness of the problem. Information on how to avoid being scammed by rogue traders and how to find reputable ones is crucial in helping those who are most at risk.</p><p>I hope that the Scottish Government appreciates the significance of the issue that James Kelly has brought to the Parliament, particularly for vulnerable people, and will consider the steps that have been mentioned to prevent the theft in question. That is the appropriate word, because it is theft from householders, legitimate businesses and the economy as a whole.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654189", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rogue Traders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo James Kelly and Bob Doris in saying that the debate will be much more consensual than the previous debate in which James Kelly spoke.

All house building in Scotland has slumped to its lowest level for almost 30 years. The number of houses that were sold between April and June was down by 10 per cent, according to Registers of Scotland, and mortgage lending is at a 30-year low. Nearly 200,000 households sit on council housing lists, and nearly 335,000 sit on housing association lists.</p><p>Against that backdrop, we would expect the Scottish Government to inject more money into the sector to boost new building and social supply and to create jobs&#8212;but, no; it has not done so. I welcome Keith Brown to his first debate in his new post, but I am dismayed that the figures that he brings to the chamber are not a boost to the sector that is under the cosh, or to the hundreds of thousands of families who are waiting months and years for a home, but a cut, and not just any cut: a 40 per cent cut.</p><p>Lewis Macdonald and Hugh Henry feigned surprise at the rolling back of the SNP&#8217;s recent manifesto pledge to boost the sector by building more than 6,000 new social rented homes, revised down in the spending review, but I am not surprised. I remember in another SNP manifesto another promise that was designed to help the sector and to help people to get on the property ladder: the &#163;2,000 grant to first-time buyers went the same way as the 6,000 new social rented homes.</p><p>I am pleased that Maureen Watt recognised the problems that first-time buyers face&#8212;first-time buyers perhaps like myself. In my early to mid-30s, I am still below the average age at which people can get a first-time mortgage: people are now 36 or 37 before they can get on the housing ladder because they need such a big deposit. Perhaps &#163;2,000 could have helped me and hundreds of thousands of others like me, and perhaps Maureen Watt would like to see such a policy actually delivered to help the situation that she has identified.</p><p>Mr Henry also made the point that the &#163;40,000 unit-cost grant rate that has been provided for in the innovation and investment fund may be unsustainable. It is not just Mr Henry who thinks that: the Chartered Institute of Housing says that a number of successful bidders to the IIF will not be able to bid again at that level because the only way they could build units on the &#163;40,000 rate would be when things are in play, such as their being able to draw down on bank accounts that they already have or free land being thrown into the bargain.</p><p>The institute further points out that the level of subsidy will squeeze specific sectors such as rural housing, wheelchair-accessible housing and specialist housing for older people.

As I said in my intervention, Historic Scotland is one of the organisations that is hardest hit in the whole culture portfolio, with a real-terms cut of 24 per cent.

Broadband is important in ensuring the accessibility of the large data packets that are needed to convey properly the details that are needed to appreciate an object.</p><p>Following my colleague Jamie McGrigor&#8217;s intervention, the availability of broadband was discussed but the issue is not just availability, but uptake. Uptake in Scotland trails far behind the rest of the UK at 61 per cent, in comparison with the national rate of 74 per cent. My own area of Glasgow has high levels of broadband availability but very low levels of uptake. That has been raised in the chamber before.</p><p>I see much to applaud in the motion, which I will support. However, I remind the cabinet secretary gently that putting digital collections online requires funding and Historic Scotland is a vital provider of such funding.

Therefore, I do not have the intimate knowledge of the programme that some members in the chamber have when talking about it.</p><p>However, I know that nobody wants to see their community misrepresented, particularly on screen to a wide sector of Scottish society. I grew up in Fife and went to school in Buckhaven. I know that there are myriad ways in which communities can be represented. There were high levels of deprivation, drug abuse and economic inactivity in the areas of Methil, Buckhaven and Kennoway, but that was not the whole story for me when growing up. My school delivered a fantastic extra-curricular roster of activities that helped all the children at the school to make the most of their talents. Mr Coffey is right to refer to the Onthank school and the great work that it does at the heart of the community.</p><p>The programme has, however, provoked a debate in Scotland about not just poverty and the representation of the people in the programme but addictions. I note that the text of Mr Coffey&#8217;s motion refers to recognising the challenges for people who suffer from addictions and lead chaotic lifestyles and to measures to assist those who lead such lives.</p><p>Within Mr Coffey&#8217;s wider point, I want to talk about the new drugs strategy for Scotland, which a number of my Conservative colleagues helped the previous Scottish National Party Government to implement. The strategy is based on treatment and abstinence, and is a step forward. However, there are grumblings that the strategy&#8217;s implementation on the ground does not live up to its aims and ethos. A recent report from Audit Scotland, entitled &#8220;Drug and alcohol services in Scotland&#8221;, referred to the scale of the problem of drug and alcohol abuse in Scotland. We have a high level of such abuse, particularly compared with other European nations: its incidence has doubled in the past 15 years. The latest figures show that in 2007-08, &#163;173 million was spent on combined drug and alcohol abuse services.</p><p>That is not the whole story, however, because Government policy and wider health policy concentrate too much on inputs in drug and alcohol services for tackling what are complex and conflicting problems and not enough on outputs and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;outcomes, which are far harder to quantify. I hope that the Government recognises the merits of the suggestions in the Audit Scotland report on what we can do better to measure our progress on the ground in order to offer help to the large number of agencies involved in addressing alcohol and drug addiction in co-ordinating their work.</p><p>It is entirely appropriate that we, as legislators in the Scottish Parliament, discuss the serious issues of poverty and drug and alcohol abuse, which affect all areas of Scotland and not just Onthank, and I thank the member for Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley for bringing the debate to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649905", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;The Scheme&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I declare an interest in that I used to be employed by BBC Scotland, although I was never employed by the factual department in charge of the documentary &#8220;The Scheme&#8221;.

Thank you, Presiding Officer.</p><p>I am delighted to open the debate for the Conservatives today. I have been a bit of a wild rover of Scotland in my lifetime so far&#8212;I have lived in many different parts of the country. I was born and lived my formative years in the Borders&#8212;a good Selkirk girl. As it is not long past the first Friday after the second Monday in June, it is worth highlighting the common riding and the festivals in the Scottish Borders, which are a huge part of life there.</p><p>I then moved to the east neuk, where I went to school. With reference to the industrial heritage in that part of the world, we have the Scottish fisheries museum, which speaks to us all about where we come from and who we have been.</p><p>I was educated at university in Edinburgh, the cradle of the enlightenment&#8212;not that that helped get me a better degree, it must be said. Then I found my place in the world of work in Glasgow, which I am delighted to represent today as an MSP. Listening to Ms Ferguson talking about what we have in Glasgow, I reflect that it is true what a cultural jewel that city is, not just for the people who live within its confines but for people throughout Scotland and beyond.</p><p>When it comes to fixed cultural and artistic assets, the Kelvingrove art gallery is a fantastic resource that is visited by tens, indeed hundreds, of thousands of people every year. The new Riverside museum on the banks of the Clyde will bring not just its exhibits but the architecture and the building itself to a new audience, showing what we can do as a nation when we dream big.</p><p>We also have the St Mungo museum of religious art and life. Given the debate that we had in the chamber this morning, I hope that that museum will continue to play its part in the educational process in the west of Scotland and Scotland in general in relation to what we can do to move forward in areas that can be particularly difficult.</p><p>We also have a number of excellent individual venues, such as the Tramway, the Barrowlands and the Citizens theatre, to name but a few, and the moveable feasts, such as the southside festival, the mela and Eid. In economic terms, all those institutions and events bring in huge amounts to Glasgow and make it a more prosperous city. However, they do much more than that: they bring a great deal to the cultural life of Scotland.</p><p>I was pleased that the cabinet secretary mentioned what we do in Scotland to help others, such as the links that we have with Malawi. As I represent the region of Glasgow, which contains Blantyre, I think that it is right that we celebrate those links and do more. However, I will leave the issue of external affairs to my colleague, Jamie McGrigor. Despite the fact that he has the most wonderful singing voice of any member in this chamber&#8212;believe me, you have not enjoyed &#8220;Campbeltown Loch, I wish you were whisky&#8221; until you have been driven one-handed alongside it in a souped-up Subaru by the gentleman himself&#8212;and is possibly more qualified than I am to talk about cultural issues, he will talk about external affairs in his speech.</p><p>I recognise the part that culture plays in our national life. I echo the cabinet secretary&#8217;s words about how rich we are in terms of heritage, history and legacy, particularly with regard to the inventions that she talked about, such as the goggle box, which brings all of that to a wider world and showcases it. Although it is important to embrace the cultural legacy of the past, we must refuse to be defined by it: we are the nation of Burns, Barrie, Stevenson and Scott, but we are also&#8212;for better or for worse&#8212;the nation of KT Tunstall, Christopher Brookmyre and &#8220;Grand Theft Auto&#8221;. There is so much of our heritage to be proud of, but that should not blind us to the good work that is going on now, from the physical theatre of &#8220;Black Watch&#8221;, which the cabinet secretary mentioned, and festivals such as Rock Ness and T in the Park, to the hardy perennials of the Edinburgh festivals and the Mod, which I do not think has been touched on yet.</p><p>It is said that we Scots are an oral people. That is borne out by our tradition of storytelling and folk tales, and we have a strong traditional folk sector.</p><p>I want to applaud all that is going on to make Scotland such a wonderful, vibrant, energetic, exciting and stimulating place in which to live, which grows artists and talented people and attracts them from abroad. However, there is much that we legislators can do to help the arts to progress and to open up access to artistic and cultural life. One of ways in which we can do that is through infrastructure.

As one of the many newbies in the Parliament, I recognise the amount of work that was done on the matter by members in the previous session of Parliament, particularly by my former colleague Ted Brocklebank. That work was impressive, but we need more information, particularly following the cabinet secretary&#8217;s speech.</p><p>First, we need to hear more about the framework and vision for a digital network. Are we talking about linear or online programming? Would it be on demand or a mixture? How would it happen? What would the progression be? How would we future proof the content that would be sent out across the nation?</p><p>We have issues surrounding the funding and timeline for establishing such a network. We also have grave questions about the impact on our current broadcasting output in Scotland, particularly concerning BBC Scotland, the jobs there and Gaelic broadcasting.</p><p>I will get on to those issues in a moment. My colleague Alex Johnstone will talk in some detail about the boy side of it: the nuts and bolts, the heavy engineering and the pipes that will take all the content into people&#8217;s houses. Before that, I will come back on some of the points that the cabinet secretary raised.</p><p>When we talked about the problem with the take-up rate for digital broadcasting, particularly broadband and the infrastructure that is at the crux of the debate, the cabinet secretary suggested that there was a deficiency of content and that, if we improved content, we would improve the take-up rate. The problem with that argument is that, in Glasgow&#8212;my area and Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s&#8212;the take-up rate is low. That is nothing to do with how Scottish or Glaswegian the available content is, because Glasgow is best served of all the areas of Scotland by an identifiably Glaswegian and Scottish television output. It is where the major two networks are based. It is where the jobs are. It is where many of the dramas, such as &#8220;Lip Service&#8221; and &#8220;Taggart&#8221;, are based. People there see themselves represented on the screen, but we still see a low take-up rate.</p><p>I am not sure that content is the problem. The problem is that the digital network report and the cabinet secretary have conflated what is free and what is not. Glasgow has a low take-up rate because it has areas of great poverty. It has a low take-up rate because of the economics, not because of the programming and the output. The problem is that, although a digital network may be funded centrally, people would have to pay for the facility to have it in their homes. They would still pay for their broadband.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648873", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Broadcasting and the Scottish Digital Network"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the cabinet secretary for her good wishes to me on taking up my new post as the culture spokesperson for the Conservatives.

Helen Eadie and James Kelly talked about their flickering black-and-white cathode ray tubes, and Patricia Ferguson remembered the days before BBC 2.

As the Conservatives&#8217; newly minted cities spokesperson, I was delighted to hear in the last minute of her speech that, at a future date, we will have a wholly separate debate on city issues.</p><p>Instead of discussing cities strategy today, therefore, I will turn to an issue of health and wellbeing that is of great importance to my own city of Glasgow and which was touched on by Alison McInnes. It is an issue not of acute care, which we have heard a lot about already, but of primary care&#8212;the issue of mental health. At this point, I give a nod to my colleague Mary Scanlon for her continued hard work in this area.</p><p>Mental ill health is a huge problem in Scotland. It affects thousands of people in any number of aspects of their life. It is an element in one in three visits to the GP. It is not like a broken leg that can be reset, or an infection that can be cured. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, personality disorder and schizophrenia do not follow a linear diagnosis-to-cure pattern. Some conditions recur, some can stand alone, some are contributing factors to other health and social problems, and some mental ill health can be the side effect of those problems.</p><p>The care across Scotland can vary widely in approach and timescale and the social stigma attached can be great. I appreciate the feelings of fear, confusion, shame and sometimes even guilt&#8212;at not being strong enough or at letting people down&#8212;that can surround the diagnosis of mental ill health. Considering an approach that too often sees pills as the answer and tells the patient that they will be put on a sometimes very long waiting list for talking therapy before they can see someone to discuss those feelings, it strikes me that we have not quite got the balance right.</p><p>If members ask why that relates to Glasgow, the answer is fairly simple. As with a number of health conditions, a so-called Glasgow effect exists for mental health. Even if we account for age, gender, economic activity, physical activity and alcohol consumption, residents of the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board area are still more than twice as likely to have symptoms of severe anxiety as people elsewhere in the country. If we look in purely numbers terms, that can be played out with pretty fatal consequences: Glasgow&#8217;s suicide rate is significantly higher than that of the rest of Scotland.</p><p>I contend that we need to do better at addressing those conditions for the sake of both the patients and our communities. The impact and legacy of the conditions is great. The cabinet secretary has invested a great deal of political capital in minimum pricing by unit to reduce alcohol consumption. While it is true that alcohol abuse is a contributor to mental ill health, it is also true that mental ill health can be a contributor to alcohol abuse, so I ask that the cabinet secretary use a small portion of her political capital to address that side of the argument as well. Just as mental ill health can be a contributing factor to alcohol abuse, so it is in other areas that affect the health and wellbeing of not just our cities, but our nation&#8212;such as homelessness, criminality, family break-up and economic inactivity. The proportion of people on our streets, in our jails and in the welfare system who have an underlying mental health problem shows the wide scope and scale of the issue and how important it is that we make advances.</p><p>I know that we are living in straitened times and that the allocation of taxpayer-funded resource must be weighed judiciously before it is apportioned. However, the social and health costs of mental ill health in Scotland are &#163;8.6 billion a year, which is more than the entire NHS budget that the cabinet secretary controls. In its manifesto, the SNP promised to support the NHS in making &#163;300 million of efficiency savings to be reinvested in the health service&#8212;not over the course of the Parliament, but in the next year. My plea is to consider whether any of that money could be reinvested to support mental health. In the same manifesto, the cabinet secretary expressed sympathy for a new mental health bill and said that she would consult on the development of a new national mental health strategy. I ask her to turn that sympathy into legislation that she can bring to the Parliament and that talking therapies be front and centre of any new strategy on mental health. I also look to my colleagues on the Labour and Liberal Democrat benches, for all our manifestos stated a wish to see a greater provision of talking therapies, earlier intervention and reduced waiting times. The Scottish Government has expressed the wish to gain consensus where it can, and this is one such area.</p><p>My final point surrounds social stigma. We have come a long way in a short time on mental health, but there is more to do. People can still leave doctors&#8217; surgeries with the same feelings of fear, confusion, guilt and shame, and those feelings can be aggravated by the treatment that they receive in the workplace, in education and even in their own families. Those feelings are often made worse not through badness but through ignorance. Campaigns such as the see me television and radio adverts can and do make a difference to attitudes and understanding, and I ask the cabinet secretary whether there is any provision for such campaigns.</p><p>I know that it is not usual to see a Conservative arguing for more resource, but I am doing so at this time and on this issue because prioritising mental health could do so much for so many across this nation. I do not want to see the continuation of the Glasgow effect. We know that looking after our country&#8217;s mental health will help to reduce unemployment, the prison population, the level of homelessness, alcohol abuse, the amount of acute care that is necessary and all the associated costs of all those issues. It is not a silver bullet, but it is a place to start. Beyond the economic case for doing more on the issue is the human case: there are thousands of Scots whose lives will be poorer if we do not.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to be called to speak in this debate, to follow Richard Lyle, who gave a robust but dignified maiden speech, and to welcome, in absentia, the cabinet secretary to her expanded role.

Frankly, it is an honour just to be speaking in this chamber and to be following the representatives from Glasgow who have gone before me. In particular, I would like to mention the member from my own party, Bill Aitken, who represented the city he loves for 12 years in this chamber. He gave many more years of selfless service at council level. I wish him well in his well-earned retirement. Given all Bill&#8217;s past associations and his continued vocal support, along with other members of the chamber, for Partick Thistle, it seems somewhat fitting to follow him in my first outing by talking about sport.</p><p>The motion this afternoon is wide ranging in its remit, and the quality of debate has been high, particularly in the contributions from new members&#8212;I will try desperately hard to keep up.</p><p>Health outcomes is one of the big issues that have been raised today, and I agree with Dr Richard Simpson on the need to ensure that the qualitative measurement of outcomes is up to scratch as we go forward. We heard too from Tavish Scott on the importance of leadership in schools, from Humza Yousaf and Alison Johnstone on the social dividend of sport, and from James Dornan on sport&#8217;s cultural impact.</p><p>I would like to add a few comments of my own, as I believe that sport is part of our culture. It shapes and describes us as a nation every bit as much as art or music, literature or theatre. It affects the country&#8217;s consciousness and is part of who we are, whether that is on the march with Ally&#8217;s army in 1978&#8212;for some of the elder members of this chamber&#8212;or willing on Chris Hoy in 2008 for some of the younger ones. It is that glimpse of Murray mania at Wimbledon every year, the desolation when our team is put out of the cup, and the disgust and shame that we have all felt when a football match has spilled over into sectarianism, violence and hate.</p><p>Sport has a power and influence. It captures the imagination, inflames passion and ignites ambition unlike any other pursuit. We must concentrate on making it a force for good.</p><p>In Scotland we are blessed with a landscape that spoils us and a climate that does not&#8212;hence the point about the need for summer football, with which I agree. From first-class ice climbing in Kinlochleven to world-class mountain biking in Innerleithen, we have the building blocks to encourage excellence. Tavish Scott, George Adam, Clare Adamson and Jamie Hepburn all spoke of individual opportunities in their own area, and I would like to talk about my patch in Glasgow.</p><p>From champions league football to world team badminton and table tennis, title fight boxing, indoor athletics and artistic gymnastics, Glasgow is and has been proud to welcome the world. We will do so again in 2014 for the Commonwealth games. I echo the words of Drew Smith when he highlights the importance of the good governance of the games and acknowledges that the current preparations are progressing on time and on budget. We need strong oversight to ensure that that continues.</p><p>As such, like Dr Richard Simpson and others I welcome the appointment of Shona Robison as minister for the new portfolio of Commonwealth games and sport. I was heartened to hear that her door will be open to those from all parties who have an interest in seeing the games succeed.</p><p>The crux of the debate is about increasing participation, which, as many contributors have stated, must be done at grass-roots and school levels. Liz Smith has ably set out Conservative plans for a sports trust to help the expansion of community sports throughout Scotland, and I support the amendment in her name, which calls for the Government to make more urgent progress on targets for PE provision in schools. All of us, across the chamber, want that to happen and we are concerned about the time slippage on that goal. I also inquire about the &#163;1 million for outdoor education that was promised by John Swinney to Derek Brownlee in the 2009 budget negotiations. I hope that, in her closing remarks, the minister will clarify when that money will be forthcoming.</p><p>As I stand here next to Liz Smith, it is pretty clear which one of us has been an international athlete&#8212;it is not me. I am a club player at best, taking the occasional hill walk or exercise class, and that is about my limit. Yet, despite those limitations, my life has been immeasurably improved and altered by sport. At all levels, sport has the power to improve mental and physical health. It imparts a valuable lesson about how to be gracious in defeat as well as in victory. It teaches teamwork, discipline and a selflessness in front of goal. It cements friendships and it makes the spirit soar. The lessons of sport truly are the lessons of life, which is why grass-roots and community provision is so important.</p><p>Whether one is testing oneself against an opponent or trying to beat one&#8217;s own best efforts, sport is about the struggle for improvement, attainment and pride. It is about our striving to be the best that we can be. I urge the Government to help us to reach our collective best, making good on its promises of PE provision, outdoor education and making the Commonwealth games in Glasgow a legacy for all of Scotland that is measured not just in money, buildings or jobs&#8212;important as those are&#8212;but in the ambition, belief, opportunity and motivation of individual Scots to go out and compete at their own level, whether that is on a five-a-side pitch in the middle of a city or above the snow line up a mountain range. The work needs to start at grass-roots level now for us to build ourselves a healthier, happier and more ambitious nation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to close this debate for the Conservatives.
