We tried hard to ensure that it did not happen, but it has happened. As you have suggested, we will reflect on how we can avoid its happening in the future. Once the information had appeared in the public sphere, I sent out a briefing note to Opposition members to ensure that they were aware of as much of the information as possible. Nevertheless, I regret the release of the information.</p><p>As Scotland prepares to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice during the great war, we should pause also to remember those who returned from that war injured and, in many cases, broken in other ways. They believed that they would return home to a land fit for heroes. Instead they came back, by and large, to poor housing, the prospect of unemployment and very little in the way of welfare support. Ours is a different society, and although we always strive to do more, those who leave the armed forces today have access to a wide range of support and services. In one vital respect, however, it can be argued that that earlier generation had one factor in their favour: the many people from this country who served in that conflict had a common experience and its horrors were shared on a much larger scale than is the case for those who serve today and return to join civic society.</p><p>Experience of active service is shared by far fewer people today, which reflects our success in avoiding wars on the scale of those that we had in the early part of the previous century. That also provides a strong reason why we must continue to provide particular support to veterans, many of whom have experienced conflict of one sort or another and have served with honour and pride, and have given up many of the individual freedoms that we take for granted. Not just for that reason, but for others, too, we owe them a debt of gratitude. By and large, our veterans are innovative, hard-working, entrepreneurial and civic-minded people, and they generally play a full part in making Scotland successful.</p><p>Veterans Scotland estimates that there are about 400,000 veterans in Scotland, which is almost 8 per cent of the population, and about 2,000 service leavers return to civilian life annually. Many make the transition relatively seamlessly, but a small number face particular difficulties and require our support. In some cases, we must ensure that they get special treatment in recognition of the special circumstances that they have had to endure, and I make no apology for taking that action.</p><p>In 2012, the excellent armed services advice project&#8212;ASAP&#8212;reported that although veterans often have similar support needs to the wider population, the experience of serving can also result in multiple and complex needs. Those needs can relate to welfare, access to benefits, getting back into employment, health issues or financial and debt issues, and their causes can often be traced back to the veteran&#8217;s initial transition to civilian life. The ASAP report notes that in spite of the support and advice that is available, too many veterans in Scotland slip through the net. Some continue for many years after leaving to experience problems resulting from that unsuccessful transition. That is why it is so important that we get it right at the point of transition, but it is clear that the current transition process is failing some of our veterans. That is particularly the case for early service leavers, who are not eligible for the full Ministry of Defence resettlement package, which is offered to veterans who have more than four years&#8217; service.</p><p>In my previous role, I served in an education capacity; I remember the issues and discussions that we had then about the transition from primary school to secondary school. I am not saying that that transition is completely analogous to the transition that people make from military life to civilian life, but a fairly substantial change takes place and some of the issues are similar. It is really important that we get the transition right. Early service leavers account for half of all those who make the transition to civilian life in any given year, and some find themselves ill equipped to cope. The transition mapping study that was produced by the Forces in Mind Trust last August projected that the cost of poor transition across the United Kingdom would rise to &#163;122&#160;million in 2013.</p><p>Much of the responsibility for meeting the needs of service leavers in Scotland falls to the Scottish Government and to devolved public services. It is a responsibility that we take seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that they receive the full range of support. Had we the full range of powers, we would design an holistic framework of support running seamlessly from enlistment to transition.</p><p>However, transition is currently the responsibility of the UK Government. I saw how the process could be managed when I talked to people in Canada who are involved in the transition process. They, too, take a holistic approach to people serving and moving into civilian life. I have told many UK ministers over a number of years that, on the very day when somebody joins the services, we should start a plan for their return to employment and for their housing provision when they eventually leave the service.</p><p>I look forward to seeing the outcome of the UK Government&#8217;s veterans transition review, which we expect to report in February. I have made known to Lord Ashcroft my views on the failings of the current system of transition, and we have shared some suggestions for concrete improvements.</p><p>Working within our devolved powers, our priority remains the removal of any disadvantage that our veterans face in accessing public services in a way that suits their unique circumstances. Lord Ashcroft&#8217;s team said that the support that is provided in Scotland to services personnel who enter civilian life is a model to be recommended.</p><p>In September 2012, we published &#8220;Our Commitments: Scottish Government Support for the Armed Forces Community in Scotland&#8221;, which details the support that we provide to members of the armed forces and veterans. That support covers health, education, housing, justice and sport. The paper was widely welcomed by veterans organisations, as well as by the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces. They told us that it lays the foundations of an on-going productive relationship with them. It reaffirmed our clear and unequivocal message that the armed forces, their families and veterans remain at the centre of our policy thinking, as well as of our development and delivery of policies.</p><p>We have made considerable progress, which has been underpinned by significant funding commitments. We have committed more than &#163;3.5&#160;million to projects across Scotland that provide housing and support services for veterans and disabled ex-service personnel. We have implemented the recommendations of both Murrison reports by providing &#163;2&#160;million for a new national state-of-the-art prosthetics service, and more than &#163;1.2&#160;million of funding per year for specialist mental health services. We have also improved access to national health service services, which has included provision of access to priority treatment through new general practitioner forms, the roll-out of community health index numbers to serving personnel, and provision of a veterans&#8217; health zone on the www.nhsinform.co.uk website.</p><p>Those successes have been made possible through working with our strategic partners, the NHS, local authorities and wider public bodies. I pay particular tribute to the ex-services sector: Veterans Scotland and others play a vital role as champions and advocates, as disseminators of good practice and in representing the interests of veterans across Scotland. That is why in November I announced that the Scottish Government would provide Veterans Scotland with capacity-building funding of &#163;220,000 over the next two financial years. Along with a significant increase to the Scottish veterans fund, that is further evidence of our whole-hearted support for those who have served.</p><p>However, we must seek to do more and, in particular, to help veterans who slip through the net. I believe that the time is right for us to step up our commitment and to shape a response that addresses the distinct needs of veterans, and which supports public services to meet expectations for them.</p><p>Having reflected on the models that I have seen in Canada and elsewhere, I am pleased to announce the creation of a new commissioner dedicated to veterans. The Scottish veterans commissioner will have a broad remit, which will involve taking an overview of support services across Scotland. Through thematic inquiries, the commissioner will identify the need for, and will help to drive, changes that will enable those services to support veterans better.</p><p>We must ask why some veterans are still struggling to access the help that they deserve, where the gaps are and what more we can do to meet our obligations to those who have served. As I have said, we must ensure that at the first point at which a veteran tries to access public services&#8212;whether it is the council, the Government or the health service&#8212;they get the right response at the right time, because if they do not, many will not come back to seek that support, as we have found in the past.</p><p>Working with partners, the commissioner will bring renewed focus and momentum to our ambition to develop leading-edge support for veterans across our devolved responsibilities. The commissioner&#8217;s recommendations will help to build leadership and direction on veterans policy in partnership&#8212;crucially, that will be done with the strong ex-services sector. The unique role of veterans organisations in Scotland will be pivotal, and the expertise and evidence of the Royal British Legion Scotland, Poppyscotland and others will be drawn on to capture the experience of veterans. The veteran&#8217;s perspective will be fundamental to the work of the commissioner and will inform investigations and recommendations for improvement.</p><p>However, the commissioner will not be a complaints arbitration service; we will ensure that the commissioner&#8217;s remit does not duplicate the functions of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman and others. We will take the time to listen to and take on board the views of key partners&#8212;especially Veterans Scotland&#8212;in order to help to shape the commissioner&#8217;s remit and work programme before the post is advertised.</p><p>I have set out what we have done to support our veterans to date and how we now propose to do more, through the development of a Scottish veterans commissioner. We will continue to work with veterans charities and public sector providers to ensure that we meet the aspirations and expectations of Scotland&#8217;s veterans.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament acknowledges the debt of gratitude that Scotland owes to those who have served in defence of freedom; notes that, since the publication of Our Commitments: Scottish Government Support for the Armed Forces Community in Scotland in September 2012, the Scottish Government has continued to provide support to the armed forces and veterans&#8217; communities in Scotland that has been widely welcomed by the military and the ex-service community; commends the partnership working with stakeholders, which has led to improved support, including capacity-building funding for Veterans Scotland, and further notes the Scottish Government&#8217;s intention to ensure that the response to the UK Government&#8217;s Veterans&#8217; Transition Review addresses the distinct needs of Scottish veterans and supports public services to meet their expectations; recognises the excellent work of veterans&#8217; organisations in supporting veterans; welcomes the number of Veterans&#8217; Champions across Scotland, and endorses the aim of ensuring that local services are better integrated to support Scotland&#8217;s veterans.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838931", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I note your comments about the release of information.

However, on the two substantive criticisms, which I think were made by Alex Johnstone and Liam McArthur and were to do with remit and resources, I said in my opening speech that we are not only applying new resources to the post, which have been found from the Scottish Government, although not from the veterans budget, but putting additional money&#8212;about &#163;100,000, I think&#8212;into capacity building. Liam McArthur suggested that money should be used in that way. I therefore thought that we had covered the issue and allowed for unanimous support for the post.</p><p>On remit, I said that we intend to consult further, not least with Veterans Scotland. If members have suggestions, I will be more than willing to listen to them. On Alex Fergusson&#8217;s point, it is certainly not my view that the commissioner should have oversight of the charities that comprise Veterans Scotland. I have made that point to Veterans Scotland, and I am sure that it will not be suggested that such oversight form part of the commissioner&#8217;s remit.</p><p>I think that the proposal is positive and is of a piece with the Government&#8217;s approach, which has been pretty innovative. The first minister to have responsibility for veterans&#8212;Stewart Maxwell, who is in the chamber&#8212;was appointed back in 2007. He established the Scottish veterans fund, which was the first such fund in Scotland. The paper, &#8220;Our Commitments: Scottish Government Support for the Armed Forces Community in Scotland&#8221;, represented a new departure and set out expectations on how Government and others should meet veterans&#8217; needs.</p><p>As Alex Fergusson said, there is also the cross-party group on armed forces veterans.

Whether we are talking about the Government or the Parliament, we have upped our game on veterans over the past few years.</p><p>It is not the case that whenever there is a debate on veterans we should all naturally fall into consensus mode. I have never thought that. However, it would be useful to have a consensus about the role that we expect the commissioner to undertake. Given the assurance that resources will not come from other veterans-related activities&#8212;in fact, additional money is going into such activities&#8212;and the assurance about consultation on the commissioner&#8217;s remit, I hope that we will be able to reach unanimity.</p><p>Mark Griffin mentioned support for Britain&#8217;s reservists and employers. I am involved with SaBRE, although I have to say that I have attended my local organisation fairly infrequently. The organisation is important and looks after the interests of reservists and other parts of the armed forces.</p><p>Many organisations have been mentioned and it is perhaps invidious of me to mention only two or three, but given that a number of members mentioned Scottish Veterans Residences, I take the opportunity to thank very much Lieutenant Colonel Ian Ballantyne, who recently retired from the post of chief executive of the organisation. He happens to have been my company commander when I served in the Falklands and has had a fantastic career since then. He is succeeded in his post by Phil Cox, who I am sure will continue the good work that the organisation does.</p><p>As we set out in &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future: Your Guide to an Independent Scotland&#8221;, irrespective of the outcome of the referendum&#8212;I go back to a point that Alex Fergusson made&#8212;there has been a fairly substantial consensus on and a very progressive approach to veterans affairs by the Parliament and the parties in it. I hope that that will continue, regardless of either constitutional or political change in the future, and I believe that it will, not least because of the point that Ken Macintosh, I think, made. Over the past few years, there seems to have been an increasing appreciation of the role of the armed services, and people seem to be able to divorce that appreciation from any views that they may have on the conflict in which the armed services are serving. That is a very welcome development, and we hope that it will continue.</p><p>I will not go into all the stuff about constitutional change, but Nigel Don made one or two points, one of which in particular bears repeating. It related to the idea of no compulsory redundancies. It could be said that that is really a matter for the Government to take on if the result of the independence vote is yes, but it is important in this context because compulsory redundancies make people veterans by force and make their becoming veterans much more traumatic, not least if they have been serving on the front line and are suddenly presented with a P45 and told that they are no longer required. That is why it was important to mention that issue. We are committed to delivering better outcomes for those who have, in many cases, sacrificed a great deal to defend our freedoms, and to ensuring that that better deal is felt across all our devolved responsibilities.</p><p>The creation of the post of veterans commissioner is an attempt to take that forward. As I have said, we are still willing to listen to what others have to say, but my view is that the very good things that are currently being done can be pulled up to a higher level. Mark Griffin made a point about what has been done in respect of housing in North Lanarkshire. I hope that the commissioner will be able to see, in looking at that, that it is an excellent development and that they will ask why it cannot happen elsewhere, why there is not uniformity, if that is required, and whether it would be easier for veterans who may have joined up in one location and have perhaps become a veteran in a different location to have a better and more uniform approach to the services that they require. Such uniformity may not be needed, but the commissioner could usefully take up such issues. As I mentioned at the start of the debate, thematic inquiries could be undertaken into some of the current provision.</p><p>The commissioner is therefore of a piece with a fairly progressive approach that the Government has taken. It is the first such post in the UK. We and the UK Government have looked at the issue of an ombudsman. I refute the idea that things were done in a hurry; the idea has been developed over many months and there have been a number of discussions, not least to find out what has been done in Canada. We have not followed the same model. The comments that were made about the plethora of ombudsman-type positions are true. However, as I said in my opening speech, we are not saying that the person should be responsible for taking up individual cases, although they can listen to individual veterans.</p><p>To respond to another point, the post will not be paid for by the Parliament; it will be paid for by the Scottish Government as part of the veterans activities that we undertake.</p><p>Members have a real opportunity to agree on the commissioner&#8217;s role and to see whether the commissioner can start to make the difference that the ombudsman&#8217;s role in Canada has made, although the roles will not be the same. The role in Canada has made a great difference to veterans there. From what I have heard from around the world, I believe that it very much depends on the individual who is selected to do the work. The important thing is not the statutory underpinning of the post. The appointment will not be a statutory appointment in the way that Alex Johnstone described; it will be made by the Scottish Government. What is really important is the person&#8217;s standing in the veterans community and whether they are credible and understand the issues that are at stake.</p><p>I would like the commissioner not only to address the needs of veterans who are particularly disadvantaged, but to develop a wider focus on unlocking the potential of veterans so that their skills and experience can be brought to bear for the benefit of all Scotland. Most members present must have heard a veteran who was looking for a job on leaving the service say to them, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not really qualified to do anything.&#8221; They are completely unaware of the skills that they have developed over a number of years in the services. It is incumbent on all of us, and it will be incumbent on the commissioner, to ensure that people realise their potential when they rejoin civilian life.</p><p>Members have commented on the first world war and the commemoration of it. I was asked to do a foreword for a study on the war memorial in Dunblane, which went through every individual on the memorial. The first people to lay a wreath at that war memorial&#8212;in 1921, I think&#8212;were a mother and father who had lost three of their four sons in the conflict. To go back to a point that was made earlier, it was really interesting to go through the individual stories of each of the people involved, as they are often forgotten. We see the names, but it is very important to remember that that those people were part of a family and a community and to find out what their role was.</p><p>On other kinds of service, Ken Macintosh mentioned football. I once played against a services outfit. He said that I was &#8220;useful&#8221;, but I think that I was just too slow to get out of the way and nearly severely injured one of the very fast service personnel who was playing against us. I was also happy to play against a Hearts legends team&#8212;it is never a hard task to play against a Hearts team, admittedly&#8212;although they beat us, I think, 13-2. Hearts have a proud tradition of working with Erskine and all that goes with the history of Hearts. I am not sure that I will be present when the fixture comes up next time, but I will certainly be there in spirit.</p><p>I close by again recording my thanks to the vast and diverse array of veterans charities. Some people have suggested that there could be a role for the commissioner in bringing them together or putting them in order, but it is not about that&#8212;it is about something else entirely. We are just trying to ensure that the services are right. The charities do a considerable amount of work on behalf of veterans, providing advice, assistance and support as well as signposting to services elsewhere. They also represent veterans at local and national levels and inform our policy thinking and development, which is an invaluable role. I congratulate them on all their fantastic work. They support the estimated 400,000 veterans in Scotland, for which they have our gratitude.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838931", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to all members who have spoken.

Perhaps we would not do that in the course of this debate, but we should all from time to time check the arguments that we are deploying and the effects that they would have.

I wrote to her on 25 June to ask whether she could clarify whether Scottish Labour would commit to work with the Scottish Government to give our shipyards the best possible chance of winning this contract as soon as possible, thus safeguarding hundreds of jobs and the local communities that depend on them. I still have not had a response from her. Perhaps that colours my view of her call for cross-party working. I welcome the commitment from Alex Johnstone to cross-party working.

Duncan McNeil has not said one word about the fact that, as I have pointed out, the UK Government is responsible for diversification, as it is responsible for defence. It has some responsibility, as well. As soon as I raised that issue, his response was, &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t look back.&#8221; His first point was, &#8220;What have we done up till now?&#8221; All that I am saying is that we should be even-handed.

Tavish Scott&#8217;s question hints at the amendment that he proposed in relation to further work between Edinburgh and Glasgow on, for example, the high-speed line. However, we are of the view that the improvements that we are making to lines north of Edinburgh and Glasgow will benefit from EGIP freeing up capacity for points north and that high-speed rail will benefit the whole of Scotland if it comes to Scotland from London, as we think it should.</p><p>The completed projects are expected to generate billions of pounds in benefits over the next 30 years through better journey times and reliability, improved safety, reductions in emissions and better choice, all of which will improve the quality of life of people who live and work in Scotland. Businesses will reap the benefits, too, through reduced operating costs and improved access to key housing and employment sites.</p><p>We can see the benefits now. The Airdrie to Bathgate rail link and the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line are giving people more choice in using the train rather than the car, and patronage is running well above the levels that were initially predicted. The Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line, which was projected to carry around 80,000 passengers a year, carried more than 400,000 passengers in its first year.</p><p>Roads are also a fundamental part of transport infrastructure&#8212;they help public transport and active travel, too&#8212;and the new M74 through Glasgow is cutting journey times by more than 15 minutes. Claudia Beamish asked about air quality. Previously, in the mornings and afternoons, people could be stopped for long periods at the Kingston bridge, but they now have far better journey times and a far smoother journey. Air quality is improved by our having made that investment, so it has been important for the environment as well, and the project provided a much-needed catalyst for the regeneration of the east end of Glasgow.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s infrastructure investment plan sets out our investment priorities for the future. In the short term, it is stimulating the economy and boosting the construction sector. Construction Scotland says that, for every &#163;1 that is spent on construction output, a further &#163;2.94 is generated in the economy. The largest of the current projects is the Queensferry crossing, which has been under construction&#8212;under the water, in many places&#8212;for more than two years and is under budget and on programme. That project not only is providing a vital future crossing across the Forth, but currently employs around 850 people on site, with 365 Scottish businesses having benefited from the project. Between them those businesses have been awarded orders worth about &#163;143&#160;million to date&#8212;money that is going straight back into the Scottish economy. Moreover, the latest projections put the cost of the project at around two thirds of its original budget, which was between &#163;1.75&#160;billion and &#163;2.3&#160;billion. The current estimated cost is around &#163;1.4&#160;billion.</p><p>We shared the frustrations of people in the Aberdeen area that were caused by the legal challenges to the Aberdeen western peripheral route, but both that project and the Balmedie to Tipperty project are now out to tender, with construction on programme to start in the autumn next year.

We do not have complete motorway between our two major cities, but that will now change with the M8 Baillieston to Newhouse upgrade.

We need to do in-depth planning to ensure that we deliver the right scheme at the right price and keep impacts on communities, businesses and the environment to an absolute minimum.</p><p>I will say a word on keeping costs down. I once met a previous transport minister from the Parliament in Waverley station. He commended the Government on having brought some of those projects in on price and on time and said, &#8220;You must have to meet with these people every week.&#8221; That is exactly what we do. I was appalled to hear in the debate on high-speed rail in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom Government anticipated a six-monthly report&#8212;in fact, it ruled out a six-monthly report, preferring annual reports. It really is necessary to keep on top of such projects.</p><p>We make no apologies for taking the necessary time early on. We need to get it right&#8212;it would be a false economy to do anything else. Too often, other public infrastructure projects have been rushed and not properly planned, which has resulted in delays and cost overruns when they get to construction. Our track record speaks for itself: the &#163;690&#160;million M74 was completed ahead of time and under budget and the &#163;320&#160;million M80 upgrade was on time and on budget.</p><p>We intend to continue to apply that robust approach to future projects, such as the A9. We have set a demanding programme to have the 80 miles of dualling on the A9 completed by 2025 and we are on track. Last month, draft orders were published for the first stretch between Kincraig and Dalraddy, and orders for the Luncarty to Birnam section will come forward early next year.</p><p>We are the first Government to commit to full dualling of the A9 between Perth and Inverness. Estimated at around &#163;3&#160;billion, it represents the biggest transport infrastructure project, by cost, in Scotland&#8217;s history. To go back to the point that Tavish Scott raised, the cost of the project is in excess of the combined cost of the Forth replacement crossing, the M74 and the Borders rail project.</p><p>Earlier this year, I announced our outline strategy for the A96 dualling programme between Inverness and Aberdeen by 2030. That identified design and development work to be progressed over the next few years. I was in Nairn on Monday at the public information exhibitions.</p><p>In my closing speech, I will speak about high-speed rail as well, but I underline the ambition that we have for the future.

It strikes me that, given the 26 per cent cut to our capital budget&#8212;despite what Alex Johnstone&#8217;s amendment says&#8212;and the 11 per cent cut in our resource budget, the fact that we have, by and large, maintained the same level of expenditure on buses through BSOG and the concessionary travel scheme shows a good record of support for buses.</p><p>That is even before I mention the green bus and the bus investment initiatives; the Glasgow fastlink; and the &#163;300&#160;million project to upgrade the subway in Glasgow, which does not involve buses but is about providing local transport.</p><p>Unlike Tavish Scott, I do not have to worry about my popularity with the Labour group, so I will say one or two things that will not win many friends among its members.</p><p>First, we have heard tonight four or five demands from the Labour group, none of which is costed, and none of which Labour will ever propose in a budget, because in order to do so it would have to find money from somewhere else. I think that it was Nye Bevan who said that the language of politics is the language of priorities, and setting priorities is what we have to do. If you want to spend money on something else, you have to say what you will take out and where the money will come from.</p><p>I will give members an idea of the scale of the commitments that the Labour Party wants to see. First, it wants the reinstatement of the GARL and EARL projects, and&#8212;I think, from what has been said&#8212;an additional &#163;350&#160;million for EGIP. It wants lower bus fares, more buses and bus investment, lower ferry fares and more road equivalent tariffs&#8212;which, of course, Labour never wanted when it was in government, although the current Government is progressing that. Money has been demanded for additional rail services, more ferries and more routes, and for the air discount scheme. We should not forget the demand for bus reregulation; the best estimate that we can make on the bare bones of what is there already is that it would cost approximately &#163;1&#160;billion to reregulate bus services in this country.</p><p>Everyone knows that there is not the slightest prospect of the Labour Party lodging a single amendment that proposes to do any of those things. That is the extent to which Labour is duping people by saying that it supports those things when it has no intention of putting its money&#8212;or taxpayers&#8217; money&#8212;where its mouth is.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all those who have participated in what has generally been quite an interesting&#8212;and sometimes even consensual&#8212;debate.

That is a fair point to make.</p><p>On Rob Gibson&#8217;s question about average-speed cameras on the A9, when I visited Thurso and Portgower earlier this week, I saw the work that is being undertaken there and on the Berriedale Braes&#8212;there is no other way to get to Thurso. One misconception that appears to exist is that the average-speed cameras will involve a reduction in speed limits, but that will not be the case until we get to the construction part of the project, when limits must be reduced to ensure the safety of those working on the road. The average-speed cameras will come in in the next year, and the final procurement and timescale for that will be published shortly.</p><p>Coming back to high-speed rail, I think that Alex Johnstone asked why, post-independence, the UK Government would contribute to the cost of investing in high-speed rail in Scotland. Incredibly, he said at one point that the benefit of high-speed rail coming to Scotland would accrue only to Scotland. That is fundamentally to misunderstand the basis of high-speed rail. Even the UK Government acknowledges that, as well as for London, Manchester and Birmingham, there will be profound business and economic benefits for the whole of the current UK if we have a high-speed rail link.</p><p>Recently, we found out that the UK Government minister&#8217;s position is that high-speed rail coming to Scotland is</p><p>&#8220;not top of my to-do list&#8221;.</p><p>That may be the UK Government&#8217;s position, but surely the Secretary of State for Scotland&#8217;s role is to put Scotland&#8217;s case, so it should be at the top of his to-do list. Rather than threatening people with losing shipyard jobs or failing to pass on money for agricultural purposes, his job is to fight for the Scottish interest, so that issue should be at the top of his list.</p><p>Bringing HS2 to Scotland is the most profound thing that we can do to connect the railways between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Let us not forget, of course, the extent to which the north-east of England feels let down by the lack of recognition given to the benefits that high-speed rail could bring to that area. Great things could be achieved by high-speed rail. We cannot say exactly what the costs would be, as I said to Annabel Goldie earlier, but we are doing the same as the UK Government did in undertaking a study to show us the routes and the costs involved. We will produce that information. We asked the UK Government to do that two years ago, but it took until last month for it to do that, whereas it should have been produced much earlier.</p><p>In conclusion, even if we do not quite have the intergalactic ambitions that Chic Brodie mentioned, we certainly have ambitions. I mentioned the 26.5 miles of new railway that we have built and the six new stations that we have opened. The total investment in completed schemes&#8212;to pick up a point that was raised previously&#8212;is &#163;2&#160;billion at this stage. We have more than &#163;4&#160;billion of work under construction or in procurement and we are making available &#163;6&#160;million for dualling the A9 between Perth and Inverness and the A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen. We are the first Government to commit to dualling both those roads, which should have been done decades ago. The investment of &#163;5&#160;billion going into our railways should give the lie to anyone who says that we are not concentrating on public transport investment.</p><p>Together, those investments in road and rail will better connect our cities and help to create growth and jobs across this country.

More than &#163;660 million has been provided, with &#163;230 million being spent on upgrades to the track and the stations and new platforms at Glasgow Central, and &#163;430 million being committed over 16 years to the new fleet of class 380 electric trains, which are now running. That underlines our focus on delivery for the people of the west of Scotland, and our determination to prioritise the right investments and not to flinch from taking hard decisions to drop projects that simply do not deliver value.</p><p>I turn to the context in which the decision to cancel GARL was made. It was taken in a period when maintaining capital expenditure was vital to Scotland&#8217;s economy. Action was required to ensure that the impacts of the exceptional cuts that Westminster had imposed were kept to a minimum. We can all remember the words that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury wrote as Labour departed from office in 2010:</p><p>&#8220;There is no money left.&#8221;</p><p>In those circumstances, we faced some extremely tough decisions. The cuts had started well before that, when Labour drove the economy into a ditch.</p><p>This Government was prepared to take the resulting difficult decisions. A contributing factor in our decision to cancel GARL was the fact that the costs associated with accommodation work within the campus of Glasgow Airport Ltd were escalating. Let us look at some of the facts. Work by Transport Scotland in the first half of 2009 identified a fourfold increase in the scope and capital compensation costs that we had inherited from SPT.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22727753", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Airport Rail Link"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is more than four years since John Swinney came to Parliament to explain the reasons why we cancelled the GARL project.

As I stated in my response to the committee in September, its report is an important piece of work on a significant transport sector that does not always receive the recognition that it deserves. I hope to demonstrate that, even in relation to the Government&#8217;s response, the report has already had an impact on the sector.</p><p>The Government has invested more than &#163;8.3 billion in transport since 2007, which is the largest transport investment programme that Scotland has ever seen. Bus services account for around 80 per cent of all journeys by public transport. In difficult economic times, and despite Westminster budget cuts, we have managed to sustain direct central Government spending on bus services, at around &#163;250 million a year in cash terms. That is on top of the considerable funds that come via the local authority funding settlement. Nevertheless, as the committee identified, it is a fact that public transport is easier and more affordable to access for some areas and groups than it is for others. Community transport has a significant role to play in addressing some of the needs to which conventional services are less well suited.</p><p>As members will be aware, funding of community transport was devolved to local authorities following the concordat with the Scottish Government. That is the right approach, because councils have a better understanding of transport needs in their areas, and those needs are not the same throughout Scotland.</p><p>Despite the dramatic reductions in public spending imposed by the United Kingdom Government to which I referred, we have maintained the revenue funding available to local government. Between 2007-08 and 2012-13, the resources available to the Scottish Government from the departmental expenditure limit and non-domestic rates increased by 6.4 per cent. Over the same period, the local government budget increased by 8.9 per cent. It is that budget that provides the resources that enable local authorities to support community transport provision in their areas.</p><p>As well as maintaining overall funding, both direct and through the budgets made available to local authorities, the Government has made a number of changes that are benefiting many organisations in the sector. For example, last year, we changed the rules on bus registration to allow demand-responsive transport services that are available to the general public to qualify for concessionary travel and the bus service operators grant. At the same time, changes were made to the BSOG, so that the calculations are now based on distance travelled rather than on fuel used. I know from discussions with operators that the change has been of benefit to many rural bus operators in particular, including eligible community transport operators. For example, in its written evidence to the committee, Buchan Dial-A-Community Bus said that the changes to the BSOG have made</p><p>&#8220;a vital difference to CT operators, specifically those in rural areas, and ... supported the services a great deal.&#8221;</p><p>Despite those policies and changes, we know that community transport faces a difficult time. I add my thanks to everyone who contributed to the inquiry, whether orally or in writing, whose evidence brought into sharp relief the problems that the community transport sector faces in the current economic climate.</p><p>Previous debates that we have had on the subject suggest that we all recognise the important role that community transport services play as part of the transport network in Scotland. We appreciate and admire the dedicated volunteers who freely give their time and effort to organisations in their local communities. That is done for no financial gain, sometimes over many years, because it is the right thing to do. Recently, I talked to someone who had contracted cancer. She was a driver, as was her husband, but he, too, had health conditions. On a couple of occasions, because she could not get to the Beatson centre under her own steam, she was offered support in getting there and back by a community transport provider. That included the provider hanging around for a number of hours in Glasgow while the treatment was administered. That assistance was vital to the individual concerned.</p><p>That is just one example of what such providers often do. It exemplifies the fact that, in providing the service that they provide, they are helping people who might otherwise be excluded from playing a bigger part in the community. The provision of community transport helps to support independence, enables people to have a more active lifestyle and encourages less reliance on social and health services.</p><p>I will now say a few words about the Government&#8217;s response to the committee&#8217;s report. I am well aware of the number of calls that have been made&#8212;most recently in relation to Age Scotland&#8217;s still waiting campaign&#8212;for all community transport services to be included in the national concessionary travel scheme. Many members have written to me on behalf of constituents on the subject.</p><p>As we have heard, the committee acknowledged the logistical and administrative difficulties that extension of the scheme to include all community transport projects would present. It concluded&#8212;rightly, I think&#8212;that that would not be the best way forward. The Government agrees with that conclusion for a number of reasons.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First of all, I welcome the work undertaken by Maureen Watt and her colleagues on the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee into community transport in Scotland.

The Government has no control over that&#8212;by its nature, community transport is often provided by voluntary organisations. We cannot insist on provision being equal throughout the country, but we can do what we can to ensure that the gaps are filled.</p><p>I am not sure whether what David Stewart said was a plea for community transport services to be included in the concessionary travel scheme, but we do not agree that that is the right way to proceed, for the reasons that I have mentioned. The figure that I gave does not include the back-office costs, which can be substantial. If such services are provided with a car, the installation of electronic ticket machines is a difficult issue. Without such machines, it is not possible to have the audit process that is necessary to ensure that the scheme is not being abused. That process has to be provided for.</p><p>Moreover, the national scheme for older and disabled people is primarily for free bus travel throughout Scotland. As I have mentioned, community transport covers many different modes, including cars; in fact, the &#8220;CTA State of the Sector Report for Scotland 2012&#8221; estimates that cars make up two thirds of the vehicles used in Scotland&#8217;s community transport.</p><p>Finally, the current scheme offers operators a reimbursement rate of around 60 per cent in 2013-14, falling to 58.1 per cent in the following year, but Age Scotland is asking for 100 per cent reimbursement for community transport operators, and it is not clear how practically that could be accommodated in the same scheme.</p><p>We are very clear that the committee&#8217;s report, which highlights the increasingly difficult operational environment for community transport, places some demands on the Scottish Government. Indeed, demand for services is going up from our aging population, which itself is likely to increase, and we need creative thinking about how we can help the sector further. The committee has made a number of recommendations, including some for the Scottish Government, and I intend to provide practical help in the following ways.</p><p>First of all, Transport Scotland will from next month double its funding for the CTA. That additional funding will allow the association to enhance and expand its work in the community transport sector&#8212;the committee specifically asked for that in its report&#8212;and enable it to build on its 2012 state of the sector report, which represents probably the most extensive research on the subject to date. For its report, the CTA surveyed 80 of the largest community transport groups and estimated that there were at least 100 additional organisations in Scotland. However, as I have said, we do not know how many community transport organisations operate in Scotland. The new research will provide a more comprehensive picture of the community transport sector in Scotland than we have had before, which will, in turn, give us a better idea of the requirements of the sector as a whole and make it much easier to target help where it is needed. Furthermore, the additional funding will enable the CTA to increase the level of advice and support that it provides to the sector and, by extending its CT online portal to Scotland, it will also offer better service information and direct links to the community.</p><p>On the issue of D1 licences, which was raised in the committee&#8217;s report, the Scottish Government will continue to look at options for securing D1 licence driver training more efficiently. Through Transport Scotland, we have already spoken to the CTA, the Department for Transport and local authorities, which also need qualified minibus drivers, and will continue to seek ways of addressing the issue without compromising safety standards.</p><p>The issue of funding for new vehicles has also been highlighted, and I recognise that it is one of the main difficulties for community transport providers. There are two issues to address: the first is to identify resources in very difficult times; and the second is to ensure that we get the right process for a grant system. However, we are giving very positive consideration to what we can do in this area and expect to come back with a conclusion very shortly.</p><p>The bus investment fund was launched in April 2013 to provide opportunities for local transport authorities and others to bid for resources to deliver bus-related projects. Community transport organisations have made a number of interesting applications to the fund in its first year; the results will be announced very soon, and I expect some of those applications to be successful. I certainly look forward to the sector&#8217;s continuing engagement in future rounds.</p><p>Obviously, there are no quick fixes to the problems faced today by community transport groups in Scotland. However, I trust that the measures that I have outlined demonstrate the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to continuing support for the sector, as I think was evidenced in our response to the committee.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have already acknowledged that the provision of community transport is uneven across the country.

I had hoped to be able to say that James Kelly&#8217;s speech was absolutely smashing but, as his subsequent comments about the Scottish Government prove, he is a glass-half-empty&#8212;or a glass-completely-empty&#8212;kind of guy.</p><p>I want to respond to some of those comments. Mr Kelly talked about me wringing my hands. The very essence of wringing one&#8217;s hands is complaining about the effects of dropping ring fencing while not proposing to reintroduce it. Similarly, if Mr Kelly disagrees with the rate of reimbursement, which has been independently arrived at and jointly agreed with the bus industry, it is open to him to propose a different rate of reimbursement during the budget process. I look forward to seeing whether he has the conviction to make that proposal.</p><p>I will now concentrate on some of the points of consensus. There has been a lot of recognition of the value of the contribution that has been made by the community transport sector. I am aware that the transport sector has been described by many members as particularly diverse. It has no predetermined shape but it springs from local communities working together to meet transport needs in a particular way. To endorse Alex Johnstone&#8217;s comments, community transport does not want or need a centrally driven agenda, but I acknowledge that, in these tough economic times, it could benefit from some further help. Because of that, the Scottish Government will work with the CTA and other stakeholders to strengthen the support that we provide.</p><p>I return to one or two of the points that have been raised by individual members. Perhaps I did not understand the import of Roderick Campbell&#8217;s question when he asked it, but I confirm that the Scottish Government does not accept that a failure to provide a concessionary travel scheme covering community transport is in any way unlawful under equality law.</p><p>On a point that was made by Duncan McNeil, the Scottish Government is providing approximately &#163;400,000 over two years for at least two pilots&#8212;one urban and one rural&#8212;in healthcare transport. We will seek applications from NHS boards as the lead authority, acting in collaboration with relevant local authorities, regional transport partnerships and the Scottish Ambulance Service. As Duncan McNeil suggested, those pilots will explore new approaches to the provision and integration of health and social care transport. That is therefore being implemented and I take on board Duncan McNeil&#8217;s points.</p><p>Cameron Buchanan mentioned the suggestion made in his area that we should try to simplify BSOG applications. If he wants to write to me on exactly what the proposed modifications that would be helpful to operators are, I am more than willing to have officials look at that and get back to him.</p><p>Alex Johnstone criticised one-year funding. We have heard about that many times before from different authorities, especially from the third sector. Although that charge could be levelled at the Scottish Government or local government, we are currently in the process of a one-year spending review from Westminster. Much flows from that; under the current situation, what we do flows from that, which influences what local authorities do. There has to be a joint approach if we are to get the longer-term, more stable funding that has been mentioned.</p><p>Mark Griffin made many of us very envious when he said that he sat his driving test after 1997, and I am very grateful that he did not say how long it was after 1997 that he sat his test. I could have sat my test when I was 17, gone back to zero and then sat it again before 1997, so I am very envious. He made an important point about people who qualified to drive after 1997 not being able to drive minibuses. We will look at that and I have mentioned some of the measures that we have said that we should take to ensure that we have enough trained and qualified people to undertake driving voluntarily. We should not be putting obstacles in the way; we should try to make it as easy as possible.</p><p>Elaine Murray made the point that the situations that she finds herself in would make it wrong for her to benefit from the concessionary travel scheme; that demonstrates the difference between us, although it is a sincere point and I know that she is frustrated at the reaction that she gets. Many in the SNP have gone through many elections being told that we were going to cut the concessionary travel scheme, which perhaps explains some of the sensitivity around that area. Of course, Elaine Murray is quite right to say that debates such as this are times to put forward contentious points of view; I do not disagree with that at all.</p><p>I am sorry that I cannot remember who made the very important point about using the procurement powers of local authorities and the Scottish Government to make it easier for community transport organisations to procure, for example, new buses. I have looked into that in some detail, and I was very keen that if the Scottish Government was able to help out with the provision of new assets, we should do so&#8212;as we are doing with the green bus fund&#8212;by buying vehicles that are much more environmentally friendly. However, if members look into that, they will see that there are very few or no vehicles on the market that achieve that to any extent. There is no guarantee that even new buses will be more environmentally friendly than the ones that they replace&#8212;I understand that point. The buses that have been bought through the general bus fund have in many cases been hybrids, which are much more environmentally friendly. I looked into the issue with Alexander Dennis, which said that it would have to have 200 to 300 buses on order to make it viable for it to develop a bus of that kind. If we can work together with local authorities and the Scottish Government, as has been suggested, and start to give that certainty of orders to some of the suppliers, we could achieve even more of that.</p><p>That will not stand in the way of us very quickly coming to a conclusion on what support we can give through a grant scheme to help some operators replace their current vehicles.</p><p>Mark Griffin made a point about the level of funding for local government. I asked for the figures and, in 2006-07, it was around 34.7 per cent of Scottish Government expenditure. The figure is currently 38 per cent and it has been more than 37 per cent in every year in between, which shows the commitment that we have made to local authorities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have listened with interest to all the contributions and, although they have been diverse, they have largely been consensual, and there is some consensus around this issue as has been mentioned by previous speakers.

I also mention quickly Kathleen Welsh, who was a woman with substantial disabilities in my constituency. I represented her as a councillor and an MSP for the best part of 17 years. She worked tirelessly with the dial-a-journey service for many years to help people to access such services and her death is a real loss to the sector. I record my thanks for what she did.</p><p>I reiterate the points that I made at the start about what we are doing. James Kelly mentioned leadership. We are providing leadership through providing the research on the community transport sector that has been talked about and improving the support and advice to the sector. We are also doubling the moneys that are made payable to the CTA, which will allow it to get a better database of information for how we go forward; many members talked about that. There is also what we might still be able to do on bus investment through a grant scheme.</p><p>The Scottish Government is doing a great deal. We are showing leadership. The committee by and large agreed that we had responded positively to the important points that it made.</p><p>In the first year of the new bus investment fund that I mentioned, a number of community transport projects have already submitted big bids for funding. As I said, I am hopeful that they will be successful.</p><p>We have shifted the basis for BSOG to mileage rather than fuel used, which makes sense to me. To some extent, that was opposed, but it has worked out extremely well. We were right to do it. It has tended to benefit operators, especially those in more rural environments.</p><p>There is a great deal that is positive in the debate. It is good to see the level of consensus that has emerged. If it was possible, I would like to get absolute unanimity on one thing: the point that Duncan McNeil made about the jungle of acronyms. He mentioned, for example, ICI&#8212;a name from the past&#8212;and the SAS, although that was the Scottish Ambulance Service, rather than anything else. Duncan McNeil also said that I should not be categorised with Jim Hacker, who was alleged by Sir Humphrey to have been unable to tell his ACAS from his NALGO. As an ex-shop steward and member of NALGO, I am glad that I am not categorised in that way.</p><p>The debate has been genuinely positive. It is important that we learn the lessons from the comments that members made in the debate and from the committee&#8217;s report.

I confirm&#8212;as some people doubt it, I am sure&#8212;that I take road safety issues very seriously and I agree that one death on Scotland&#8217;s roads is one too many. We do all that we can, where there is an evidence base to suggest action, to implement measures to reduce road casualty figures in line with our road safety framework and the targets to reduce casualties.</p><p>I should first set out the Scottish Government&#8217;s position on liability in relation to road traffic accidents. In 2010, the &#8220;Cycling Action Plan for Scotland&#8221; committed Transport Scotland to looking at incidents of killed or seriously injured&#8212;KSI&#8212;cyclists and to examining the implementation of liability laws in other countries to see whether there was any evidence to suggest that the intervention reduces cycle accidents and fatalities.</p><p>As was noted in the refreshed CAPS document that was published in June, we have not been able to establish a robust evidence base that links liability laws to cycling accident rates. The research, which has been circulated and is available via the Scottish Parliament information centre, looked at various countries across Europe and their cycle fatality rates between 1990 and 2010 and compared them with figures for the UK and Scotland.</p><p>Comparisons between countries are inevitably hindered, as has been suggested, by the different circumstances in the countries. Each country has a different legal approach to liability as well as different laws on road speeds, different cycling cultures and different geographies, and there are many other factors. As a result, other questions have to be addressed when the evidence is looked at. Between 1990 and 2010, Germany, where strict liability is in place, and Scotland, where it is not, had similar reductions in fatalities. Scotland&#8217;s fatality rate reduced more than Italy&#8217;s, despite that country having strict liability legislation in place.</p><p>Figures on our reported road casualties for 2012 were published last Wednesday and the headline figures, overall, are the lowest since records began. That is obviously better news than if they were higher. However, we know that we still have a long way to go and we take the approach that one death is too many. We also know that there are continuing concerns to address in respect of pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, although pedestrians have not been mentioned in the debate as much as I expected. Collectively, we must continue to ensure that everyone plays their part to make the roads safer.</p><p>Cycle Law Scotland has been lobbying for a change in Scotland&#8217;s civil laws regarding presumed liability for road traffic accidents. Indeed, its representatives have met Transport Scotland officials twice to discuss the issue, and the Government has not turned a deaf ear to the representations that have been made. The argument for stricter or presumed liability is that it would raise drivers&#8217; awareness of vulnerable road users, thereby making drivers more careful. However, from a road safety point of view, there does not appear to be robust evidence to suggest that the number of road accidents would be reduced if the law were changed in such a way.</p><p>As has been said, first by Alison Johnstone, there is no magic bullet to improve cyclist safety. Rather than one intervention, a package of measures must be implemented, as the motion states. We are already delivering better infrastructure&#8212;although we know that we have much more to do&#8212;as well as the cycling training that Alison Johnstone mentioned and the road safety campaigns. The nice way code has attracted criticism from cycling groups, but it is difficult to change the culture. That does not happen overnight. We have seen, through other social marketing campaigns that have been pursued over time, that it takes time to do that. The code is a good step forward and is not one that the Government just dreamed up&#8212;it was drawn up with many cycling groups.</p><p>On that point, I have different information from Alison Johnstone. I understand that it is not the case that Sustrans supports the change to which she refers. In fact, a number of other organisations&#8212;for example, Living Streets Scotland and Paths for All&#8212;are against the change that has been mentioned. Perhaps that is worth investigating further.</p><p>John Lamont talked about spend per head of population, but he restricted his comments to the Conservative Party and what Boris Johnson is doing in London. Outside London, the spend per head of population in other parts of England is around &#163;1.50 whereas in Scotland this year it is around &#163;4.00 and will be around &#163;6.00 next year&#8212;and that does not include the contributions from local authorities. The fact that we have recognised that there is much more to do is reflected in the increasing levels of investment that are being made.</p><p>We are delivering better infrastructure. Kezia Dugdale, who has left the chamber, mentioned Easter Road. One of the officials from Transport Scotland who is sitting at the back of the chamber regularly cycles up and down Easter Road and feels that it is a safe road to cycle. Such things are subjective and depend on people&#8217;s experiences and perceptions of the environment around them, but other people feel that the road is safe in the circumstances. One of the main infrastructure initiatives that we are delivering, not far from Easter Road, is the Leith Walk initiative. We recently announced support for the City of Edinburgh Council&#8217;s initiative to have infrastructure put in there to improve active travel.</p><p>I have mentioned the cycling training that we are providing. We are specifically delivering on-road cycling training to improve people&#8217;s confidence. In the past, training has been delivered in the playground but that is not a real environment for many parents, and as crucial as getting children to feel that it is safe to cycle is getting parents to feel that it is safe for them to cycle.</p><p>Claudia Beamish highlighted problems with the roads around schools. Car journeys to school are often short and quite environmentally damaging. However, it is true to say&#8212;I am not passing the buck&#8212;that 94 per cent of the roads in this country are controlled not by the Scottish Government but by local authorities. We have a responsibility to help them to improve their roads and there have been initiatives in the past such as safer routes to school. Nevertheless, local authorities and schools themselves have a role to play. Claudia Beamish made a good point about the state of the roads, which should be looked after and kept in good condition. Also, during the winter, we can tackle the perception that the roads might be unsafe because of ice or snow. We are looking at that on a cross-portfolio basis and I have met Paul Wheelhouse, Shona Robison and Alasdair Allan a number of times to discuss that very issue.</p><p>We are trying to address the three issues on which Alison Johnstone finished her speech: road safety, better infrastructure and campaigns on cycling training and road safety. We are also encouraging local authorities to implement lower speed limits, not least in Edinburgh. That work involves the three Es&#8212;engineering, education and enforcement. On engineering, we are steadily increasing investment in cycling infrastructure. Members may not think it, but we are spending more on that than any previous Government in Scotland. At the first-ever cycling summit on 24 September, I announced &#163;20 million of match funding for local authority-led community links schemes over the next two years, which includes money for tackling problem junctions. On education, we have developed road user awareness campaigns to foster mutual respect, which is another issue that Alison Johnstone raised.</p><p>Preliminary results from the evaluation of Cycling Scotland&#8217;s nice way code campaign suggest that it has been useful in shifting public perceptions in favour of giving cyclists more space and respect on the road, particularly at junctions, and in leading to an increase in the number of cyclists who say that they feel comfortable cycling on the roads. There has also been an increase in driver awareness of pedestrians. There will be an opportunity to discuss that further at the next meeting of the cross-party group on cycling on 3 December.</p><p>We have tried to be as helpful as possible on Edinburgh&#8217;s 20mph pilot project, which is being rolled out to all business and residential areas of the city. A 20mph limit has been introduced in other countries such as the Netherlands, where the number of cycling fatalities has reduced as a result. The Netherlands&#8212;which I visited to see what is done there on cycling&#8212;provides hard evidence of which we should take notice.</p><p>I was highly encouraged by the positive engagement that local authorities and other delivery bodies showed at the first national cycling summit that was held last month. For my part, I will continue to seek constructive discussion about what more we can all do to make cycling a more attractive and safe travel option in our communities. The motion makes a plea for us to debate the issue further, which has been echoed by a number of members. I welcome debate on protecting the most vulnerable road users, but we must proceed on the basis of robust data. If people think that the exercise that we said that we would undertake, which we have undertaken and the results of which we have published, is wrong, I would be more than willing to look at other evidence&#8212;proper, objective evidence&#8212;that suggests that another approach can be taken.</p><p>For that reason, although I am supportive of nearly all the statements that are made in the motion, I cannot support it in its current form, given the lack of robust evidence that stricter liability could have positive benefits for vulnerable road users. However, there will continue to be debate on the issue, in which we will continue to participate.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:16.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713818", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strict Liability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been interesting to hear the diverse views that exist in the Parliament on the issue.

It must be recognised that such a cut impacts on what the Government can do through capital investment, particularly under the current devolution settlement.</p><p>In spite of that cut, the Scottish Government is committed to delivering the recommendations of the 2008 strategic transport projects review, including the Inverkeithing to Halbeath line, which Liz Smith mentioned. That will deliver journey time savings for the Edinburgh to Perth route, albeit to a lesser degree but for a fraction of the cost of a direct link between Perth and Inverkeithing.</p><p>On the cost, I note that Liz Smith acknowledged the high financial and construction cost at the start of her speech. The estimates that I have seen suggest a cost of anything between &#163;0.5&#160;billion and &#163;1&#160;billion for the project.</p><p>It is a fact that the 2008 strategic transport projects review undertook a study into the matter and found that the Perth to Inverkeithing proposal did not represent the best value for the taxpayer. That said, ministers are always willing to consider rail interventions outwith the STPR recommendations where a positive case can be made and, of course, if they follow the Scottish transport appraisal guidance.</p><p>I was happy to discuss the proposal with Transform Scotland in March this year. As Liz Smith mentioned, officials have discussed Transform Scotland&#8217;s proposal with it, and will continue to do so. Officials have also recommended to Transform Scotland that it should approach the relevant regional transport partnerships&#8212;the south east of Scotland transport partnership and the Tayside and central Scotland transport partnership, with interest from the Highlands and Islands transport partnership and the north east of Scotland transport partnership, obviously&#8212;to discuss a new study that incorporates all possible transport solutions, not just rail, in line with the Scottish transport appraisal guidance process.</p><p>Generally, our commitment to our railways is reflected in the ambitious &#163;5&#160;billion package of funding and investment until 2019, which will support improvements to the infrastructure and services right across the network, including substantial improvements to the Highland main line and the Aberdeen to Inverness line.</p><p>We have heard that the Government has been instrumental in reversing a number of the Beeching-era cuts and has moved Scotland back to something approaching a golden age of rail. Last year, there were 83&#160;million rail journeys in Scotland, which is a record high. Since 2007, we have invested more than &#163;8.3&#160;billion in transport. We have reopened the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line, which Liz Smith mentioned and which I was involved in proposing as the council leader in Clackmannanshire at the time. We have also reopened the Airdrie to Bathgate line. Both lines have been a great success. As has been said, the Borders railway will restore the link between our capital and the Borders by 2015. Furthermore, phase 1 of the Highland main line project provided two additional services daily as well as journey time savings of up to 18 minutes, which have directly benefited the people of Perth.</p><p>Timetable improvements in 2008, 2011 and 2012 have delivered additional calls and services on the Edinburgh-Perth-Aberdeen corridor.

I certainly know that cities in the north of England in particular are very envious of the Scottish Government&#8217;s record in reversing some of the Beeching cuts. However, we must have an eye on the moneys that are available.</p><p>The STPR was the right way to go about assessing the proposal. There was a nationwide, multimodal and evidence-based review that ruled it out on the ground of poor value to the taxpayer, as I have said. Therefore, we have had the feasibility study that Liz Smith calls for. It is there and it is evidence based; I have also mentioned that there is another route through the regional transport partnerships to have further work done.</p><p>We are as committed to improving services for the people of Perth and Fife as we are to improving services across the network. Phase 2 of the improvements to the Highland main line will deliver greater capacity and faster journey times.

That project could increase capacity and produce further journey time savings in the Perth and Fife area.</p><p>We have announced the &#163;60&#160;million network improvement fund, which will be available to support the funding of infrastructure works across the network, in line with the Scottish ministers&#8217; strategic priorities, which include improved journey times, connectivity and resilience. Liz Smith mentioned the possibility of taking traffic from road to rail. The study that was done showed that that would amount to a shift of 1 per cent of current traffic. That is not insignificant, but perhaps it does not represent the savings or the modal shift that we would want.</p><p>In addition, future phases of our electrification programme will include electrification of routes between Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee, Dunblane to Aberdeen, and Perth to Inverness.

Despite that, our current investment in transport directly supports around 12,000 jobs across Scotland.</p><p>The successful Scotland-wide concessionary bus travel scheme provides free local and long-distance bus travel throughout Scotland for older and disabled people at any time of day, on any route and for any number of journeys. In January this year, we reached an agreement with the bus industry that will safeguard the concessionary travel scheme for the next two years.

When I was leader of Clackmannanshire Council, we introduced Scotland&#8217;s first ever concessionary bus travel scheme that was fully free&#8212;as opposed to one that was free just during off-peak periods.

We believe that, in the times in which we currently live, it is important that we continue our current provision for people at that age. However, I acknowledge the point that Alison McInnes makes.</p><p>We made changes to bus registration legislation from 1 April 2012 to allow demand-responsive transport services that are available to the general public to qualify for concessionary travel and for the bus service operators grant. At the same time, changes were made to the BSOG so that it will be calculated on the basis of distance travelled rather than fuel used. It would appal some people to know that the previous scheme allowed bus service operators grant to be paid in respect of buses that carried no passengers, but the position has now been changed, at least in respect of what is known as &#8220;dead running&#8221;. I know from discussions with operators that the change has benefited many rural bus operators, including eligible community transport operators.</p><p>Age Scotland recognises in its research that transport services are crucial and are appreciated by older people, which is a point that all members in the chamber have highlighted today. Age Scotland also presents some useful information from the CTA on the scope of the sector. Its research provides the following estimates: 100,000 people benefit from CT in Scotland each year; there are currently 70,000 older CT users and 3.5 million CT trips per year; 62 per cent of CT users are aged 60 or older; and 16 per cent of users are disabled. Overall demand may rise&#8212;as Christine Grahame noted&#8212;to an estimated 83,500 older users by 2022, which does not take into account the potential exponential rise if the service is provided as a free good.</p><p>The Government provided local authorities with resources for the provision of community transport services through the local government finance settlement following the concordat between local authorities and the Scottish Government. That is the right approach, because councils will have a better understanding of transport needs in their immediate areas.</p><p>Local authorities can also commission bus services that go further in meeting the needs of people throughout Scotland and in more rural, isolated areas. Strathclyde partnership for transport is already co-ordinating a forum for community transport operators, which will help to develop the sector. That is to be welcomed.</p><p>We have also worked closely with local government to provide fair and equitable settlements. Between 2007-08 and 2012-13, the resources available to the Scottish Government from departmental expenditure limits and non-domestic rates increased by 6.4 per cent. Over the same period, local government&#8217;s budget increased by 8.9 per cent, which is a strong financial settlement and allows local authorities to do things on community transport if they choose to.</p><p>We are also maintaining the revenue funding that is available to local government. The total funding from the Scottish Government to local government next year will amount to around &#163;10.3&#160;billion, which is roughly a third of our whole budget. That will provide resources to allow councils to support community transport provision in their areas.</p><p>Age Scotland has proposed the extension of concessionary travel arrangements to community transport. Over and above affordability, there are some practical issues around that, although many were not raised in the debate. However, a number of issues were raised, not least by Jim Eadie.</p><p>I will listen to the points that are made as the campaign progresses and will study with real interest the findings of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s inquiry into community transport when it reports later in the year.</p><p>13:15 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:29 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692563", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Concessionary Travel Scheme (Extension)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Well, it is the first time that I have understood it to be the position of a party.

I congratulate Network Rail and First ScotRail on their efforts. Although we have benefited from a relatively mild winter, that reflects their successful collaboration. Whether it is in services, lines, rolling stock or performance, we recognise that there is more to do, but there is a good story to tell about what has been done so far.</p><p>An example is that passenger figures today are higher than they were in the last golden age of rail in the 1920s and 1930s. Last year, there were a staggering 83&#160;million passenger journeys in Scotland, which was a 33 per cent increase since the start of the current franchise. That figure undermines the Beeching assumption that rail would lose out to the car and rail passenger numbers would wither. This Government has been instrumental in reversing some of the Beeching cuts and creating for Scotland the possibility of a new golden age of rail. Nothing illustrates that more clearly than our commitment to the new Borders railway line: a link that has been broken for 40 years will reconnect communities in the Scottish Borders and Midlothian with our nation&#8217;s capital.</p><p>We have recently seen the positive impact of bringing communities together, with the reopening earlier this year of Conon Bridge station in the Highlands. We have also completed phase 1 of the Highlands main-line project, which has provided two additional services from 2011 and has meant, from December 2012, journey time improvements of up to 18 minutes on some services.</p><p>Further south, in the central belt, the Airdrie to Bathgate line project, which received cross-party support in Parliament, has provided a new through line from the west of Scotland to Edinburgh, with new stations and new travel opportunities. We have ensured that our new stations are accessible by offering step-free access for people with reduced mobility, and we have increased the number of accessible stations in Scotland.</p><p>We have made passenger journeys more comfortable by investing more than &#163;430&#160;million in new electric and refurbished rolling stock.</p><p>We are enhancing the passenger experience by providing wi-fi and modern, appropriate facilities. We are making strides towards better integration of rail services, and between rail services and other modes. Our commitment is manifest in the recent opening of Scotland&#8217;s first rail-cycle hub in Stirling. That exciting three-year pilot will offer expert knowledge on local roads and cycling facilities. It will also raise the profile of greener active transport options to reach our rail stations.</p><p>In respect of cross-border rail, there have been huge successes, with unprecedented passenger growth&#8212;more than 144 per cent on the Glasgow to London route since 2008. Last year, after much pressure from Scotland, we finally saw the introduction of a full hourly service between Glasgow and London. We have also seen the extension to London of Edinburgh to Birmingham services, which has opened up new connectivity for passengers. The recent announcement of an additional 2,500 seats a day on services between Scotland and Birmingham underlines the importance of Scotland to the United Kingdom rail market and dispels the myth that we do not need more passenger and network capacity north of Preston.</p><p>Yet, despite huge passenger growth between Scotland and Birmingham&#8212;more than 261 per cent since 2008&#8212;the role of the Scottish people in determining the specification of the franchise on the arterial east and west coast main lines is extremely limited; we remain at the mercy of Westminster.

However, I repeat what I said last week: from when the previous Labour Government took office in 1997 right through to 2010, it did not change the Railways Act 1993, which leaves us in the position in which we can accept public sector bids, but only from foreign countries: we cannot allow one of our public bodies to bid.

However, we must acknowledge that there have been decades of underinvestment in the railways. That is also true of the roads network&#8212;anyone who wants to disagree should feel free to intervene. We are trying to roll back on that underinvestment.</p><p>In the presentation in Parliament from Virgin Trains&#8212;I think it was on Tuesday night&#8212;we heard that in the early 1980s the Serpell report proposed that the railways in Scotland should comprise the Edinburgh to Glasgow line and should point south, with nothing else. The chap from Virgin said that there was no fanfare of opposition to the proposal to limit the railways in Scotland in such a way. In his view, no one was interested in railways or in expanding the railway network.</p><p>Tavish Scott said that we should acknowledge what previous Governments did. I am always happy to do that. In 1999, when I was leader of Clackmannanshire Council, I approached the first transport minister, Sarah Boyack&#8212;I do not think that she is in the chamber&#8212;about the proposal to reopen the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line. To her credit, Sarah Boyack allocated the largest-ever sum of money under the public transport fund, as it was then called&#8212;around &#163;6&#160;million&#8212;to the council, at the second time of asking. By the time Tavish Scott was minister many years later, the cost was &#163;85&#160;million and the line had become a freight line. However, foresight was shown in making money available.</p><p>Previous Administrations, particularly since devolution, have advanced the case for rail travel in Scotland, but I think that we are now seeing much greater improvements than we have seen up to now. That might be because, as Tavish Scott hinted, there has been a major shift. There was perhaps a slow start and then a change of direction. We have invested massively in rail and we are seeing the benefits of that.</p><p>We are accelerating the investment that is planned for the next control period. I mentioned the Whifflet route electrification, which will take place by summer 2014. Work on that will start next month&#8212;years ahead of what was previously proposed. That demonstrates the importance that we accord the rail industry and our confidence in its ability to help us to realise sustainable economic growth. We will not price that growth off the network, but will support and sustain it.</p><p>Members expressed views about the state of the railways in Scotland. I did an interview recently for the BBC in Yorkshire, where people say that they are envious of us in Scotland, because we are bearing down on fares in a way that the previous Westminster Labour Government did not and the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government has not. The current Westminster Government made changes recently, but we acted much faster. As members have said, people in other places in the UK are envious of what is happening with railways in Scotland.</p><p>I have said that there is a transformation going on. I repeat that that is not entirely due to the Government&#8212;of course, other partners are involved. However, it would be nice to have that transformation recognised in the chamber, because it has certainly been recognised outwith the chamber.</p><p>Industry alliancing and industry regulation are starting to ensure that we get real value for money. The investments that we make in control period 5, from 2014 to 2019, will offer faster and better-connected services on improved infrastructure, and will connect more and better stations.</p><p>I spoke earlier about large-scale projects, many of which have been mentioned by other members. The &#163;650&#160;million investment in the Edinburgh to Glasgow improvement project, or EGIP&#8212;which should not really be characterised as &#8220;Egypt&#8221;, as I have no responsibility for Istanbul or Cairo&#8212;is a huge investment that will deliver significant benefits for Scotland, plus major refurbishments at Haymarket station. Members who get the train regularly at Haymarket station will have seen how it is being transformed. Queen Street station will, of course, be transformed in the longer term.</p><p>We are looking forward to implementing our ambitious plans for high-speed rail, which will ensure resilience and better journey times between our two largest cities. It would have been nice for some of the UK-based parties to have said what they think about the UK Government&#8217;s attitudes to high-speed rail coming to Scotland.

I think that Alison McInnes basically said that the improvements in our rail services and the 83&#160;million passenger journeys last year had nothing to do with the Government. I do not know how she can reach that conclusion. I am not saying that it is all down to us, but new stations, bearing down on fares, the new lines and the exponential growth in patronage must have had something to do with the Government. We have done things that have encouraged that growth.</p><p>We heard essentially the same line from Gavin Brown, who said that it is really all down to the franchise holders. He offered some recognition of some improvements for which the Government is responsible, but he said that it is basically down to the franchise holders.</p><p>The Labour Party made a number of points; I will return to Ken Macintosh&#8217;s point. I am not talking just now about the not-for-dividend model proposal, but the publicly owned model proposal. The only way we can get that is if Scotland becomes independent.

On the specific proposal that Ken Macintosh made, I have tried to address that issue before, but I will look into it further because he has asked me to do it. The specific point that I have tried to make to him is that we have always said that we will look favourably on proposals that relate to not-for-profit or mutual-based models.</p><p>There are, however, practical strictures&#8212;one of which is that the bidder has to show evidence of experience of running railways, which makes things difficult.

The bill provides for a single contract to manage and maintain both Forth road bridges and deliver value for money and operational efficiencies, with projected savings over the alternatives of about &#163;1.2 million per annum. The bill also provides for a transfer to the Scottish ministers of FETA&#8217;s land and assets for use by the bridge operating company and of its liabilities.</p><p>There will be no compulsory redundancies for the 72 staff employed by FETA, because they will be transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 to the new operating company. FETA&#8217;s existing byelaws will be revoked and replaced as necessary by road traffic regulation orders.</p><p>The Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee published its stage 1 report on 18 March, and my considered response to the issues that it raised was made during the stage 1 debate and contained in my reply of 24 April to the committee convener. At stage 2, Elaine Murray moved an amendment on the Forth bridges forum, which was subsequently withdrawn. We welcome further debate on the bill today.</p><p>The bridge has served the local area and the nation well over the past 49 years and has carried more than half a billion vehicles since opening in 1964, which is well beyond what was envisaged when it was designed and built. It will obviously be 50 years old next year. I suspect that every member in the chamber has used the bridge. It is not something that is quickly forgotten, particularly because, at one time, it had the longest suspension bridge span outside the USA.</p><p>The bill will dissolve FETA, whose staff have dedicated large parts of their working lives to the bridge and built up an extensive knowledge of its workings. By transferring the FETA staff and their experience to a single operating company that will look after both bridges and the connecting roads, we are not only protecting jobs but ensuring that the wealth of knowledge is retained.</p><p>I am reminded of a programme that I saw recently from the American television channel PBS about the Brooklyn bridge and the extent to which the construction and maintenance of a bridge as significant as that can form a large part of people&#8217;s lives. I was privileged to be at an event recently to which the veterans who built the Forth road bridge came along, and we heard about their stories and experience.</p><p>I welcome the news that the recent inspection carried out by FETA on the anchorages has provided very positive findings. Anything that offers confidence that the bridge is on a more secure footing will be well received by the people who rely on it. The efforts of the FETA workforce on that should be recognised, as should the work to prevent further deterioration in the cables from corrosion. The findings also confirm the Forth road bridge&#8217;s future as part of a twin-bridge strategy under which the bridge will be used as a dedicated public transport crossing. I look forward to using the bridge in the pedal for peace event, which I will undertake with Provost Jim Leishman of Fife Council this Saturday.</p><p>The bill will pave the way for a single operating company to look after the trunk road from Halbeath in the north to Kirkliston in the south, and it will include the Forth road bridge and the new Forth crossing motorway. The bridge operating company contract will combine the best practice from FETA&#8217;s operations and work services manuals with Transport Scotland&#8217;s new fourth generation of operating company contracts to ensure that existing service levels are maintained, if not improved.</p><p>As I mentioned at stage 1, the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to contracting for network maintenance has delivered continual improvement and significant efficiency savings, which were estimated to be worth about &#163;18.6 million in 2012-13. The Highways Agency in England recently highlighted how Scotland&#8217;s approach can generate cost savings without compromising service delivery. We have given assurances that the important role that FETA has in the community will be captured in the contract or via the Forth bridges forum.</p><p>As the bill has progressed through the Parliament, we have engaged with and continued to listen to people who will be affected. We acted promptly when worries were expressed about pensions, for example. We were quick to put fears to rest by committing to the continuation of FETA&#8217;s current arrangements. Ministers will act as a guarantor for FETA pensions. When concern was expressed about the continued availability of the crossing to pedestrians and cyclists during severe weather, we gave a commitment that arrangements that FETA put in place would be written into the operating contract, to ensure that the public do not experience a diminution in service post the dissolution of FETA.</p><p>The construction of the bridge&#8217;s neighbour, the Forth replacement crossing, continues to progress on budget and is employing about 1,200 people and benefiting 334 Scottish firms. The crossing is on time for completion by December 2016.</p><p>We have committed funds to improve the cycle link between Fife and Edinburgh&#8212;in particular the part between the existing bridge and Edinburgh.</p><p>The people of Scotland are having their say on the new crossing&#8217;s name. Other countries, particularly Canada, are paying attention to how we are engaging individuals and communities in the biggest infrastructure project in a generation. The response from the public, in voting for their favourite name, has been tremendous. More than 27,500 people have had their say and, with 15 days left before voting closes on 7 June, the public still have the opportunity to influence and be part of an historic process, by logging on to www.namethebridge.co.uk.</p><p>Bus lanes that are built as part of the Forth replacement crossing managed motorway project on the M90 and the M9 will prioritise public transport between Halbeath and Edinburgh. We have recognised the importance of public transport and the need to make it more attractive to the public. The public transport corridor will continue to encourage modal shift from the car to public transport and will contribute to cross-Forth travel becoming more sustainable.</p><p>The bill is an important step in achieving that. When the new crossing opens in 2016, commuters will be able to exploit public transport options at Ferrytoll and the new Halbeath park and ride. They will be able to travel along the bus lanes and across the existing Forth road bridge to Edinburgh and West Lothian, which will take as much as 30 minutes off the peak journey times from the time when the considerable investment began.</p><p>Given that 75 per cent of all southbound bridge traffic passes within a mile of Halbeath, I was pleased to announce last year that the Scottish Government would provide up to &#163;10 million to Fife Council for the park-and-ride facility. I was there at the start of the construction project, which is well under way; I look forward to it being delivered later this year.</p><p>The Forth bridges forum has been set up to facilitate a strategic and collaborative approach to the management and operation of the bridges. It is led by Transport Scotland and attended by senior officials from the bodies that are currently responsible for the bridges&#8212;Network Rail for the Forth bridge, FETA for the Forth road bridge and Transport Scotland for the new Forth crossing&#8212;and from the City of Edinburgh Council, Fife Council, West Lothian Council, Historic Scotland and VisitScotland. Collectively, the forum not only supports the bridge operators with planned activity but takes forward action to promote the three bridges as a tourist destination. I hope that members agree that Scotland will have a valuable and unique asset in three iconic structures&#8212;feats of cutting-edge engineering of their times, spanning three centuries&#8212;which will become an international tourist destination.</p><p>A good example of how well the forum&#8217;s arrangements are working is its sub-group, the Forth bridge world heritage nomination steering group. That group has invited participation from the local community, which is central to everything that the forum is doing, and has just launched a 12-week consultation exercise to help to inform the application for world heritage status for the Forth bridge.</p><p>Provision for the Forth road bridge to be adopted into the trunk road network will allow for the most cost-effective management of the bridge and support the transport measures that we think will facilitate the shift from the car to more sustainable forms of transport. As I said, through a number of provisions and our listening to the people who are most affected by the bill&#8212;local communities and the workforce at FETA&#8212;we will protect existing staff, with a commitment of no compulsory redundancies. Through TUPE, we will ensure that the expertise that we have in FETA is retained.</p><p>For those reasons, I hope that members will support the bill at decision time.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the Forth Road Bridge Bill be passed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s convener, Maureen Watt, and the committee for their consideration of the bill, and I thank the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Finance Committee for their earlier consideration of it.

I will make sure that I try to correct the record.</p><p>On the name of the bridge, I have been scrupulous in ensuring that I do not express any preference. I was not involved in selection of the shortlist. I fear that Alex Johnstone has done irreparable damage to his preferred option with his comments today. Let us hope that that is not the case.</p><p>I also thank Elaine Murray for lodging her amendment at stage 2. I hope that she will agree with me&#8212;and with the view of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8212;that the make-up of the Forth bridges forum is appropriate for the type of activity that will undertake and that it will ultimately benefit the local community. On the points that Elaine Murray made about having contacted local councillors, we have to take the views of the councils, rather than individual councillors, as I am sure she understands.</p><p>It is worth saying that neither Perth and Kinross Council nor West Lothian Council even responded to the call for evidence on the bill. We have to take the express views of the committee into account. We have made clear our reasons for the constitution and membership of the forum. I hope that members will welcome confirmation that the agendas and minutes of future forum meetings will be made available online. Elaine Murray raised that issue, which I know has been a concern.</p><p>We do not believe that councillors need to be part of the forum for them to ask questions of ministers about management and maintenance of the crossing. It is worth pointing out that currently about 10 per cent of all correspondence that we receive on the subject comes from councillors, which I think proves that keeping the current proposals for ministerial responsibility for membership&#8212;to which Alex Johnstone referred&#8212;rather than making provision in the bill or subsequently in regulations, is sufficient.</p><p>Although the bill has been unamended since its introduction, we have been listening to people&#8217;s views. A number of members have acknowledged the various points that we have listened to and agreed with&#8212;not least of which were the concerns of FETA staff.</p><p>During the passage of the Forth Crossing Act 2011, it was recognised that arrangements for future maintenance and operation of the bridge must be in place before the new Forth crossing opens. Subsequent analysis of the options has provided a clear way forward. Although the decision to dissolve FETA has not met with universal approval, retention of jobs, a guarantee in respect of staff pensions, a cost-effective regime&#8212;which Annabelle Ewing was right to say is very important&#8212;and the twin-bridges management and maintenance strategy emerged as the clear priorities.</p><p>I am glad that so many stakeholders, as well as Parliament, are agreed on those outcomes, and I anticipate that once the new Forth crossing opens, we will agree on encouraging modal shift from cars to public transport across the Forth estuary, which the bill will also facilitate.</p><p>In reply to comments on privatisation, I point out that the previous Administration took the same decision with an earlier iteration of the trunk roads maintenance contract. It is the case that, should they want the contract to stay in the public sector, councils could collaborate and put forward their own bid for it; it would not even have to be the councils that were nearest to the bridge that did that. Councils have been able to do that in relation to the trunk roads contracts ever since the decision was taken in the mid-1990s to take responsibility for trunk roads away from councils and it is still possible. Councils would have to apply to be on the tender list. In the past, councils have applied for earlier versions of operating company contracts. FETA could not do that, but the councils could get together and do that if they wanted to.</p><p>To return to democratic accountability, elected local authority representatives are in a different category from local groups and local people, whom we have asked to be involved in the Forth bridges forum, in that they have a mandate of their own. That is where the potential for confusion would come in. I feel as strongly about that issue as I do about the requests that we are receiving for ministers to be involved in a council road project&#8212;the third Don crossing in Aberdeen. That is not the role of ministers. It is a local authority scheme, and it is right that Aberdeen City Council takes the project forward and deals with the concerns that have been expressed.</p><p>In the same way, it is right&#8212;as Alex Johnstone said&#8212;given that the new Forth crossing is being funded by central Government, that there is a clear line of accountability right through to the minister, who cannot hide from the scrutiny that Parliament can bring to bear. I hope that that assures those who are concerned about the issue that there will be accountability. As I have said, councillors can raise issues, and I am sure that they will continue to do so. The only person who has raised the issue of democratic accountability outwith Parliament is Councillor Hinds of the City of Edinburgh Council.</p><p>Elaine Murray&#8217;s stage 2 amendment would have allowed scrutiny only of the Forth road bridge, which I do not think was the intention and which is probably another reason why it was withdrawn.</p><p>I have tried to respond to the various points that have been made, including the concerns that staff have raised. The pensions guarantee that we have provided is not a straightforward or inexpensive thing to do; the Scottish Government has made a substantial commitment, which we did because we listened to the concerns of staff members.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch asked about TUPE and the level of protection that will be provided. As a former shop steward, I know that concerns have been expressed about how effective TUPE can be, but following engagement with the United Kingdom Government, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has said that it is generally satisfied with the TUPE provisions, which prohibit gratuitous compulsory redundancies. Under TUPE, obligations are passed on to the contractor. As I have mentioned, perhaps the most important issue is that of pensions, on which we have given a guarantee.</p><p>On Alex Johnstone&#8217;s point about tolls, I welcomed the abolition of tolls in my maiden speech in Parliament. I am aware that Helen Eadie was ahead of her time in asking for a new crossing, and ahead of her time&#8212;and, I am sure, out of step with her colleagues&#8212;in asking for bridge tolls to be abolished. I can only imagine how she jumped for joy when the Scottish National Party was elected, which led in due course to both those things being guaranteed. That had not happened previously, despite the fact that&#8212;as I said in my intervention on Alex Johnstone&#8212;the tolls on the original Forth road bridge should have been abolished in 1994, when the capital costs were paid off. It is extremely important that, when Governments make such commitments on tax or charges, they follow them through. The tolls should have been abolished in 1994, and I am pleased that it was the SNP Administration that finally&#8212;with support from others, as has been mentioned&#8212;abolished them.</p><p>I mentioned at stage 1 that, at one point, it was proposed that the toll on the Forth bridge should go up to &#163;4, which was a similar level to the Skye bridge toll. I was pleased to be involved in the campaign to abolish the Skye bridge toll, even although I still bear a conviction for refusing to pay.</p><p>I think that I have covered most of what members said in their speeches, which were very positive. It was interesting to hear from Richard Lyle about the early development of the bridge. I was but a babe in arms in the days of the ferry. Although I crossed the Forth by ferry, I do not remember having done so because I was too young. Since then&#8212;as all other members have done&#8212;I have used the bridge on many occasions.</p><p>I look forward to continuing our effective engagement. Members&#8217; comments reflect the fact that there has been effective engagement with stakeholders, members and the people who will be most directly affected.</p><p>Commencement of the bill is scheduled to not happen until June 2015, and there is still substantial work to be done not only on the arrangements for the TUPE transfer of staff, but on the operating company contract, in order to ensure that it meets the commitments that have been made during the progress of the bill. Commitments have also been made to other stakeholders. I put on the record an offer to provide regular updates to the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, including details of how the contract is developing, community engagement and the FETA staff transfer.</p><p>The bridges over the Forth play a key part in keeping Scotland moving. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of safeguarding the future of that vital link in Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure, and am pleased to commend to members the motion</p><p>&#8220;That the Parliament agrees that the Forth Road Bridge Bill be passed.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members for their contributions to what has been a generally very positive debate&#8212;apart from the one gratuitously controversial statement by Alex Johnstone.

For example, I have had a letter from somebody in the Aberdeen City Council administration asking whether we would reconsider the whole AWPR and put in a tunnel instead. There seems to be no end to the reasons that the Labour Party and its allies will produce to delay the projects rather than get on with them. What was most interesting was the reaction of Aberdeen City Council when we said that we would give it the cap that it had asked for on its contribution: the council wanted to continue the argument over the contribution, which was first agreed with the Labour Administration back in 2003, then agreed with us in March. However, the council wants to go back and argue about the question of its cap.</p><p>The difference is clear between Aberdeen City Council, which wants to continue to argue about that point rather than get on with the scheme, and Aberdeenshire Council, which said, &#8220;A deal is a deal.

However, the north-east should have had those projects years ago. There was a lack of investment in Scotland&#8217;s transport infrastructure for decades when the Labour Party was in control and did nothing and when the Conservatives were in control for even longer. That was the situation at Scottish Office level, devolved Administration level and council level. Members should not forget that Haudagain and the AWPR started as a council project and that the previous Scottish Executive said that it would get involved in it.</p><p>The fact that we are contributing 81.5 per cent of the costs&#8212;there is of course a substantial cost to the taxpayer of providing the local authority&#8217;s money in the first place&#8212;means that we are committed to the scheme and bringing it forward. I do not think that anybody, apart from Richard Baker, questions the fact that we had to observe the legal challenge that was made and try to see that through first. We had no control over that. If the scheme had been started many years ago, perhaps it would not have been started from where we are now. However, it was not started many years ago. The Labour Party talked about it, just as it talked about the Borders railway and the M74 but did not complete them.

Of course, if we were able to do it earlier than that, that would be great as well, but I think that his point was that we should go through the various processes, legal and otherwise, that we have to go through as quickly as possible to ensure that the project is shovel ready as quickly as possible.</p><p>I am happy to give Mr Johnstone that commitment.

We wanted to assess the socioeconomic impact on those communities of the removal of RET for commercial vehicles. The report was first published on Transport Scotland&#8217;s website on 26 April.</p><p>It is worth remembering that the decision to remove RET for commercial vehicles was partly a result of the cuts that Westminster imposed on us. It was a very difficult decision. Interestingly, this morning I was in Wales, where I listened to a report in which Carwyn Jones said that the Welsh Government had further difficult decisions to take because of cuts that it had experienced and cuts that it expected. Such realism is not evident among Labour members in this place, given their continued demands for more spending in virtually every area of Government.</p><p>We have done everything possible to make additional funding available for a transitional scheme. Over the past two years, we have provided &#163;4.5 million for that. We have also introduced additional concessions and made a change that means that small commercial vehicles are now eligible for RET fares.</p><p>As the report said&#8212;and as Angus MacDonald pointed out&#8212;it is hard to assess the impact of the removal of RET against the background of the general economic situation in a recession. Between 2008 and 2012, there was a 16 per cent increase in haulage costs, which was primarily a result of increases in other costs, such as the 17 per cent increase in fuel costs, which account for a third of all haulage costs.</p><p>In the ferries plan that we published at the end of last year, which Richard Baker mentioned, we committed to use the study to inform the terms of reference for an overarching freight fares policy. Anyone who looked at the freight fares policy&#8212;and, indeed, the passenger fares policy&#8212;that the Parliament applied prior to 2007 would not be able to work out a rationale for why certain fares applied in certain circumstances while different fares applied in others. There was no objective rationale. We will try to provide such a rationale through the freight fares policy.</p><p>The need for that was confirmed in the report. Businesses in the Western Isles, Coll and Tiree stressed the need for a clearly defined long-term fares strategy. To take that forward, we have established a working group that will include broad representation from key stakeholders. The aim is to deliver a commercial vehicles fares structure for all Scotland&#8217;s islands that is fair, transparent and straightforward and which delivers the best value for taxpayers at a time of severe cuts to the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget.

That said, it is vital that we do not lose sight of RET&#8217;s benefits, especially for passengers, cars and small commercial vehicles and coaches, and the major impact that there clearly is on tourism in the islands. In addition, we plan to improve from this winter the level of winter services offered to Barra, Lochboisdale, Coll and Tiree.</p><p>I will turn to the second point in the complex and multifaceted motion that Richard Baker has laid before Parliament: the MV Hamnavoe. The ship is obviously an important element of the lifeline ferry service to Orkney, but with regard to the breakdown of the starboard main engine&#8212;I have forgotten what Richard Baker called it, but it was fiasco, debacle or some such term&#8212;I have to say that no one can foresee these things. They happen from time to time; strangely enough, they have happened in the past under a Labour-Liberal Administration. When it happened this time, it was through no fault of the ferry operator, Serco NorthLink, whose technical staff ensure that all vessels are maintained to a very high standard, well above and beyond the required legal minimum.</p><p>Like any responsible transport provider, Serco undertakes regular contingency planning exercises to make appropriate provision for disruption. I know that the current situation is not ideal and I understand that the Hamnavoe is the preferred vessel for the people in Orkney. However, they are also able to get to Orkney with Pentland Ferries, John O&#8217; Groats Ferries and the Aberdeen service, and the freighter MV Helliar has been set aside to help with passengers and freight. As the people in Orkney whom I met last week were very keen to point out, Orkney is not closed for business and capacity is being met through the different provisions that have been put in place.</p><p>It was simply not possible to source an additional vessel. Last week, I heard a suggestion from the Labour benches that we should have a separate vessel on standby in any event, but the cost of that on top of the contract would be enormous and run to millions of pounds. I do not think it right to spend taxpayers&#8217; money in that way, which is why we have not done it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691872", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferry Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have just mentioned that we have established a working group that will include broad representation from key stakeholders.

I have mentioned the three to four return sailings a day for passengers and vehicles on Pentland Ferries services; two return sailings a day on the service operated by John O&#8217; Groats Ferries; Serco NorthLink&#8217;s own Aberdeen to Kirkwall sailings; and the two return sailings a day on the Helliar, which Serco has brought into the Scrabster to Stromness route. This is not what Serco wants; it wants the Hamnavoe back. The latest news is that we expect it to be back in service tomorrow, depending on today&#8217;s sea trials, but provision has been made in that respect and I have looked closely at the breakdown of Serco&#8217;s response.</p><p>On Richard Baker&#8217;s point about penalties, I think that I made clear in a previous topical question time that every time a sailing does not take place the penalty is around &#163;7,000. Of course, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Helliar is undertaking some of the sailings so we have to work out how penalties will apply. However, Serco will face penalties for not providing the service.</p><p>I do not have much time left so I will address in my summing up the third issue raised by Richard Baker: the TSSA situation. I have made it clear to CalMac and in public statements that the matter is really between employer and trade unions, and I have insisted that discussions take place and that the trade unions are fully consulted.

It is a disappointment, although it is perhaps inevitable, that that is usually followed by some very political statements.</p><p>I was more than happy to go to Orkney again to listen to the representations that people wanted the Scrabster to Stromness route to be written into the contract and that they wanted the 90-minute crossing. I was delighted to go again and talk to the council, the stakeholders and the tourism group. However, one bit of feedback that I got was that the constant politicising of these things by Liam McArthur is starting to annoy quite a number of people in Orkney. Perhaps he will want to address that. We heard some more of that cynicism in some of the comments that he made today, which is regrettable.</p><p>On the substantive point made by the Labour Party, I have now tried to find out from two Labour spokespeople whether Labour is committed to having a commercial RET for hauliers in the Western Isles or across Scotland. Of course, we know that, as was pointed out earlier, that would not apply in some cases, because it might increase fares for passengers, for example in Shetland. However, the Labour Party has not said whether it is committed to that. People in the Shetland Isles, the northern isles and the Western Isles will notice that, having been given the opportunity to say that that is what it would do, Labour has not said that. I think that I know why it has not done so.</p><p>Labour has also not said that it would definitely guarantee a new ferry for Lochboisdale because, of course, that would cost between &#163;20 million and &#163;40 million, with about &#163;3 million to &#163;4 million every year in additional subsidy. People in the Western Isles can draw their own conclusions about why the Labour Party has made the point that it has made yet made no commitment to such a ferry. It suggests that Labour members are playing politics with the interests of people in the Western Isles and elsewhere.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691872", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferry Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin with the point that has just been made about Pentland Ferries.

Our five canals are some of the most famous and historic in Britain, having been built between 1768 and 1822 as transport routes. Each canal is unique, with its own characteristics.</p><p>When we look at our canals today it is easy to forget the poor condition that they were in and the uncertain future that they faced only 20 years ago. The Caledonian canal was facing closure, with bulging and leaking lock walls. A 10-year, &#163;20 million, lock stabilisation project secured its future. The Forth and Clyde and Union canals became derelict following closure in the 1960s, and there were calls for them to be filled in. However, they reopened in 2001 as part of the &#163;78 million millennium link project, which was the largest-ever canal restoration project in Britain. The iconic Falkirk wheel was constructed to reconnect the two canals.</p><p>In 2011, we protected that investment and subsequent investments by placing a statutory obligation on British Waterways to maintain the canals in a suitable condition for use by cruising craft. As scheduled monuments, the canals are now not only recognised as part of Scotland&#8217;s rich heritage but safeguarded for generations to come. They are no longer shunned by their communities; they are well-loved resources.</p><p>Partnership working, especially between Scottish Canals and local authorities, has been critical in recognising and realising the additional benefit that our canals can offer. I commend the partnerships that have been formed, which demonstrate that wider benefits to canal-side communities can be secured, in addition to benefits for the canal itself.</p><p>The Scottish ministers gained responsibility for Scotland&#8217;s canals in 2001. British Waterways continued as a cross-border body, receiving policy direction and funding from the Scottish Government for its Scottish activities. More than &#163;150 million in grant in aid since 2001 has allowed it to meet statutory duties and progress new initiatives. That direct investment has acted as a stimulus for other public and private sector investment. In January, we allocated &#163;4.6 million to Scottish Canals for shovel-ready infrastructure projects in addition to previously announced annual grant in aid of &#163;10 million.</p><p>In 2010, the United Kingdom Government decided to transfer the canals in England and Wales to a waterways charity. British Waterways&#8217; chair suggested that our canals might also be transferred. However, there was no appetite for such a change among Scottish stakeholders and we were not persuaded that it would be in Scotland&#8217;s best interests, so we decided to retain our canals in the public sector.</p><p>We worked closely with the UK Government and British Waterways to ensure that both Governments&#8217; decisions were implemented smoothly, with Scottish interests protected and preparatory work undertaken to allow British Waterways Scotland to operate on a self-standing basis. Issues such as changes in legislation, the cost of change, the fair split of assets, liabilities and pensions were addressed. We adopted a business-like approach that culminated in the successful separation of the two bodies last July. The British Waterways body continues to exist, although now as a Scottish public body that is known as Scottish Canals. That significant milestone means that we now have a board that is appointed by Scottish ministers and that the policies and activities of Scottish Canals are determined solely by Scottish considerations. That stands us in good stead for moving forward.</p><p>The management of that successful change is emblematic of what can be achieved. It demonstrates that, although challenging, with good will and hard work it is perfectly feasible for Scottish and UK ministers to work jointly to separate out functions where desired, in this case after almost 50 years of cross-border operation. Perhaps that is a case study for the future.</p><p>A year ago, I advised the incoming board that I expected Scottish Canals to contribute strongly to the Scottish Government&#8217;s primary purpose. I recognised that a priority for the board was to take stock of assets and liabilities, inherited projects, policies and, of course, risks. The board has been heavily occupied with that, but it is now ready to launch its vision and values for the organisation.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s first canal policy document was published in 2002 and explored the potential contribution of the canals, setting out a long-term vision at a time when restoration was under way. It identified that policy decisions on regeneration, planning and development, public access, integrated transport, environment and tourism could have a significant impact on the canals&#8217; sustainable development. Partnership working, especially with the public sector, was seen as key. There was a need to increase awareness of the canals and promote voluntary sector and community involvement. That policy document stood the test of time well. Given the successful transition to Scottish Canals, this is a good time to restate our aspirations.</p><p>Our new policy is set at a strategic level and will take the canals forward for the next five to 10 years. Our canals are important assets that we wish to see utilised to enhance the future quality of life for Scotland&#8217;s inhabitants and help create a more successful, sustainable country. We look to build on the successful start that has been made on revitalising our canals and gaining wider public benefits from them. We encourage their full and sustainable development in a way that impacts positively. That can be done by continuing to develop the role that canals, both urban and rural, can play in delivering wider public benefits and by working in strong partnerships to secure those benefits.</p><p>I have encouraged Scottish Canals and its partners, whether public sector, private sector or third sector, to continue to build on relationships and to identify and exploit new contributions from canals in the delivery of the Scottish Government&#8217;s purpose. We expect Scottish Canals to continue to lead in development of the canals, taking full account of the role and legitimate interests of the Scottish Government. Scottish Canals will continue to receive Government grant and is encouraged to develop earned income streams.</p><p>The strategy for achieving our aims is based on the following seven principles, the first of which is valuing the heritage of our canals. The canals must be preserved in good condition to ensure that the integrity and appearance of these historic structures are maintained. Development should not damage or detract from their original design.</p><p>Secondly, the fulfilling of statutory and regulatory obligations is a fundamental responsibility, with proper resources being applied to ensure safe navigation for leisure and freight as appropriate. Other regulations ensure that the natural environment is protected and used wisely.</p><p>The third principle is risk management and safety. Inherent risk is associated with water-based infrastructure assets. Scottish Canals should apply the highest possible standards of care to the management of all canal operations to ensure that risks to the public are properly managed. Equally, the public should use the canals responsibly.</p><p>The fourth principle concerns increasing awareness of the canals&#8217; potential contribution. We would like to see further growth in the number of boats navigating our canals. We place great value on the cross-cutting opportunities that the canal corridors present. Scottish Canals should, therefore, continue to build on the foundations that have been laid, maintaining a balanced portfolio of projects across a range of important areas such as navigation, tourism, regeneration and housing, freight and renewables. It should spread activity across the canals and utilise its resources wisely over time, balancing both risk and reward in line with the Government&#8217;s objectives.</p><p>The fifth principle is around delivering a high-quality experience. Scottish Canals should offer high-quality services and adopt an open and honest approach to engaging with customers and stakeholders.

There is no hierarchy of use in the canal corridors, with fair and open access to all who exercise permitted types of use.</p><p>Sixthly, we ask Scottish Canals to work through partnership and collaboration. Extensive partnership and collaborative working should continue at both national and local level to maintain the momentum that has been built up.</p><p>Finally, we encourage the effective monitoring and measuring of the outcomes that have been achieved, so that the benefit that is gained from initiatives can be assessed and demonstrated.

It would be true to say that my constituents are bewildered and bemused by what is happening in the Post Office.</p><p>This is not the first time that post offices in my constituency have been under threat. In 2008, the then Government presided over the closure of a number of post offices in the local area, including those at the University of Stirling, at Fairyburn in Alloa and at Kinnesswood in Kinross-shire. I can perhaps give some encouragement to my colleagues by noting that the Post Office was forced to abandon plans to close the Crook of Devon post office when I and the local community argued successfully that that would be completely unacceptable.</p><p>The support for the closure programme under the previous Government in 2005 and 2008 gave the green light for post office closures then and set the stage for the UK coalition Government&#8217;s support for the current proposals.</p><p>It has been mentioned already that the Crown post office offers a full range of services provided at high standards. The staff in Alloa are well trained and have 100 years of experience between them&#8212;that is not quite the 280 years that Linda Fabiani mentioned but is, nevertheless, a huge amount of experience. That experience could be lost if the plans to close the post office and find what is described as a retail partner do not work.</p><p>As members of the Crown network, those staff receive training every week. They attend workshops and are kept abreast of the latest changes to products and procedures through various avenues. That experience and training is an important part of the service that the staff provide&#8212;as members have said with regard to post offices in their areas, the Alloa post office regularly has queues and is very well regarded. I have received feedback that customers go to AIIoa post office instead of Stirling, which has been franchised and is now upstairs at the back of WH Smith. People go to Alloa instead because of the level of service that they get there and the post office&#8217;s accessibility.</p><p>Crown post offices such as AIIoa provide a dedicated specialist service to communities that will not be easily replicated by a counter or two in a bigger shop. In any event, when I met representatives of the Post Office, they could come up with no suggestions of anyone in Alloa who could possibly take on the franchise.</p><p>AIIoa Crown post office is a valuable asset and an essential part of the local economy, and it is well used by local people and businesses. In response to Mary Scanlon&#8217;s point, I say that I put as much business as possible its way, as it is more or less right across the road from my office.</p><p>Currently, AIIoa post office is located in Drysdale Street in AIIoa&#8212;for those who do not know AIIoa, that is right in the heart of the town centre&#8212;and it is readily accessible for those who wish to use the service. If the plans go ahead and the Crown post office is franchised, there is a real possibility&#8212;perhaps an inevitability&#8212;that that vital service will be removed from the town centre. The only organisations that can take on the service might well be supermarkets, which are not in the town centre.</p><p>The post office brings people into the town centre, and there is a concern among local businesses about the potential knock-on effect that closure could have on their business and livelihoods.</p><p>Since the plans were announced, I have met representatives of CWU and Post Office Ltd, and I have written to the chief executive, Paula Vennels. I remain unconvinced about the argument for franchising AIIoa Crown post office. Claims that it costs &#163;1.43 to generate every &#163;1 of income at AIIoa are disputed by the CWU, and even if that is the case I have yet to receive evidence that suggests that any serious steps have been taken to turn that around. Assurances that there will be no reduction in services cannot be guaranteed.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch and others raised a number of issues about post offices that have been franchised, including accessibility, the range of services that are available, the quality of service and the increased length of queues. Of course, there is evidence of so-called retail partners taking on a franchise and then choosing to withdraw from the franchise at a later date, which has meant that communities have lost the service completely. I do not want that to happen in AIIoa.</p><p>I have written to the UK postal affairs minister, Jo Swinson, asking her to meet me at my office in AIIoa to discuss the issue further and to see for herself the local situation but, unfortunately, she has not afforded me the same courtesy that I often extend to ministers of the UK Government who have a constituency interest in an issue.</p><p>In 2008, I pledged to stand against any future moves to diminish post office services further in my constituency and I stand by that today. The UK Government claims to be investing &#163;1.34 billion to ensure that the post office network is sustainable for the future, with &#163;70 million being spent on modernising Crown branches.

Multi-agency response team&#8212;MART&#8212;partners were activated 24 hours a day from midnight on Thursday, with mutual aid working well across the roads and utilities sectors.

At present, there are 2,700 properties without power, which should reduce to fewer than 2,000 tonight.</p><p>All those efforts come at a very real cost, both physical and financial. In recognition of that, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth has been in discussion with Argyll and Bute, North Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway councils, and the Bellwin scheme has been triggered.

I am grateful to all those who contributed to that process. A number of important issues were raised, and the debate provides an opportunity to hear those views expressed and to reiterate the benefits that the proposed arrangements offer; it also provides an opportunity to go through the committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>I am pleased to note that the committee acknowledges that the bill will support the Scottish Government objective of implementing a twin-bridge maintenance strategy and that it supports the bill&#8217;s principles. I also note that the committee has welcomed the approach that ministers and officials are taking, while recognising that work is needed to make the commitments a reality.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s provisions pave the way for another important stage in the evolution of the motorway and trunk road network. Trunking the road across the Forth road bridge and the adjacent routes will allow for this important structure, and its well respected staff, to become full partners in the trunk road and motorway network and the successful operating company approach of managing the road and bridge network efficiently and effectively. It will provide for the most cost-effective solution for this vital crossing and will complement the new Forth crossing under construction.</p><p>The committee commented favourably on the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to contract a single bridge operating company to manage and maintain both bridges. Why was that ministers&#8217; preferred option? First, Scotland&#8217;s motorway and trunk road network performs well and is well regarded, with our recent 4G contracts&#8212;the framework in which the new bridge contractor will operate&#8212;providing a sophisticated approach to asset management.</p><p>Long-term contracting to network maintenance has delivered continual improvement and significant efficiency savings&#8212;&#163;18 million was saved in 2011-12. A recent review by the Highways Agency in England highlighted how Scotland&#8217;s approach can generate cost savings without compromising service delivery, my publicly stated intention in the bill.</p><p>Of course, standards must be maintained. Although remedial action will be taken against an operator if necessary, delivery is based on inclusive team working by the client&#8212;Scottish ministers and Transport Scotland&#8212;the private operators and PAG plus, the performance audit group.</p><p>A virtuous circle of improvement via a system of incentives, obligations and shared best practice contributes to efficiencies, with regular inspections providing a no surprises regime that enhances delivery and prevents, rather than simply corrects, faults. The existing road bridge and Forth Estuary Transport Authority staff will join that environment.</p><p>Secondly, as the committee has acknowledged, state aid considerations and the possibility of challenge meant that ministers were correct not to take the risk of allowing FETA to bid for the contract to manage and maintain the new bridge.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687687", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to open the debate on the general principles of the Forth Road Bridge Bill.

It was not possible to demonstrate that delegating the functions to FETA would have realised value for money, and we must also bear it in mind that FETA was not set up for that purpose. A competitive procurement exercise was clearly the right approach for all concerned and meets the risks that I have mentioned. Members will also know that operating contracts have been the preferred choice of previous Administrations.</p><p>Section 2 of the bill makes comprehensive provision for the transfer of FETA&#8217;s liabilities. I repeat that Scottish ministers will meet the liabilities for which FETA is responsible. The committee report describes concerns that some of FETA&#8217;s liabilities may remain with the City of Edinburgh Council. Officials will work to an agreed timeline with FETA and the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that FETA&#8217;s liabilities are properly accounted for in the transfer. I have provided assurances on that matter. In addition, future budgets explicitly allow for the associated claims and costs and, as mentioned in committee, amounts in such cases often prove less than initially forecast. The council has estimated less than &#163;100,000 for part 1 compensation claims.</p><p>The committee recommended that a formal communication be issued to the council on that issue before the passage of the bill. I have done that today by assuring the council that section 2 will transfer all FETA&#8217;s property and liabilities to the Scottish Government.</p><p>A cessation payment will apply to pension liabilities. We are obliging the new contractor to apply for admitted body status. It will also be expected to cover the costs of employees. As the committee noted, that will apply to successor operating companies, too. Legacy costs need to be covered and, since FETA will no longer exist, it falls to Scottish ministers to act as guarantor. We will do that.</p><p>Various respondees to the committee have welcomed that outcome, and the committee commended Transport Scotland for the outcome achieved on admitted body status. Rightly, that has provided the reassurance to FETA staff that they fully deserved. There was much recognition of employees&#8217; concerns about their pensions.</p><p>There were also concerns about health and safety. During the recent event with veterans of the construction of the Forth bridge, I met a former employee. South Queensferry resident, Alan Macdonald, who is now 77 but was a supervisor who worked for the bridge designers, described a discovery in the project&#8217;s south anchorage tunnel, which was one of many unexpected challenges during construction. As the Edinburgh Evening News reported, Mr Macdonald said:</p><p>&#8220;I saw bubbling coming up through the water in the bottom of the shaft. We collected a sample and took it back to the office. In our naivety we thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to see if it was flammable. We dropped a match in this glass jar and we just about blew up the whole office.&#8221;</p><p>I spoke to another person, who talked about handling explosives and being told not to get the material on their face, because it would blind them. The material was accessed from a small hut at the bottom of the hill, next to the river. Things have obviously moved on tremendously in health and safety, which is a key consideration in our moving forward in the way that I am describing.</p><p>We understand that the bill impacts on individuals. It was essential that FETA staff should receive assurances about their future. The Scottish Government acknowledges and greatly values the skills, knowledge and professionalism of FETA staff. I have assured all FETA staff that their jobs will be protected, through the process that is provided for in the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report reflects the reassurance that has been provided to FETA staff in the bill and through the arrangements that the Scottish ministers have made on their behalf. The bill provides protection for FETA staff&#8217;s terms and conditions, through the application of TUPE.</p><p>On section 4, the committee commented on the impact that the dissolution of FETA might have on local accountability and local councils&#8217; ability to influence regional transport matters. We recognise that stakeholders hold strong views on the issue, which we welcome; the committee&#8217;s endorsement of the Scottish ministers&#8217; approach as striking the right balance is also welcome.</p><p>The Roads Scotland Act 1984 and Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 create clear lines of responsibility for local roads and for trunk roads. The new Forth crossing, of course, will be a trunk road and motorway, responsibility for which properly will lie with the Scottish ministers. There is no other section of the motorway network in Scotland in relation to which councillors are in a position of authority.</p><p>The committee agreed with our judgment that the Forth bridges forum, which has council officer representation, is the most suitable vehicle for ensuring that local stakeholders&#8217; interests remain at the core of the management and maintenance of the Forth bridges. The Scottish ministers will, of course, be able to receive representations from the public and councillors about those strategic routes. The approach will be no different from the approach that is taken elsewhere in respect of the trunk road network.</p><p>Transport Scotland and the winning contractor will build on the relationships that FETA has established. Regular and meaningful engagement with community councils and residents will take place&#8212;and indeed has already begun. That will be stipulated in the Forth bridges operating company contract. Such arrangements are a condition of existing operating company contracts elsewhere on the trunk road network; again, we build on existing practice.</p><p>The committee shares our view that an important facet of FETA&#8217;s work, which was highlighted by the chief bridgemaster, is the added value that is brought by contact with operators of similar structures elsewhere in the world. That will be evident later this year, when members of the International Cable Supported Bridge Operators Association arrive in Edinburgh. Transport Scotland is represented on a number of key national and international bodies, and I confirm that, to maintain the immensely valuable contact that I have described, the role of membership of appropriate national and international bridge bodies will pass to Transport Scotland rather than to a bridge operating company. Such an outcome fits well with the principles of the national roads maintenance review.</p><p>I thank the people who contributed on the issue and I look forward to hearing members&#8217; opinions.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Forth Road Bridge Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687687", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have just made the point that the committee acknowledged the legal situation that ministers were in and the possibility of challenge, and that ministers were correct not to take the risk of allowing FETA to bid for the contract.

I will put the record straight: we have consulted those who are most directly affected. The trade unions that have been mentioned, in particular UCATT and Unison, were contacted prior to the original announcements and invited to all FETA staff meetings that were arranged between Transport Scotland, Scottish Government human resources and Barry Colford, the bridgemaster. Three trade unions in particular engaged through transition officials: UCATT, Unison and Unite. Transport Scotland arranged face-to-face meetings at that time for officials from all three unions and FETA, although not all trade union officials attended. There has been substantial contact, but I will take on board some of the points that have been made.</p><p>Elaine Murray made a number of points on which I am happy to provide some reassurance. I also want to address the point about representation, which a number of members raised. Helen Eadie pointed out that the original bridge was funded largely through loans that were raised by councils. It was quite right that those councils were the direct point of accountability. However, it is also the case that a commitment was given to stop the tolls once the capital costs were paid off. As I understand it, they were paid off in the mid-1990s, yet the tolls continued to be charged for many years and were the source of some of FETA&#8217;s funding. Just as it was right that councils were accountable for the money that they raised, it is right that Scottish ministers are responsible for the money that is being spent on the new bridge. Of course, the maintenance of the existing bridge is funded directly through Scottish ministers, so it is right that that should be the level of accountability.</p><p>As I said, the bridges will be fully integrated into Scotland&#8217;s motorway and trunk road network. The Forth road bridge, the staff who currently maintain it and&#8212;I underline this point&#8212;their pensions and Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations terms are going to be safeguarded in the process.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687687", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members for their contributions to the debate.

It has made representations about obligations in respect of previous work on the A9000, said that we should take on those responsibilities, and pointed out that the Government is taking on responsibilities. Therefore, we should take on the accountability as well, not the councils. It wanted to hand over responsibility to the Government, and I have said that we will take that on. That responsibility should be reflected in the democratic arrangements, which is what we intend.</p><p>It seems to me that the point that Alex Johnstone made in relation to the international bridge organisations is absolutely right and that the people who will get most benefit from that will work directly on the bridge. I will check that further, but it seems absurd not to have those people directly involved in that process.</p><p>Dave Stewart made a number of points. He mentioned that we should not just make assumptions about the legal position. We do not do that. We do not pluck such things out of the air. We have advice, we have considered the issue, and the position has been given.</p><p>Dave Stewart also raised the question whether there should an unsuccessful bidder premium. There will be no unsuccessful bidder premium. I think that he also made a point about maximising the use of the existing bridge. We will certainly do that, and I am happy to provide more information on that in writing.</p><p>I simply disagree with some of the points that Helen Eadie made. The first speech that I made in the Parliament was on abolishing the existing tolls. Alex Johnstone mentioned the idea of increasing tolls to &#163;4 and recoiled in horror. Perhaps he should have recoiled in horror at the Skye bridge tolls, which were sky high. I am very proud to say that, to this day, I have still not paid the fine from my conviction for refusing to pay those tolls. That shows that, given the opportunity, it can seem very easy to draw on an income stream and it is very hard to refuse that, as people should have done in the 1990s to keep faith with the Government&#8217;s promise that the tolls would stop being applied once the capital costs of the Forth bridge were paid. I am sure that, even now, had it not been for the actions of the Scottish Government, we would still be paying the tolls for the Skye bridge and would be a long way from seeing its capital costs paid off.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report explains that there are various community engagement requirements and that they are in the process of being put in place or are being developed. It expressed views on membership of the forum. In my view, the preferred outcome will be achieved without the loss of democratic accountability.</p><p>It is true that the next generation of trunk road operating company contracts that are currently being rolled out has been designed to positively seek value for money. I think that Alex Johnstone made that point.</p><p>Alex Johnstone asked what the cost would be if we did not have the new bridge. The cost would certainly run into billions of pounds to the Scottish economy. I think that that cost would be around &#163;600,000 a day if the existing bridge was out of commission, so it is absolutely right that we continue with the new bridge. One or two members have mentioned that. It is not the case that the work that is being done on the cables on the existing bridge obviates the need for the new bridge. The case for the new bridge was not predicated solely on the problems with the cables. The current bridge reached its design capacity many years ago and is currently taking more traffic than it was designed to take. The case for the new bridge is therefore made.</p><p>I made a point about the existing contract for the bridge, which was to a consortium that involves Scottish companies. Beyond that, of course, there is the chance to have commercial arrangements for subcontracts. Richard Baker&#8217;s assertion that it should have been broken up into different contracts fills me with horror.</p><p>We have ensured that an original budget of between &#163;1.7 billion and &#163;2.3 billion has now been reduced to around &#163;1.4 billion to &#163;1.7 billion.

That is our role.</p><p>We will get the chance later to hear from Bill Kidd, who I believe was the only UK parliamentarian to attend earlier this month a major international conference in Oslo on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. He and others will wish to make their own points, but I feel that in debating these issues we must never lose sight of the truly devastating consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. We must be absolutely clear that these are weapons of mass destruction; they are indiscriminate and kill and destroy without grace or favour; and they devastate not just all military targets in their path but all civilians including children, all schools and hospitals, and all livestock and crops.</p><p>On this point, at least, I agree with the former UK Secretary of State for Defence Des Browne who, writing in The Telegraph on 5 February, said that</p><p>&#8220;large-scale use of nuclear weapons ... would be suicidal&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;even a small-scale nuclear exchange ... would affect at least a billion people and usher in colder temperatures than at any time in the past millennium.&#8221;</p><p>I also highlight the February 2013 report from the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament entitled &#8220;If Britain fired Trident&#8212;The humanitarian consequences of a nuclear attack by a Trident submarine on Moscow&#8221;, which sets out in horrifying detail the devastating humanitarian consequences of a nuclear attack on a large urban area&#8212;precisely the type of attack that Trident is designed to deliver. I note in passing that the Conservative amendment seeks to delete any reference in the motion to the devastating impact of nuclear weapons. It is clear that a nuclear attack would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences.</p><p>There is also an economic case to make in this argument. I have talked about the human cost of nuclear weapons, which is clearly far and away the most important factor, but there is also an unacceptable financial cost. The UK Government keeps the accounting on Trident confidential, but estimates suggest that running costs amount to around &#163;2 billion per annum, with Scotland&#8217;s share estimated at around &#163;163 million per annum or almost &#163;500,000 each and every day. Furthermore, the UK Government&#8217;s plan to replace the current Trident fleet is projected to cost around &#163;20 billion to build, with costs running to more than &#163;100 billion over its lifetime. Although it is not due to decide on the plan until 2016, the Ministry of Defence estimates that it will spend around &#163;3 billion for and in advance of that decision. Frankly, it is staggering that the UK Government is preparing to spend massive sums on nuclear weapons while at the same time cutting conventional defence forces and slashing social welfare budgets.</p><p>That is not just the view of the Scottish Government.

He did not really give me an answer and it ended up in a bit of a rammie, if I can call it that. The simple fact is that the Labour Party is all over the place on the issue&#8212;as, I think, Kenny Gibson said. It will be interesting to see what it does in a few minutes, when we come to the vote. Will there be another abstemious action by the Labour Party, in which it will not vote? In the same way, it abstained from supporting the Tories in the vote on workfare in the House of Commons yesterday&#8212;the Tories&#8217; dirty little helpers.</p><p>It is also very telling that none of the Opposition spokespeople&#8212;Ken Macintosh, and Ruth Davidson, who was asked&#8212;could come up with a scenario in which they would use the &#163;100&#160;billion-worth of weapons that they want to procure for this country and site in Scotland.</p><p>On the matter of Labour deriding its own history, Jim Murphy derided those who said they were against nuclear weapons and had supported CND in the past as &#8220;flirting with surrealism&#8221;. That is what he said about people who genuinely believed in the Labour Party and in unilateral nuclear disarmament. We heard more &#8220;flirting with surrealism&#8221; this afternoon, when Richard Simpson decided to compare nuclear weapons with not putters, but drivers in a golf bag. That was surreal&#8212;I have no idea what he was talking about. His suggestion&#8212;that we would restrict ourselves to using only putters, rather than using the drivers or the woods that he equates with nuclear weapons&#8212;was &#8220;flirting with surrealism&#8221;.</p><p>We have set out the reasons why we believe the motion should be agreed to by Parliament. I cannot for the life of me think why any part of the motion&#8212;despite what Malcolm Chisholm said&#8212;might prove to be impossible for the Labour Party to support. Malcolm Chisholm might quibble with the timing of the debate, but it is only the SNP that has previously brought the issue to Parliament, in 2007 and 2008. His party has had the chance to do that at any time, if its members had felt as strongly about the subject as they say they do, but it has not done so. Today, Labour members have denied that we should ever debate the subject, so how can we be criticised for the timing? There is no reason why the Labour Party and those who genuinely wish nuclear weapons to be taken away from Scotland cannot easily support our motion.</p><p>An interesting question about the Labour Party&#8217;s position is this: Where is it showing leadership? Its leader is not even here. She is meant to be in charge of all the Labour MSPs and all the Labour MPs in Scotland, and she is meant to speak for the Labour Party, but she is not even here. I am willing to take an intervention from any Labour member who can tell me what Johann Lamont&#8217;s position is on the replacement of Trident.</p><p>It is our priority, as good global citizens, to support and promote global nuclear disarmament. That is the right thing to do.</p><p>Ken Macintosh rose&#8212;</p><p>I will give way to Ken Macintosh&#8212;if he can tell me what the views of his leader are on the replacement of Trident.

First, we should remember those people, and secondly we should learn the lessons. We should learn the lesson that we have to be absolutely clear and honest about the basis for war when we ask people to accept the case for war.</p><p>It has been said already that going to war is the gravest decision that a Government can take. If anybody doubts that, they should listen to the words of King Croesus, who said:</p><p>&#8220;No one would be foolish enough to choose war over peace&#8212;in peace sons bury their fathers, but in war fathers bury their sons.&#8221;</p><p>They should listen to the words of Dwight Eisenhower, who said:</p><p>&#8220;I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its stupidity.&#8221;</p><p>What, then, was the case for war? What was Tony Blair&#8217;s basis for it? There were three essential elements: weapons of mass destruction, the 45-minute threat, and, of course, the associated threat of al-Qa&#8217;ida working with Saddam Hussein. We know that weapons of mass destruction were not there&#8212;that was a false prospectus&#8212;and that the 45-minute threat was absurd. If that applied to anything, it applied to Saddam&#8217;s plans to launch a strike on his own troops if they chose to desert; it did not apply to a threat to the national interests of this country.</p><p>We also know that the al-Qa&#8217;ida threat that was raised was false. Al-Qa&#8217;ida and Saddam Hussein were the bitterest of enemies and were not working in collusion. Therefore, the basis for war against Iraq was &#8220;a lie&#8221;&#8212;those are not my words; they are the words of Joschka Fischer on the &#8220;Panorama&#8221; programme last night. He was the German foreign secretary who knew something of how thin the intelligence that was provided to the UK and US Governments was.</p><p>The second lesson has to be that the basis for going to war cannot be changed after having gone to war. We have seen some of that today. Tony Blair was very clear in the House of Commons when he said that he had never said that it was about regime change. It is not permitted under the UN charter to invade another country to effect regime change. He said that it was for weapons of mass destruction. We know that, if we change the basis on which we go to war after the event, we will lose the credibility and moral authority in having gone into it in the first place. That is a crucial lesson for those who supported the decision.</p><p>It might interest members to know that a senior Labour member of this Parliament said in a previous debate:</p><p>&#8220;I do not particularly care that we did not find weapons of mass destruction.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 2 June 2004; c 8751-52.]</p><p>What does he think that means to the people who were told that they were going to war to find weapons of mass destruction? He does not even care about the fact that that was essentially a lie.</p><p>The entire speech of John Lamont was based on the idea of regime change. That was not the view of the Conservatives in the House of Commons when they voted to support Tony Blair. It is interesting to ask: exactly what is the Tory position?</p><p>Referring to the stance of the Labour Party in particular, some of the members who have spoken today have talked about everything apart from the Iraq war. That tells me that the Labour Party is not willing to learn the lessons&#8212;particularly that we have to be honest with people before making the gravest decision of all. [Interruption.] Well, it is clearly the case that the Labour Party was not honest with people. Even those hundreds of thousands of people who were against the war would have liked weapons of mass destruction to have been found and to find that the Government had not been lying to them, but that was not the case&#8212;the Government had been lying to them, and so they lost faith in the integrity of government.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq Invasion (10th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Let me say only that I have discussed that matter with SPT.

Given that it came on top of the previous announcement that the RAF would be leaving Kinloss, it was a particularly heavy blow. At a stroke, the number of air bases in Scotland was cut from three to one.</p><p>That disappointment was somewhat mitigated by Liam Fox&#8217;s commitment that, as part of the rebasing of Army personnel from Germany, up to 7,000 additional troops would be coming here to Scotland. That commitment was made in the full knowledge that the United Kingdom&#8217;s regular Army would be reduced to 82,000 by 2020. Suggestions otherwise are a reinvention of history. Philip Hammond&#8217;s betrayal of that promise is a disgrace.</p><p>Following Liam Fox&#8217;s announcement, we committed to working positively with the Ministry of Defence, local authorities and other partners to make the changes work as best they could for service personnel, their families and communities around Scotland. Officials from the Scottish Government have engaged fully with the MOD and its Defence Infrastructure Organisation at every available opportunity.</p><p>At ministerial level, since July 2011 various ministers&#8212;including the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and me&#8212;have underscored that commitment by raising issues connected with the basing review, both in writing and through meetings, a total of 18 times with UK ministers. We have also been supportive of the local communities involved by meeting those affected in the aftermath of the announcement and, through officials, keeping closely in touch with local authorities.</p><p>The time that it has taken to work through that process has led to a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety in the communities that are affected around Scotland, but now, at last, the announcement has come. Again, it is deeply disappointing, given the work that we have put in to trying to make the process work for Scotland.</p><p>In place of the commitment that Army numbers would rise significantly as troops were rebased from Germany&#8212;Liam Fox talked of a figure of up to 7,000&#8212;we now have a commitment that the total number of armed forces personnel will rise by only around 600 from the baseline at July 2011. That suggests that numbers&#8212;if the time commitments are delivered&#8212;will be just over 12,500 by 2020.</p><p>That ignores the fact that Scotland has already seen disproportionate cuts in our defence footprint, which has shrunk by more than a third since 2000. By comparison, across the UK as a whole, it has reduced by about a fifth. The increase that Philip Hammond announced yesterday will serve to reverse only a small part of the reduction in the military footprint that we have seen in Scotland under successive UK Governments.</p><p>Liam Fox&#8217;s announcement included the news that Scotland would become home to one of five multirole brigades, but Philip Hammond has downgraded the military commitment to Scotland. Now Scotland will be home not to one of five multirole brigades but to one of seven army hubs. We need clarity from him and from the MOD on what the roles and functions will be of the elements that will be located here.</p><p>Philip Hammond also made no mention of his predecessor&#8217;s commitment to exploring the possibility of an additional training estate in Scotland, a proposal that we actively worked to support and which he has ditched.</p><p>I have mentioned the overall military footprint and the impact of the announcement nationally in Scotland. However, where these changes will really impact is at the local level. Although I welcome the UK Government&#8217;s complete about-turn on the basing of the Royal Marines at RM Condor in Arbroath, around much of the country there is little else to be genuinely pleased about.</p><p>Although it has finally been confirmed that Army units will be based at Leuchars to replace the RAF, the numbers, though not yet confirmed, will not reach the 1,300 that Liam Fox promised. Moreover, Liam Fox talked about an Army headquarters at Leuchars, but that was absent from Philip Hammond&#8217;s statement and questions remain about what, if anything, that will amount to. There will also be disappointment in Fife at the confirmation that no Army units will be based at the current Royal Navy facility at Caledonia in Rosyth.</p><p>As for Edinburgh, we have confirmation that Dreghorn will remain but Craigiehall and at least part of Redford barracks will close; we also know that the Kirknewton site on the outskirts of Edinburgh will not be developed. The MOD must work immediately and closely with us and the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that the situation is handled properly, including setting out again the numbers associated with the units that it has said will be based in the different locations.</p><p>Similar questions arise in other areas. Clarity is needed on the partial disposal of the Army site at Forthside in Stirling with the relocation of the headquarters of 51st brigade. We have also been led to believe that there will be a further small increase in the numbers at Kinloss&#8212;although it will still not bring the Army presence there, welcome though that is, to anywhere near the previous levels of RAF personnel.</p><p>I have already set out some of the unanswered questions that remain around this announcement. That so many remain is partly because of the remarkable&#8212;indeed, someone described it today as &#8220;bizarre&#8221;&#8212;fact that UK ministers have made no contact with the Scottish ministers in connection with the announcement, even though an MOD minister, Mark Francois, found time yesterday to stroll on Edinburgh castle esplanade while briefing the media.</p><p>We also understand that, although local authorities have received some written communication, it does not set out the numbers associated with the Army units that have been allocated to different locations. That is a shocking omission at this stage. We also have no detail on timing and numbers in relation to changes for the other services beyond the Army. That detail is required not just by us but by local authorities, and the situation is quite frankly unacceptable.</p><p>Of course, it does not need to be this way. I believe that this Parliament is more than capable of taking decisions about defence in the best interests of our people and our communities. Given the many years of draconian cuts to Scotland&#8217;s defence footprint by both Labour and Tory Governments, how can anyone disagree with that simple, democratic proposition?</p><p>Scotland already contributes a great deal to defence spending and, like other nations of similar size, could afford conventional forces of its own. The Scottish National Party has made it clear that, with independence, Scottish defence forces would have 15,000 regular personnel and be supported by a &#163;2.5 billion defence and security budget. Such a defence settlement is designed to meet Scotland&#8217;s needs and priorities.</p><p>By way of comparison, I note that, in 2010, Finland spent &#163;2.3 billion on defence and Denmark &#163;2.8 billion. No one would seriously suggest for a minute that those countries do not take their defence seriously. In stark contrast to the UK&#8217;s approach, we would not spend money on Trident&#8212;those weapons of mass destruction on our shores, which cost Scotland &#163;163 million each and every year.</p><p>In conclusion, we will continue to support local authorities, communities and other partners, and I am writing to them to offer our on-going support. Indeed, I have just spoken to senior Army personnel to convince them that we will continue to provide that support in future. However, the UK Government must now confirm the numbers associated with each of the units that it has said will be located in different parts of the country.</p><p>Alongside that, we have since September been pressing the UK Government for baseline information to enable us and local partners to understand the economic impact of the changes. We will continue to demand the immediate release of that information to allow us to work with local authorities, communities and other partners on an impact study that will help us to plan fully for, as well as to mitigate, the economic consequences of these UK Government decisions.</p><p>Once again, Scotland has been let down by a UK Government and its ill-thought-through and poorly handled decisions. At least some members will remember debates when it was a Labour UK Government whose proposals&#8212;at that time on regimental amalgamation&#8212;were doing damage to Scotland&#8217;s military heritage. Labour Governments, as well as the current Westminster Government, have presided over a long-term decline in Scotland&#8217;s military footprint.</p><p>Democracy is about having the ability to choose. I believe that the people of Scotland will choose to reverse that decline and vote yes in next year&#8217;s referendum.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685667", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Basing Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the House of Commons yesterday, the Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, made a statement on the basing of military forces, including in Scotland.

Obviously, I am not here to represent the Scottish Green Party, but I think that other viewpoints must be presented.</p><p>I gently take issue with my colleague Dave Thompson because he reckoned that the issue is a simple one. I do not think that it is that simple; I think that there is more to it than perhaps meets the eye. It is incumbent on Government before taking a decision such as the motion proposes to take into account the complexities and possible consequences of taking action.</p><p>I agree with much of what members have said on the issue. I do not want that to be forgotten as I go through some of the points that might raise issues in the minds of others.</p><p>Significant challenges face us in road safety in Scotland, as Anne McTaggart mentioned in passing. It is true that we have had the devolution of powers to the Scottish ministers to set our own national speed limits. Dave Thompson mentioned the 2008 report about which nothing had been done. However, we did not have the required powers at that time. We gained them only recently, and we now have the greater freedom that Dave Thompson and others have mentioned.</p><p>In the road safety framework that we set for 2020, we set ourselves challenging national road safety targets. We still have them in Scotland, although similar targets have been dispensed with elsewhere in the UK, or at least at Westminster. Our targets were to reduce fatalities by 40 per cent and serious injuries by 55 per cent, based on a 2004 to 2008 average.</p><p>It is worth saying that the latest confirmed figures for road casualties in Scotland&#8212;for 2011&#8212;show that the figures are at their lowest level since records began. It is also worth noting that two thirds of fatal and serious accidents involving HGVs are on A roads and that two thirds of accidents and three quarters of fatal accidents involving HGVs are on single carriageway roads. There is no guarantee that a speed limit increase would alleviate the problem of frustration and dangerous overtaking. It is worth bearing in mind that, if the HGV speed limit was raised, overtaking would continue but at a higher speed. It takes longer for a car to overtake an HGV travelling at 50mph than one travelling at 40mph.</p><p>Members have heard mention of the Transport Research Laboratory report of 2008, which had 14 recommendations for further research. As Dave Thompson said, it also referred to the possibility of considering an experimental trial of a raised speed limit for HGVs. The suggestion was that a trial could be conducted over a three-year period on the A9 between Perth and Inverness.</p><p>As I said, at the time the Scottish ministers did not have the powers to enact such a speed limit, even if they had wanted to. However, the modelling work done by the TRL on the A9 in 2009 suggests that to gain an optimum reduction in accidents we would have to install average-speed cameras and maintain the current 40mph speed limit. That is a change from the previous approach. The TRL also said that, from a road safety perspective, the best approach could be to leave speed limits as they are or even slow cars down. There is different advice even from the same organisation.</p><p>National-level modelling suggests that there are economic benefits from increasing the speed limits for trucks&#8212;a number of members mentioned that&#8212;and decreasing journey times. However, TRL said that the economic benefits are likely to be at least partially offset by greater emissions. A number of members said that they reckon that emissions could be reduced, but TRL reckoned that there would be greater emissions and lower air quality. It also suggested that economic benefits would potentially outweigh the published cost of accidents. The modelling in 2009 did not examine the impact on other road users of road closures, which could be an especially significant issue on the A9 given the lack of alternative routes.</p><p>I wanted to make the point that there are different points of view on the proposal.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684731", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Speed Limits (Heavy Goods Vehicles)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to Dave Stewart for having gained the debate, for his comments, and for the contribution that he has made to the issue.

However, the first consideration has to be road safety. Once we get past that point, we can start to think about the costs, which Dave Stewart mentioned. One cost would arise from the establishment of average speed cameras, which we think would be essential to ensure that the change, if it was to happen, was conducted safely.</p><p>In his speech, Dave Stewart asked that we seriously study the issues. We are doing that, not least in relation to a pilot on the A9. He said that the proposal would lead to a reduction in accidents but, as I said, the evidence on that is not complete.</p><p>On the example that Murdo Fraser gave, it is worth bearing it in mind that the evidence from New Zealand does not show that increased speed limits led to a reduction in accidents. There was a continuation of a long-term downward trend in casualties per 100 million vehicle kilometres, but there is no evidence that a change to HGV speed limits ensured that that continued. There was a fall in the proportion of fatalities caused by HGVs from 2006. The policy was introduced in 2004, though, and fatalities increased between 2004 and 2005 and between 2005 and 2006. There was also an increase in injuries. The evidence is not conclusive, but it is something that Transport Scotland officials have looked at and they will continue to do that.</p><p>We have to consider how we maintain safety if we are to increase the speed limit, but I am certainly open-minded on the proposal. The Government is considering it seriously, as we have been asked to do by the members who are present, but we have to do that in the context of considering safety. We have no plans to consider making changes to national speed limits or vehicle speed limits without established evidence.

I hope that it will be helpful to members if I set out the background to the proposed industrial action and what is being done to try to avert it.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s ferry services make a significant contribution to the social, cultural and economic wellbeing of our nation. Since 2007, the Government has allocated record sums of money to the ferry services in Scotland. In 2011-12, our support for ferry services totalled &#163;118 million, including spending of &#163;46 million on the northern isles ferry services&#8212;and that was as fuel prices continued to rise.</p><p>Earlier this year, we concluded our latest procurement exercise and secured a new six-year contract for ferry services to the northern isles. As members will be aware, tendering for our supported ferry services is a requirement under European law&#8212;indeed, under previous Administrations those services were also tendered. When we have to tender public services, we have an obligation to do so efficiently and effectively and to work within the current rules. That is the best means of ensuring the continuation of high-quality, sustainable ferry services, as well as ensuring best value for public money.</p><p>Following a lengthy tender process, we were delighted to have attracted four final bids from long-established and experienced maritime service providers&#8212;clear evidence of the strength of the procurement exercise. Even an initial challenge from one of the unsuccessful bidders only served to confirm the robust, transparent and fair manner in which the northern isles tender had been carried out.</p><p>Serco, which now operates on the northern isles routes as Serco NorthLink Ferries, emerged from the tender exercise as the successful bidder. The new contract commenced as planned on 5 July, after a well-managed handover period. The total value of the new northern isles contract represents a Scottish Government investment of more than &#163;243 million over six years. Building on the good work of the previous operator, NorthLink Ferries Ltd, we have been able to secure commitments from Serco to take the northern isles ferry services forward. Passengers will see improvements to the journey experience, with improved ticketing arrangements and improved catering, hospitality and customer care facilities.</p><p>Following the announcement of Serco&#8217;s success in the tender, there were those who were concerned about a new operator running the services. I received representations from the trade unions about the position of their members. However, the contract that we put in place with Serco ensured the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations transfer of all those employees who wished to transfer, with their terms and conditions intact.</p><p>Almost six months on from the start of the new northern isles contract, passengers and business customers have continued to experience good-quality ferry services, with more improvements to come. The same vessels serve the same routes and the Serco NorthLink staff continue to provide an outstanding service on board and onshore. The on-board facilities are excellent as well and the planned refurbishment of the vessels is now nearing completion, providing more&#8212;and more comfortable&#8212;seating for passengers who are travelling on the overnight route.</p><p>Members will be aware, however, that in October the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers balloted its members among the northern isles crew on strike action over Serco&#8217;s planned revision of staffing arrangements. Following a ballot on 7 December, the RMT announced dates for a series of 24-hour strikes. The first day of strike action is due to take place tomorrow, 14 December, with further industrial action on five other days over the next couple of weeks, with the final day of action being 30 December.</p><p>Members will be aware that the dispute centres around Serco&#8217;s plans to reduce staffing levels. In recent years, the three passenger and vehicle vessels that are used on the northern isles routes have been operating at staffing levels that are higher than is required for a large percentage of the year. A number of bidders for the contract, including Serco, indicated during the bidding process that they planned to reduce the permanent staffing complement to a more appropriate level, in line with industry standards. Following a period of consultation with staff and trade unions, it has been possible to put in place a process for moving to the new arrangement in a way that means that there will be no compulsory redundancies. Agreement was reached with unions on the terms under which a number of staff have opted for voluntary redundancy.</p><p>In the current financial climate, I believe that it is entirely appropriate that we require major public contracts to be operated efficiently and cost effectively. Ensuring value for money for the public purse is a responsibility that the Government takes seriously. That said, it is entirely right that full account is taken of the interests of hard-working staff on our ferry services. Serco NorthLink, along with other ferry operators on our networks, has been able to offer favourable terms and conditions to its staff. It has committed to accepting the terms of a three-year pay deal that was made last year with the previous operator. That deal saw all seafaring staff receive a 4.25 per cent pay rise this year, nearly double the rate of inflation.</p><p>The resolution of the current dispute is rightly a matter for the RMT union and the ferry operator Serco NorthLink, and I expect both parties to work in partnership to do all that they can to avoid disruption. I have spoken to both parties in an effort to facilitate constructive engagement, and yesterday I discussed the matter with the Scottish Trades Union Congress.</p><p>Even at this late stage, I urge the RMT and Serco to make every effort to find a solution with a view to minimising the disruption that will be caused by any industrial action, and I am aware that talks are continuing. However, if that should prove not to be possible, Serco has put in place comprehensive contingency arrangements, which include an agreement with another ferry operator to ensure that all Serco&#8217;s customers can still travel across the Pentland Firth on any days that are affected by strike action. Serco has also ensured that there will be proactive engagement with passengers who are booked on the Aberdeen-Orkney-Shetland service to help them to reschedule their travel plans, and it has prepared a revised freight schedule that covers the planned strike period.</p><p>Serco has engaged extensively with all freight and haulage customers, particularly those who are transporting time-sensitive goods, which is an issue that local members have rightly raised. Serco has provided assurances to my officials that the revised freight schedule will fully address the likely demand and meet customers&#8217; needs.</p><p>It is worth noting that, under the Serco contract, the northern isles are served&#8212;in addition to the three passenger and vehicle vessels&#8212;by an additional two freight-only vessels. Those freighters are unaffected by the dispute and will continue to operate as normal even if the action goes ahead.</p><p>At this time of year, the northern isles services are, of course, vulnerable to particularly bad weather. There is a yellow weather warning out for tomorrow, 14 December, which may impact on the northern isles services. NorthLink has been advising customers of the possibility of disruption for that reason.</p><p>I will say a few words about the context in which I am making my statement. Ferries are an essential part of Scotland&#8217;s transport network. The quality of our ferry services impacts on us all and affects island and mainland communities. The Government is fully committed to delivering high-quality sustainable ferry services to our communities, which will stimulate social and economic growth throughout Scotland.</p><p>In recognition of that, we have carried out the first ever comprehensive review of ferry services in Scotland, the results of which will be published shortly. The ferries plan will provide communities with an update on the progress that we have made in taking forward issues around the level and type of ferry services that communities should receive; who is responsible for providing those services; and how we ensure that all communities can be certain about the future of their ferry service.</p><p>The ferries plan will include details of the conclusions that we have reached on how we will improve and strengthen the ferry services that are provided to communities. However, that will be only the beginning of the process, and we will continue to review our approach to providing ferry services and continue to reassess the needs of our communities.</p><p>With regard to the current situation with the northern isles services, it is disappointing that strike action is still possible, particularly given the RMT&#8217;s successful campaigning for no compulsory redundancies, which is the issue on which the union balloted its members. I have previously spoken to Serco and to the RMT, and I spoke to the RMT again today. I again urge both parties to find a resolution to the dispute to avoid disruption to the services, particularly given that the proposed strike dates are in the run-up to and during the holiday period.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680037", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: NorthLink Ferries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to make a statement setting out the Scottish Government&#8217;s on-going commitment to ferry services serving our island and remote rural communities, focusing in particular on the NorthLink services and the possible disruption to those services over the festive season.

In that statement, I mentioned that the Secretary of State for Transport had initiated both the Laidlaw inquiry to look into the course of events at the Department for Transport that led to technical flaws and ultimately the termination of the process, and the Brown review to look in detail at the implications for the remainder of the rail franchising programme and, in particular, whether changes might be needed to the assessment of risk and to the bidding and evaluation processes.</p><p>The Laidlaw inquiry reported today. I received a call this morning from Simon Burns MP, Under-Secretary of State for Transport, and was provided with a copy of the report at 11.40 am. The inquiry&#8217;s findings make it clear that there was inadequate planning and preparation, a complex organisational structure and a weak governance and quality assurance framework. I expect that in light of the report the DFT will want to revise its internal structure and processes. We in Scotland are clearly in a better place, but we are not complacent and are reviewing the findings to glean where we can make improvements.</p><p>The Brown review is expected to report at the end of the year and I await its conclusions with interest. Should its findings give us cause to change our procedures, changes will be made. It is obviously imperative that we absorb any lessons that are learned.</p><p>Speaking of lessons learned, I feel a sense of frustration in having to advise Parliament that, yet again, the United Kingdom Government offered no discussion about or notice of its proposals regarding the west coast mainline franchise. That is a ridiculous state of affairs when we are talking about a key service that directly affects millions of travellers to and from Scotland.</p><p>I understand that the deal struck between the UK Government and Virgin Rail Group is for a new franchise agreement to run for up to 23 months from 9 December 2012&#8212;this coming Sunday&#8212;to 9 November 2014, after which the west coast main line will be let under a longer-term franchise. It is reassuring that the previously planned timetable improvements from 10 December, which will at long last deliver regular hourly services between Glasgow and London, are to proceed. However, I await details from the UK Government about any benefits that it has managed to secure for Scotland as a result of the new agreement.</p><p>In this statement, I intend to set out three things: first, the procurement programme for Scotland&#8217;s rail franchises; secondly, the date on which the existing franchise will terminate; and lastly, some proposed benefits of the future franchise that I will now bring forward to the current franchise.</p><p>As members will be aware, there will be two rail franchises: a 10-year ScotRail franchise with the option of a break after five years; and a separate sleeper franchise for up to 15 years. Although each future franchise is an exciting proposition, I, like many others, recognise that they are distinctly different; that they serve different requirements; that they deliver different outcomes; and that they will be of interest to different bidders. Accordingly, they will need to be evaluated against criteria that are specific to each.</p><p>For those reasons, I have decided to run not a combined procurement exercise but two quite separate exercises to allow me to secure the best outcomes for each franchise. As well as running two exercises, I want to ensure that we do not overstretch either ourselves or bidders and I therefore intend to phase the procurement of the franchises to allow a smoothing of the peaks of the procurement tasks. That might be another lesson learned from the DFT situation. As a consequence, I intend to commence the procurement programme for the sleeper franchise in the spring of 2013 to allow sufficient time for any outcomes of the Brown review to be incorporated, if necessary. The ScotRail procurement will follow in the summer.</p><p>Although there is real benefit in the focus of having a separate sleeper franchise, the proof of the proposition will be seen in the quality of the bids received. Prudently, therefore, the timing of our procurement schedule would allow the sleeper franchise to be reincorporated into the ScotRail franchise if we were not satisfied with the quality of bids received. I should say that we have already received a very high level of interest.</p><p>I hope that members will note that I am seeking to manage risks through a measured, careful approach. That is particularly important when we note that the sleeper franchise is likely to be a contract in excess of &#163;200 million. That is a sizeable sum, but it is dwarfed by a 10-year ScotRail franchise that may be in excess of &#163;2.5 billion. That is the biggest procurement project that the Scottish Government will enter into. Such sums necessitate a cautious, prudent approach. We will not be rushed; we will not be hasty. There will be no risky short cuts to franchising in Scotland: our approach must be measured.</p><p>On 4 October I advised members that I would not countenance compromising the procurement programme. I was clear that it would take at least 20 months to deliver the programme. Inevitably, starting the procurement exercise in the summer of 2013 for the refranchising of ScotRail has implications for the length of the current franchise. However, the current franchise contract gives me, as minister, discretion to decide the end date of the current franchise within the range of 9 November 2014 to 30 May 2015. ?Accordingly, I have been considering what the best contract end date would be for Scotland&#8217;s rail passengers and for the rail staff affected by the change. ?I have looked for a date that will strike a sensible balance; that allows us to maintain our prudent procurement programme while providing a suitable period to take full account of emerging views from the Brown review; and that allows us to conduct a handover at a time that will not cause undue disturbance to passengers or staff. I have therefore decided that it will be sensible to plan for the franchise handover at the end of the 2014-15 financial year on 31 March 2015.</p><p>I turn briefly to service specifications. I will be in a position to share more details on the precise specification of the future franchises next year. However, I am keen to ensure that service benefits are realised at an early opportunity. I am pleased to announce a number of benefits; I had intended to deliver them in the next franchise, but they will now commence in the current franchise. That underlines this Government&#8217;s commitment to a passenger-focused railway.</p><p>I want to ensure that the rail service is an attractive, affordable option. I am pleased to advise that I have successfully negotiated an early fares cap with First ScotRail. I confirm that peak fares will be capped in January 2014 and 2015 to the retail prices index, which will deliver benefits two years earlier at no additional cost to the franchise subsidy.</p><p>I want to encourage greater off-peak rail use. I want attractive fares that will encourage commuters, when they can, to switch to off-peak services and better spread the demands on our rail services. I want greater use of the train, rather than the car, for leisure travel. Successful negotiations with First ScotRail have resulted in off-peak fares being frozen after 2013. Provided that the RPI remains below 3.5 per cent each year for the remainder of the franchise, off-peak fares will not increase by a single penny after 2013. Those benefits will be delivered at no extra cost to the subsidy.</p><p>I realise that for many travellers improved services are as important as lower fares. In 2014, there will be, for example, more frequent services between Glasgow and Ayr, improved services to Oban, additional Sunday services between Aberdeen and the central belt, and improved commuter services serving Aberdeen.</p><p>I am also in a position to advise today that advance works for Stirling-Alloa-Dunblane electrification have been approved. We are working with Network Rail to prioritise delivery of that project within its 2014 to 2019 programme.</p><p>I have set out our measured approach to procurement, outlined the process timetable, confirmed the date of the handover from the existing franchise, and provided details of some early benefits. I hope that Parliament notes that although we are ambitious for the future of our rail service, we are cautious in the management of its realisation. Good management is what taxpayers, passengers and those who operate our railways expect of a responsible Government. That is what we intend to deliver.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679318", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to make a further statement on the future of rail franchising in Scotland.

It is perhaps not the day to say that the process has been vindicated.</p><p>Alex Johnstone might be aware that I, the cabinet secretary and, previously, Alex Neil have written to UK ministers to say that we believe that the franchising process is one of the most expensive and drawn-out ways of procuring rail services. We have asked for greater discretion to decide our own way forward with regard to how we procure rail services, but we have been refused that discretion. That can come only through constitutional change or a change of mind on the part of the UK Government; that is nowhere in prospect, given that the UK Government has made clear that it wants to try to mend and continue with the franchising process.</p><p>Mr Johnstone&#8217;s first point was about uncertainties. It is worth pointing out that the uncertainties are not all gone. We do not know what the Brown review will come up with. This morning, I had a very frustrating phone call with the under-secretary of state in which I said that we are trying to proceed with the franchise process at the same time as the UK Government is reviewing the whole basis of franchising. The fact that it is doing that without even giving us the courtesy of a call to tell us what was in the report makes the situation very difficult.

The improvements that are expected are a different set of propositions from the amount of money that we are spending on the line. There seems to be a great focus within both Opposition parties on the fact that we should spend more on it. We have said that 80 per cent of what we propose can be delivered for that price, with the rest of it following either in phase 1, or even quicker if that is thought possible in our discussions with Network Rail.</p><p>It is perhaps best to focus on the massive improvements and the massive investment of &#163;650 million that we will put into improving services not just between Edinburgh and Glasgow, but in associated areas.

The one weather prediction that I can make with confidence is that Scotland will again experience severe weather, whether it is snow, a deep freeze, heavy rain or disruptive storms such as we had last winter.</p><p>As I said, severe weather does not happen just in winter. The summer flooding that affected neighbourhoods across Scotland&#8212;for example, in the Borders, Fife and Perthshire&#8212;is fresh in everyone&#8217;s memory. The volcanic ash cloud also tested the country&#8217;s resilience.</p><p>Only two fifths of the Scots who were questioned by the British Red Cross earlier this summer said that they were prepared for severe weather. They were most concerned about the loss of utilities&#8212;water, gas and electricity.</p><p>We cannot prevent the weather, but we can prepare for it. The Government&#8217;s priority is to get the people of Scotland to think ahead and plan, and therefore to cope better with all kinds of severe weather. The changes that we are trying to bring about will not happen in a year or even in a few years. Our efforts represent a long-term investment in building a more resilient nation.</p><p>This year, the public sector across Scotland is more prepared for severe weather than ever before. Year on year, with the measures that the Government is putting in place, we become stronger in dealing with the challenges of severe weather.</p><p>On Monday, the Scottish Government began its second national resilience campaign in partnership with the British Red Cross. We are undertaking a range of activities to highlight to people that they can do relatively inexpensive but effective things to prepare themselves, their homes, their families, their communities, their places of work and their businesses to withstand the worst effects of weather.</p><p>Our advice to the people of Scotland is that</p><p>&#8220;taking a few small steps now can save a lot of trouble later.&#8221;</p><p>That is advice that we are promoting and that we are trying to ensure gets into the consciousness of people throughout Scotland.</p><p>We are engaging directly with the public and businesses on the high street. There will be 64 information roadshows visiting communities in each local authority area in Scotland and all 56 British Red Cross high street shops will become information and advice hubs. That takes the campaign out to more than 80 towns, cities and villages across Scotland.</p><p>We are also engaging directly with schools. Pupils from primary 5 through to secondary 3 will tomorrow tune in to an online glow meeting hosted by Education Scotland, where they will take part in a conversation about preparing for severe weather.</p><p>Young people can be particularly vulnerable&#8212;both physically and psychologically&#8212;in emergencies, so it is particularly important that they are prepared should they be caught in an emergency situation. However, they also have resources of creativity, energy and enthusiasm. It makes sense to build the foundations of the knowledge required through schools.</p><p>In June this year, the Scottish Government launched the ready for emergencies web resource, which gives teachers a range of suggested activities to select from to enable children and young people to develop resilience as part of curriculum for excellence.</p><p>The ready for emergencies resource was designed by Education Scotland, with a team of teachers, parents&#8217; representatives and resilience experts from the public and voluntary sectors, and it is already being well used in the classroom. To date it has been used by 3,300 people and has had 17,000 page views.</p><p>It is worth quoting the words of a teacher in a Scottish primary school that has been using ready for emergencies:</p><p>&#8220;It is great that whenever there is a major event in the news, we can follow it up with a meaningful activity, and think about what we would do if something similar happened here in the future&#8221;.</p><p>In my own constituency, that message was taken up by the pupils in Dunblane high school. In addition to ensuring that they were as well prepared for winter as possible, they took on the civic responsibility of trying to ensure that they looked after older people in Dunblane during the winter. They should be commended for that.</p><p>One of the key priorities of the Scottish Government in preparing for severe weather is to keep Scotland moving. Transport Scotland delivers its winter service programme on Scotland&#8217;s trunk road network from the start of October right through until mid-May.</p><p>Other measures that have been put in place ahead of winter include the purchase of two ice-breaking vehicles. I think that we can all remember the difficulties with trying to break down sheets of ice on the M8 after a prolonged period of very cold weather. We have made a commitment to have more salt stocked at the start of winter than was used across Scotland in the entire winter of 2010-11.</p><p>We also have a stock of more than 100,000 litres of alternative de-icers that will work in the severest of conditions when road salt becomes less effective&#8212;usually around 8&#176; below freezing or below&#8212;and we are providing guidance for operating companies on when to use these de-icers.</p><p>We also have a strengthened network of weather stations and new cameras at 24 sites to improve decision making. We are publishing daily gritting plans to give the public and media more information about the treatments that are taking place. There is also a freight Scotland hotline for drivers to highlight network problems and provide guidance for heavy goods vehicle drivers. We also have a new YouTube video on winter service provision, which has been produced by key stakeholders and the public.</p><p>We will continue to alert the public to important information about travel conditions through a wide variety of communications channels including Twitter, Traffic Scotland internet radio and the Traffic Scotland website, variable message signs and mobile applications.</p><p>The multi-agency response team&#8212;MART&#8212;will continue to keep people informed and play a major part in the smooth running of the transport network this winter. Members may recall that it was an innovation two years ago that allowed all the key parties to be in the same place at Transport Scotland headquarters at the same time to aid decision making.</p><p>ScotRail has completed its &#163;2.2m programme of investment, which includes reliability improvements to trains over the winter period through train modifications and the purchase of additional plant and equipment, enhanced facilities at stations and depots, and a significant upgrade to passenger information systems.</p><p>Network Rail has enhanced its infrastructure. For example, there is a new icebuster train, which costs between &#163;1&#160;million and &#163;2&#160;million and can quickly thaw out junctions and other key equipment. Network Rail also has many more four-by-four drive vehicles for operational and maintenance staff, and it deploys rail-mounted snowploughs at key locations across the network.</p><p>In addition, Network Rail, in conjunction with rail freight hauliers, has plans to maintain clear rail routes for critical freight train movements. That will ensure that sufficient priority is given to movement by rail of vital commodities, including fuel and food.</p><p>We recognise the serious implications for business and reflect airports&#8217; commitment to their passengers. Scotland&#8217;s airports continue to devote significant resource to meeting the winter weather challenge, including investment in new equipment. For example, Aberdeen airport announced in August an investment of &#163;1.3&#160;million to upgrade its winter vehicle fleet to best deal with the worst conditions, and it has further investment plans for next year.</p><p>Severe weather can happen at any time and we have to be prepared for every eventuality. On 7 December last year the Met Office issued the highest level of warning&#8212;a red warning&#8212;for storm force winds across parts of Scotland. An Atlantic storm soon brought gusts of up to 164mph in some parts, with gusts of 77mph in Edinburgh. The advance information we received from the Met Office enabled us to take steps to prepare the people of Scotland for the disruption to travel that resulted.</p><p>The Met Office has done a lot of work since then to raise awareness of the meanings of its weather warnings. Red warnings are only issued when there is confidence that high levels of disruption will occur, and the public and responders must take action on those warnings to mitigate the effects of a potentially dangerous situation.</p><p>Farmers also have an important role during severe winter weather. In recognition of that, Transport Scotland, in partnership with the National Farmers Union and local authorities, has developed a code of practice to encourage and facilitate roads authorities and farmers to work more closely to get additional resources where they are most needed. I welcome Jim Hume&#8217;s amendment in that regard.</p><p>The storms of last winter caused some of the worst disruption to electricity supplies in recent memory, with more than 170,000 customers across Scotland affected. That is a significant number, although it is far less than the number during the previous comparable boxing day storms of 1998, which cut off over a quarter of a million users. With networks that are tens of thousands of kilometres long and which serve hundreds of thousands of customers over sparse geographical areas, there will be occasions when the power goes out. Scotland&#8217;s two distribution network operators have made network improvements in recent years, invested millions and enhanced their emergency arrangements in partnership with local responders.</p><p>In emergencies, the capacity to exchange information and provide direction and support through resilient telecommunications is vital. I will highlight two areas on which we have made progress in preparation for this winter.</p><p>First, we have acted to address issues that arose last winter regarding the Airwave network utilised by our emergency services. A tri-service group co-ordinated by the Scottish Government worked with Airwave Solutions Ltd to recommend appropriate action. Procedures have been improved to minimise site access problems during periods of intense and prolonged bad weather, generator maintenance scheduling has been enhanced, and engineering improvements have been delivered to improve electrical power reliability. Additionally, greater fuel, battery and electrical power generation has been provided to selected sites, to provide greater self-sufficiency in remote areas during prolonged periods of severe weather. We intend that a similar review of winter performance will be carried out in 2013 so that we can continue to learn lessons and improve reliability.</p><p>Second, we have installed a resilient telecommunications network&#8212;RTN&#8212;which, in the event of public network failures, should provide back-up capacity for strategic co-ordinating groups&#8212;SCGs&#8212;to communicate with each other and the Scottish Government. For the particularly challenging areas of Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and Argyll and Bute, we have added a new satellite communications service.</p><p>We have been making the most of new technology as well. The Scottish Government is introducing a new mobile phone application for iPhone and Android that is aimed at helping the public cope during emergencies. By downloading and using the ready Scotland application, people will be able to gain quick and easy access&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, thank you for the opportunity to update members on how Scotland is becoming more resilient, year on year, in the face of severe weather, and on the preparations that we have put in place for this winter.

I do not think that I will get round to dealing with all of them, but if anyone wants to follow up any that I do not get to, I invite them to let me know and I will try to get back to them.</p><p>It has been a good debate. I was struck by the preponderance of councillors and ex-councillors who were speaking in the debate. I think that, at one point, everyone on the SNP benches was either a councillor or had been a councillor. That has contributed greatly to the quality of the debate. Unlike some people, I think that people&#8217;s experience of local government stands them in good stead when they come to this chamber, and I welcome the contribution that those people made to the debate.</p><p>I should say that there were one or two good speeches by people who have not been councillors&#8212;that is also possible.</p><p>Exercise Arctic blast, which happens tomorrow, is a severe weather event training exercise that is an important part of our preparations. Responder organisations from across the Highlands and Islands will take part in the exercise, which will examine the detailed consequence management of a combination of emergencies, including prolonged loss of electricity and a shortage of basic supplies such as food as a result of severe snow and high winds.</p><p>In my experience, it is a feature of proper contingency and resilience planning that we consider not just the last thing that happened and how we might deal with it again but new events and the fact that some events are compounded by further complications as they proceed. The Highlands and Islands strategic co-ordinating group has identified the loss of the lifeline A9 as a high risk to the region and the fact that, to return to the point that Alex Johnstone made, severe weather elsewhere, such as in the north of England, could seriously impact on the provision of food and other consumables to the area.</p><p>I mentioned the resilient telecommunications network that we have installed. For the particularly challenging areas of Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and Argyll and Bute, we have added a new satellite communications service, which will have a degree of user testing during exercise Arctic blast.</p><p>On the point that Alex Johnstone raised, as much as two years ago, when I first had this job, there were substantial discussions with the supermarkets directly and with Scotland Food &amp; Drink. Those discussions have continued through me and with the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment.</p><p>Much mention has rightly been made of the need for partnership working. The ready for winter campaign is an overwhelming success for partnership working and exemplifies our approach. In addition to the highly productive partnership that we have forged with the British Red Cross, we are working with COSLA and a multitude of other partners from the public, voluntary and private sectors. For example, the support of the major supermarket chains is enabling us to take our road shows into high-footfall areas across the country; 545 libraries will display information; and, with the help of groups such as the Salvation Army and Citizens Advice Scotland, we hope to reach more vulnerable groups.</p><p>Specific mention has been made of councils and the Scottish Government working in partnership. That was a prominent feature of the national roads maintenance review, which concluded in July this year and which set out a framework for initiatives to maintain Scotland&#8217;s roads more efficiently. By encouraging shared services, collaborative working and innovation, the review&#8217;s outcomes will make road maintenance more efficient and improve the condition of our roads.</p><p>In many instances in the south-west and north-east, council gritters grit trunk roads and trunk road gritters grit council roads. There already is a degree of collaborative working, but I agree that we should have more of that. We are trying to achieve that through the roads maintenance review and other measures. Mutual aid is a prominent aspect of the operating companies. For example, if a council is short of vehicles, vehicles can be made available from the trunk road stocks, as we offered to do many times last year. Partnership working is very much a feature of what we are doing. That underlines Anne McTaggart&#8217;s point that we can achieve more by our common endeavours than we can alone. I certainly agree with that.</p><p>Mention was made of the fact that some people might not have access to advice on the internet. That is a fair point. We produce much of the advice in written form. One of the best pieces that I have seen is the advice on driving in bad weather, which seems common sense, but it is an excellent document that is produced by the police, the trunk road operating companies and Transport Scotland. It covers not only driving in ice and snow but driving in conditions such as very low sun, which can cause problems. I commend that document to everybody.</p><p>Community resilience has been mentioned. As we have all seen and as members have mentioned, one wonderful thing that happens when emergencies occur is that people and communities pull together to get one another through the experience. Resilient communities start first and foremost with resilient individuals, and many communities in Scotland are organising their own efforts through local community emergency plans.</p><p>To give just one example, this week, Howwood community council in Renfrewshire took its first steps towards that. Dozens of other communities around Scotland, in places such as Argyll and Bute, Stirling and the Borders, are further down that road. This is not about doing the work of the emergency services; it is about communities making sensible preparations that will enable them to work in support of the emergency services. For example, one rural community cleared snow from an access road to enable a fire engine to attend a house fire. The people knew not to tackle the fire, but their actions made it easier for the fire service to do so quickly.</p><p>Much has been said on flooding, not least by Richard Baker. No one in the Parliament can argue that it is a bad thing for communities to prepare for emergencies, and flooding is one consequence of severe weather for which individuals can often prepare. Just last week, my colleague the Minister for Environment and Climate Change signed up for SEPA&#8217;s floodline service when he visited its flood forecasting centre in Perth.</p><p>I am well aware of the serious effects that flooding can have on homes, businesses and health. SEPA&#8217;s national flood risk assessment has identified 125,000 properties that are at risk of flooding. Never mind what the winter will bring&#8212;we have just had one of the wettest summers on record, and the people of Scotland share a responsibility to protect themselves from flooding. One thing that they can do to start to put protection in place is to sign up for floodline.</p><p>A number of other points were raised. Jim Hume said that 40 per cent or thereabouts of people feel that they are sufficiently prepared, which represents an 8 per cent increase on last year&#8217;s figure. In my opening speech, I made the point that we must build up the position over a number of years and raise awareness, and we will continue to do that. Far fewer people&#8212;16 per cent fewer than last year&#8212;are very or quite concerned about the consequences of severe weather, so we are taking action.</p><p>Hanzala Malik mentioned white lines on the M8. A bigger proportion of the budget has been allocated to white lining, which is being prioritised where the need is greatest. Additional white line refresh has been programmed on sections of the M8 in this financial year, which I hope will address some of the member&#8217;s concerns.</p><p>Two members mentioned the idea of a hotline for vulnerable people, which is being considered seriously. As many people know, services check on vulnerable people. Various agencies have lists of vulnerable people and are good at checking on them. The most sensible approach is to draw that activity together so that it is co-ordinated.</p><p>Many people are familiar with the existing hotlines, so it is important that they continue to be available. We will continue to look at that. In a crisis, people react by using something that is familiar, whether that is NHS 24, the traffic Scotland service or local social work services. It is important that familiar services are available. We have also developed vulnerable people protocols, to ensure that they are taken care of.</p><p>That also applies to people who depend on heating fuels&#8212;on off-grid energy supplies&#8212;which a number of members mentioned. A great deal of work was done 18 months ago to deal with the issue of the last mile in delivering heating fuels, which a number of members talked about. The companies that are concerned have invested a great deal in four-wheel-drive vehicles and many other measures.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Earlier, I outlined many of the steps that Scotland is taking to prepare for severe weather, not only in winter but all year round.

I am sorry about that, because I see that he is often the only Tory on the Tory benches. I feel sorry for him and I would like to accept his amendment but, unfortunately, a number of the points in it are not exactly accurate. The reviews that he talked about are much more about general road maintenance. However, I give him the assurance that he seeks about the preparedness of the trunk road companies&#8212;we have ensured that they are prepared.</p><p>I cannot accept the Labour amendment, which brings me to perhaps the key point of the debate. The debate was good but, unfortunately, Labour members once again made a list of demands for more spending. They wanted more money for local government, even though we could not guarantee that it would be spent in the required areas, as one member pointed out. They asked for more money for local and trunk roads, more money for central heating, more money for trains and more money to deal with fuel poverty&#8212;I am genuinely unaware of whether the winter fuel allowance counts as &#8220;something for nothing&#8221; in that context. They also asked for more money for flood prevention.</p><p>As Mark McDonald said and as most people with a local authority background know, if more money is to be spent on something, it must be taken from something else. The position is not as it was in the days of Andy Kerr, when &#163;700&#160;million was left lying in the budget. We spend the money that we have, for good purposes.</p><p>I say to Labour Party members and others who genuinely suggested ideas that I have tried to address them. If someone has a genuine suggestion of a good idea for improving the situation and if a cost is attached to it&#8212;I am not saying that the cost must be definitive; we can help with that&#8212;I am more than willing to listen to it. However, members cannot continually ask for more spending without identifying where the money would come from.</p><p>I repeat that, this winter, Scotland is better prepared than ever to deal with the effects of severe weather. We understand that we can always do more, because the weather will always carry a risk of disruption. This year, we ask the people of Scotland not to let the nasty weather that might happen turn into a nasty situation.

I wanted to provide as much clarity as is possible in the circumstances on the impact on passengers and on the refranchising of rail services in Scotland. My immediate concern is that passengers are not adversely affected by the Department for Transport&#8217;s decision.</p><p>The department&#8217;s handling of the procurement process has been incompetent and shambolic. Most important, it has caused a great deal of confusion and speculation about arrangements for west coast services after the franchise handover date of 9 December.</p><p>Neither the Scottish ministers nor officials were made aware of yesterday&#8217;s decision in advance of the announcement. I have yet to see the detail of the DFT&#8217;s contingency plan and it is still not clear who will be operating train services in December. However, after finally managing to speak to the United Kingdom rail minister, I have his assurance that services will run to timetable, using the same trains and staff, and that tickets and bookings will be valid. DFT ministers said yesterday that our Administrations have a common interest in ensuring that there is no break in the service for passengers after 9 December.</p><p>In light of the mishandling of the franchise, I can understand that many people might be reluctant to give too much weight to DFT assurances. Although our powers in regard to rail remain limited, I and my officials will monitor the assurances carefully and offer all necessary assistance to ensure that passengers are not disadvantaged. I hope that that offers some reassurance for passengers, especially as we will be approaching the festive and holiday period at that time.</p><p>Let us be clear. What has happened represents a huge failure in public procurement. I want to be clear about the anger and frustration that I feel on behalf of passengers who rely on the west coast main line. The Secretary of State for Transport conceded that there were &#8220;completely unacceptable mistakes&#8221; in evaluating bids for the west coast franchise. The mistakes were so serious that he has been forced to cancel the current franchising competition. I understand that the flaws were discovered after detailed examination by Department for Transport officials and evidence gathering in preparation for legal proceedings that Virgin Trains brought after the decision to award the franchise to FirstGroup.</p><p>The Department for Transport has spoken to the four bidding companies, whose bid costs will be reimbursed. That scandalous waste of public money could have been avoided if the franchise had been awarded properly. A fresh competition will be started as soon as the lessons of the episode are learned.</p><p>The secretary of state has announced a review of the handling of the process, which will report at the end of the month, and a review of the DFT&#8217;s wider franchising programme, which will be led by Richard Brown, chair of Eurostar, and will report by the end of the year. DFT&#8217;s three live franchise competitions have been suspended.</p><p>The decision to cancel the award of the franchise has, of course, direct consequences for Scotland, for rail passengers and for the rail industry. The UK Government offered no discussion or advance notice of a decision that directly affects people who travel to and from Scotland on services that are crucial to the economies of our major cities.</p><p>I have been asked a number of times whether the DFT&#8217;s actions have implications for our rail franchise procurement. Let me be clear. Yesterday&#8217;s announcement is focused solely on failings and incompetence in the Department for Transport, not in Transport Scotland.</p><p>We are keen to offer our support for the wider review of franchising. The Deputy First Minister will seek to meet the Secretary of State for Transport as soon as possible, and the First Minister has already spoken to the secretary of state. The reviews and the recommendations that are made will provide lessons for us as well as for the DFT on how risk can be better assessed and on bidding and evaluation processes.</p><p>I reassure the Parliament that although lessons will be learned, our franchise procurement process is led by an expert team in Transport Scotland, which is free to draw on external expertise as and when required. That can only be right given the scale of taxpayers&#8217; money involved and the importance of passenger rail services to Scotland&#8217;s economy and its communities. The franchise is the largest single Government procurement exercise that we conduct. No corners are being cut in that process; no false economies are being made.</p><p>On our current timetable, we are allowing at least 20 months to conduct the formal competition and, when the consultation that was launched last November is included, our process will last more than three years in total. In comparison, the DFT originally conducted a consultation in January 2011 in order to let a contract in April 2012, which is less than half the time that we have allowed for our process. It then delayed the process, but it still allowed only seven months from formal invitation to tender to contract award.</p><p>We are still awaiting the consultation on the trans-Pennine franchise, including on services to Scotland, despite the fact that that is due to hand over at the same time as the ScotRail franchise, the consultation for which took place last year. That is more than a year behind our timescale. Only last January I wrote to Theresa Villiers, who is no longer at the department, expressing concern over the timescale for the east coast main line franchise, which is also a vital service for Scotland.</p><p>As I set out in June, I will announce more details on the specification of our franchises around the turn of the year. Our more realistic timeline allows us to factor in any lessons that are learnt as a consequence of the DFT debacle and the recommendations that are made by the independent review commissioned by the DFT.</p><p>I am confident of the competence and professionalism of Transport Scotland staff. This Government has an excellent track record on procurement, and recent examples of that are the M74 and the Airdrie to Bathgate rail line. We will, of course, draw on yesterday&#8217;s events and the forthcoming reviews to maintain our strong record but, without pre-empting the review, I do not think that it is credible to lay all the blame on civil servants. The new Westminster franchising policy has been changed to a preference for 15 year contracts with no break or revenue review clauses. That policy ignores the difficulty of accurately forecasting revenue over 15 years.</p><p>When I announced the details of the next ScotRail contract, I made it clear that the 10 year contract would have an option for a break after five years. That will address one of the difficulties that the DFT is experiencing. We will ensure that the sleeper franchise contains appropriate provisions to address the forecast risk and that the Scottish Government shares in the return on its investment.</p><p>I urge the Secretary of State for Transport to take the opportunity of the review to address those wider questions, as it would be a missed opportunity to narrow down the reviews simply to issues of technical process. Rather than another patch and mend, a different model is required.</p><p>The current legislation&#8212;primarily the Railways Act 1993&#8212;envisaged a railway that was specified and funded in the public interest, but which was provided by the private sector. The result is a fragmented and inefficient model. We are doing all that we can in our powers to make that model work as best it can. We are committed to a deep alliance between the operator and Network Rail for the next franchise, and we are proceeding with the franchise process in a timely and competent manner. However, in 2012, the current model is not fit for purpose, and I have repeatedly raised that concern with the UK Government.</p><p>Our powers to give Scotland the rail services that it needs are limited by UK legislation. Giving this Parliament competence to have full legislative control for rail would be the simplest and most effective way to ensure that Scottish ministers have the flexibility to consider the full range of options to deliver rail services in Scotland, including public sector models. The UK Government&#8217;s decision is further evidence of why Scotland needs the powers of an independent Parliament so that it can take full responsibility for its own rail services.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674326", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: West Coast Main Line"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to make a statement on yesterday&#8217;s decision by the Department for Transport to cancel the award of the intercity west coast franchise.

I remind members that the subject of the debate is the Scottish green bus fund, as it is not immediately obvious from the Labour amendment, for example, that the debate is about that. The Scottish green bus fund is an integral part of how we will deliver the commitment to a sustainable economic future for Scotland.</p><p>Our public transport services play a vital role in enabling access to employment, training, public services, leisure, and friends and family. They produce less carbon, pollution and congestion per passenger mile than private cars do. That is reflected in our commitments in our climate change agenda to encourage a modal shift towards more sustainable and active modes of travel and to support lower-carbon and more fuel-efficient options within modes.</p><p>The bus sector plays a particularly key role. In 2010-11, buses ran 354 million kilometres on local services in Scotland. Buses deliver 438 million passenger journeys a year and 80 per cent of all passenger journeys made by public transport. They carry some 12 per cent of the population to work every day. For many communities, they are the principal or the only means of public transport.</p><p>Over the past few years, the Government has worked closely with the bus industry to support the introduction of more environmentally friendly, low-carbon vehicles into the Scottish bus fleet. The debate will consider the importance of that continuing work for transport, the environment and bus users. Last month, I announced a further round of the Scottish green bus fund worth &#163;3 million and, last week, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth announced further funding of &#163;2.5 million for hybrid buses in 2013-14 as part of his budget statement.</p><p>I will start by setting the context for bus transport in delivering our climate change agenda. Our environment is increasingly affected by the decisions that individuals make on a daily basis, transport being one of those decisions. Transport is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions by all transport, including freight, account for a quarter of all emissions in Scotland. Within that total, road transport accounts for 70 per cent. Bus transport produces 3 per cent of road emissions, but that figure is growing, partly because of increases in the weight of conventional diesel buses resulting from the equipment that is needed to ensure, rightly, that they are accessible to all passengers, and partly because of increasing improvements in the efficiency of other road transport modes, including cars and freight. Buses in urban areas also contribute to the particulate and other emissions that have a detrimental effect on the air quality in too many of our towns and cities.</p><p>As we see bus transport as an important and growing part of the transport mix, it is important that we take action to address those environmental impacts. That is why the Government has been incentivising the purchase and operation of low-carbon vehicles.</p><p>Part of our approach to doing that is the Scottish green bus fund, which has a number of potential benefits. It can reduce the direct impact of buses&#8217; carbon and other emissions on the environment and newer vehicles improve the quality of service, encouraging modal shift from car to bus. It can increase demand for low-carbon vehicles, benefiting bus manufacturers and allowing them to develop and invest in technology and achieve economies of scale. That is an important point because, although the Government&#8217;s role is to incentivise the purchase of low-carbon vehicles, it is not the idea that we will continue to do that for ever more; we want to help the industry to move towards that and provide encouragement for operators.</p><p>The Scottish green bus fund can contribute over time to reductions in the overall cost of low-carbon vehicles, which will improve their commercial viability and encourage increasing investment by bus operators. In turn, that will create and sustain opportunities for Scottish businesses to develop expertise in innovation in bus manufacturing and operation.</p><p>So far, we have completed two rounds of the Scottish green bus fund. The first two rounds have already delivered 71 low-carbon hybrid vehicles to nine bus operators that provide services in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee and Aberdeen. Last month, I announced a third round of &#163;3 million, to run this year. As I said, last week, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth announced further funding for hybrid buses in 2013-14 of &#163;2.5 million, which will bring Scottish Government funding for green buses over four years to &#163;11.3 million, which I believe represents a continuing and sustained commitment to lower-carbon bus services.</p><p>What are the practical benefits that we are achieving as a result of those investments? We have reduced the direct environmental impact that is made by vehicles, as each new bus delivers an average reduction in CO2 of around 21 tonnes per year and 300 tonnes over its life cycle, which makes an important contribution to achieving our climate change targets. In parallel with reducing carbon use, those buses are also producing less exhaust gas, which helps to improve air quality. It is worth noting, in relation to the buses that we have funded in the Edinburgh area, that the initial estimate of a reduction in fuel consumption of around 40 per cent has been substantially exceeded; we are told by Lothian Buses that the reduction is around 60 per cent. Obviously, as well as using far less fuel, there are benefits to the environment and business benefits to the operators.</p><p>In some instances, the newer vehicles that are being supported are helping to encourage modal shift by delivering higher quality services that can encourage car drivers to go by bus rather than car.</p><p>An example of a successful operation, which has seen a growth in patronage, is the number 10 route that is run in Edinburgh by Lothian Buses. The operator took the opportunity of improving the overall specification of the vehicle and developed a specific marketing brand. That demonstrates that bus users respond to the provision of high quality green transport.</p><p>Central to the Government&#8217;s approach to climate change is a sense that tackling climate change is not just a moral and practical imperative, but an economic opportunity. Green buses are a case in point.</p><p>Scotland is fortunate in having in Alexander Dennis Ltd a world class bus manufacturer that has been successful in developing diesel and electric hybrid buses.</p><p>The green bus fund is competitive and market driven. Operators receiving grants make their own commercial decisions about who to place their orders with. It is therefore commendable that Alexander Dennis has enjoyed such considerable success in winning orders from the first two rounds of the green bus fund in competition with other manufacturers, which has helped the company to invest further in hybrid bus technology.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Government is committed, as its main purpose, to creating a more successful country, with opportunities for everybody to flourish through increasing sustainable economic growth.

For example, Henderson Travel in Lanarkshire has benefited greatly from hybrid bus technology.</p><p>We are aware of the situation that Patrick Harvie described. Further development of the green bus fund will provide the possibility of doing some exciting things in the school bus transport system, which comprises a number of small operators as well. We are concerned to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises benefit. So far, as I said, that has been the picture with the green bus fund.</p><p>Alexander Dennis has won orders across the world and now has substantial investments in bus building in Australia. It continues to innovate and is looking at how hybrids can be made still more effective in operation. When I recently visited Alexander Dennis I discussed school buses, not least because some of the fleet comprises older and less environmentally friendly buses. I hope that that discussion will lead to further innovation.</p><p>Alexander Dennis can also provide examples of the delivery of other benefits that we have sought through the Scottish green bus fund: investing in technology, developing Scottish expertise and delivering real commercial benefits for operators as well as environmental ones. Given the recent history of Alexander Dennis, we should all be pleased about the turnaround that has taken place in that company and the vibrancy with which it approaches the future.</p><p>The green bus fund supports capital investment, but it is not the only way in which we incentivise low-carbon vehicles across Scotland&#8217;s bus network. The bus service operators grant, which is mentioned in the Labour amendment, has been refocused so that we provide additional, continuing revenue incentives for the operation of low-carbon vehicles, including hybrids, which benefit from a doubling in grant compared with that for conventional vehicles. Members will remember that the rationale for the changes to the bus service operators grant that have taken place is to help more rural areas and to ensure that what we do rewards actual miles travelled by buses with passengers, which is important and was not the case before. We have doubled the incentives for operators to use environmentally friendly vehicles and the bus service operators grant is another means by which to improve the environment.</p><p>We must acknowledge, though, that operators take something of a risk when they purchase what is still a relatively new and unproven technology, albeit with the caveat that I mentioned previously about the experience in Lothian. The technology is increasingly less unproven and is becoming more known to more bus operators. However, such purchasing decisions can be difficult, given the technological and market uncertainties. The green bus fund and the low-carbon bus service operators grant try to help reduce the risks and shift the balance. In the long term, I believe that operators stand to reap considerable benefits. I referred previously to a 60 per cent reduction in fuel consumption in that regard. Fuel costs for the bus industry have gone up by 57 per cent in the past five years, so the ability to substantially reduce such costs&#8212;by more than half in the case that I mentioned&#8212;must be good news.</p><p>I applaud the way in which operators have used our support creatively as an opportunity to develop their services and not just their vehicles. If that is done well it makes a substantial difference for the user, with higher-specification vehicles. If anybody has not tried the number 10 vehicles in Edinburgh, I encourage them to do so&#8212;they have a higher spec and a different appearance so that everyone knows that they are on a hybrid vehicle. Such vehicles give a smoother ride, have strong branding and highlight the clear contribution that travelling by bus makes to helping the environment. That imaginative use of new technology has helped its early acceptance by the public and it offers a direction for future improvements in service quality.</p><p>Talking about the future, it is now clear that there are substantive benefits from the investment made through the green bus fund. However, there are 5,400 vehicles in the Scottish bus fleet, so we have more to do. I re-emphasise that we are trying to incentivise the move towards green buses. The benefit will be that, over time, the investments by operators and producers will start to make that easier. The third and future rounds of the fund will have their part to play. I look forward to continuing to work in partnership with bus operators and manufacturers to finish what we have started and to make a substantial centre of excellence in Scotland.</p><p>The Government considers the green bus fund to be a proven success. Despite the current financial difficulties, we will continue to take every opportunity to make the investment and to consider how to further that investment with the industry, to help with its drive to ensure that the cost reductions and other benefits from the technology that is there or coming are realised.</p><p>I have focused on hybrid buses and the green bus fund, but it is important to recognise that other technologies offer similar benefits to our bus fleets and to other forms of road transport. For example, the Government supports the hydrogen bus project that is being led by Aberdeen City Council and SSE. That will result in 10 hydrogen buses operating on routes in central Aberdeen, which will be the largest fleet of hydrogen-powered buses anywhere in Europe.</p><p>A local company in my constituency developed a hydrogen power unit that can be used in ferries. In fact, it is being used in a ferry in Bristol. Because the unit is so efficient and light, after it was fitted more ballast had to be put into the vessel. There is a difficulty with new technologies to do with ensuring that the regulatory framework is there. That project was, if you like, a pipe clearer for future projects.</p><p>We also support electric vehicle technology. In March, we launched our E-cosse initiative, which is a partnership between Government, industry, WWF Scotland and other key stakeholders to advance the adoption of electric vehicles in Scotland. The initiative aims to make Scotland an EV pioneer. We are producing a road map, to be published in early 2013, which will lead to a portfolio of projects to advance electric vehicle adoption.</p><p>I have set out the original environmental aims of the Scottish green bus fund, outlined the benefits to the environment, the economy and bus users that have been delivered so far through the introduction of low-carbon vehicles to the bus fleet and looked forward to our continuing programme of support for the take-up of new hybrid technologies. I am therefore happy to move the motion in my name.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Green Bus Fund has already supported the delivery of 71 new low-carbon hybrid buses; welcomes the contribution that these are making toward reducing fuel consumption and Scotland&#8217;s carbon emissions; urges the Scottish Government and the bus industry to continue to work together to improve the environmental performance of Scotland&#8217;s bus fleet, and further welcomes the launch of the third round of the fund, worth &#163;3 million in 2012-13, and the provision of an additional &#163;2.5 million for hybrid buses in the draft budget for 2013-14.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is a fair concern, but the way in which the green bus fund has been distributed so far shows the benefit to small companies rather than the bigger ones to which Patrick Harvie refers.

I also recently had the opportunity to travel to Orkney by ferry, under the new management, and I enjoyed the usual Orcadian hospitality and some very helpful and pragmatic discussions with the islands&#8217; council.</p><p>I was a little confused when the Labour Party asked for a ministerial statement on ferries to Orkney. I was not confused about the content&#8212;the Scottish Government understands the importance of ferries to the communities of Orkney and Shetland&#8212;but about the timing. The most recent events regarding ferries to Orkney and Shetland took place during the previous parliamentary term when the Scottish Government concluded its tendering of the northern isles ferry services contract. Serco was announced as the preferred bidder on 4 May. There was a short delay while one of the other bidders appealed the outcome, but the court found in the Government&#8217;s favour and the contract was signed on 1 June. The new contract commenced as planned on 5 July, following a well-managed handover period on which I must congratulate the staff of the outgoing operator, NorthLink Ferries, and the incoming operator, Serco.</p><p>Those events were certainly of public interest and they created understandable, if temporary, concern for staff and ferry users. Some members took the chance to speak to me at the time, but I do not recall any calls from Labour for a ministerial statement. By my reckoning, there were eight weeks between the announcement of the preferred bidder and the end of the previous parliamentary term. If I had been asked for a statement, I would gladly have given it. We are now in a new parliamentary term, looking ahead to new challenges and opportunities, including the new legislative programme announced yesterday by the First Minister. However, we have been asked by the Labour Party to look back for the next 30 minutes, so we will.</p><p>I have set out the main milestones that led to the successful handover to Serco on 5 July. Serco has chosen to trade as Serco NorthLink for the provision of the services, thus recognising the value that the communities attach to the NorthLink brand.</p><p>As I mentioned, I had the opportunity to use the ferry service when I travelled to Orkney on 9 July. As always, I was very impressed with the service and I recommend it to all members. The vessels that provide the services are among the best that we have in Scotland, although the latest ferry that we have introduced to the Hebrides, the &#163;25 million MV Finlaggan, is of a similar standard, and the new &#163;42 million ferry for the Stornoway to Ullapool route that I announced on 8 June will be a further step forward in technical prowess. That new vessel will use around a quarter less fuel than the current service, which is an important consideration given the Parliament&#8217;s climate change targets and ambitions.</p><p>The Serco NorthLink staff are, by and large, the same staff who have been providing an outstanding service on board and on-shore for many years. They continue to provide an efficient and courteous service and the on-board facilities are excellent.</p><p>There were those who were concerned about the change in operator. I can understand that. Change always brings uncertainty and it is the responsibility of the new operator to prove that it is up to the task. The feedback from customers and stakeholders that I have received is that Serco NorthLink has achieved that. It has adopted the NorthLink brand, employed the existing staff and is deploying the same vessels, so there has been much more continuity than change. The operator has planned improvements for the future that ferry users in Orkney and Shetland will welcome, I am sure.</p><p>One change that users, particularly those in Shetland, will notice and appreciate is that Serco NorthLink is taking a fresh approach to vessel overhauls. I understand that during the winter there will be no interruption to services, in contrast to the long dry-dock period of last year. That responds to the representations that I received from the local community, the council and the constituency MSP.</p><p>I also received representations from the trade unions about the position of their members. The contract that we put in place ensured the transfer of all those employees who wished it, with their terms and conditions intact. There was a particular concern about pensions, and strike action was briefly mooted by the RMT. Thanks to the contract&#8217;s provisions and the commendable response of Serco NorthLink management and the RMT in getting around the table, I am pleased to say that the issue was quickly resolved to the satisfaction, I understand, of the RMT. I plan to follow that up when I meet RMT representatives tomorrow afternoon.</p><p>In tendering the northern isles ferry services, the Scottish Government was doing nothing different from its predecessors. The Labour Party and, after devolution, the Liberal Democrats, were responsible for the award of three northern isles contracts: the first to P&amp;amp;O Scottish Ferries in 1997, the second to the original NorthLink, which commenced in 2002 and&#8212;when that contract failed&#8212;the third to the second incarnation of NorthLink in 2006.</p><p>We may not always support the tendering of public services. I am sure that many Labour members feel the same, but we are working to the same set of European rules to which they worked when they were in government. As Duncan McNeil, whose constituency includes the David MacBrayne headquarters, said when the Parliament debated the issue in 2005:</p><p>&#8220;The primacy of European Union law over United Kingdom law is long established. We might not like it, but we need to make the best of it. We need to meet our international obligations and our moral obligations to those who elected us.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 14 September 2005; c 19046.]</p><p>When we have to tender public services, we have an obligation to do so efficiently and effectively and to work within the current rules. The northern isles tendering exercise attracted four high-quality and competitive bids. That ensured the continuation of a high-quality ferry service, as well as best value for public money.</p><p>Since 2007, we have allocated record sums of money to the ferry services in Scotland despite severe pressure on public spending and despite cost pressures, such as the rising cost of fuel. For example, in the previous financial year we absorbed an increase in subsidies to CalMac Ferries and NorthLink of around &#163;14 million, which was due to fuel costs.</p><p>I also look to secure changes to the European Union rules. I have met the European Commission to point out the absurdity of having a maximum contract length for ferries of six years when, under parallel EU rules, rail contracts can be at least 15 years long. I will continue to make that case to the EU.</p><p>We have committed to publishing our final ferries plan by the end of the year. That will provide a blueprint for improvements to ferry services throughout the country, as well as a foundation for a long-term programme of investments in modern, efficient vessels and accompanying shoreside infrastructure. Those investments support jobs in Scotland, not only for the ferry operators but in civil engineering and shipbuilding.</p><p>I am proud that the Scottish Government has brought commercial shipbuilding back to the Clyde with the award of a contract for two cutting-edge hybrid ferries to Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd. That not only safeguards 75 jobs, but creates 100 more jobs and, for the future, 20 modern apprenticeships.</p><p>Following the publication of the final ferries plan, we will focus on the next major challenge: the replacement of the contract for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services, which expires in October 2013. The Government awarded the current contract to CalMac Ferries in 2007 following a competitive tendering exercise undertaken by the previous Administration. We will soon announce our plans for the procurement of the next contract.</p><p>I am aware that the trade unions have concerns about how their CalMac members might be affected. They raised the same concerns with me at the time of the northern isles tendering and I was able to work constructively with them and achieve an outcome with which all parties appear to be satisfied, notwithstanding the concerns that we share about the current EU tendering rules. I have two meetings with the unions planned for the coming weeks to enable me to listen to and respond to those concerns.</p><p>I assure members that I am always happy to come to the chamber and defend the Government&#8217;s record on ferries. As I have shown with the examples that I gave, we have achieved record investments, have maintained services despite severe financial pressures and once again see commercial ships being built on the Clyde.</p><p>I said at the start that I was confused by the request from Labour for this statement, but I hope that nobody is in any doubt about the strength and clarity of our commitment to our island communities and to the ferries that serve them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671472", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferry Services (Orkney)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to be able to give my statement so soon after the Scottish Cabinet&#8217;s successful meeting in Orkney.

In addition, there have been significant improvements, some of which&#8212;such as those relating to dry-dock arrangements, which people on the islands and stakeholders were unhappy about&#8212;have been mentioned.

I issued no instructions to the CalMac board, nor did Alex Neil in his capacity as Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment.

They might not be directly involved with the Scottish Government but they work on their own merits. Many of them, including Scottish War Blinded, have been around for many years and we acknowledge the work that they carry out.</p><p>ASAP is a free, independent and confidential advice service that is available to serving personnel, veterans and their families, regardless of where they live in Scotland&#8212;although I take on board Maureen Watt&#8217;s point. The Scottish Government does not provide these services directly, but we must as far as possible ensure that veterans throughout Scotland are able to draw on available services.</p><p>ASAP&#8217;s specialist advice is available through appropriate signposting and is only a phone call away. Initial advice is available on a national helpline&#8212;0845 231 0300&#8212;and, after that, veterans can get an appointment with an adviser at a designated CAB. This excellent, intuitive and well-designed tool makes the right connections with organisations and agencies that have expertise of direct benefit to those who need it and provides the right people to assist with benefits inquiries; debt and money management advice; housing issues, to which I will return in a moment; work-related problems; consumer issues; and help in coping with relationships.</p><p>In response to Alex Fergusson&#8217;s point about the preponderance of veterans in the homelessness figures, I point out that we have been tackling homelessness directly. For example, as was made clear during First Minister&#8217;s questions, the level of homelessness dropped by almost a fifth over the past year while, south of the border, there was a substantial increase. We have managed to reduce those figures in the teeth both of a recession and of certain welfare reforms that have increased homelessness south of the border. If Mr Fergusson has more information on the figure that he mentioned&#8212;more than 10 per cent, I believe&#8212;I would be interested in hearing it.</p><p>In order to tackle this issue more effectively, we need more effective joint working between those who help veterans, the Scottish Government and the Ministry of Defence. We have certainly had a great deal of co-operation from those at the very top of the armed forces, who have made it very clear that they are keen to work with us; and Veterans Scotland has said the same. However, if the MOD and the Scottish Government can engage more effectively, we will be able to pick up certain issues, particularly the point highlighted by Christina McKelvie about the ability of members of the armed forces to apply for housing.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670789", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Services Advice Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I certainly commend Scottish War Blinded on its work.

All I am saying is that I would like more information. I know that that has been the case in the past when there have been substantial reductions in the homelessness figures but it seems counterintuitive that that should continue to be the case.</p><p>As part of my work with the MOD, I have recently visited two bases. The visits were not public; I had gone along with the intention of asking serving personnel to give me their views and to highlight certain issues, particularly with regard to leaving the service. In one base, the tables were turned on me and I had around 40 personnel from the different ranks asking me what the Scottish Government was able to do. Housing came up repeatedly, but often their questions were less about what the Scottish Government could do before personnel left the service and more about what the MOD could do with regard to, for example, housing grants, which are available only in certain parts of the country. It was extremely useful for me to realise where we have more work to do and to get an idea of serving personnel&#8217;s concerns.</p><p>The statistics in the motion make very impressive reading. Christina McKelvie mentioned some of them: ASAP has helped more than 1,400 clients in 21 months and addressed 6,000 issues. I am particularly struck by the fact that it has secured almost &#163;900,000 in additional benefits for those who access the service. That is a successful project by any description and I congratulate all the advisers in each CAB on their considerable achievement.</p><p>It is only right that the other partners in the project are congratulated on their foresight and commitment, and on their support of ASAP. First and foremost the role of Poppyscotland must be applauded, as Alex Fergusson mentioned. The staff from that veterans charity work very closely with CAS and it is entirely appropriate to acknowledge the fantastic work that Ian McGregor and his staff have done to move the project forward. It is also right that we acknowledge the other funders. There are many, which demonstrates the faith that they put into ASAP. I welcome the contributions and support of the other veterans charities mentioned in the motion.</p><p>I am sure that members would also wish me to record the role of the Scottish Government in the project, which is a minor part, but integral nevertheless. We contribute to the Scottish veterans fund just more than &#163;6,000 towards the cost of booklets for advisers, which has helped to build the library of information that has proved to be so invaluable. I am pleased that we have made a contribution to that.</p><p>Of course, ASAP is a tool to be used to assist those who face difficulties when transiting from military to civilian life or who experience problems some years after discharge. Mark Griffin spoke about some of those challenges for service personnel and I should challenge one of his points. Service personnel often cook for themselves, although that tends to be in circumstances where they have ready-made food products in the field. He is right to say that when service personnel move into a tenancy or new housing arrangements they face a challenge of home economics. The armed forces could do more about that while people are still serving.</p><p>I look forward to reading the CAB report on veterans&#8217; issues, which was published today. I am sure that it will provide valuable insight into particular needs and aspirations. Members will be interested to know that yesterday I met with Colonel Martin Gibson, who is chairman of Veterans Scotland. Once again, he congratulated the Scottish Government for its inclusive, supportive and effective raft of programmes, which was developed to support our armed forces and veterans community.</p><p>Last year I announced in the chamber that the Government would publish a road map, which would set out our future plans for the planning and delivery of support and advice services.

The Government has invested record levels in rail, opening two new passenger lines and seven new stations, providing 38 new trains and increasing train services by 10 per cent. Since 2004, intermodal rail freight traffic has grown substantially and passenger numbers have increased by 30 per cent. We are determined to build on that success and ensure that our railways meet the needs of the people of Scotland.</p><p>Rail must form a key part of a fully integrated transport system. Rail passengers are also cyclists, bus users and ferry passengers and it is essential to everyone that journeys are joined-up. We have an opportunity to make that happen in 2014, with the new contracts for rail passenger services and a new funding agreement for Network Rail.</p><p>The &#8220;Rail 2014&#8221; consultation showed the importance that the people of Scotland attach to rail services. It attracted more than 1,200 responses, which are being published today, and I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. I am also grateful to the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee for its scrutiny of the issues, and I have today written to the convener to set out how we will pursue its recommendations.</p><p>Rail services in the United Kingdom are provided through a private sector model. Although the Scottish network is funded entirely by the Scottish ministers, the structure of rail remains reserved. We have written to UK ministers several times, most recently in February and May, making it clear that we could achieve better outcomes for passengers if Scotland had overall responsibility for rail. I am disappointed that, so far, UK ministers have chosen not to respond. A yes vote in 2014 will enable us to rectify the situation and create a more fully integrated transport network.</p><p>In setting out the way forward for Scottish rail services from 2014, I will focus on three areas: the structure of our railways and the requirements that are placed on the rail industry; the future of the franchise; and the benefit to passengers.</p><p>I am pleased to announce a &#163;5 billion programme of investment in Scotland&#8217;s railways between 2014 and 2019. That will support the delivery of franchised passenger services and enable Network Rail to operate, maintain and enhance the network over that period, which will continue the delivery of the Edinburgh to Glasgow improvement programme and the Borders railway. We will announce further progress on EGIP shortly. Network Rail will also be required to advance a series of strategic enhancement projects, including work on the Highland main line and the Aberdeen to Inverness rail improvements project, as detailed in our infrastructure investment plan.</p><p>We are working to future proof the network. Organisations across Scotland have come together to make the case for high-speed rail. We will continue to drive forward work on that while ensuring that EGIP and the other network improvements are compatible with our approach.</p><p>We are establishing separate funding streams to provide for future growth. A &#163;30 million fund will support strategic freight enhancements, while &#163;60 million of investment will improve journey times and punctuality, and &#163;10 million will develop future projects, alongside the &#163;30 million that has been announced for new and improved stations. A further &#163;10 million fund will accelerate the closure of level-crossings, to make our railways even safer.</p><p>Our requirements and funds are set out in our high-level output specification and the statement of funds available, both of which are being published today. We will issue new guidance to the Office of Rail Regulation on how we expect it to best represent Scotland&#8217;s interests.</p><p>On taking forward the franchise, we agree with the rail unions and others that privatisation has led to too much fragmentation and additional costs. The rail industry has for too long been distracted by internal arguments over responsibility. We will therefore expect the ScotRail franchise holder and Network Rail to work together to develop a deeper alliance, which will be a significant step towards greater industry integration. The industry should focus on passengers, providing better services and enhancing resilience and operational effectiveness. We expect that deeper alliance to generate annual savings of up to &#163;30 million.</p><p>Passengers have made it clear that they value a single focused contract for services across Scotland. We therefore intend to let the next ScotRail contract for 10 years, with a potential break point after five years, to encourage investment and ensure that the franchisee focuses on improving performance, increasing passenger numbers and enhancing the rail experience. We will welcome bids from a wide range of operators, including not-for-profit operators.</p><p>When we consider the future of rail services, the Caledonian sleeper stands as a unique and cherished service for rail users to and from Scotland. In December, we announced our contribution to the &#163;100 million-plus of transformational investment in the service. To get the best from that investment and ensure that the Caledonian sleeper remains a unique, valued and high-profile service, we intend to let a separate franchise for it of up to 15 years.</p><p>The Caledonian sleeper is more than just a train service; it is sometimes part of a holiday, it is a business office and it can be a hotel. The sleeper is special to passengers and to Scotland. Users should be clear that the improvements will be made in the term of the next franchise. A separate longer franchise, coupled with more than &#163;100 million of investment, will give this historic service the 21st century future that it deserves. The specification of both franchises will be published at the turn of the year.</p><p>Of course, our passenger rail network&#8217;s primary purpose is to enable travel connections for work, services and leisure. We are determined that passengers will feel the benefit of the new arrangements. Rail fares will be attractive and affordable, and we intend to expand fares regulation to protect those in rural areas, as well as commuters. We will look to the next franchisee to increase passenger numbers through innovative fares packages. That will build on the Stranraer promotion, under which fares will be reduced by 65 per cent. We need the franchisee to use available capacity on off-peak and lightly used services.</p><p>We are fully aware that people want joined-up journey options, so we will require bidders to develop plans and proposals for the actions that they can take to link with other forms of transport&#8212;bus, bike and ferry. It is sensible to ensure that buses arrive in time for trains and vice versa. To support that, we will expect comprehensive smart ticketing across the network by the end of the franchise.</p><p>In line with the digital strategy, which the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment laid out, and in response to business and passenger demand, we will look for wi-fi-type facilities to be available across the network by 2019. In preparation for that, I was delighted to launch the pilot wi-fi programme earlier this week.</p><p>Members may recall that, during the consultation, there was discussion about antisocial behaviour and the consumption of alcohol on trains. We had a substantial number of responses on that issue. We will take forward with the franchise holder and British Transport Police more measures to ensure that antisocial behaviour is driven out of our trains.</p><p>The ICI committee quite rightly stressed the importance to passengers of trains running to time. We will set a minimum performance level and punctuality targets that will increase over the period. We will also require the industry to publish right-time information for all routes so that we can all see to the minute how services are improving. The industry will also be expected to work with passenger representative bodies to ensure that new performance regimes and information meet their needs.</p><p>I draw the attention of Parliament to the issue of indemnity clauses, which the trade unions have regularly raised concerns about. We have decided to review the clauses with a view to developing an alternative approach that is fair to both operators and the workforce.</p><p>The response to the &#8220;Rail 2014&#8221; consultation demonstrated not only the importance that communities place on the railway but their willingness to play a part in it. We want to see that enthusiasm harnessed and promoted. Therefore, we will encourage the creation of local community rail partnerships and will require the industry to work with them to establish facilities and services that address local needs.</p><p>We have created a comprehensive package of measures that, working with the rail industry, employees and passengers, we believe will deliver high-quality rail infrastructure and services that are responsive to Scotland&#8217;s needs and represent good value for money, while supporting our businesses and communities, promoting tourism and offering real alternatives to road and air travel. Scotland deserves a 21st century railway and this Government will see that that is delivered.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670046", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Rail transport is vital to Scotland&#8217;s success as it supports economic growth, strengthens connections and provides sustainable alternatives to road and air travel.

For example, I think that the east coast rail franchise consultation started only this year, even though the contract is to be let for the coming year.</p><p>It is quite difficult to climb down from a consultation. We had a genuine consultation in which we asked people for their views as part of a genuine and open debate. Perhaps Richard Baker&#8217;s previous allies in the former Administration were strangers to that concept.</p><p>I do not know whether Richard Baker picked up this point, but I said during my statement that there will be a break in the 10-year franchise after five years. Things may well change during that time. I am sure that Richard Baker will be aware that a number of different things will apply in 2019. For example, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will come into full effect then, and there are issues to do with the leasing of rolling stock. There could also be significant new constitutional opportunities for a Government of Scotland to take measures to improve the rail service. I would have thought that Richard Baker would welcome that point.</p><p>Richard Baker made the point that there will be fragmentation as a result of having two franchises. We were accused of the same thing in relation to the northern isles ferry service&#8212;it was said that unbundling the service would be a disaster. What do we have? The same operator operating both services quite happily. It is entirely possible that that could happen here.</p><p>This represents a very good deal for passengers across Scotland. It substantially improves the situation that we had under the Labour Party. Richard Baker should not chide us for not having pursued more vigorously the issue of the franchise constraints, because we have done that&#8212;we have written to UK ministers repeatedly, but they have not even bothered to give us the courtesy of a response, and they have not listened to us.

However, it is worth looking at the issue more widely. Some of the franchises that are held south of the border are extremely short. One is as short as one and half years, and there have been improvements to more than 50 stations on the line where that franchise is held, so there is no obvious or direct correlation between the length of a franchise and investment. Of course, the issue of rolling stock is dealt with almost separately&#8212;it was designed to be done that way so that it could then roll over to the next franchise holder. I do not deny that there is a relationship, but we believe that it is important to have that five-year break to take advantage of other opportunities that might exist.</p><p>The separate franchise for the sleeper will give it a real focus. The sleeper is a distinctive service, with a different customer base from the rest of the network. As we know, it is receiving its own capital investment of &#163;100-plus million. It is important that we treat it differently, and the franchise holder has the opportunity to develop it over time. If the franchise holder does that, as I expect that it will, then the answer is yes, we believe that it will be a stable franchise in future.</p><p>I do not know why previous Governments introduced the indemnity clause. I understand the point that it protects passengers but, to our mind, there is an element of one-sidedness about it. There is no incentive for people to avoid the dispute if they know that it will not come at any cost to them&#8212;that is an issue that we want to bear in mind. As the member asked us to do, we will seek to protect passengers interests, but we will also want to listen to the workforce and the trade unions. That is the right thing to do.</p><p>I have mentioned that seven new stations have already been built, one of which is in my constituency. It has been tremendously successful, with more than 400,000 people using it in its first year, which was substantially in excess of the 80,000 predicted. As I said in my statement, we have made available around &#163;30 million to encourage proposals for new station developments, but that will be in the hands of local communities and developers&#8212;they will have to come forward with those proposals. In many cases, they will want to contribute towards the cost of that station. We will have to assimilate the cost of the running of the services through the station, but we will work in tandem with local people, communities, and developers, who will also have responsibility for doing the necessary studies to prove that the option is viable.

My response to the points that have been made about road safety is that the A75 safety group is due to meet in July. That multi-agency group is made up of key stakeholders from the police, local authorities, Amey, the fire service and the safety camera partnership. That group is committed to improving the safety of the road. I am perfectly willing and keen to raise the issues from this debate at that meeting and also to consider some of the signing suggestions that were made by Elaine Murray.</p><p>Over this year we have spent &#163;650&#160;million to try to ensure that our road network remains safe, efficient and effective. In 2012-13, &#163;3&#160;million has been allocated to the Scottish budget for the road safety framework delivery and road safety Scotland activities. We are committed, as Joan McAlpine and Aileen McLeod said, to building the &#163;25.6&#160;million Dunragit bypass, which&#8212;like the Hardgrove to Kinmount link&#8212;was not done previously, despite the length of time that was available in which to do it. We are having to pick up that slack now. The Hardgrove to Kinmount scheme is shovel ready, which means that when we have the money to get the shovels and go into the ground, we will do that.</p><p>Again, as has been pointed out, we made that pitch to the United Kingdom Government. It was not done just because we want more money&#8212;although it was probably our money in the first place&#8212;but because we had a &#163;1.3&#160;billion cut that comprised &#163;500&#160;million in terms of capital and &#163;800&#160;million in terms of revenue. That was before our capital budgets for the next three years were cut by a third.</p><p>It is not possible to wish away those facts and say that we should be doing all the things that were not done before, at the same time as saying that we must cut our budgets. I assume that Jim Hume and Alex Johnstone support the budget cut. We cannot do the same amount of work after such a cut, so they must choose what their priorities are, rather than always asking us to cope with the consequences of their cuts. The First Minister, as was mentioned, wrote to the Prime Minister recently to seek funding for that and a number of other schemes from the Westminster Government. That request was turned down.</p><p>There has been some talk of cross-party collaboration. That was how Elaine Murray started her speech, but then it became what Graeme Pearson accused Joan McAlpine of giving&#8212;a particular history and a particular set of politics in respect of how that was interpreted over the years when there was a Labour and Liberal Democrat Administration.</p><p>Our request for additional funding was turned down. We will seek to do what we can. As Joan McAlpine said, it is much better to look for ways to work together to try to achieve something. That is what we have sought to do over a number of years rather than making simple complaints and accusations. Accusations such as those that were made by Jim Hume are made in the full knowledge that he and his party are responsible for the cuts to our budget.</p><p>I welcomed the recent opportunity to write to the Dumfries and Galloway Standard. I recommend it&#8212;as other members have done&#8212;on its campaign to improve the A75, which is an example of local democracy in action and of pressure being brought to bear. I could not have been clearer in the article that the SNP Government will upgrade the road if the UK Government gives us that funding. We have to find the funding from somewhere. There can be no one who is involved in this debate&#8212;including me&#8212;who does not want the project to go ahead. I would love to be&#8212;I intend to be&#8212;the transport minister who eventually says that the road will be built. I want to do it and I cannot imagine that the Opposition parties could come up with any reason why I would not want to do that. Of course we want to do that&#8212;not least because we believe that such projects also create jobs. They are good for the economic wellbeing of the country as well as leading to improvements in safety and infrastructure.</p><p>Irrespective of the road, one death on our network is too many, especially for the families of those involved. However, we should recognise the substantial improvement that we have made in relation to road safety&#8212;we now have the lowest statistics on record, despite increasing car usage. I am determined to do whatever I can to contribute to prevention of loss of life on our roads, whatever the cause.</p><p>The Government also recently committed to lowering the amount of alcohol that drivers can consume before driving. That shows the action that we can take as a result of the Scotland Act 2012&#8212;we now have the powers to do that.</p><p>Elaine Murray may know that a substantial amount of action was taken by the police following the accidents to which she referred in order to try to reduce further the accident rate on the road and to make it safer. The police have said that that will continue and that they will keep an eye on the situation.</p><p>On the lower limit on alcohol, on 18 December 2008, the Parliament voted clearly in favour of a reduction in the drink-drive limit. I would like to think that the Parliament stands united in taking that forward. It will result in further safety improvements on our roads. I confirm that we will soon prepare a consultation paper as the next stage in implementation of that change.</p><p>The Government is committed to working with its partners to ensure a co-ordinated approach to road safety. I believe that any objective assessment of what we have done in relation to the A75&#8212;Joan McAlpine gave us some interesting figures on that&#8212;stands comparison with the record of any previous Administration. As the minister who is responsible for safety on Scotland&#8217;s roads, as a road user and as a father of three children, I am determined to do all that I can to prevent such tragedies. It is up to us, individually, to do all that we can to improve safety, but there is obviously an expectation on Government in that regard. I think that our record shows that we have tried to do that.</p><p>I have taken on board a number of the points that have been made. I am happy to engage in further multiparty discussions on the matter. I am sure that if we work together to find an innovative approach, we can get the right solution.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:40.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668520", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: A75 (Improvements)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I will not.

I realise that there are a number of very important public policy and resource allocation issues to address but, from my discussions with veterans organisations and veterans themselves, I can tell the chamber that they appreciate the united front that the Parliament has often displayed on veterans&#8217; issues. I also welcome members&#8217; speeches, which illustrate their very clear interest in the issue and their determination to focus support and assistance on those with alcohol and drug problems.</p><p>Dr Richard Simpson will know that I am well aware of the William Simpson&#8217;s home, as it was previously in my constituency, which he represented before me. Last night, I received a communication from a former MSP, Dennis Canavan, asking me to attend an abseiling event on Sunday. I am tempted to say to Richard Simpson, &#8220;If you do, I will, too,&#8221; but, in any case, my association with the home and its redoubtable chief executive will continue. The home, whose origins are steeped in the military&#8212;it was founded by the parents of a returning naval officer&#8212;does tremendous work and I will continue to advocate its case in its efforts to raise funds.</p><p>In response to Paul Wheelhouse&#8217;s important point about NHS numbers, I point out that substantial work is being carried out on that matter. Officials are developing arrangements in partnership with the MOD to allocate numbers to all military personnel in Scotland to facilitate the provision of an NHS record for every serviceperson and the eventual migration of military and health details on to that record. Paul Wheelhouse was quite right to highlight an important issue that many veterans have mentioned directly to me.</p><p>I am also delighted to confirm that the Scottish veterans fund, which members have mentioned, has provided support to Gardening Leave to allow it to expand its services into Dundee and that I will be visiting its facility at the Tayforth centre in the very near future.</p><p>I know that this issue was discussed in detail at a recent meeting of the Scottish Parliament cross-party group on veterans, which heard from the MOD surgeon general, Vice Admiral Philip Raffaelli. As members have pointed out, it is the responsibility of the armed forces themselves to tackle alcohol and substance misuse by serving personnel. As employers, the three services have put in place clear and unambiguous rules that must be obeyed under pain of court martial. James Dornan suggested that, historically, the armed forces have had a reputation for a work hard, play hard culture. That is understandable and, to some extent, inevitable. However, as Mr Dornan made clear, that culture is changing for the better. Alcohol consumption by service personnel is permitted, provided that it happens in controlled circumstances and off duty. Soldiers, sailors and airmen and women have the armed forces&#8217; reputation to maintain&#8212;which they do, with pride and honour.</p><p>Apart from the very dangerous work that they carry out, service personnel have to work with heavy, sophisticated and dangerous equipment and must do so in full control of their faculties. Everyone is aware that, under such circumstances, no serviceman or woman can be under the influence of alcohol, so we must welcome the fact that the services have programmes for and training on sensible and responsible drinking. Drug use is also strictly forbidden. The armed forces routinely conduct random drug tests and those caught using drugs are dismissed.</p><p>It is important to stress that, when they leave the armed forces, the vast majority of service personnel return to civilian life and live quietly and successfully in their communities. No one should take from the debate the idea that service inevitably leads to problems with alcohol, drugs or mental health. However, we recognise that, for some people, problems will arise and might lead to heavy drinking or drug use. That is a tragedy for the individuals concerned and, as has been made clear in the debate, it often leads to other problems such as family breakdown, a lack of employment opportunities and perhaps even homelessness.</p><p>Many types of support are in place to help those with alcohol and drug problems. Naturally, the armed forces are considering better and quicker ways of identifying those who might be at risk of falling into alcohol and drug dependency and that work will, in itself, lead to improved and tailored interventions.</p><p>As members have said, a number of service charities offer a range of support packages and I applaud them for their selfless work in support of veterans. They offer invaluable assistance in myriad settings across Scotland, some of which we have heard about today. That is why the Scottish Government has set up the Scottish veterans fund and allocated more than &#163;400,000 to projects of direct support to the veterans community.</p><p>The armed forces are a reflection of the society from which they recruit. It is inevitable that some individuals will become involved in problem alcohol or drug use. That can manifest itself in a number of ways. However, despite all that has been said, it is important to recognise that problem alcohol or drug use are no more prevalent in the armed forces than they are in an equivalent demographic profile within wider society. The national alcohol strategy, &#8220;Changing Scotland&#8217;s Relationship with Alcohol: A Framework for Action&#8221;, sets out a broader agenda and adopts a whole-population approach, which is augmented by guidance for the provision of effective alcohol treatment and support services.</p><p>The &#8220;Quality Alcohol Treatment and Support (QATS)&#8221; report from 2011 outlines 14 recommendations that, if embedded in practice, will help to better identify and respond to the specific needs of people, including veterans and those in the armed forces.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667209", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol Abuse (Armed Forces)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Paul Wheelhouse on securing this debate on what is an important issue and am gratified to see members&#8217; attempts at being as consensual as possible.

The heightened levels of stress that are associated with serving for long periods of time in Afghanistan or, in the past, Northern Ireland are bound to have an effect, and alcohol comes into that picture.</p><p>I do not want to apportion any blame, but it is also true that some have said that the armed forces cannot be held responsible for the people they recruit if they have a pre-existing propensity to be involved with social problems, if I can put it as generally as that. I do not accept that that is the case. For centuries, the armed forces have harvested people from their communities and they have a responsibility to those people.

They should continue to do that.</p><p>The Alcohol etc (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force on 1 October 2011 and is a significant step in the battle against Scotland&#8217;s unhealthy relationship with alcohol.

It is that</p><p>&#8220;by end December 2012, local authorities will provide all unintentionally homeless applicant households with settled accommodation as of right&#8221;.</p><p>As Maureen Watt said, the target has been internationally acclaimed. That is to the credit of previous Administrations and Oppositions, as well as the current Administration and Opposition groups, because there has been a general consensus on the benefits of the target.</p><p>We concede that the target is a challenging one to meet in difficult economic times but, despite that, we are committed to supporting local authorities to achieve it. We will introduce the necessary secondary legislation to the Parliament before the end of the year.</p><p>It is important to note that much of what we will do this year to reach the target will be a precursor to what will have to happen when the target has been achieved. At that time, we will start another process and embark on the important task of maintaining quality services for homeless people and, of course, preventing homelessness wherever possible.</p><p>I have already written to the committee convener with the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the committee&#8217;s 24 recommendations. They were all made in a positive spirit and there were some constructive suggestions.</p><p>As the convener mentioned, positive updated homelessness statistics were published in February for the period April to September 2011. They record a reduction of about 20 per cent in homelessness applications and assessments, which is the biggest ever fall. The Guardian has quoted the corresponding figure in England as being a 14 per cent increase. We should recognise the efforts of our partners, particularly in local government, towards meeting the target.</p><p>As we have heard, in 90 per cent of homelessness assessments in Scotland, those concerned are regarded as being in priority need and so are entitled to settled accommodation. Nine local authorities are fully meeting the 2012 target and 11 are within 10 per cent of achieving it. However, even more local authorities have met the target since the statistics were reported. The new statistics will be published in June 2012, and we hope to see further progress in future.</p><p>The Scottish Government and COSLA joint 2012 steering group was established in 2009. I first attended the group in November last year and I know that there is a focused effort to ensure that we do not take our eyes off the ball. At the most recent meeting of the group that I attended, I suggested that as soon as the local elections have passed&#8212;just in case anyone is in doubt, I remind members that there are some local elections next week&#8212;we, or COSLA, should have an early meeting with the newly appointed housing conveners to reinforce the need to make further progress and achieve the target.</p><p>The priority areas for the group have been the prevention of homelessness, which has required substantial joint working and corporate buy-in; investment in the appropriate areas; and the opening up of access to all housing tenures. Chief among those priorities has been prevention. In that area, the work that Alex Neil led previously led to the establishment of the five regional, local authority-led housing options hubs across Scotland. They focus on the individual and the range of needs that they might have, and the action plans that the hubs have come up with are being implemented with positive results. A culture change has begun that has seen the refocusing of homelessness services for the better, and it has been an important, innovative public service reform.</p><p>The convener mentioned the committee&#8217;s desire for the Scottish Government to allocate further resources to the hubs. I can announce today that we will provide another &#163;150,000 of on-going funding to support the hubs throughout 2012-13. We will discuss the disbursement of that funding with COSLA, and an independent evaluation of the hubs approach will be published shortly.</p><p>We can see the beneficial impact of good prevention work, but the other side of the issue, which I am sure members will mention, is the supply of new housing, which remains a priority for us. We have committed to the delivery of 30,000 affordable homes over the next five years, at least 20,000 of which will be social rented homes. We also want access to the private rented sector to be made easier to assist homeless households, and we are working with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, through its membership of the 2012 group, and individual registered social landlords to enable greater access to that sector.</p><p>The convener made an important point about the impact of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reforms on housing benefit, and we are apparently in the midst of a second recession, which also makes the work extremely difficult.</p><p>The welfare reforms will have a major impact and risk effect on the underoccupancy provisions and the way in which we can configure new housing stock. That is happening during a recession&#8212;until yesterday, we could have said that it was a recovery, but we are now into a second recession. We should acknowledge the achievements of local authorities in particular in making progress towards the target at what has been an extremely difficult time for them. They deserve credit for that. They are working hard to stay on track to achieve the target and a strong foundation is being built for what comes after 2012. I am confident that, if we keep an eye on the ball, between us, our partners and local government we can achieve the target despite challenging conditions such as welfare reform and the economic situation.</p><p>I am delighted to have seen the committee&#8217;s report. I will continue to work with the committee and will report back to it to ensure that we achieve what we all want, which is to meet the 2012 target by the end of this year.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665539", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Maureen Watt for her opening remarks and the members of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee for the report.

I will try to address some of their points and give the Government&#8217;s point of view.</p><p>Elaine Murray, Jim Hume and others mentioned the temporary accommodation situation. It is worth noting that there was a 4 per cent reduction in the number of households in temporary accommodation to December 2010; a reduction of 13 per cent in the number of households with children in temporary accommodation; and a reduction of 18 per cent in the number of children in temporary accommodation. We are now down to only 15 households with children or pregnant women in bed-and-breakfast accommodation; that is also a key indicator. Substantial progress is being made. We have not taken our eye off the ball as we make progress towards the 2012 target.</p><p>A number of members made a crucial point on the supply of affordable housing. Richard Baker is quite right to mention the difficulties that the housing benefit reforms and the general economic situation have caused. However, the impact on achieving the target of the 33 per cent cut to the Government&#8217;s capital resource was not mentioned by the Labour Party, the Conservative Party or the Liberal Democrats. The capital budget has been cut by about one third&#8212;that has to be recognised and none of the speeches that have been made so far has recognised it. That cut has had a huge impact on our budgets.</p><p>On the other side of the equation, Richard Baker mentioned cuts to local authorities. It is worth bearing in mind the fact that we give a bigger proportion of our budget to local authorities than the previous Administration did. If the previous Administration had carried on doing what it was doing before, it would have given less to local authorities than what it criticises us for giving. We have done well by local authorities and protected their share of public resources.</p><p>Hanzala Malik made a point about the return of proceeds from sales. We often do that, but the housing association is required to ask us and make a case to us. If, for example, we have given a grant to allow houses to be developed in the first place, the public moneys have to be protected. We work on a case-by-case basis, but we take a pragmatic approach and try to help wherever we can.</p><p>It is worth reasserting that recent statistics indicate the lowest figures for a decade on homelessness applications and assessments. I should also point out the current success of prevention measures. As I said, the Scottish Government will continue to support local authorities to drive the housing options approach. About &#163;70,000 has been made available to the hubs to help them to consider how to mitigate the effects of the housing benefit changes. Initially, &#163;500,000 was given to establish the hubs and, as I mentioned, there is the subsequent award of &#163;150,000, which was announced today. We are providing support. We will learn from the independent evaluation of the hubs approach, which will be published shortly.</p><p>It is easy to say this, but it is absolutely crucial that we continue to have cross-sector partnership working. At present, things seem to be working well, with joint responses across sectors and services.</p><p>Alex Johnstone raised a point about ex-services personnel. The important thing is to ensure that those people do not suffer a disadvantage. It is more difficult to provide them with an advantage, but they should not suffer a disadvantage, for example by not being allowed to be on a waiting list when they are in service or by not being able to establish a local connection because they are on duty. Several authorities, particularly Aberdeen City Council, take that issue very seriously. We are keen to roll out best practice to other authorities. There are questions for the UK Government, not just about the fact that it is making some of those people redundant, but about ensuring that people are as well prepared as possible for civvy street.</p><p>Several members have mentioned the supported accommodation implementation group. The group reports in November, which will be an important step in improving services for homeless people and those who are at risk of homelessness. Humza Yousaf gave good examples of people who are in that category. We also have a consultation on our strategy for the private rented sector, which was published last week. A higher-quality private rented sector can make a great contribution to dealing with homelessness.</p><p>We share the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s view that it is vital that the 2012 commitment is met across Scotland. We know that work is required with the councils that still report challenges in meeting the commitment. Members, particularly those who are members of the committee, will know exactly which councils those are. It is important that those councils achieve the target. We have made that point strongly to them, while telling them to let us know what more we can do if there are particular circumstances in their areas.</p><p>One thing that is not in doubt is the record of strong support for the 2012 commitment among wider stakeholders. That underlines the fact that Scotland is a progressive nation. That is evidenced by the general consensus on the issue and, as I have said, by the fact that the commitment has been subscribed to by successive Governments and Oppositions. The Parliament has a good record. However, it is perhaps easy for the Parliament to say that we want to achieve something when we know that delivering it is largely up to other people. I was on the other side of that debate back in 2003 when, as a council leader, I signed the accord. By and large, councils and others will deliver the commitment, so they will deserve the credit for doing that if they can achieve it by the end of the year, although that is not to say that the Scottish Government does not have obligations, too. It will be a proud achievement if we can do it.</p><p>Even at this stage, we can rightly be proud of the progress that has been made. We bandy about numbers and percentages, but we are talking about people&#8217;s lives. We heard telling stories, particularly from Margaret Burgess. If people are now avoiding that kind of experience, that is a massive achievement, even at this stage. We will continue to build on the hard work of local authorities and their partners to achieve sustainable outcomes for all homeless people beyond 2012. I am grateful to the members and convener of the committee for their support in that process.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665539", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members who have spoken for their contributions.

To come back to the point that Kezia Dugdale mentioned, there have been substantial effects, particularly in East Lothian and Midlothian. To that end, I have been happy to meet with Unite, representatives of which are in the gallery today. I met them inadvertently this morning, but I also met them yesterday and on previous occasions, and we have had constructive and positive discussions. It is up to Unite to say what it believes, but I believe that it is a commonly accepted fact&#8212;First itself has said so&#8212;that the issues that we are dealing with are to do with the way in which those services were run over a number of years, not the fact that, in the past two weeks, a new BSOG regime has been brought in. I am not saying that First is happy about the changes to the grant, but it acknowledges the other factors that impact on the situation, not least the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s proposed further increase in fuel costs later this year. An increase of 57 per cent in diesel costs will be hard for any company to cope with.</p><p>I have discussed the issue twice with Paul McLennan, the leader of East Lothian Council, who contacted me as soon as the announcement was made. I met him during the bus stakeholder group meeting and have spoken to him since then. East Lothian Council has also had a summit with the bus companies. To come back to Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s point, an assurance has been given that not one community in that area will go without a bus route. I have not heard the same representation being made by Midlothian Council, but I have said to Unite that I am happy to work with Midlothian Council and East Lothian Council on the issue. It would be productive if they worked together.</p><p>I have heard from local MSPs, such as Christine Grahame and Colin Beattie, and I have seen Iain Gray&#8217;s motion, although he has not yet spoken to me directly about the issue. We are keen to do what we can. I have said that the officials in Transport Scotland will provide every assistance to the councils in their efforts to ensure that they can backfill those services, by whichever means.</p><p>I have never said that we could not regulate in Scotland. If Elaine Murray goes back and listens to &#8220;Call Kaye&#8221; again, she will realise that I was speaking in an entirely different context. It is possible to regulate. As we see in Lothian, it is possible for a successful bus company to run at arm&#8217;s length from the council. There are possibilities and we will work constructively in that regard. That is what we have to do in Government in the real world. We cannot just make promises worth &#163;1 billion-plus, which nobody has any faith will be delivered&#8212;I do not think that even Labour believes that they can be delivered, especially not in the context of a fixed budget.</p><p>We will continue to work with people on the issues around jobs and the routes that are affected, and will do everything possible to help the councils and others in relation to their commitments. I have said to Unite that we will meet its representatives any time. If they want to pick up the phone, we will speak to them.</p><p>There are very challenging conditions, and we recognise in our amendment that fuel is one of the biggest factors. We call again for the introduction of a fuel duty regulator and for common sense on fuel costs.

Indeed, as Kezia Dugdale suggested, at the root of all of this lie the people who might lose their jobs and communities worried about the future of their services. I suppose that we can address the matter in a number of ways: we can meet the people concerned and support them in what they are trying to do; we can meet their representatives, by which I mean councillors or MSPs&#8212;and indeed we have done so; or we can meet the communities and the operators. For example, we have had fairly productive discussions with First since the announcement was made about the future prospects for its staff, which we hope will safeguard as many jobs as possible.</p><p>James Dornan made the point that the serious way in which to go about trying to address the issue is to talk to people and see what resolutions we can get. That is what we have to do in government, as I am sure Iain Gray knows. We betray rather than serve those people&#8217;s interests if all that we do is to make promises that we have no intention of keeping. Labour does not have the costings or the track record of putting forward proposals during the budget process that would give credibility to the things that it proposes in its motion.</p><p>A number of members&#8212;Paul Wheelhouse in particular&#8212;pointed out the problems that First has had in East Lothian and Midlothian. First has acknowledged those, but that never finds its way into speeches from the Labour benches. As I mentioned, we have had discussions with First and we are also going to speak to Lothian Buses&#8212;that came out of the meeting that I had with Unite. We will also try to get Midlothian Council on board, as it will be much more effective if both of the councils that are most concerned talk together.</p><p>In a good speech, Sandra White discussed green buses. She asked the pointed question&#8212;which I cannot answer as it is for those concerned&#8212;of why there were no applications for green buses in Glasgow. When we put in additional money to provide the green buses in Edinburgh, particularly on the number 10 route, we estimated that savings of about a third in fuel consumption would result, but the company tells us that the saving is more than two thirds. That is the way to go in investing in buses. What Lothian Buses has done with its services must be the way to go for the future benefit of both passengers and the environment.</p><p>Not enough mention has been made of the fact that the cost of diesel has increased by 57 per cent in the past five years, and the figure for petrol is about 55 per cent. We also have the highest fuel duty in the European Union. People who wonder why the bus companies are looking for more support should look at those facts. What is the UK Government&#8217;s response? It is going to hike fuel duty again in August. That is the biggest driving factor for the fare increases. Just before the 2007 election, we had support from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats for a fuel duty regulator and tough action on fuel. It will be interesting to see whether we get the same support today.</p><p>We will continue to make representations to the Westminster Government and encourage it to scrap the increase in fuel duty. No mention was made in the speeches from the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats of the effect of the fuel duty increase, which vastly outstrips the impact of BSOG. The impact of BSOG is 1.9 per cent in relation to the turnover of First, but fuel duty is bound to have a massive impact. It would have been far better for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to support us in our call for the Westminster Government to look at that seriously.</p><p>I am convinced that we are doing a great deal to support the bus industry, not least by trying to get rid of some of the worst effects of the fuel increases from Westminster.

It is a comprehensive motion on cycling that provides us with a good opportunity to debate further what actions and partnership working are needed. As she suggested, Parliament is generally in agreement that cycling should be a safe, healthy and realistic choice as a mode of transport. There has recently been a focus on cycling, not least because of the four fatalities in Edinburgh in the past 12 months, which have led to the recent road safety operational partnership group meeting. That meeting provided an extremely fruitful discussion; it was well attended and there was participation from a wide range of cycling stakeholders, some of whom have been mentioned.</p><p>In Scotland, the growth in the number of cyclists has been accompanied by a 12 per cent drop in cycle accident casualties between 2000 and 2010. That was the result of a lot of activity by different partners. As Alison Johnstone said, we have a vested interest in trying to make it clear to the public&#8212;as far as we can and with the appropriate caveats&#8212;how safe cycling is and how much safer it has become, with fewer serious accidents happening. If we do that, we are more likely to encourage more cycling.</p><p>That said, we cannot be complacent. Everyone has been shocked by the cycling deaths in Edinburgh over the past 12 months.

The leadership role of the Scottish Government is to draw in those examples and to ensure that they are extended where that is possible. I commend Nestrans for having undertaken that initiative. A number of approaches to better cyclist safety are either being trialled or are in practice around Scotland, but people are not always aware of them. There is a role for Government in making people aware of them.</p><p>Currently, 98 per cent of Scottish primary schools offer cycle training and 70 per cent of pupils take up the offer. Of the eligible cohort of 55,000 pupils, 69.5 per cent receive some form of cycle training, but only 31.5 per cent are receiving on-road training to the national standard. That is why I have agreed a target with Cycling Scotland of 40 per cent of children receiving on-road training by 2015. I urge every local authority in Scotland to work in partnership with Cycling Scotland not just to meet that target, but to exceed it. We must reinforce the message that learning to cycle in a live environment is more beneficial than learning to ride a bike in a playground.</p><p>An immediate development from the operational partnership group meeting is that, following a representation from the sustainable transport team, which has responsibility for cycling, it will provide on-going feedback to the group on what the cycling action plan delivery forum and the national cycling interest group are doing, and on whether those fora have raised concerns about road safety. I hope that that will provoke wider discussion of the issues and improved communication in the established cycling groups, without unnecessary duplication of effort.

That is a crucial point. We just heard from Claudia Beamish about the Netherlands.

We must do all that we can to encourage such a culture, but that will not happen overnight; it will take some time to achieve.</p><p>The behavioural change towards mutual respect that Alison Johnstone first mentioned must take place.

If we want to encourage more children to take up cycling, parents must feel more able to say yes to children who want to cycle to school or cycle recreationally.

As we have heard, such services are often of particular benefit to people with mobility difficulties who cannot access conventional buses and people who live in areas where there are limited or no public transport services. Community transport can offer a more personal touch with trained drivers, passenger escorts, door-to-door transport by accessible minibus and volunteers who use their own cars.</p><p>As a number of members mentioned, the users value those services highly. They help individuals to get out and about, to access services, facilities and health appointments, to go shopping&#8212;a point that Alex Fergusson made&#8212;and to visit friends and family. Being given the option of mobility is extremely important, as it can overcome the sense of isolation. That helps people to remain part of their community and improves their wellbeing.</p><p>I applaud the employees and dedicated volunteers who give up their time to help to provide transport services. At least two examples have been mentioned: Teviot wheels and Tweed wheels. In my area, there is Dial-a-Journey Ltd, which I visited earlier this week. That long-running organisation provides a tremendous service and has opened fantastic new premises. Interestingly, it is resourced by and large by the three local authorities in its area but also benefits from substantial support from the Order of Malta, which is involved in many such activities.</p><p>Talking of funding, it is true to say that the local authorities are provided with resources to support community transport services in their areas, but we do not ring fence those resources. Local authorities have flexibility on how they spend their funds. We encourage them&#8212;that is as far as we would go&#8212;to maintain and, where possible, extend spending on community transport services.</p><p>We also encourage local authorities to consider community transport options in the provision of transport services in their areas, as well as more efficient and effective use of such services through partnership working and integrated services. The idea of school buses&#8212;a resource that was underused previously&#8212;being used for additional purposes was mentioned. More efficient use of ambulances was also mentioned. A great deal of work is being done on that, not least by the Strathclyde partnership for transport. When we have constraints on resources, it is right that we get the most out of the resources that we have.</p><p>The concessionary travel scheme was mentioned. In case members do not remember, that has cost &#163;180 million this year and is about to go up to &#163;187 million. It services exactly the people about whom we are talking&#8212;older people and people with disabilities&#8212;as well as disabled veterans, who are a new addition to the budget line.</p><p>As Aileen McLeod said, the main reason that that budget line is growing is the cost of fuel. That is a huge factor. It seems pretty obvious that it drives up the cost of transport. For example, CalMac Ferries needs an extra &#163;14.5 million this year alone for ferry costs because of the increase in fuel charges. There is no doubt that there is pressure on budgets.</p><p>Sarah Boyack mentioned BSOG. There is no question but that there has been a cut in the overall amount of BSOG, but many rural operators have welcomed the change that levels the playing field between rural and urban services. Three times as many operators will benefit from that change as will lose from it. That has been appreciated because some of the services that were previously under threat now attract more support. That includes rural community transport services.</p><p>We have put &#163;3 million into the bus investment fund, which is set up to enable transport authorities to make bus improvements in their areas. Details of that are still to be finalised, but we envisage that organisations will be able to access the fund for, among other things, the development of community transport.</p><p>We will look at the system for issuing section 19 permits to community transport services that are not available to the general public.

That is the further step that would have to be taken. Jim Hume suggested that the cost of extending the schemes would be about 3 per cent of the budget, or the not insignificant sum of &#163;6 million or &#163;7 million. That said, we will consider all the types of organisations that are able to issue permits and look at the crucial role of the traffic commissioner and the development of a community transport operator database.</p><p>We have regular discussions with the CTA; after all, it is the main voice of community transport in the UK and works on behalf of its members to engage Government and to inform, influence and help to shape future community transport policy and development. It is encouraging more transport providers to be less reliant on public funding, which is crucial, and to engage in the social enterprise model of delivery. It is also encouraging providers to consider bidding for local contracts, allowing them to play a bigger part in local transport delivery. Community transport providers must consider how to integrate their services better with the commercial network and, as has been mentioned, ensure that there is no duplication of existing services.</p><p>In conclusion, I should mention two points.

We agree that reform is needed. We also agree that the system should incentivise work, that it should be simpler and, of course, that it must be affordable, but we believe that many of the changes will have a devastating impact on some of Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable communities and households. As long as responsibility for the welfare system rests with the UK Government rather than the Scottish Government, there is very little that we can do about that.</p><p>The figures relating to the housing benefit reforms are eye watering. The shared accommodation rate changes will affect more than 4,000 Scots, who will lose more than &#163;85 per month on average. Some 95,000 households in the social rented sector will be affected by the Department for Work and Pensions underoccupancy restrictions and will lose between &#163;27 and &#163;65 per month. The benefits cap will affect around 4,000 adults in Scotland and between 7,000 and 8,000 children. The average loss will be around &#163;250 per month.</p><p>It is not only claimants who will bear the costs; there is also an impact on landlords. Currently, most social tenants who depend on housing benefit choose to have their rent paid directly to the landlord. That helps to keep a roof over their head, regardless of the many other financial pressures that they are likely to face. That will change through welfare reform. Most working age tenants will receive support to cover their rent directly to them, whether they want to or not. We support financial inclusion, but our stakeholders tell us that the UK Government&#8217;s approach is likely to increase rent arrears. That is a sledgehammer approach. The reforms cut right across our devolved housing policies and right through the workings of our social landlords.</p><p>Local authorities, too, will feel the impact. Cutting support for some of our most vulnerable households will inevitably result in hardship&#8212;in some cases, severe hardship. When people are struggling to find their rent or are forced to move home, they turn to local authorities and registered social landlords.</p><p>The underoccupancy penalties alone aim to save around &#163;100 million a year for the UK Treasury. We have estimated that that will have a one-off cost of &#163;87 million to the Scottish economy and will remove &#163;54.4 million a year directly from the Scottish economy thereafter. Overall, the housing benefit reforms will remove more than &#163;150 million a year from the Scottish economy.</p><p>Those are the impacts of just the housing reforms. The Scottish Government and stakeholders are clear that the Welfare Reform Act 2012 will have a significant negative impact in Scotland. The current benefit spend in Scotland is around &#163;12 billion. In evidence that was presented to the Health and Sport Committee by the DWP, it was estimated that the reduction in welfare benefit receipts in Scotland would be &#8220;about &#163;2.5 billion&#8221; by 2015. We share our stakeholders&#8217; concerns. We do not want those who cannot work as a result of ill health or disability to be relegated to a life of disadvantage, financial uncertainty and poverty.</p><p>On the issue of protecting vulnerable people, it is worth noting the views of Mary Taylor of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. She said:</p><p>&#8220;What we are worried about is the Government penalising some of Scotland&#8217;s poorest families&#8221;.</p><p>Today, the richest in our society&#8212;those who earn over &#163;150,000&#8212;have received a 10 per cent tax cut. That gives the lie to the UK Government&#8217;s idea that we are all in this together.</p><p>We have worked tirelessly with our stakeholders to make the UK Government understand the problems that it is creating by making the cuts that it is making in the way that it is making them.

We will put more information in the public domain about how we can best mitigate the effects of the changes.</p><p>The reforms will mean significant changes for the way in which some of our most vulnerable people are housed, including women in refuges, older people in sheltered accommodation and people with severe physical and learning impairments. The organisations that provide that support need to know the detail of the changes and they need to know it in good time, but they say that they have not seen the detail yet.</p><p>It is worth restating that we believe that the overall model of universal credit has some merits, but squeezing housing benefit for people in supported and temporary accommodation into that system without due consideration will inevitably cause problems. For example, a default position of direct payments of support for housing costs for users of supported and temporary accommodation is frankly wrong, and all the stakeholders agree.</p><p>Of course, the question that arises is what an independent Scotland would do if it was to face the same pressures. I have conceded that the system needs reform. Our Tory and Lib Dem colleagues might suggest that an independent Scotland would be forced to do the same to make ends meet. It is not for me to say what the first Government of the shortly-to-be-inaugurated independent Scotland would do&#8212;it would be up to the Government of the day, elected by the Scottish people, to decide.</p><p>However, I can say that many of the UK Government&#8217;s reforms will simply move burdens from the DWP to others. Remedying the impacts of housing benefit reform could cost more than preventing them in the first place. A Scottish Government, working with stakeholders, could decide where best to invest to get the most from our resources. There is a mismatch between housing policy, which is devolved, and housing benefit, which is reserved. A Scottish Government could make housing benefit policy support our wider housing responsibilities.</p><p>A number of opportunities for Scotland&#8217;s housing system through devolved housing benefit are set out in the report that was launched last week by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and the Chartered Institute of Housing. For example, at a fundamental level, what should be the balance between subsidising people through the benefits system and subsidising new homes through housing investment?</p><p>We have an extremely strong housing sector in Scotland. The devolution of housing policy has allowed Scotland to make great strides, such as internationally acclaimed homelessness legislation. Once again, though, all the stakeholders would tell us that that has been made much more difficult by the welfare reforms. Despite those reforms, we are on track to meet our 2012 target, which is a testament to the determination of hard-working local authorities to end the misery of homelessness.</p><p>Of course, we have the restarting of the council house building programme and the delivery of 30,000 affordable homes during this parliamentary session alone. We have innovative, groundbreaking approaches, such as our pioneering national housing trust initiative and our commitment to provide a guarantee to support a three-year mortgage indemnity scheme, which will help about 6,000 households.</p><p>Yesterday I was at the opening of a housing development in the east of Edinburgh. One of our key partners, who also deals with the UK Government, mentioned how much more progress and innovation there is in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. The things that we have done have helped to tackle homelessness. This year alone, 28 of the 32 local authorities say that they have had a reduction in homelessness. The reduction in Aberdeen has been huge. All that good work is being done in a process that started in 2003. Now, as we get to the end of the process, as if it was not enough to be hit by an international recession, the welfare reforms are making it much more difficult to get up the final part of the hill to reach the 2012 target.</p><p>All the stakeholders whom we deal with have told us&#8212;and the UK Government&#8212;that the changes to benefits will have a huge impact on some of the most vulnerable individuals in our communities. That is why we oppose the changes and why we have lodged the motion.</p><p>I am proud to work in a Government that is part of a dynamic shift to revitalise our homes and communities. However, it is clear that our ambitions for housing&#8212;for our people and for our communities&#8212;are being thwarted by the current constitutional arrangements. Again, it is not just me saying that&#8212;some of the responses from stakeholders point to the frictions that the constitutional arrangements have created.</p><p>There is an easy way for the UK Government to deal with this. It can look again at the reforms. It was encouraged to do that by Liam McArthur&#8217;s colleagues in the House of Lords, but it did not want to listen. I hope that Liam McArthur&#8217;s contribution to the debate reflects more the concerns that were raised by the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords than the opinions of Danny Alexander and others in the UK Government.</p><p>The benefit cuts will have a huge impact. We should oppose them and we have opposed them. The Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment, the Deputy First Minister and I have made representations to the UK Government, most of which have been ignored. Some changes have been made but not nearly enough. It is vital that the Parliament makes clear its opposition to the changes for the benefit of the people of Scotland.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the UK Government&#8217;s plan for housing benefit reforms that will have a devastating impact on tenants, especially in some of Scotland&#8217;s poorest communities, and, as a result, on social and private landlords, local authorities and support agencies; regrets that, despite significant, well-evidenced and considered lobbying by Scottish stakeholders against the reforms, the UK Government pushed through the Welfare Reform Bill largely unchanged; notes that the UK Government&#8217;s housing benefit reforms cut across devolved responsibilities, compromising the Scottish Government&#8217;s capacity to deliver on its housing ambitions for Scotland, and acknowledges that, now that the Welfare Reform Bill has gained Royal Assent, the Scottish Government, local authorities, landlords and others must work together to minimise as far as possible adverse impacts on some of Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable people and to develop thinking on the Scottish delivery of housing support costs under any changed future constitutional arrangements.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663621", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Benefit Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have published substantial information about the action that we have taken, including, for example, on the provision of additional resources to the hubs that have been set up throughout Scotland to help to mitigate the effects.

Because of when Laurencekirk was completed, the figures have not yet come through the machine to show how much in excess of the projected figures the actual figures are. However, in my area, with the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line, we estimated&#8212;because we were told to&#8212;that there would be about 80,000 users, but there turned out to be 400,000 users. However, I have a list of stations that have performed drastically below the projected figures. That points to the fact that predictions of patronage are not hard and fast. Transport Scotland, with which I have raised the issue, and the Department for Transport recognise that more work needs to be done on proper projections. The figures for Laurencekirk and the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line have been substantially above the projected figures, although that has not been the case for many stations. I will get back to the member with information on whether the nature of the BCR calculation has changed.</p><p>We have encouraged local stakeholders to investigate whether other transport options might provide better value for money. SEStran is undertaking an additional study to complement the feasibility study. As requested, that will consider in more detail the main socioeconomic issues that affect the area, some of which Paul Wheelhouse mentioned, such as tourism. It will also provide a proportionate appraisal of the coach and local bus feeder options, following Scottish transport appraisal guidance.</p><p>I know from experience that people who support new rail services often say automatically that buses are not the answer. I am just saying that we have to go through the process. We are duty bound to be diligent in considering additional investment. Therefore, it is important that we consider those options first and in a serious way. The study will establish whether options other than rail could provide a better value-for-money solution to the economic development, social accessibility and environmental needs of residents in the east and south-east of Scotland. It will help to build a robust business case for any option that is taken forward.</p><p>A decision on the proposal for local rail services to Berwickshire and East Lothian is not a prerequisite for the letting of the next franchise, which will commence in 2014. John Lamont raised that point. As I made clear at the site visit, the proposal could be added subsequently as a franchise variation.</p><p>Claudia Beamish said that the issue is not just about money. However, there is a real issue about money. I must be honest and say that there are at least 30 different cases for station reopenings throughout Scotland. If each one required &#163;1 million or &#163;2.5 million subsidy, the additional cost would soon add up. We are spending more on rail services&#8212;it is already about &#163;775 million, for a service that is used by about 6 per cent of the population. Therefore, we have to consider carefully whether we make further investment. That is not even taking into account capital costs, but just the on-going subsidy costs. That is an important consideration, not least because&#8212;as members have mentioned&#8212;we have had a substantial cut to the budget and constraints have been placed on capital spend. Therefore, we need to consider money carefully.</p><p>For that reason, ministers are not in a position to commit to new investments, especially in projects that would require significant on-going annual subsidy payments. Due to budgetary constraints, we must focus on the strategic investments that will deliver the greatest benefits at the national and local levels. We must prioritise funding for those key transport projects. Even though John Lamont is&#8212;to put it kindly&#8212;somewhat lukewarm about the Borders rail line, there is huge support elsewhere for that line. The Government is taking it forward and it will improve.</p><p>Alex Johnstone mentioned that, when the station at Laurencekirk was opened, people asked why that had not been done before. I admit that, when I came into my present job, I kept asking myself why many things had not been done before. However, it is not possible to do everything that the Government would like to do at once for all modes of transport, not least because of the current budgetary situation.</p><p>Nevertheless, we are keen to improve access to the rail network by local communities on existing routes through the provision of additional stations. New stations or services will be considered favourably by the Scottish ministers, subject to the STAG appraisal of other transport options and rail being identified as the best option. Where the surrounding population is sufficient to generate a high level of demand, whether through workplace or visitor needs, we will support new stations. However, even then any funding for the construction of the stations and the subsidisation of services would have to be identified and prioritised relative to other national and local investment priorities. Where local funding sources can be identified, that can greatly help in bringing a project up the priority list.</p><p>The proposal for the local rail services to Berwickshire and East Lothian is progressing to the next stage of development, but I caution John Lamont about trying to get a definitive and conclusive response now. He should do that when the best possible case has been made for the additional services or stations. If the additional study can improve the business case and the affordability of the proposals, the Scottish ministers will be in a better position to consider whether and when the proposals can be implemented.</p><p>We are keen to consider proposals for new stations where there would be clear benefits. As I said when I made my site visit, there is an awful lot of pressure just now&#8212;whether through the high-speed rail proposals or the Edinburgh to Glasgow improvement programme&#8212;to concentrate on journey times alone, but I have said that we will not do that. Connectivity with communities that are not otherwise connected to the rail network should be taken into account, even if that is sometimes at the expense of journey times.</p><p>A number of transport projects around the country are already shovel ready but, as I have said, if the promoters of the new stations and services can identify local funding sources to contribute to the project, that could help greatly in bringing them up the priority list.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:18.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663697", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Services (Berwickshire and East Lothian)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was coming on to that point.

Elaine Murray talked about the cost of fuel; Labour&#8217;s fuel duty escalator has added to the burden over the years and the 15 per cent increase in diesel costs also adds to it. The reduction in the bus service operators grant would justify an increase in fares, if any, of about 1 per cent, not the 7 or 8 per cent increases that are happening elsewhere. That is a decision for the bus operators.</p><p>I will talk a bit more about our aspirations for bus. We want to improve connectivity, improve the quality of service, maintain the bus network and increase modal shift, through patronage growth. We can do that in part by maintaining global funding levels for the sector and in part by better partnership working. That is why I am bringing forward to March the inaugural meeting of a new bus stakeholder group. Members of the group will include the regulator, local authorities, operators, customer representatives and the Community Transport Association. We want to ensure that we move forward on partnership working. Some of the best innovations in the bus industry have been the result of close partnership working.</p><p>I will talk about specific initiatives. We want to regulate&#8212;and we do regulate&#8212;service changes. I will take further advice from the traffic commissioner for Scotland and others on whether we should alter the short-notice period for service changes and the fact that such changes can be made throughout the year. We need greater stability of services. On radical service improvement, I want our commitment to, for example, &#163;40 million for the Glasgow fastlink project to showcase what can be achieved when the public and private sectors come together to crack the infrastructure problems that often hamper growth and patronage of the network.</p><p>On technical innovation, I want us to have a stronger low-carbon bus fleet in Scotland. Our green bus fund has delivered 48 new low-carbon vehicles and we recently announced a second round, to the value of &#163;2 million this year. There will be more to come, thanks to the Scottish future transport fund. I very much welcome the associated investment by the operators.</p><p>Elaine Murray talked about demand-responsive transport. We have been talking about doing some of the things that she mentions. We want better community services. As of April, I intend to allow demand-responsive transport services that are available to the general public to be registered as local bus services and thereby qualify for BSOG and concessionary travel. We will continue to work with the Community Transport Association on affordable bus services in more remote areas.</p><p>We can develop the area further. A constituent of mine is quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair. He cannot access any bus or taxi that is available and he relies on a dial-a-journey service, which, because it does not provide a service to the general public, does not attract concessionary travel income. We are willing to look at that matter.</p><p>I was surprised to hear that there is a proposal&#8212;if that is what it is&#8212;to take away concessionary travel from people over 60 who are in full-time employment, many of whom will be low-paid employees. Richard Simpson made such a proposal before the election, and I have asked in the past whether it is the Labour Party&#8217;s position. I understand the rationale and I am not suggesting that the proposal is not worth looking at. The Labour Government took such an approach in England. It is good to have clarity.</p><p>The bottom line is that overall bus funding for the spending review period is about &#163;248.5 million per annum. To put that in context, there is a reduction of about &#163;7 million on the current figure.</p><p>The bus service operators grant is paid as a direct subsidy to operators. For a number of years we have been discussing the need for change to the approach, and the changes that we are making this year reflect those discussions. The aim of the grant was always laudable. It was intended to help to keep fares down and support the bus network and community transport services.</p><p>Why, then, are we changing the scheme? BSOG payments currently track the amount of fuel that each operator uses, and more fuel means more subsidy. So, we are removing fuel from the calculation and substituting route length. We are also taking away payment for dead mileage, when there are no passengers at all on the buses. We believe that those moves will incentivise greater fuel efficiency and emission reductions; they will also tend to benefit rural services, as Elaine Murray acknowledged, providing a degree of protection for our vulnerable rural communities. BSOG will also continue to provide additional incentives for low-carbon vehicles and for some biodiesel fuels.</p><p>We are reducing the BSOG funding to &#163;50 million, but we are adding a &#163;3 million investment fund for bus infrastructure. The reduction therefore represents about 1 per cent of fare costs. It does not justify significant fare rises or withdrawal of services.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The largest part of a fare is comprised of labour and fuel costs.

People often use the clich&#233; that something is constantly reviewed. The scheme is not constantly reviewed&#8212;nothing is constantly reviewed&#8212;but we are looking at it on regular basis. That approach has led to changes. For example, the cap that kicks in when the budget level is reached, which was agreed with the transport operators, was one thing that came from the review. However, I give a commitment to Tavish Scott that we will continue to review the scheme. That is only right, because it involves a large amount of public expenditure. Elaine Murray&#8217;s suggestion could feed into that debate.</p><p>Another change in the scheme is that it has been extended to make it easier to access for veterans who have been injured in active service&#8212;they can now access the scheme much more quickly and with much less hassle. We extended the scheme in that way before the Westminster Government did so, although it has now done so, too. That is a welcome change. Therefore, changes have happened to the national concessionary scheme and it has been reviewed.</p><p>There are issues to do with the proper management of the scheme, which come down to matters such as driving out abuse of the system. A great deal of work has been done on that. It perhaps does not create headlines, but Alex Neil and I have done quite a bit of work with operators on that. As several members have mentioned&#8212;and not only those on the Government back benches&#8212;there is a drive to ensure that we get the maximum possible effect from the money that we commit. Obviously, the amount that we can commit is constrained.</p><p>Jamie Hepburn made the important point that we are not the only players. We give money to local authorities so that they can subsidise bus routes. We provide the BSOG, but we do not subsidise bus routes. At local authorities&#8217; request, the money is no longer ring fenced. Some local authorities have been good at ensuring that the money is passed on, but others have not. That is where responsibility lies. It is not always down to the Government when the service that might be expected on a particular route is not in place. The local authorities and, sometimes, the regional transport partnerships have a role in that.</p><p>There has been fairly general agreement on the need for further consideration of demand-responsive transport. As I said, we have considered that already and we will continue to do so, particularly in relation to the example that I gave earlier about allowing voluntary organisations that cannot currently access the concessionary travel scheme&#8212;even for people who would otherwise qualify for concessionary travel&#8212;to do so. That is entirely right.</p><p>The motion mentions the SNP&#8217;s 2003 manifesto, which must have made a big impact when it was produced. Equally, we could refer to Labour&#8217;s 1983 manifesto commitment to abolish nuclear weapons and various other things that have gone by the board. Our 2003 manifesto was three manifestos ago, but we are still discussing it. Paul Martin rightly mentioned fundamental problems in his constituency. Those are deep-rooted and long-standing problems. Between 1997 and 2007, the Labour Party had the chance to do something about them. It was in power in this Parliament for eight years. Labour members concede that the problems started before then and lasted right through that period. That is just another issue on which the Labour Party thinks that the long-standing problems that it has left subsequent Governments to deal with are all the responsibility of the current Government. The Labour Party must take some responsibility for those problems.</p><p>As Jamie Hepburn said, we must see the issue in context. We have maintained local government expenditure, whereas in England it has reduced by 28 per cent, which produces knock-on effects including, in some areas, the abolition of concessionary travel. We have not done that. We have stuck by the bus industry and, in particular, the bus passenger&#8212;that is who we are trying to help in all this.

To give some more weight to the idea that we have no plans to close stations, members should look at our track record. Contrary to what some members have suggested, we have a good track record. The level of subsidy in Scotland is greater than it has ever been. It is greater, as I understand it, than the subsidy for any other train-operating company in the whole of the UK. The fare box is smaller, but the subsidy is greater. The EGIP involves around &#163;1 billion of investment in the railway infrastructure in Scotland. We are delivering the Borders railway, which the previous Administration did not get round to even looking at delivering. It talked about Borders rail for many years, but it did not deliver it. We have started that process. We managed to get the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line, which I was involved in when I was a council leader, through and completed. We are committed to looking at other stations in the north of Scotland.</p><p>Dalmarnock has been mentioned, as, quite rightly, has Glasgow, where there has been additional investment in the subway and in fastlink. There is a huge commitment to public transport in Glasgow from this Government, which is demonstrated by what we have done. That does not support the idea that we have some kind of agenda to cut back on transport.</p><p>What we have here is a consultation document. It is right that we should consult, and the document is open and inclusive. Some of the things in there are not the Government&#8217;s views, but things other people have suggested. For example, Jim Hume made a point about the length of the franchise, but the suggestion to which he referred came not from the Government but from the trade unions, which wanted to look at that. There are other reasons why they think that it would make sense to have a shorter franchise. Contrary to Jim Hume&#8217;s point, there is no evidence to suggest&#8212;as one might think and as, indeed, I did&#8212;that longer franchises encourage more investment or reduce fares.</p><p>We have a very good record on rail, on public consultation and on support for public transport. It is right that we are consulting on these issues. We are at the stage at which we are looking for a new franchisee, and we are obliged to follow the franchising system. It is interesting that we are holding a consultation on a franchise, and yet there is no consultation at all from the UK Government on the franchise for the east coast main line, which starts in 2013.

We must consider what that is if it is not a union dividend. The tax changes for the oil and industry and the loss of expertise from Aberdeen represent anything but a dividend to Scotland. We must consider whether such functions are best served by the involvement of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government, or by the involvement of the UK Government.</p><p>There is almost a former Lib Dem leaders club commenting on the issue.

As far as I am aware, we have not yet heard from the current Lib Dem leader, Willie Rennie, on whether he supports the closure of the facility on the Forth, which is in the area that he represents.</p><p>We can contrast the comments of those previous Lib Dem leaders with what Tavish Scott said. As I have said previously, he really sees the matter as an opportunity to attack the SNP Government rather than take to task proposals that have been made by the Government at Westminster that he supports.</p><p>It is difficult to see how, in the structure that the UK Government has announced, the areas that I mentioned can be adequately covered without significant loss of vital local knowledge, as members have said. I think that it was Alasdair Allan who, in a previous debate, made the point that even the mispronunciation of place names can cause confusion and potentially endanger vessels and lives.</p><p>The concerns that Lewis Macdonald expressed about the Aberdeen MRCC cannot be overstated. Although the MCA has assured us that it intends the current role in relation to oil and gas liaison to continue, it is difficult to see how that will be managed in the context of a significant reduction in staffing levels. As a number of members, including Rhoda Grant, said, although terms and conditions will be improved for the people in the service who keep their jobs, many people will lose their jobs as a result of the changes. That must be of concern to all members. We will continue to press the UK Government on that point and others, and we expect the MCA to provide early advice and support to staff at all affected stations, to ensure that people are aware of the options that are available to them in the new structure. We urge the MCA to avoid compulsory redundancies.</p><p>We welcome the three-month reprieve for the ETVs that was offered at the last minute and the attention that the Scotland Office is now giving the matter. Marine Scotland is formally part of the ETV working group, and officials from that agency and Transport Scotland have provided information and advice to the Scotland Office to help in the search for a solution that ensures that our seas continue to receive the required level of protection. Only last week, Richard Lochhead met David Mundell MP to discuss the matter with him and his officials. Richard Lochhead was able to press on Mr Mundell the importance of having adequate provision in place and of guaranteeing that there will be no break in cover prior to the implementation of a suitable long-term solution, which is crucial.</p><p>We are confident that that message was put across and that at that point the Scotland Office was in agreement with our view. It was also highlighted that the terms of the devolution settlement under the Scotland Act 1998 are clear. Funding for ETVs is a reserved matter and the Scottish Government cannot and will not provide funding to compensate for cuts that Westminster imposes. As members said during the debate, it is simply not sustainable for us to continue to pick up and provide funding for functions that were previously financed by Westminster. As I have said before, a much better and more sustainable approach would be to devolve the function and the budget.</p><p>In conclusion, I reiterate two key points.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655473", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Maritime Safety and Coastguards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to make a bit more progress.

The speeches in today&#8217;s debate, including Christina McKelvie&#8217;s supportive and passionate speech, illustrate clearly that there is a groundswell of good will and support across Scotland for the surviving veterans of the UK nuclear test programme.</p><p>The motion indicates that around 70 such veterans live in Scotland, but the figure might not be entirely accurate. We know that 70 Scotland-based veterans are involved in the litigation that is before the UK Supreme Court, but there might well be many more. We just do not know, and there is no way of verifying the true figure.</p><p>I should say that I took advice and double-checked it before my speech and that although I will refer to the legal case I will not do so in a way that jeopardises it.</p><p>That we owe the nuclear test veterans and, indeed, all veterans a debt of gratitude is not in doubt. All the service personnel served with honour and distinction, and we applaud them for that. A member&#8212;I cannot remember who&#8212;made the point that veterans&#8217; families should be equally in our minds, which is true. I think that Mrs Jessie Munn from East Kilbride, who is the widow of a man who served during the tests, is in the gallery. It is often the families who pay a huge price for the activities that our service personnel are involved in.</p><p>We show our gratitude across the country: it is never as poignantly demonstrated as it is at the impeccably observed remembrance Sunday commemoration services, which took place earlier this month. The Government tangibly demonstrates its support by putting veterans&#8217; issues at the heart of policy making, for example by ensuring that veterans can access the best possible medical care and support services. I think that we have delivered on that, and I have not yet heard of any case in which less than the best medical attention was provided to veterans by the national health service in Scotland.</p><p>On whether veterans of nuclear testing should be financially compensated, I fully support the position that where ill health is proved to be a result of service in the armed forces, wherever and whenever that service took place, it is right that the UK Government provide adequate compensation. Ultimately, however, that is a matter for the UK Government and the Ministry of Defence.</p><p>I understand that the UK Supreme Court sat for 3.5 days from 14 November to hear an appeal by the veterans, and that the court&#8217;s decision will be handed down in the new year. Should the case that the veterans brought before the UK Supreme Court prove to have been successful, that will not mean that they are entitled to compensation. Rather, it will mean that their case will be returned to the Court of Appeal in England and they will be required to win that particular battle.</p><p>It would be inappropriate for the Scottish Government to comment on the validity or otherwise of the veterans&#8217; cases. For a start, we have not seen all the evidence that has been put forward by the veterans&#8217; legal team or, indeed, the case that has been made by the MOD. In any event, were that evidence to be made available to us, the Scottish Government does not have access to the necessary expertise in the field to evaluate it thoroughly. I am not going to defend the MOD&#8217;s position; that is a matter for UK ministers. I am aware, however, that it is the MOD&#8217;s contention that the veterans and their legal team cannot prove a causal link between the tests of the 1950s and 1960s and the majority of the conditions and illnesses that are now being experienced by some veterans. Nevertheless, compensation through the mechanism of war pensions is being paid to some veterans who have been able to demonstrate that their specific illness is directly linked to exposure to radiation as a result of the tests.</p><p>Listening to the debate, it occurred to me that it would be interesting to examine the links between what was experienced by those who underwent the nuclear tests and the training that has been provided subsequently, since a few years after the tests to all armed forces personnel for nuclear, biological and chemical warfare. It must be the case&#8212;it cannot be otherwise&#8212;that lessons were learned from the tests that were incorporated into subsequent training. That bears further examination. I will say no more than that.</p><p>The MOD and the UK ministers hold the line that the link is not proven in the vast majority of cases. Many people can and do point to academic studies and research that have been carried out overseas, but none of those papers appears to have moved the UK Government. As members have mentioned, other countries have also offered compensation, although it is the MOD&#8217;s case that that is not always what it seems. That is its case to make. What we must do is ask how the Scottish Government can help.</p><p>As many members have, I met on 17 August Ken McGinley, who is a leading light in the veterans&#8217; campaign, as well as representatives of the veterans group and Mr Neil Sampson, who is a partner in the legal firm that is acting on their behalf, to hear for myself details of their fight for compensation. I think that they would agree that we had a very productive and useful meeting. I was very much moved when I listened to their stories. The veterans and their legal team fully accept that the matter is wholly reserved to Westminster and that it is for the UK Government to resolve.</p><p>At that meeting, however, I offered to pass on to the appropriate UK minister any evidence that they have in support of their claim. That offer was made because the veterans felt that some of the data that they had gathered were being blocked by MOD officials and were not, therefore, reaching the appropriate UK Government minister. So far, I have not had that information passed to me by the veterans, but that may be because they are still suffering from that blockage. I remain intent on honouring the commitment that I made to pass on that information to the relevant UK Government ministers.</p><p>Before concluding, I offer an apology to Kevin Stewart. At the earlier debate that we had on veterans, I said that I had written to Andrew Robathan on the issue. I had actually written to him on a different issue to do with the Atlantic convoys. I apologise for that. As I have just said, however, we remain committed to writing to the UK minister on behalf of the veterans when we receive the further information that they themselves are seeking.</p><p>My view is very much that the issue demands to be resolved. It reflects badly not only on the UK Government but on society as a whole when veterans of our armed forces feel let down, ignored and aggrieved&#8212;especially when they feel let down enough to go to court to try to resolve a dispute. I hope that the veterans get a verdict on their appeal to the Supreme Court as a matter of urgency. If it is proved that those people have experienced, and continue to experience, conditions and illnesses as a result of their service and participation in the nuclear testing programme of the 1950s and 1960s, the UK Government is morally bound to pay compensation. I also hope that, whatever the outcome, the decision is open, transparent and, above all, fair. Those who have served this country in whatever capacity deserve nothing less.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:58.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655894", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Test Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Christina McKelvie on securing this important debate on the veterans of nuclear tests.

It would have been far better, however, if Alex Johnstone had acknowledged that cutting Scotland&#8217;s capital investment by 36 per cent over three years, as his United Kingdom Government has done, has at the very least compounded the problems that we face. Of course, the welfare reforms, including the housing benefit reform, have done a great deal to hinder the future supply of housing in Scotland and it would have been better had he acknowledged that. It would also have been better had he acknowledged that the Scottish Government has been doing everything in its power to support the housing market.</p><p>I will make up for Alex Johnstone&#8217;s oversight. The Scottish Government has accelerated capital spend on affordable housing, kick-started a new generation of council houses&#8212;much though I know that that annoys Alex Johnstone&#8212;and continued investment to help first-time buyers access home ownership through our shared equity schemes. We recognise the scale of the challenge that we face, so we have been encouraging and supporting innovative solutions, including the one in East Lothian that Alex Johnstone mentioned, which we think is a commendable innovation in how we fund affordable housing. There is also the example of the widely acclaimed and successful national housing trust.</p><p>As a result of all that, it has been possible for us to deliver a total of &#163;460 million to be invested, which will deliver around 4,300 homes. That is not the be-all and end-all of what we will do this year, but just one part, although Alex Johnstone seemed to interpret the 4,300 homes as the total for this year. That will not be the total, but it will contribute towards our commitment to deliver 30,000 affordable homes during the life of this Parliament. It is also unfortunate that Alex Johnstone chose to overlook all that we are doing to counter the effects of ill-conceived Westminster policies.</p><p>It is even worse that his own solution to the problem is more of the right to buy at more generous discounts&#8212;talk about confused thinking. He offers a partial assessment of the impact that right to buy has had on our communities and ignores the problems that it has caused, for example, in managing blocks of flats when some flats have been bought but others continue to be owned by social landlords. Above all, though, he overlooks the impact that right to buy has had on the amount of housing that is available for social rent and the impact that that has had on those in housing need. Certainly, in my area in Clackmannanshire we saw the council&#8217;s housing stock reduced by half over a period of time, which has produced huge constraints for people looking for social housing.</p><p>Indeed, it was the recognition of the harm being done by the right to buy that resulted in almost universal support for the previous Administration&#8217;s proposals under the previous housing minister to reform the right to buy and to end it for new-build social housing and for new tenants in the sector. Those proposals became key elements of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2010, which the previous Parliament approved overwhelmingly. The idea that a year later we might contemplate overturning such popular legislation is at best fanciful, although not perhaps as fanciful as thinking that more generous right-to-buy discounts would give social landlords more money for new build.</p><p>If Alex Johnstone and the Conservatives could drop their obsession with right to buy and perhaps even recognise the damage being done to the economy by Westminster&#8217;s policies, we might be able to have a much more productive debate about how we achieve fairness and equity in the allocation of social housing, an objective that everyone in the chamber probably shares. We all know from our constituency experience that that is a pressing problem and one that ultimately arises from demand constantly outstripping supply. The long-term solution is to build more of the houses of all tenures that people want and can afford in areas where they want to live, and that lies at the heart of our vision for housing.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654922", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you very much, Presiding Officer.

His reference to &#8220;homes fit for heroes&#8221; after the second world war was at least 20 years out of date, as that initiative took off after the first world war. However, the fact that he was 20 years out of date seems to reflect the nature of the proposals in the motion.</p><p>I will also focus on action that is being taken to increase supply across all tenures. There is, rightly, an understandable emphasis on the inputs&#8212;how much money is going in. However, we must focus much more on the outputs&#8212;the number of affordable houses that are being built. That is the direction taken by Government policy. We recognise the connections between different tenures&#8212;how they can impact on one another&#8212;and the critical importance of supply to Scotland&#8217;s economic recovery and future growth.</p><p>Reference has been made to the challenges that exist in the construction industry and how much money is in the economy. It is interesting to note that more than &#163;100 million will be removed from the economy generally as a result of the changes to the local housing allowance. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are responsible for that but made no reference to it in any of their speeches.</p><p>It is our job to make our funds work harder and deliver more affordable housing at lower cost and for greater value to the public purse. To that end, we have tried to encourage housing associations, developers and local authorities to work together to deliver housing that meets their communities&#8217; needs; to make better use of the existing housing stock to improve choice and quality for households; and to help to deliver our ambitions for tackling climate change.</p><p>John Lamont talked about meeting local needs and allowing extra weighting for local connections. We have listened to that point and will start consultation in January on allocations. Nevertheless, I agree with Derek Mackay that we must be aware of the dangers of such an approach. A recent trend has been to ensure that veterans do not require the same number of points for local connections, as they do not establish those during their time in the service. There are difficulties with that approach, and some of the points that Derek Mackay raised are well worth bearing in mind. We will consult on the issue.</p><p>Increasing the supply of affordable homes remains our top priority. However, we could be so much further down the road in terms of the money that is available to us had successive Labour and Conservative Administrations, when tenants decided to keep their stock with the council rather than transfer it, treated both types of debt equally. Addressing homelessness and affordability issues is a vital part of our effort to build a better and fairer Scotland as we continue to regenerate our most deprived neighbourhoods.</p><p>Our target&#8212;which I have set out several times&#8212;is to deliver 30,000 affordable homes, completed by the end of the current Parliament. As one of the SNP speakers said, that is a challenging target. We understand that&#8212;it will not be an easy target to achieve.

That veteran exists, of course, but veterans in Scotland have served in world war two, Korea, Aden, east Africa, Suez, Northern Ireland, the Falkland Islands, the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan and in many other places around the globe, from the Rhine to Hong Kong and from Belize to Cyprus.</p><p>There are veterans in their 80s and 90s, but they are also in every other age group down from that; we have veterans who are only 19 and 20 years old. Veterans are predominantly men, but women have also served and have done so with distinction, just as men have.</p><p>When we talk about veterans, we talk about everybody who has served in the armed forces, including those in the Territorial Army and reserve forces. Those veterans live and work among us. They are an integral part of Scottish society. They make use of public, private and voluntary services in the same way as every other member of Scottish society, as is absolutely right. They access healthcare at the point of need, they live as owner-occupiers or as tenants of private landlords and social landlords and they have their children educated in our schools. They are part of our workforce. They put their skills and expertise to excellent use. Many are retired, and are making the most of their lives in the ways they wish to do so.</p><p>Do we owe these people a debt of gratitude? Of course we do. Each of them has put their life on the line. They have experienced and seen the best and the worst of human nature. Many of them have been to war&#8212;the worst possible resolution to international dispute and disagreement. Others have been international peace keepers who have faced bombs, bricks, stones and hatred&#8212;sometimes, tragically, very close to home. In the face of all of that, they have put duty before self interest so that we can live in peace and enjoy the freedoms that we sometimes take for granted.</p><p>Yet, by and large, the veteran does not expect a great deal in return. The veterans whom I have met and know are unassuming. They do not want to make a fuss; they just need their special circumstances recognised and acknowledged. That is very little to ask and that is why the Scottish Government has put veterans at the centre of our policy thinking, development and delivery. We have recognised that, sometimes, it is important to design and provide services and support in a way that is tailored to the specific and unique needs of the veteran. We have done well in that regard and will continue to deliver more as time goes on. We will, of course, plan for the future.</p><p>Our commitment to the veterans community in Scotland is a matter of public record. We have taken action in support of the words that we have spoken in favour of veterans and their interests. The agenda that we have followed and the results that we have achieved are widely acknowledged by the veterans community and by the other United Kingdom Administrations.</p><p>What is in place for veterans? What does the Government&#8217;s record look like? Does it stand up to scrutiny? I believe that it does, so I will give some examples from that record. We have added policy responsibility for veterans&#8217; issues to a ministerial portfolio. We are the first Administration to do that since devolution. We have appointed an armed forces and veterans advocate at director-general level to co-ordinate the delivery of Scottish Government policy as it impacts on veterans, and we have created a Scottish veterans fund with resources since 2008 of more than &#163;300,000, which has provided grants to more than 30 projects in support of veterans.</p><p>We have created a steering group that comprises the Scottish Government, the Ministry of Defence and senior officials of veterans organisations to examine issues around policy development and to facilitate direct access to Scottish ministers. Veterans organisations frequently tell me that they appreciate the access that they have to ministers. We have established quarterly meetings between Veterans Scotland and me to discuss priorities for action and we have established armed forces and veterans champions in national health service boards and local authorities as points of contact as well as for dispute resolution and signposting in relation to public services.</p><p>Beyond getting the administration right, we have delivered a range of direct services to Scotland&#8217;s veterans. We have made tremendous progress in health and housing. For example, in healthcare, we have given priority NHS treatment to veterans who have service-related conditions. With NHS Lothian, we have set up a &#163;300,000 prosthetic-limb project to provide state-of-the-art prosthetics to veterans. In 2009, with NHS Lothian&#8217;s Veterans First Point project, we created a one-stop shop for veterans that is based around mental health services. We have provided &#163;1.7&#160;million to Combat Stress for specialist mental health services in in-patient care and an outreach service. We have published leaflets such as &#8220;Have you served your country? Taking care of veterans&#8221;, which draws attention to the support packages that are in place for veterans.</p><p>Considerable progress has also been made in relation to housing.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Annual remembrance Sunday commemorations will be taking place the length and breadth of Scotland, and will be marked by thousands of Scots in honour of those whose lives were lost in times of war and other conflicts.

I was particularly interested in his point about the work that is being done on behalf of former and serving Royal Marines. I am also happy to accept the invitation from Dennis Robertson to visit the charity HorseBack UK, which I think also has a strong Royal Marines connection through its founder. As Dennis Robertson requested, I will write to the DWP on the issues that he raised.</p><p>Some extremely important points have been made. Derek Mackay and Linda Fabiani talked about the fact that other people often recognise the efforts of those who are close to us before we do.

In 2007, none of the budgets that we have today existed.

One reason that I perceive for that is that we are not in control of when veterans appear or the nature of the support that they receive prior to that.</p><p>Several members commented on resettlement in the armed forces, which has been pretty poor for a long time, although it is improving. A big difference can be made by properly preparing people for the move from an institution to civilian life and providing the additional support that they need as a result of experiences that they have undergone in the military. For someone in that situation, many decisions suddenly have to be made, such as those on healthcare and accessing housing services. The process of accessing services can be intimidating for somebody who has had such things taken care of for a long time. I accept that there is more for us to do, and I take on board the points that members have made.</p><p>Tavish Scott spoke interestingly about his experience and that of his family, and Liz Smith&#8217;s point was spot on. My children go to Alva academy in Clackmannanshire, and as part of a project pupils are going to the battlefields of Europe. I watched the video of my children&#8217;s visit. Some people have said&#8212;and perhaps sometimes with justification&#8212;that young people can feel removed from something that happened so long ago. However, when young people see the ages on the gravestone, it moves them and drives home the issue. As well as the 17-year-olds, we know that 16-year-olds served in the great war. Some were even younger. Schools take an open approach. They not only teach the history but try to make it meaningful. As a result, there seems to have been a cultural change.</p><p>For many years in the United States, we have been able to see a difference in their way of treating their veterans. We can go down Veterans Expressway in Florida, for example. If veterans want, they can go to all the various theme parks at reduced rates. They can access all sorts of facilities, public or otherwise, if they have a veterans card.</p><p>Americans always seem to have been able to make the mental distinction that Jamie Hepburn mentioned. To put it mildly, conflicts such as the one in Vietnam have not enjoyed complete public support, but Americans seem to be able to separate the ideas. Politicians send servicepeople to wars, and those servicepeople have no choice but to go&#8212;and they deserve support for what they experience.</p><p>A number of people have mentioned Erskine. Derek Mackay, the First Minister and I had a very interesting visit there&#8212;especially our conversation with a former Royal Marine in his wheelchair. I do not want to obsess about the Royal Marines, but the new chief executive of Erskine is an ex-Royal Marine himself, and I extend to him a word of warning and sympathy. As I have learned since being appointed as a transport minister, people can expect ex-marines to have superhuman powers to deal with all the problems that can arise. I wish him the best of luck.</p><p>Erskine is a superb organisation. Recently, Christina McKelvie and I were able to go to the Erskine ball. Through the generosity of the people who turned up, more than &#163;100,000 was raised for Erskine&#8217;s work. If anyone talks to people from Erskine for any length of time, they will realise how much the organisation has to raise every day from charitable contributions to continue its work. Its work is valued and it deserves support from all members. It has attracted such support: in the previous session, Trish Godman, Hugh Henry and others were involved in receptions in the Parliament.</p><p>The changing footprint of the armed forces in Scotland over the next few years will have repercussions for the way in which we organise services. More service personnel will return to this country from overseas, bases in Germany will close, and there will be the effects of the strategic defence and security review.</p><p>Having more serving personnel here in Scotland means that more people will become veterans in due course. In my experience, many serving personnel who come here from elsewhere in the UK stay and make their lives here. Why not? We offer such a wonderful place to live. However, greater demand will be placed on our infrastructure, services and communities&#8212;but I welcome that challenge. We can and should continue to improve our planning and delivery of support and advice to veterans. Most will access goods and services in the same way as everyone else, but a few will need a little extra helping hand. We owe them that.</p><p>To add to the roll call of people who have done sterling work, I would add Dundee City Council&#8212;and this relates to points made by Elaine Murray. In its allocation process for housing, the entire length of time that somebody has served in the military counts towards points. Other councils are also considering such a system. Perhaps that is testament to the changing culture around those who have served in our armed forces.</p><p>It is important that we mention the idea of remembrance.

Since then, agencies across the public, private and voluntary sectors have taken significant steps to improve their resilience and that of the people who live and work in Scotland. Whatever the winter brings, building Scotland&#8217;s resilience to the consequences of severe weather is a key priority. Our approach to resilience is to identify and assess the risks and, where possible, to take or to encourage preventative action to reduce their impacts.</p><p>We can hope for a mild winter, but we must prepare for a severe one. More than half the people in a survey by the British Red Cross this summer said that they were more concerned about the impacts of severe weather than they were about any other emergency, and that they did not feel that they were adequately prepared. The Scottish Government is responding to that by offering better guidance and support in the lead-up to winter, and a higher-than-ever level of preparation across the public sector. Last year, the people of Scotland mucked in and helped out. I have no doubt that that spirit will be there again this year if it is needed, but we must prepare by doing more than just asking for that. We, as a Government, and all the public sector agencies must be prepared.</p><p>On Monday, the Scottish Government began its ready for winter public information campaign. Individuals and communities are stronger when they help themselves and each other. This year, we are making it easier for people and communities to take their own actions to prepare.

Winter&#8212;no matter how prolonged or severe it is&#8212;should be no surprise to us, in Scotland. Everyone can take small, low-cost and sensible actions to be more resilient in their workplaces, at home, in their cars, in their neighbourhoods or wherever they happen to find themselves in the winter. The range of activities and resources that make up our ready for winter campaign, coupled with the relaunch of the ready Scotland website this week, will help to raise awareness of the simple steps that people can take and of the support that is available to them.</p><p>The Scottish Government has put in place significant measures to help households that will struggle to heat their homes this winter. They include the &#163;12.5&#160;million that was recently announced to fund insulation schemes across Scotland; the &#163;30&#160;million investment this year in the energy assistance package; &#163;2.5&#160;million to help households to replace inefficient boilers; and our commitment to extend to carers eligibility for our fuel poverty programme. An additional &#163;5&#160;million will ensure that the EAP delivers support for hard-pressed households through the cold weather that we might face in the coming months. Overall, our energy assistance package has offered advice to more than 200,000 households, has helped to reduce annual fuel bills by almost &#163;12&#160;million since 2009, and has delivered heating measures to more than 21,000 homes.</p><p>Since last winter, the Government and responders have prepared together, planned together and worked together to ensure that we are as ready as we can be to minimise the impact of severe weather. The winter weather review group, which the Scottish Government convened in the summer, published its report on Monday. It lists a series of actions that have been taken across the public, private and voluntary sectors and a range of services to improve resilience&#8212;particularly that of our critical national infrastructure. For example, the Met Office has improved its national severe weather warning service and we have invested more than &#163;500,000 to launch the Scottish Environment Protection Agency floodline warnings direct service to help to improve information to the public with updates on various platforms.</p><p>We have improved the operation of the Government&#8217;s emergency arrangements by reviewing the experience of last winter. That has included revising the staffing and training arrangements for the Scottish Government resilience room and developing a new approach to sharing information between strategic co-ordinating groups and SGoRR, when it is active.</p><p>I stress that, although we are more prepared than ever, some disruption might still be unavoidable if severe weather hits. Disruption can happen at any time&#8212;we have just to look at the M25 today for evidence of that. The challenge for us is how we respond to severe weather incidents and how quickly we recover from them. I will outline some of the key steps that we have taken in that regard.</p><p>Transport Scotland has prepared for the coming winter with additional equipment and improved information for people who are on the move. From 1 November, 23 additional gritters will patrol the most strategically important routes before and during the morning peak when there is a risk of snow or ice and will add to our ploughing capability during snowstorms. Specialist equipment&#8212;an icebreaker, footway snowblowers and inverted-V ploughs&#8212;is being brought to Scotland to increase our winter capability.</p><p>Salt stocks are obviously fundamental to a successful winter on our roads, so as of 1 November more salt will be stocked in Scotland than was used over the whole of last winter. Transport Scotland will publish, on the basis of the daily forecast, the gritting plans for trunk road operating companies. We also have 70,000 litres of alternative de-icers that work in the severest conditions&#8212;for example, below 7&#176; below freezing&#8212;when road salt becomes less effective.</p><p>Next week, Traffic Scotland will launch the trial of an internet radio service, which will provide 24/7 national traffic and travel information bulletins about the strategic motorway and trunk road networks. Information will be updated three times each hour during peak travel times and twice hourly off-peak, and the frequency of updates will be increased when there is extreme winter weather. The service will be available on computers and mobile devices, and via an automated message service on the traffic customer care line.</p><p>We have also set up the voluntary strategic alliance on winter tyres. This year, the industry has agreed to ensure an increased supply of winter tyres.</p><p>The freight industry has rightly expressed concerns about its portrayal last winter as being the cause of many road closures. Since then, we have worked hard with the police and freight partners to develop procedures for proactive management of heavy goods vehicles and other vehicles during severe weather conditions. Guidance has been developed, which will be supplemented by a freight Scotland hotline, so that HGV drivers can inform Traffic Scotland of traction problems that they experience on the network. That will help to inform the operating companies&#8217; treatment priorities. A similar service will be developed for bus operators.</p><p>We have secured a &#163;2.2&#160;million package of investment by First ScotRail for winter improvements to the railways. There will be investment in modifications to trains, and there will be equipment improvements to make trains more reliable; for example, in the purchasing of additional plant and equipment, including improved gritting equipment for platforms and car parks; and in the provision of more permanent facilities for de-icing carriages, such as the train skirts&#8212;or kilts, as they were called last year&#8212;the polytunnels that were developed last winter, and high-pressure hot water de-icing equipment at nine main depots.</p><p>Network Rail has also enhanced its infrastructure by, for example, improving the moving points at key junctions, using remote monitoring of points heaters and providing protective blankets for points on rural lines, and investing in more four-by-four vehicles for operational and maintenance staff. Perhaps the road and rail difficulties of staff in getting to work during times of severe weather are not commonly appreciated. The trunk road operating companies and Network Rail have taken action to ensure that staff can get to work.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate provides us with the opportunity to update members on the many measures that have been put in place to enhance Scotland&#8217;s resilience for the forthcoming winter.

The &#163;2.2&#160;million investment is by First ScotRail, and there is different investment that will help winter resilience, some of which is from the Government and some of which is from Network Rail. However, that has all been done at Network Rail&#8217;s own hand.</p><p>The rail industry recognises the importance of accurate and timely information, and we have worked with the rail regulator to raise the bar for the quality of passenger information: members will recall that that was an issue last year. Furthermore, Network Rail, in conjunction with rail freight hauliers, has committed to maintaining clear rail routes for critical freight-train movements to ensure that sufficient priority is given to the movement of vital commodities, including fuel and food, by rail.</p><p>Airports are a vital asset in our transport connectivity. Earlier this year, I met airport operators to review the response to last winter&#8217;s severe weather. They have all taken steps to strengthen their preparedness. That has included investment in new equipment. I had hoped to go to Edinburgh airport to see that yesterday, but people there have had one or two other things on their minds, so the meeting did not go ahead. However, I met a previous managing director of Edinburgh airport, Kevin Brown. Obviously, that airport faces the same question that the Scottish Government and others face: whether to invest substantially in new capital equipment that might not be used&#8212;which can attract criticism&#8212;or to ensure that there is enough resilience. It has taken the latter course, and it is right to have done so.</p><p>We have liaised with ports throughout Scotland to ensure that they have built on their well-established plans, which helped them to play a key role during last winter. The majority of our ports have invested in early maintenance or have purchased equipment to ensure that they can repeat that role. Most notably, they have invested in the import and onward shipping of strategic salt supplies and the running of lifeline ferry links to our island communities. As I mentioned, we expect to have as much salt in stock by the end of this month as we used during the whole period last year.</p><p>Obviously, as the transport minister, I have a role in relation to transport, but winter resilience does not respect portfolio boundaries. The continued provision of essential services to those who need them most must remain our top priority. This year, we are working with care providers and suppliers to ensure that those who are in need are brought quickly to the attention of those who can provide assistance.</p><p>In consultation with our resilience partners, we are developing a protocol that outlines the steps that local authorities and service providers should follow when considering persons and customers who are at risk, especially those who are at risk of being cut off from electricity or gas supplies or of running out of heating oil. The protocol will direct activity primarily at the local level, but it will inform a wider Scottish response, if that is required.</p><p>Many sectors played vital roles in keeping communities running last winter and in supporting essential services. Here in Edinburgh, for example, the military helped nurses and care workers to reach people who were cut off by snow, and mountain rescue teams did the same in other areas. Land Rover lent four-wheel drive vehicles to the Red Cross, which enabled it to reach and help vulnerable people, and neighbours checked up on those who needed a bit more help. We will continue to support such partnerships where we can. We have published new advice for community groups that wish to work together to build resilience in their areas. We have developed a national directory of third sector organisations that can provide help and support when major incidents occur. Our ready for winter campaign sets out the simple steps that we can all take to be more prepared.</p><p>To ensure that members are kept up to date, Transport Scotland is today writing to members to invite them to a presentation by representatives of the trunk road operating companies&#8212;Amey, BEAR Scotland and Scotland TranServ&#8212;on Wednesday. That will happen in the Parliament, in room P1.02. Transport Scotland has worked closely with the operating companies to ensure improved winter preparedness. I attended the same presentation from the trunk road operating companies yesterday. It is impressive to hear about the amount of work that those companies have done and the lessons that have been learned since last year.</p><p>At a time of severe economic challenges and environmental change, we must demonstrate that Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure and services are ready to withstand severe winter weather. Obviously, such weather can affect people&#8217;s personal plans and lives, but it can also have a major impact on the economy. We want to ensure that we limit that impact as much as possible. We believe that through our preparations we are ready for this winter and that the people of Scotland are, too. We believe that they have taken heed of the idea that we should hope for the best, but plan for the worst of severe weather. We all want a ready and capable Scotland.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament welcomes the major winter preparedness campaign launched on 24 October 2011; commends the Red Cross, responder agencies and the broad range of partners involved for working together to stress the importance of planning ahead for winter; supports the activities that are taking place during Ready for Winter? week, which highlight the simple steps that people can take to be more prepared; acknowledges that, although Scotland&#8217;s weather is unpredictable, government, responders and a range of public, private and voluntary sector partners have taken significant steps to be more prepared for severe weather this winter, including holding a major winter planning exercise, Polar Storm, last month and that improved winter planning is captured in the report of the Winter Weather Review Group, and acknowledges that preparedness will be an ongoing process and that everyone must be resilient in preparing for winter.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There has been strong collaboration between Network Rail, ScotRail, Transport Scotland and the Government.

I welcome his positive words. Indeed, I welcome the positive words from members of all parties, although I am under no illusion about how quickly they will dissipate if we have a cold winter and things do not go to plan. Jackson Carlaw said that he fears that given that we have had an election since last winter people might have taken their eye off the ball. It is worth remembering that since the election we have experienced the highest-ever winds in May and, in August, some of the heaviest rainfall that we have ever experienced. We have also had a volcanic ash cloud and the remnants of hurricane Katia. Therefore, all the people who are involved have had to stay very much on top of the matter&#8212;not that they would not have done so anyway, but the conditions have meant that we have continually needed to consider issues to do with resilience.</p><p>Dick Lyle talked about the strategic placement of gritters and grit bins. He might remember that in the six-point plan that we adopted last year we addressed precisely that point in relation to our responsibilities on the trunk road network&#8212;one example is the rise at Harthill, which is not far from Dick Lyle&#8217;s area. We have put grit on site on the strategic trunk road network, so that we can get the roads gritted quickly. I take Dick Lyle&#8217;s point that local authorities might want to adapt the approach for their purposes.</p><p>Someone said that there should be a minister for pavements, rightly drawing attention to the fact that pavements were a problem for many people last year. As I said, we have the salt stocks that we need. There are other materials, such as magnesium chloride and Eco-Thaw, which work far better than salt at low temperatures. It is open to local authorities to get those materials, although they are much more expensive than salt. The materials keep pavements clear of ice for longer periods; they also break up hard-packed ice. That is an option but, by and large, pavements are the responsibility of local authorities. Where they abut the trunk road network, we have provided community self-help kits to a number of local communities, especially in rural areas. The people will have their pavements cleared and those areas will be gritted, but that cannot happen everywhere at the same time, so community self-help kits have been issued, which have been very much welcomed.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch raised the idea of working closely with local authorities. We are doing that. She mentioned South Lanarkshire Council specifically. Amey told us yesterday that it has a commitment with South Lanarkshire Council to enhance communications and supply and to provide mutual aid when required. That happens in Aberdeenshire, where some functions of the trunk road operating company are carried out by the local authority and vice versa, and it also happens in Dumfries and Galloway. That should continue. Last year, we made a number of offers of assistance even to the airports, and we had the trunk roads next to Edinburgh airport cleared. There were also problems with clearing the runway, but the plant that we have cannot be used on runways. We regularly ask ourselves how we can help other organisations.</p><p>There was a lot of discussion about the threat of litigation if someone clears a path and somebody else slips. Ready Scotland advice makes it clear that that is extremely unlikely, as Graeme Dey helpfully mentioned. Even if someone were to be sued, the vast majority of household insurance policies would cover them for that eventuality. If people are insured, that should take care of that. One or two people were trying to put that story about last year, perhaps through their own self-interest or in the interest of the legal profession. However, it should never be a matter for legal reproach if someone takes action to help out a neighbour. I understand that that was a concern, but that addresses that.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw spoke about the variable message signs that are mounted on gantries. The VMSs in Scotland can be used for other purposes when there are no emergency messages to put up. I do not know whether that is exactly what he was referring to. He made a good point about the need to ensure that the language that is used in VMS messages is as clear and understandable as possible. We do not live in a police state and cannot tell people not to go out, but we can make the dangers of going out as clear as possible and we will do that. This year, we have refined the language that we are using to make sure that that happens.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I reiterate that the primary link is between local authorities and community councils, as is set out in statute, although we will provide support and encouragement where we can do so.

The leaflet &#8220;Drive Safely This Winter&#8221;, published by Safer Scotland, should be extremely useful for that purpose.</p><p>Many members talked about how much voluntary organisations and individuals did last year, much of which went unsung.

I intend to use the debate to point out a number of challenges that face housing in Scotland; to set out the Government&#8217;s housing strategy; and to update the Parliament on the progress that we are making on delivering the strategy.</p><p>Housing has been a cause and a casualty of the global financial crisis. Unsustainable lending practices by the banks and unsustainable promotion of outright home ownership, including the right to buy, contributed to economic volatility, put households at risk and undermined our objective of sustainable economic growth. The credit crunch and lack of mortgage availability for first-time buyers not only introduced barriers to home ownership but put housing developers out of business and people out of work.</p><p>The Government has acted quickly by accelerating capital spend on affordable housing; kick-starting a new generation of council housing; expanding access to shared equity for first-time buyers; and introducing, through the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Act 2010, new protections for home owners who are at risk of losing their homes. Although private housing construction fell, the number of social housing completions was higher than in any other Scottish parliamentary session, which kept thousands of people in work and helped to house those in need.</p><p>Following the financial crisis, we face a number of challenges. Demand for social and other forms of affordable housing remains high. First-time buyers face a tough challenge to save a deposit. Local authorities are making good progress on meeting the 2012 homelessness target, but our efforts to achieve that jointly with our partners are undermined by United Kingdom Government cuts in housing benefit. It is essential that we improve the energy efficiency of our stock if we are to meet our climate change targets and help those who have to pay large energy bills. Some people now pay more for their energy than they do for their mortgage or rent. A further challenge is that the number of households is growing every year and our population is ageing. Achieving the right mix of housing is essential if we are to meet people&#8217;s needs.</p><p>Despite the UK Government&#8217;s drastic cuts of about 36 per cent over four years to Scotland&#8217;s capital investment, our strategy is to tackle the challenges by making our funds work harder to deliver affordable housing; encouraging housing associations, developers and local authorities to work together to deliver housing that meets their communities&#8217; needs; and making better use of the existing housing stock and improving choice and quality for households.</p><p>I believe that we are leading the way in developing new ideas. The award-winning national housing trust initiative is delivering hundreds of affordable rented homes and supporting hundreds of jobs for very little taxpayers&#8217; money.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652640", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to lead this debate on housing, which is my first such debate as Minister for Housing and Transport.

I have just said that at least two thirds of the 30,000 houses that we intend to have over the next five years will be social rented housing. That is vastly in excess of the figures that previous Administrations delivered. The supply of those houses is not plummeting. The supply of affordable homes is increasing, it remains our top priority and it is a vital part of our efforts. I have no doubt that we will deliver our target to have 30,000 affordable homes completed by the end of this session.</p><p>To come back to the other part of Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s question, despite the cuts in capital spend for housing, we have prioritised more than &#163;600 million for new housing over the period in question. That commitment enabled me to announce a doubling of investment in new affordable homes through the investment and innovation fund. The &#163;111 million that we are committing through that fund will lever in more than &#163;283 million in additional investment. Combining that money with the equivalent provision through Glasgow City Council and the City of Edinburgh Council will deliver 4,310 new affordable homes, more than 70 per cent of which will be for social rent.</p><p>Many people doubted housing associations&#8217; ability and capacity to deliver that kind of housing at &#163;40,000 grant per unit, but the sector has risen magnificently to the challenge, and has drawn on its ability to tap into new sources of funding. Local authorities in Scotland are now building almost as many council houses as the rest of the UK combined, and private developers are taking advantage of guarantees offered through the national housing trust and our support for shared equity, which are providing lifelines for construction businesses throughout Scotland and homes that Scotland needs.</p><p>I underline the point that, as a result of the drastic cut in the capital budget, we are forgoing employing more people who would pay taxes rather than receive benefits. Investing now in capital in housing and transport means creating economic assets for the future at a cost that will be hard to replicate when the economy picks up again. This is the time to invest in capital.</p><p>Our record is there for all to see. Under the four years of the first Scottish National Party Government, more than 27,000 affordable homes were completed. That is a third more than the four-year total under the previous Administration. More than 19,000 of our total of 27,000 affordable homes were for social rent. As we look ahead, we are confident that, together with our partners in the housing sector, we have the ideas, capacity and commitment to keep Scotland building.</p><p>Obviously, investment in new supply dominates the discussion about housing, but we also need to make better use of existing homes. We have already said that we will look to limit further the right to buy to preserve social housing stock, and we will soon consult on proposals to allow councils to charge a council tax levy on long-term empty properties. Empty properties are a wasted resource. We aim to introduce legislation next year to allow councils to charge the levy from April 2013 to help to provide more revenue for them to use for affordable housing. The levy will also help to reduce homelessness by releasing more houses as owners rent or sell their empty properties. Our focus on alleviating the causes of homelessness stands in stark contrast to the actions of the UK Government and its swingeing housing benefit cuts, which&#8212;make no bones about it&#8212;will force people out of their existing homes. I have made my concerns about the reforms crystal clear to UK ministers, as the cabinet secretary has on a number of occasions.</p><p>Prevention and planning are important in preparing for the challenge of an older population. The Government supports older people&#8217;s aspirations to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible, but significant demographic and financial challenges mean that we must find new ways to achieve those aspirations. I plan to publish a national strategy for housing for older people in December that will set out a clear vision for housing for older people and what needs to be put in place to achieve it.</p><p>With the challenge of reducing greenhouse gases and the rise in energy prices, it is essential that we build houses to the highest standards of energy efficiency. Progressive increases in our rigorous building standards are ensuring that new houses will be near zero carbon but, with the expectation that more than 80 per cent of current housing will still be in existence by 2050, improvements to the existing stock are also vital.</p><p>We are tackling fuel poverty head on with an increase of more than 30 per cent in funding to support fuel poverty and energy efficiency programmes.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652640", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not sure that I agree with the premise of the question that the supply of socially affordable houses is plummeting.

I also recognise the work of other members, such as Mary Scanlon, on the cross-party group on supporting veterans in Scotland. I know that you were previously involved in that group, too, Presiding Officer. I was about to become involved when other tasks were presented to me.</p><p>I am delighted to support the motion, which thoroughly deserves the endorsement of everybody in the chamber. The bravery, gallantry and achievements of all those merchant seamen and members of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force must not be ignored or forgotten and must certainly not be just lost to history.</p><p>Some members might have seen the recent programme, which I think was on the BBC, about the Arctic convoys. It was evident from watching that programme how young and inexperienced some of the people were who were asked to do things way beyond their years. It also gave a very good representation of how cold it was, which is probably hard to imagine. When I saw some of the conditions that those people had to endure, I thought that it was remarkable what some of those very young seamen endured. To fail to acknowledge their sacrifice and selflessness in securing the freedoms that we now take for granted would be to do them an enormous disservice.</p><p>It is right and fitting that we remember and mark the incredible bravery of those who served on the Arctic convoys. Many of those who took part in them were ordinary young men drawn from throughout the British empire and beyond, but they undertook an extraordinary task. They sailed through a deadly gauntlet of Arctic weather, ice, German U-boats and planes on what&#8212;to add another Churchillian reference&#8212;Churchill called the &#8220;suicide run&#8221; to carry essential supplies to the Russian people in the ports of Murmansk and Archangel. Their dedication, bravery and professionalism ensured that much-needed provisions were available to the Soviet Union and were a crucial component in supporting the red army in its ultimately successful fight against German forces on the eastern front.</p><p>We heard a moving speech from Chic Brodie. I confirm to him that I have read &#8220;HMS Ulysses&#8221;, which is a combination of heroism and tragedy, although it is more than 30 years since I read it. The novel would give members some idea of what conditions may have been like for those who served.</p><p>The Arctic convoys had the highest sinking ratio of any of the second world war convoys: 85 merchant ships and 16 Royal Navy ships were lost between August 1941 and May 1945. Around 20,000 Royal Navy and merchant navy sailors served in the 78 convoys that braved the Arctic Ocean, with more than 3,000 losing their lives.</p><p>The number of remaining veterans of the conflict sadly reduces with each passing year, but those who endure wear their Atlantic Star medals and Arctic Emblems with pride. They keep the memories of their shipmates alive and they will never forget them. Occasions such as the debate keep the story of their heroism, bravery and endeavour burning brightly.</p><p>I can only add to the congratulations to Rob Gibson. He has worked on the issue for some time but, by bringing the matter to the chamber for debate, he serves the memory of those involved well. We owe a debt of gratitude that we can never repay but we can and should remember those who served.</p><p>The heroism and determination to succeed that those remarkable young men demonstrated has been acknowledged by the Russian Government and the people of Russia. I welcome that and thank the Russian Government and people for such a kind gesture. They recognise that the convoys played a vital role in ensuring that food supplies, munitions and equipment were available to the Russian people as they continued their resistance to the Nazi invasion. If members think about the battle of Stalingrad, they will realise how crucial those supplies were.</p><p>As a mark of that respect, in 1985, the Russian Government commissioned a Medal for the 40th Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, which is known more commonly as the Russian convoy medal, and awarded it to veterans of the Arctic convoys.</p><p>Sadly, despite promises that the coalition parties made while in opposition, the UK Government has yet to follow that lead and commission an official campaign medal. I am delighted that different members have said that they intend to write to the Government on that issue. I wrote to Andrew Robathan MP, the Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, on 5 September to urge him to follow the example set by the Russian Government and give the Arctic convoy veterans the official recognition that they richly deserve. I await his reply.</p><p>I welcome the work of those who have started an ambitious fundraising programme that aims to raise &#163;1&#160;million to establish a public museum space of around 3,000ft2, sited beside a new village hall in Aultbea. That museum will create an archive and display artefacts of the conflict, not least the one that Chic Brodie mentioned. I wish them well with that endeavour and am sure that they will succeed in creating a lasting legacy to the brave men who left Loch Ewe and sailed into the unknown.</p><p>On Annabelle Ewing&#8217;s point that the Scottish Government should assist with the funding of that ambitious and fitting tribute to those brave seafarers, I confirm that the Scottish Government makes funding available to local and non-national museums through Museums Galleries Scotland, which will be able to provide advice on setting up a museum. I encourage the organisers to make contact directly with Museums Galleries Scotland if they have not done so yet. My officials will provide any interested parties with the relevant contact details.</p><p>The Scottish Government does a number of things to support veterans. We have allocated &#163;320,000 to establish a specific Scottish veterans fund. We have also appointed an armed forces and veterans advocate and created a defence policy unit to ensure that veterans issues are at the heart of all our defence policy. We will continue to work with the Ministry of Defence, the armed forces, the health service, local authorities, the veterans community and service providers to put in place the best possible level of support for our veterans.</p><p>I have one final point, on remembering. My view is that, for individuals in a life-threatening situation such as armed combat, there is an acute fear that their contribution or the sacrifice that they make will not be acknowledged or remembered. That might sound odd, but it is my view and it is a very real fear. It is our responsibility to ensure that the huge contribution that veterans make, including the ultimate sacrifice, is not just acknowledged but remembered, and remembered with pride. They deserve nothing less.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:40.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650809", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Remembering the Russian Arctic Convoys"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, like others, very much welcome Rob Gibson&#8217;s motion, in which he recognises the bravery, professionalism and selfless sacrifice and service of all those who participated in the various convoys to Archangel and Murmansk during the dark days of world war two.

I acknowledge the work that David has done in the past on the issue. There has been an interesting range of contributions. We had someone who has campaigned for a long time on the issue. We had someone from the motor industry. We had someone who had served in the police. In Mark McDonald, we have as near as we get to a young person, at least in the current crowd&#8212;no offence to anyone else, including myself. It was a good range, even though it was a fairly small number of speeches.</p><p>David Stewart alluded to and is well aware of the fact that significant challenges face us in respect of the safety of young drivers on Scotland&#8217;s roads. The latest confirmed figures for road casualties in Scotland, from 2009, show that road casualties are at their lowest level in 60 years. We should acknowledge the progress that has been made.</p><p>That said, the Government believes that more can be done, particularly for young drivers. While, as with other age groups, rates are falling, they are not falling as fast for young drivers as they are for other groups. I would particularly like to take action with regard to fatalities and serious injuries.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw touched on the fact that in all cases we are talking about adults. No one can get a provisional licence till they are 17 years old. There is the issue of responsibility&#8212;if someone is an adult, they must accept adult responsibilities. One can make a mistake with some adult responsibilities, such as the ability to marry, and many of us do. One can make a mistake with drinking. When we first get the chance to drink legally, we can make a mistake by overconsuming. However, the consequences of a mistake when we drive can be far more serious. We are talking about young people but they are also adults.</p><p>The statistics show that around one in four drivers or riders killed or seriously injured on the roads in 2009 was in the 17 to 25-year-old age group. That figure changes to 29 per cent for car drivers only. However, young driver accidents are not increasing. If we compare 2009 with the average for 1994 to 1998 for all casualties&#8212;that is, all severities and all road user types&#8212;we see that casualties among 16 to 24-year-olds fell by 30 per cent, compared with a 33 per cent fall for all age groups. If we consider the category &#8220;killed and seriously injured&#8221; for car drivers only, we find that in the 16-to-24 age group there was a 48 per cent reduction over the same period, compared with a 47 per cent reduction for all ages.</p><p>&#8220;Go Safe on Scotland&#8217;s Roads&#8212;it&#8217;s Everyone&#8217;s Responsibility: Scotland&#8217;s Road Safety Framework to 2020&#8221;, which was published on 15 June 2009, was debated by the Parliament in September 2009. The framework sets out our commitments for greater road safety for all road users and includes our intentions on education, publicity and young drivers. In the framework, we set ourselves challenging targets to reduce fatalities by 40 per cent and serious injuries by 55 per cent, based on the 2004 to 2008 average. Young drivers are identified as one of the eight national priorities in the framework.</p><p>Road Safety Scotland has focused much of its recent publicity on young drivers, as well as talking about rural roads, which also cause concern, as members said. The organisation&#8217;s recent publicity measures feature young drivers and include a national cinema and television campaign on country roads and distraction. As Mark McDonald said, and as I know from experience, some of the work that is done in schools has a visible impact on young people, especially when people take part who have been involved in serious accidents with dramatic consequences.</p><p>There is evidence that the behaviours and factors that contribute most to fatal and serious accidents that involve young drivers and their passengers are speeding, driving while impaired through drink or drugs, distraction, not wearing a seatbelt and&#8212;this is crucial&#8212;lack of experience. All those factors are addressed comprehensively in Scotland&#8217;s road safety framework.</p><p>David Stewart made a good point about passengers. Parents&#8212;especially parents of daughters, given the figures&#8212;are very concerned to say to their children that once they are in a car that someone else is driving, they have no control, so they really must ensure that the person who is driving is aware that they must not take risks. Taking risks with oneself is one thing; taking risks with other people is quite another.</p><p>In late 2010 we commissioned a nationwide debate with young people and key partner road safety bodies, which gave young people a chance to voice their needs and concerns and put forward their ideas and suggestions on the issues that affect them&#8212;I think that David Stewart referred to the debate and I am happy to let him have the findings from it. As I think that Mark McDonald said, the response from young people on graduated driver licensing was different from the response of older people. As we perhaps would have expected, there was much less support for the idea among young people and support grew as people got older. The report on the discussions, &#8220;National Debate on Young Drivers&#8217; Safety&#8221;, was published on Transport Scotland&#8217;s website in March.</p><p>My officials and I are aware of the research that Sarah Jones, from Cardiff University, conducted. She was invited to present her findings to the road safety strategic partnership board meeting in March. Her research found that between 2000 and 2007 the number of crashes that involved 17 to 19-year-old drivers appeared to be steady, at around 1,400 per annum. However crashes remaining steady does not equate to injuries remaining steady, and we categorise a young driver as being between 17 and 24 years old.</p><p>I urge members to support the spirit of David Stewart&#8217;s motion and to note that graduated driver licensing is a reserved matter, as he said. We wrote to the UK Government to encourage it to move in that direction, and when it replied, &#8220;No,&#8221; we wrote back to express our disappointment and ask it to keep the option open.</p><p>The report of the national debate on young drivers&#8217; safety contained 17 recommendations to improve road safety outcomes for young drivers&#8212;I mention that to make the point that although we have had a refusal from Westminster we have not left matters at that but realise that there is much that we can and will continue to do. We have gathered evidence to help us to consider whether and how graduated licensing could be implemented in Scotland, if we have such an opportunity.</p><p>As I said, to deliver the framework commitments we brought together key stakeholders to form the road safety operational partnership group and the road safety strategic partnership board. The group met on 30 June and agreed to consider all 17 recommendations in the report, one of which is to get further evidence on graduated driver licensing. We have not let the issue slip. We have made representations and we are taking other actions. We will keep on at the issue.</p><p>Meeting closed at 17:29.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650209", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young Drivers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Stewart on securing the debate.

We are keen to get that right, so it is right that we take time over it.</p><p>Lewis Macdonald made a point about unbundling in relation to the AWPR, as did others. We have to await the outcome of the legal process. That perhaps addresses a point that Maureen Watt raised. It is not for Government ministers to challenge any courts, so we will not do that. It is important that we respect the legal process. I know that the delay that it has caused has been frustrating for many people. Only after the process comes to an end can we look at how we can proceed. The cabinet secretary said that it would be worth looking at unbundling again at the appropriate time, but not in advance of then.</p><p>The cabinet secretary answered a question from Maureen Watt about including a community benefit clause in relation to the AWPR. We have done that in previous schemes and we would be very happy to do it for the AWPR.</p><p>Helen Eadie asked about European funding, which I think the cabinet secretary addressed when he spoke first of all. We are trying to look at every single penny that is available from Europe. We have always done that. If Helen Eadie is aware of any funds that we are not accessing, we are happy to hear what she thinks we can do. She said that she had not had a response to her letter yet; I am more than happy to meet her to discuss her constituents&#8217; concerns about the Forth crossing.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm made a number of points. We are freeing up money for social rented housing. We published targeted guidance in March which, if adopted by social landlords, could save up to &#163;1 billion against the already-budgeted amount to meet the cost of the Scottish quality housing standard. It is worth pointing out that the 1,273 local authority homes started in 2010-11 was the highest number in a single financial year since 1987-88 and that the 583 local authority homes completed was the highest number in a single financial year since 1994-95. Real progress is being made in that respect. As I indicated in relation to the targets that we have set, we intend to go further.</p><p>Jim Hume raised a concern about having a single bidder for the Borders railway. It is our intention to see through the project and our 2014 target remains in place. There are issues to address, but the M74, which many members have mentioned as a positive example, also had a single bidder. Certain things have to be taken into account and we have to have discussions to ensure that the process is rigorous, but it is still possible to see through the project and we will do that.</p><p>On the Rosyth to Zeebrugge route, there is no difference between the point that I made that the decision is a commercial matter for the company involved and the point that Alex Neil made, which I understand was in a completely different context, that we should be ambitious in that respect. Of course we have always wanted to see a passenger service on that route, but we understand the commercial pressures on the company concerned.</p><p>Paul Wheelhouse made a good point about the Norwegian oil fund. Would it not be fantastic to have a job like this if we had &#163;300-plus billion of which we could access &#163;13 billion in any given year to do some of the things that we would like to do? That just shows the folly of having squandered the oil wealth of this country. He was right to say that no provision was made by the previous Labour-Lib Dem Government for funding the Borders rail link. It is this Government that has driven the rail link forward and we will continue to do so.</p><p>Margaret McDougall made a series of points about council housing, but she did not seem to recognise the fact that the 36 per cent cuts to our budget&#8212;crucially, our capital budget&#8212;by Alistair Darling, which were subsequently supported by George Osborne, might have something to do with the cuts that we are having to wrestle with. That is the kind of thing that we are having to look at.</p><p>As a general rule, I genuinely think that it is important that we look at any good ideas that come from other parties on these issues, because the cabinet secretary has a role in looking at innovative ways of drawing in new funding. However, we can only take such suggestions seriously if members say where the money should come from. At the previous election, it was shown that the idea that one can demand more money for everything and expect to get it is finished.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649605", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Infrastructure and Capital Investment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I said, I have stated in the public domain and the cabinet secretary has made clear&#8212;and I have just made clear again&#8212;that our priority is 30,000 affordable homes, or around 6,000 per year, over the next five years.

The speeches today and in the previous debate in January send a clear message, which was confirmed by the select committee.</p><p>The strength of the concern about the proposals cannot be overstated. It extends not only throughout Scotland but throughout the UK. There is broad consensus that the proposals are ill considered and ill founded.</p><p>As the motion and the David MacBrayne Group emphasise, the overriding consideration must be protecting life, not just saving money. We all support&#8212;and must support&#8212;efficiency in public services, but not at the expense of a service&#8217;s primary function, which in this case is ensuring safety at sea. We heard an eloquent speech from Mike MacKenzie about his experience in that regard.</p><p>Of course, it is not only the coastguard proposals that cause concern. The convergence of those proposals with the withdrawal of funding for emergency towing vessels and the uncertainty over the future of search and rescue services and marine firefighting capabilities threatens to create a perfect storm that would leave users of our seas and our precious marine environment itself exposed to unacceptable risks.</p><p>Tavish Scott was right to say that we should not forget the Donaldson report. It would be illuminating for those who consider the proposals to go back to that report and see what emerged from it.</p><p>Alongside those significant concerns on the substance of the UK Government&#8217;s proposals and its funding decisions, we are very disappointed with the process to date. Despite the fact that the Scottish coastline and sea area make up 60 per cent of the UK total, there was no prior consultation with the Scottish Government or wider Scottish interests. That meant that valuable information and expertise were not taken into account in arriving at the coastguard proposals. However, I hope that the consultation to which Scottish interests contributed heavily will lead us to a more sensible outcome.</p><p>The situation in relation to emergency towing vessels is even more perilous. Following a unilateral decision to withdraw funding, we are still no further forward in knowing how that vital service will be provided after September. The Scottish Government is pleased to play a part in the working group that was established to consider alternative provision, but we must emphasise that that is not a suitable model of engagement. In essence, we are asked to devise a solution to a problem that was created by the UK Government without any prior consultation or proper consideration of risk or appropriate resources. The select committee notes that the UK Government</p><p>&#8220;is, quite literally, inviting disaster.&#8221;</p><p>It is up to us to ensure that that disaster does not happen. We had one illuminating example of what that might mean from Dave Thompson&#8217;s speech. The decision-making processes on the future of search and rescue services and firefighting at sea have been marked by unacceptable uncertainty.</p><p>Given that scant regard for Scottish interests across the board, it is natural that we look to exploring the merits of devolution of the coastguard responsibilities to Scotland as an option at least. In so doing, we are mindful of the need for the cost implications to be properly and transparently examined in order that the appropriate resources transfer with the responsibility. I also acknowledge the importance that the shipping industry, for example, places on a consistent and integrated UK service. However, those issues would not be insurmountable in the case of a devolved service.</p><p>We have made our points to the UK Government in response to the coastguard consultation and in correspondence between ministerial colleagues and their Whitehall counterparts. The First Minister has also raised the concerns directly with the Prime Minister. We also provided evidence to the Transport Select Committee and I am pleased that the concerns about the inherent risks of the proposals are strongly reflected in its report.</p><p>The David MacBrayne Group, which has years of experience of operating in Scottish waters, has also made a valuable series of representations. There is broad consensus with its contention that the focus on costs, rather than lives, is wrong and that local knowledge&#8212;about which we heard quite a bit tonight&#8212;is crucial. I also agree that the proposals&#8217; social and economic impacts, particularly in our more remote areas, should be considered.</p><p>A number of members said that we have not allowed ourselves to be divided and ruled. It was particularly interesting to hear some of the comments about the Clyde. That is where recreational sailing was born. I have sailed there many times, although I have never been given sole charge of the vessel, and it is reassuring to know that there is a coastguard out there looking out for me.</p><p>Stuart McMillan&#8217;s point about the presence of nuclear submarines and all the other traffic in the Clyde is very important indeed. The consequences of not having the right cover really are unthinkable.</p><p>The David MacBrayne Group makes the point about its involvement in search and rescue. It can and should contribute directly to the debate, and I hope that it is listened to.</p><p>It will, I hope, be crystal clear that the Scottish Government has real concerns about the UK Government&#8217;s proposals for the coastguard and ETVs. The Transport Select Committee endorses those concerns, and we need a constructive dialogue with UK ministers in order to take the issues forward. We accept the need for modernisation, but we do not believe that saving money should come at the expense of putting lives or the environment at risk.</p><p>This Government has taken great steps recently to improve the management of our seas. The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 introduced marine planning to respond to the increasing use of our seas, and we stand poised to reap the benefits&#8212;as other members have mentioned&#8212;of offshore renewable energy.</p><p>It is crucial that the valuable services that our coastguard and ETVs provide are not compromised in any way. We need maritime safety services that are capable of delivering for Scotland, which includes meeting all the demands that have been mentioned. That must include the search and rescue services and the fire-fighting capabilities that are also being reviewed.</p><p>We need to keep safe those who use our seas and coasts, and we must ensure that we keep those seas safe from pollution. Today&#8217;s debate has again shown that members are unhappy at the way in which Scotland has been treated in relation to those vital issues. We need to work together with the UK Government in the weeks and months ahead, as it responds to the select committee&#8217;s report and finalises decisions, to ensure that Scottish interests are heard, understood and properly taken into account.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:41.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Coastguard Services (David MacBrayne Group)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I congratulate Stuart McMillan on securing the debate, which is particularly timely given today&#8217;s publication of the Transport Select Committee&#8217;s report on its inquiry into the coastguard proposals and other marine safety issues.

Bus subsidy is also provided as the bus service operators grant, which is paid directly to bus operators. The BSOG benefits passengers by helping operators to keep their fares down, by enabling operators to run services that are less commercially viable and by supporting the bus network. From April 2010, we removed the link to fuel duty through the BSOG and introduced incentives for operators to run low-carbon vehicles to help in achieving our climate change targets. That is something that we can further address if the fuel stabiliser that was agreed by the Scottish Parliament is eventually adopted at Westminster. In 2010-11, &#163;66.5 million is available for mileage run, which was agreed with the CPT on the understanding that operators would seek to minimise reductions in mileage.</p><p>Charlie Gordon also mentioned the Scottish green bus fund, which was promoted by the likes of Michael Matheson long before the Labour Party jumped on to that particular bus. The Government launched the Scottish green bus fund in July 2010 to encourage the purchase of low-carbon vehicles. The scheme funds the difference in cost between a low-carbon vehicle and a diesel equivalent. The fund of &#163;4.4 million will enable 48 vehicles to be ordered for Scottish services throughout the country. Low-carbon vehicles allow growth in patronage to be increasingly favourable due to the reduction in emissions per passenger. The fund also enables economies of scale to apply to bus manufacturing, thereby enabling increasing numbers of low-carbon vehicles to operate in Scotland.</p><p>In addition, we have sought to address the increasing problem of poor air quality in our cities by making available funding to retrofit particulate traps on buses. I am delighted to announce that, in this financial year, both Glasgow and Edinburgh will benefit from funding to the tune of &#163;524,000. That will allow their citizens to benefit from improved air quality as the retrofitting is carried out on city centre bus services.</p><p>I have mentioned fuel costs. The steep increases that we have seen recently threaten the economy and disproportionately penalise rural areas. For that reason, the Scottish Government calls for the Westminster Government to introduce a fuel duty regulator to mitigate the effect on prices, on individuals and on the wider economy. I do not think that it is possible for Labour members to hide their recent shameful abstention on the issue in trying to portray themselves as champions for bus passengers. A large part of the cost of running buses is fuel duty and the Parliament has voted in favour of a fuel duty stabiliser, a derogation for rural areas and the forgoing of Labour&#8217;s proposed increase in fuel duty this year in order to benefit passengers.</p><p>Buses provide the sustainable mass public transport that is necessary to support economic growth while minimising the impact of transport on the environment&#8212;we must try to strike a balance. Given the suite of policy initiatives that the Government has taken, we can at least accept that we have sought to achieve that balance; however, we must always re-examine, at different stages, whether the balance that has been struck is the right one, and we should commit to doing that. Central to our policy has been the view that the bus has an important role to play in achieving modal shift, which is the major deliverable in helping to achieve our climate change targets.</p><p>As we have demonstrated, the Scottish Government provides significant funding to the industry, which, as I have outlined, will increasingly incentivise investment in developing a modern vehicle fleet and reducing its environmental impact. We have provided detailed guidance on essential policy tools for operators and local authorities. I submit that those tools are sufficient to address the needs of local authority provision of bus services and that there is no requirement for further regulation. However, there is a need for transport to be given its appropriate priority and for partnership working across local authorities and with bus operators to achieve transport aims.</p><p>Given its flexibility, efficiency and accessibility, the bus is an essential part of our community, our economy and our future. I encourage all those who are involved across the public and private sectors to work together to seize the potential of a positive future for buses.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-8177.1, to leave out from &#8220;believes&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;notes the Labour proposals for regulation of bus services; recognises the important role that bus services provide to communities across Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s investment of almost &#163;250 million in the bus network, including funding for the national concessionary travel scheme, the Bus Service Operators Grant, which supports the bus network, investment of &#163;4.4 million in the Scottish Green Bus Fund and over &#163;500,000 in retrofitting particulate traps in buses that help reduce costs, and calls for more practical support for passengers and bus companies including the introduction of a fuel duty regulator, as agreed by the Parliament on 2 March 2011, which would be of genuine help to bus users, reducing costs, unlike Labour proposals on VAT, which can be reclaimed and would make no difference to bus companies or users.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is on record.

The principle that we would apply would be taken further, so that the windfall revenues for fuel duty could be the basis on which a rebate&#8212;or a reduction in the costs as applied to motorists&#8212;could be given. Obviously more detailed work can be done on that, but it would be done by the Treasury, which is responsible for collecting those revenues.</p><p>High fuel costs are a particular concern in our remote and island communities. In some rural areas, petrol and diesel prices are up to 25p a litre higher than the national average. With fewer opportunities to use public transport, that imposes a significant cost on residents and businesses. As has been said in previous debates, the car is very often an absolute necessity and not a luxury in such communities.</p><p>The Scottish Government has introduced a range of measures specifically to help rural communities. In particular, we are investing record amounts to support ferry services, which allows operators to keep prices at half the levels that they would be in the absence of subsidies. Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise continue to provide assistance to proprietors of rural filling stations with the capital costs of upgrading their facilities.</p><p>However, the disparity in fuel prices between Scotland&#8217;s remote and island communities and the rest of the country remains a key concern. The Scottish Government is clear that that issue can best be addressed through a rural fuel derogation, which would reduce the rate of duty on fuel that is sold in certain rural communities in order to offset the higher distribution costs in those areas. Similar proposals have previously received cross-party support in this Parliament, and have been successfully implemented in France, Portugal and Greece.</p><p>The Scottish Government made numerous representations to the previous UK Government to introduce such a scheme, but unfortunately those were all rejected. The current UK Government has been more receptive to the proposals&#8212;indeed, introducing a rural fuel derogation was a key element of its programme for Government, which is to be welcomed.</p><p>However, rural fuel prices have continued to rise since last summer, but the UK Government has as yet taken no action. I understand that it has yet to even apply to the European Commission for the necessary derogation to implement the scheme, although I am happy to be corrected by other members if that is not an accurate description of the position.</p><p>The UK Government&#8217;s lack of action so far reinforces my belief that it has yet to grasp the impact that rising fuel prices are having on Scotland&#8217;s economy. There is a need for immediate action. I have, for my part, outlined a raft of policy interventions that could help households throughout Scotland right now if this Government had the power to implement them. We would start, of course, by scrapping the increase in fuel duty that is planned for next month.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that next month&#8217;s increase&#8212;or rather, later this month&#8217;s increase, if it is agreed at the budget and implemented in April&#8212;is not the last: further increases were planned under the previous Government for 2012 and 2013. If the chancellor can cancel those increases, it would undoubtedly benefit households and businesses throughout Scotland.</p><p>I hope that Parliament will unite in calling on the UK Government to take immediate action to tackle that issue&#8212;indeed, I plead for unanimity on the matter.</p><p>If we can, I believe that the Parliament talking with a united voice, in concert with the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly, will be a powerful advocate for making the changes that we seek from the UK Government. I ask that no one tries to seek splendid isolation on this and that we work together&#8212;we have tried to compromise on what we have put forward to see whether we can reach a common position.</p><p>This issue clearly highlights the urgent need for Scotland to be granted full financial responsibility and control of our fuel duty and oil revenues, so that we can take the right decisions for the people and businesses of Scotland.

The on-going council tax freeze has been mentioned, but the abolition of prescription charges is also important. The small business bonus is also important to people. It eliminated the business rate burden on 74,000 properties. Those measures make a real difference to Scottish households and businesses.</p><p>We would be delighted if we had the tax levers to address the high fuel prices directly but, sadly for us, that remains the responsibility of the UK Government. Perhaps the Scotland Bill Committee might consider that in greater detail in its deliberations.</p><p>Ministers have repeatedly called on the UK Government to take immediate action to address the high petrol and diesel prices that motorists face. We have put forward genuinely constructive and workable solutions, which have been described in the chamber today. I am pleased that it seems like our calls for action are about to be addressed. The chancellor has committed to addressing the issue in this month&#8217;s budget. It is now vital that he follows through on the assurance that he provided and delivers real support for Scottish motorists. The most crucial part of that is the postponement of the rise in duty that is planned for April, which would have a better effect than Labour&#8217;s proposed VAT reversal. It would have a bigger effect because of the size of the increase. When the UK Government considers that, it is extremely important that it also takes into account the representations that are made by the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. The UK Government can take that step immediately, but it would be useful if it could also make a statement on future rises that Labour scheduled in previous years. That would not alleviate the difficulties that current pump prices cause motorists, but it would ensure that the UK Government does not make matters worse with further tax rises.</p><p>The VAT reversal for which the Labour Party argues does not prevent massively increased tax revenues from fuel. That is one of the main reasons why it would not have the same effect as the measures that we propose.</p><p>Some people have argued that cutting fuel duty is unaffordable when Government borrowing is so high. The deterioration of the UK public finances under the previous Government must be taken into account, but the simple fact is that the regulator is a hugely beneficial measure for the entire economy. If we can take off the brake of people not being able to distribute, deliver and receive goods in the most cost-efficient way, we can help the economy.</p><p>As my colleague Stewart Stevenson mentioned, there is a massive windfall to the UK Treasury through fuel duty.

Given members' arguments, I see the freight facilities grants scheme as a far higher priority than, for example, spending &#163;500 million on the tram scheme in Edinburgh. It is a question of the priorities that we want to advance. I say that because the FFG scheme has without question played an important part in moving freight from road to rail and water by funding new freight facilities. As many members said, it has led to a reduction of millions of lorry miles in the past 10 years.</p><p>I join Cathy Jamieson and others in celebrating its success in delivering environmental benefits across Scotland. Many of the FFG-funded facilities will continue to remove lorries from Scotland's roads for years to come. On Richard Simpson's point, I confirm that the resource element will continue, so traffic that has been taken off the roads will not revert back on to them.</p><p>Like other members, we are clear about the FFG scheme's positive environmental impact. That is why its budget has totalled more than &#163;40 million since 2007. During that time we have made FFG awards to seven projects. It would repay the members who are most interested, among whom I certainly include Charlie Gordon, to look at the history of the projects. Many projects that are talked about for many years do not come to <place-holder colnum=\"32290\"/> fruition. The business case is sometimes not presented and, in some cases, an award is made that is not subsequently taken up. It is worth having a look at that information, which might go some way towards explaining the response that Charlie Gordon received at the committee from John Swinney on the take-up of grants so far.</p><p>The projects that have been successful include the daily Eddie Stobart-Tesco rail service to Inverness, which takes more than 270 lorry journeys off the A9 each week, and the innovative JST floating pier, which enables timber to be transported to sawmills by sea.</p><p>The nub of the situation is the UK Government's decision to cut the Scottish Government's budget by &#163;1.3 billion in 2011-12. Whichever party members represent, they must agree that there is no question but that that presents a real financial challenge&#8212;a challenge that is without precedent since devolution. On top of that is the reduction of &#163;800 million in the capital budget, which was hit particularly hard.</p><p>Members have said, with some justification, that, in the global scheme of those reductions of &#163;800 million and &#163;1.3 billion, the figures that we are talking about for the FFG scheme are small. However, we have to get the smaller figures to add up to achieve the huge cut. As Karen Whitefield said, we are in Scotland and we have to talk about Scotland. However, the money that we get comes from Westminster.</p><p>It is interesting to draw a comparison, because the Labour Party in England did not have the same scheme when it was in government. I think that the Labour Government in England spent &#163;8 million on such grants over five years, whereas we have spent &#163;40 million over a slightly shorter period.

An issue that is important to the people of Scotland should be important to us.</p><p>I start by thanking the various groups of people that some members have mentioned and which form the focus of John Swinney's amendment. Last night, I had the chance to see some of their efforts up close. I am referring especially to night gritters, who sat for many hours waiting to go out at the appropriate time, police officers and the many people behind desks who do a tremendous job. It was apparent that genuine effort was being made across a number of agencies and communities, whose role has been mentioned. I think that it was a Labour member who made the point that the issue should be about people. That is true, and that idea informs our amendment.</p><p>I will try to deal with as many of the points that have been made as possible. I do not think that I will get through them all, but I will be happy to talk to any individual member who wants to pursue a point that I cannot mention.</p><p>First, I highlight the fact that some members have taken a fundamental view of some of the issues that have affected us, and I have tried to take those issues into account. I enjoyed Bill Kidd's speech, although some members did not seem to. It was an interesting exposition of long-term and profound changes in weather conditions. I, like many other members, was not aware of the term \"Arctic oscillation\". He made important points about Paris, Poland, Canada and Finland experiencing dramatically different conditions in <place-holder colnum=\"31684\"/> recent days. Charles de Gaulle airport and the Eiffel tower were closed, which raises the question whether France's reputation should be damaged. Some people think that we in Scotland like to beat ourselves up; there is no need for us to do that when we have Jeremy Purvis around.</p><p>We have tried to take immediate measures. Improved communications are at the heart of the six-point plan that we mentioned. Andy Kerr talked about the involvement of local government in that six-point plan&#8212;it was discussed in the presence of representatives from COSLA, SCOTS and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers. Andy Kerr was right that there was not a great deal of time to consult, and action had to be taken quickly, but the plan was discussed with those bodies, and we can have further discussions as necessary.</p><p>Some of the measures that have been mentioned by individual members are, as the cabinet secretary made clear, being considered, and others that have been mentioned will be examined. One of those is the point that is made in the Labour motion about planning exercises. Charlie Gordon mentioned that when we met on Monday morning. I do not know whether we are thinking about the same thing, but I envisage local authorities and all the agencies undertaking contingency planning from time to time when they are not under stress. We should look at doing that on a Scotland-wide basis or in an appropriate location in Scotland.</p><p>Johann Lamont said that Nicola Sturgeon was not involved. I have attended four daily meetings since I got this job and Nicola Sturgeon has been at every single one to report on the efforts of the health service, which have been tremendous. Some of the figures that could be given out show how it has continued, almost without interruption in many cases. It has done a tremendous job and Nicola Sturgeon has been involved right the way through the process.</p><p>Karen Whitefield mentioned the traffic Scotland website. As Alex Johnstone said, the pressure on some of those websites can be phenomenal. On 5 December, that website received 1.1 million hits. On 6 December, there were 21.6 million hits on it. It is not always possible to plan for that, although now that it has happened, we should do exactly that.</p><p>Heating fuel provision has been mentioned by several members. There is an extent to which we have to act: there is no question but that we must ensure that we can help with supplies. However, there is a question about the vehicles that some of the companies are using not being able to access some rural locations with large tankers. We have raised that issue. It is also true that the demand for heating oil increased during the cold spell. Fuel <place-holder colnum=\"31685\"/> distributors are working well to resolve specific problems. The cabinet secretary mentioned the current extension to drivers' working hours and the rights and derogations that we have achieved. Grangemouth is ramping up its operation, and I understand that it had a further delivery today. We are mindful of the points that members have made and we will take them to today's meeting of the Scottish Government resilience room.</p><p>Pauline McNeill and other members mentioned ScotRail. On the point that Pauline McNeill made about information getting to members, I will ask Transport Scotland to ensure that every member is given a briefing as far as possible about the various things that it is doing so that members are better informed. If something is not covered in that briefing, members can come back to me.</p><p>Mary Scanlon mentioned that there were temperatures of -19&#176;C. In my area, which is a lot further south than hers, it was -15&#176;C for a number of days. I have never seen that before. Temperatures below -10&#176;C have a profound effect on ScotRail's rolling stock. It is not easy to remedy that quickly because of the money that would have to be spent. I mention that as just one of the reasons why some of the services have been disrupted.</p><p>I have tried to work constructively with members and I will continue to do so. For example, as the cabinet secretary said, we will accept Labour's motion. We have demonstrated that we are willing to listen, and to look at constructive suggestions, such as that about planning exercises. As the cabinet secretary said, Jackson Carlaw's suggestion has been discussed. It is not quite as straightforward as it may appear&#8212;I am sure that it will not surprise him to hear that&#8212;but it has been discussed because it seems attractive on the face of it. We will try to work through the problems, but the end result will be to have a much clearer definition and a more commonly accepted and understood set of warnings that people can know the integrity of.</p><p>Mary Scanlon mentioned HGVs. Let me say that the intention is to stack HGVs&#8212;to put them to one side&#8212;when we have to get a gritter or snowplough on to a trunk road to clear it. There was a concern that they would be disadvantaged compared with general traffic, which could just go on its way. That is not the intention. The intention is to stack the vehicles so that we can get in for a short time to grit or plough a road. That means that where we can do that&#8212;I appreciate that we cannot do it everywhere&#8212;there should not be the problem that she mentioned in relation to livestock.</p><p>Finally, despite my natural inclination to be constructive, I must mention Jeremy Purvis's amendment, which is a step too far. As is always the case, there 50 words when one will do and <place-holder colnum=\"31686\"/> there is no group of words that includes anything like \"suggest\", \"collaborate\", \"measured\" or \"balanced\". It is merely a never-ending stream of verbose negativity&#8212;not so much a Jeremy as a Jeremiah. He misses the mood of today's debate and, when we come to decision time, I hope that the Labour motion is accepted along with the Conservative amendment and the amendment lodged by John Swinney, but that we reject Jeremy Purvis's amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145235", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is right that we have such a debate when everyone in Scotland is talking about the weather and its effects.

It would have been better if more members had been in the chamber. As many members have, I record my thanks and admiration for the work that my good friend and colleague Stewart Stevenson undertook. If the bill is passed today, it will be due to recognition of, and will be a worthy testament to, his drive, enthusiasm and dedication to the project. His involvement and leadership in delivering the project from development to design and through the bill process were considerable. I am sure that all members acknowledge his substantial contribution.</p><p>There is general consensus on the bill albeit, sadly, with one or two notable exceptions. I thank Parliament greatly for its interest and support. This is a proud day for Stewart Stevenson&#8212;it should be&#8212;for the Parliament and, most important, for Scotland. This is the day when Scotland commits to a world-class structure across the Forth. As a couple of members have mentioned, we will have three bridges&#8212;three iconic designs made over three centuries&#8212;in one splendid Scottish setting. This is not only about structures. Beautiful though they are, such structures are merely a means to an end in which our purpose is, of course, to secure our future economic and social wellbeing, thereby providing an inclusive and economically vibrant Scotland.</p><p>A number of points were raised in the debate and I will try to address them. In his summing up, Charlie Gordon referred to the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth as being \"enervated\". I have never seen John Swinney enervated. I have seen him energised perhaps, but I have to say that: he is my boss. Charlie Gordon made a number of interesting points, to which I will come back. He also touched on points that members who spoke before him had made, not least of which were Jim Tolson's points on the Halbeath junction and Rosyth. The Halbeath commitment remains in place and there will be further discussion on the matter with Fife Council. We cannot put a price on the works until we have <place-holder colnum=\"31608\"/> had that discussion. I cannot say just now whether we can commit to Rosyth. We do not yet have sufficient details from the council on that, but I am content to explore the option, while being mindful at all times of funding constraints. We will explore the option as best we can as things go on.</p><p>I say to Mary Mulligan that we are providing a link from the new bridge to the M9, using the existing asset of the M9 link. I remind her that we are making improvements to traffic management in Newton: we will sign traffic from the M9 through to Newton. I mentioned earlier the funding commitment that we will make.</p><p>I say to Dave Stewart that we are confident that we will be able to sign the contract in April; we are very confident on that and we want to do it because we can then commence work in the summertime. David Stewart also asked about EU funding applications. We have done that but, unfortunately, we were unsuccessful. He also made a point on regular updates to committees. I will continue the commitment that Stewart Stevenson gave previously; Dave Stewart will be aware of the updates that Stewart Stevenson has already given. We will provide six-monthly updates.</p><p>Dave Stewart also spoke of his concern about the two consortia that are bidding for the project. My view is that there is very little likelihood that either would like to withdraw, given how much they have already put into the process that&#8212;of course&#8212;started quite some time ago. He also made a reasonable point on the adopt an apprentice programme. That issue is one for my colleague Angela Constance, who has the skills remit. We continued the programme this year, but whether it will continue in the future depends on budget constraints. I will ensure that my colleague takes up the point.</p><p>A number of members made the point to Patrick Harvie that the real risk is that, if we were to wait until we had checked the cabling&#8212;which will happen in 2012&#8212;and the results were wrong, we would not have enough time to build the new bridge.

Our manifesto therefore committed us to a replacement Forth crossing, and we took action.</p><p>In 2007, we developed our proposal. In 2008, we confirmed retention of the Forth road bridge as part of a public transport corridor. In 2009, we introduced the Forth Crossing Bill, which, this year, has been subject to detailed public and parliamentary scrutiny. The bill withstood that examination. In 2011, we will build. In only four years we have gone from initiation to construction. The Government recognises the issues. We have acted quickly, and we have delivered.</p><p>Like other members, I never forget that we are making legislation for and on behalf of the people of Scotland. Accordingly, we must engage with those who will be directly affected by it, and we have done so. We have listened, and we have reflected. As the committee graciously acknowledged in its report, we have made a host of significant, positive changes. They include changes to improve design, changes to improve mitigation and changes to improve monitoring, reporting and community engagement.</p><p>The hybrid bill procedures, which were applied here for the first time, present undoubted challenges, particularly for objectors. Substantial periods of time have been given to investigating complex matters, some of which are deeply sensitive for individuals. I am sure that we can all learn lessons from the process. However, the process has been thorough and exacting.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge the contribution of those who have shaped the bill and its associated code of construction practice. Although I will mention him again in my summing-up speech, I mention first the efforts and diligence of Stewart Stevenson in getting us to this stage. I also thank publicly the many individuals, community councils, local authorities, businesses and associations that have actively engaged in the process. We might not always have agreed, but their contributions and advice were much appreciated, and our proposals are better for that engagement.<place-holder colnum=\"31585\"/></p><p>It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the people within the Parliament who have done a lot of hard work to improve the bill, including the Finance Committee, the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee, for their considered analysis. I also acknowledge the leading roles of Mary Mulligan and Margaret Smith in representing their constituents in Newton and South Queensferry. I am sure that the Parliament will join me in paying tribute to the skill and rigour of the Forth Crossing Bill Committee, expertly led by Jackson Carlaw, in scrutinising the bill.</p><p>This is a good bill. Together with the associated code of construction practice, the bill is the better for the exacting scrutiny to which it has been subject. The code sets out precisely how the contractor should undertake the works, and it enables full scrutiny and transparency of actions. In so doing, it rightly provides the highest possible levels of protection for the public.</p><p>The construction task itself will be huge. It will be, as has been said many times in the media, the biggest single project in Scotland for a generation. The bridge construction will take between five and six years, and our code of construction practice addresses mitigation measures to minimise disturbance over that period. We are also investing in public transport measures. We will implement bus hard shoulder running on stretches of the M90 and M9, and we are working with Fife Council to deliver Halbeath park and ride. Those and other measures will assist traffic flows during the construction phase and beyond.</p><p>We will set very high standards in the provision of information. I can confirm that we will establish a contact and education centre at the current offices of the Forth Estuary Transport Authority at South Queensferry, which will be a focus for interested individuals. We are providing accessible engagement and information, because information and providing public protection will be at the heart of this vital project.</p><p>The bill is absolutely necessary.

We have worked closely with the City of Edinburgh Council, West Lothian Council and Fife Council to develop an appropriate noise control regime. The aim is to have in place a regime that will meet the national objectives of having the project built on time and on budget; will allow independent oversight of construction by the local authorities; and, perhaps most significantly, will provide safeguards for members of the public. That regime is now incorporated within the code of construction practice.</p><p>Members who have followed the bill's progress will note that the issue of noise was subjected to detailed scrutiny at stage 2. The assessor, Professor Begg, sat for 11 days during which noise management was discussed extensively. The evidence included a full, comprehensive and detailed exposition by all concerned parties of the issues that Margaret Smith now wishes to be reconsidered. In his report, the assessor noted the merits of our proposals and recommended our approach to the committee, which gives full effect to the noise management process now defined; fully involves the local authorities as integral members of the noise liaison group, scrutinising the contractor's proposed construction methods before they are approved; and&#8212;this relates specifically to Margaret Smith's amendment 2&#8212;retains the ability of the local authorities and the public to have a statutory mechanism by which to challenge independently the contractor's undertaking of construction works. Also, under our proposal, the local authorities will gain an <place-holder colnum=\"31574\"/> additional statutory mechanism to ensure the implementation of the noise management processes. Let us not forget that, at stage 2, as Jackson Carlaw can attest, the committee endorsed that approach. Accordingly, the assessor and the committee&#8212;the two parties most intimately involved in consideration of the bill&#8212;supported the comprehensive proposals that we have put in place.</p><p>Our approach provides consistency across the project, which lies within three local authority areas, and provides certainty for the public. It also provides a significant benefit to the management of risk and the price of the contract, as it will provide the contractor with the knowledge that his or her operations will be disrupted only if he or she operates outwith the framework of the code of construction practice. That code has been amended to reflect local authority concerns. I confirm that we are not removing local authority powers to take independent actions afforded in the Control of Pollution Act 1974. Both the councils and the public will retain a statutory mechanism by which to challenge independently the contractor's undertaking of construction works. The councils will also have an enhanced role through the code of construction practice.</p><p>I do not believe that the amendments have wholesale support from local authorities. I remind Margaret Smith that Fife Council did not object to any of the proposals during the parliamentary process and that West Lothian Council stated, on 13 September, at the assessor hearing:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"As the Transport Scotland team has correctly pointed out, what it is proposing in the code of construction practice is better than what exists purely under the 1974 act. That is what we as the local authority would expect on a project of this size.\"</p><p>Margaret Smith seeks to overturn the process within the code of construction practice that has taken more than a year to achieve; to overturn the consistency that will apply across all three local authorities for controlling noise and vibration; to overturn the findings of the assessor; and to overturn the considered views of the committee. Having overturned those things, she wishes to introduce significant risks and uncertainties. Surely, the introduction of risk and uncertainty cannot be the considered view of the Parliament. I strongly urge Margaret Smith to withdraw her amendments. If she does not withdraw them, I urge all members to resist these amendments, the consequences of which will fall on a future Administration.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21142706", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Crossing Bill: Stage 3: Section 70 &#8212; Control of noise: Control of Pollution Act 1974"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "These amendments reopen matters that were previously determined at stage 2.

In the past year, through sportscotland, we have provided significant support for sports clubs across the country, most markedly in South Lanarkshire.</p><p>We will wish to recognise the contribution of the sports alliance and its constituent bodies&#8212;the Scottish Sports Association, the Scottish Association of Local Sports Councils, and Scottish Universities Sport. The Minister for Public Health and Sport cannot be here today as she is in Delhi, but she meets members of the alliance regularly.</p><p>The Scottish Government echoes the sentiments that have been brought out in the motion and in some of the speeches this evening. Sport can make a significant contribution to Scottish society and, as a number of members have said, it can benefit our physical and mental wellbeing.</p><p>We recognise that we do not do enough as a nation. It is therefore essential that we increase our levels of physical activity, which in turn will help us to combat a range of illnesses&#8212;Nanette Milne mentioned some&#8212;and shake off our record of being a nation in poor health.<place-holder colnum=\"29539\"/></p><p>As Ross Finnie said, we love our sport, but we need to do more than just watch it from the sofa or the terraces. As well as helping us to become healthier, sport can bring significant economic benefit. That is particularly true when it comes to big events&#8212;notwithstanding the points that Margo MacDonald rightly made about the costs. She was also right to suggest that some countries that seek to hold such big events perhaps now feel themselves priced out of them, given the costs that can go with them. However, the Commonwealth games in 2014 will deliver an estimated net economic benefit of about &#163;81 million at the Scottish level, with an estimated 1,200 net jobs, 1,000 of which will be in Glasgow.</p><p>The Ryder cup at Gleneagles, which will take place shortly afterwards, is expected to benefit the Scottish economy by &#163;100 million&#8212;that is what it says in my notes, but I have recently seen an estimate that puts the figure at around &#163;150 million&#8212;in the week of the event alone.</p><p>Tackling antisocial behaviour is another area in which sport can play its part, as James Kelly said. We fund that through, among other things, the Government's cashback for communities programme. Funding is being provided from the proceeds of crime fund to a range of sports bodies, such as the Scottish Football Association and Scottish Rugby, to offer our young people the chance to keep fit and try new activities, in the hope that that will change attitudes and behaviours and, in turn, make our communities safer.</p><p>We must remember, as several members have said, that sport is meant to be fun. At the top level, athletes earn huge sums, but for the vast majority of people sport should be about having fun and enjoying themselves. Some members mentioned the prospect of cuts and the impact that that might have on sport. It is somewhat ironic that we are discussing that possibility when it is possible for some players at the peak of their sport to collect &#163;200,000 a week for playing football. I am not saying that that is all that they do, but it marks the difference between the scale of private funding and what Governments can expect to spend.</p><p>I say to Margo MacDonald that it is true that New Zealand has hosted the rugby world cup at least once, and I think that it is to host the next rugby world cup. In addition, it is interesting to see a small country such as the Falkland Islands competing at the current Commonwealth games. It is taking part in the badminton competition, despite having only one club with 40 members.</p><p>By its nature, sport is competitive. As we have seen from the performances, that is at the very heart of sport. Whether it is winning a kick-about with mates or winning a championship final, sporting success makes people feel good about <place-holder colnum=\"29540\"/> themselves. I am sure that the whole nation was delighted to see Colin Montgomerie lift the Ryder cup on Monday after leading the European team to victory at Celtic Manor and to watch Robbie Renwick taking gold in the pool on Tuesday. I was lucky enough to get down to one of the days of the Ryder cup&#8212;fortunately, it was the day when the scoreboard was almost entirely blue. The day after, we managed to go on to win the cup. It was phenomenal to see the level of interest in the event. Listening to \"Flower of Scotland\" being played as Robbie Renwick received his gold medal made us all feel extremely proud&#8212;it had echoes of Liz Lynch's victories, as was mentioned.</p><p>Although sport is competitive, it is about more than winning. It is about what we can bring to individuals and communities alike. Not everyone will have the talent or the belief to win major events, but they should have the opportunity to have that ambition.</p><p>It is important to remember that even the physical infrastructure can have a legacy that is not physical. I have lived through two Commonwealth games in Edinburgh, the first of which was when the Royal Commonwealth pool and Meadowbank stadium were built. After the games, it was inspiring for those of us who lived in Edinburgh to be able to use the same pool that the athletes had used. Like Willie Coffey, I had the chance to run the five Edinburgh marathons in the 1980s, each one of which finished on the tartan track in Meadowbank stadium. Although most of the race involved running around the back streets and the foreshore of Edinburgh, it was highly inspirational to come into the stadium, where the international athletes had been, for the end of the race. The physical infrastructure can have an important legacy.</p><p>As has been said, it all starts at the grass roots. It is essential that we have the appropriate infrastructure&#8212;I am talking about people as well as buildings&#8212;that will allow everyone to develop their basic skills at an early age and have the opportunity to try a wide range of sports and get the right coaching in a facility that is fit for purpose. In that regard, I take Hugh Henry's point. Some of the early public-private partnership buildings were not open to the community at night, and I commend local authorities such as Glasgow City Council, which bought out the contract so that everyone in Glasgow could use all the facilities that were part of the original PPP programme.</p><p>Now that the Commonwealth games are under way, many of us have been glued to our seats watching top athletes compete. Such events have the ability to inspire and encourage others to do that little bit extra. We must capture that interest and enthusiasm if we are to have health at the heart of our legacy plan, and our clear aim is to <place-holder colnum=\"29541\"/> create an active nation. Ross Finnie's point about the lack of success of countries that have hosted events such as Commonwealth games was well made. To return to the Ryder cup, the club golf programme, which was born out of our bid to host that event, has been extremely successful in introducing thousands of young people to golf and it will have long-term benefits.</p><p>It has been mentioned that local grass-roots clubs can be a focal point for bringing communities together. Those clubs need to be supported and helped to thrive, and that support will be provided through the community sports hubs.<place-holder colnum=\"29542\"/></p><p>We should all enjoy and celebrate the Commonwealth games, but we should also recognise that we should not measure success just by the performances of the few; rather, we should measure it by the efforts of the many. We should use the games as an opportunity for Scotland to become a healthier and fitter nation.<place-holder time=\"17:55:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:55.</em></p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21007025", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate James Kelly on securing the debate, and I echo the point that this is a very good time for it, given that the Commonwealth games in Delhi are in full swing.

In its report, as others have mentioned, UKCES recommended the better integration of employment and skills services. In August, we completed a national roll-out of integrated employment and skills services, which has made it easier for people to access training, careers and employment services, thereby helping them to get back into work more quickly.<place-holder colnum=\"29507\"/></p><p>David Whitton made a point about volunteering, which was mentioned as part of the summer leavers skills strategy that was launched recently&#8212;yesterday, I think&#8212;with ProjectScotland, which was discussed by Jim Hume. It is too early to give figures on that, but we will produce such figures.</p><p>More generally, Margaret Smith asked about the outcomes from the summer leavers package. It is a bit too early to provide meaningful figures on that. We are getting some information through, mainly from schools and colleges, but we are in a position to make progress in collecting those data, and we will provide that information as soon as we have it. It is fair to say from what we have seen already that work in some areas has been more effective than work in others, as is to be expected. We must look extremely hard at how we can make progress with looked-after children&#8212;to which I will return shortly, when I respond to Jeremy Purvis's point&#8212;which is an extremely difficult area. I point out that the figures that he mentioned have been bad for a very long time. That is not because Governments have not tried to do something about the issue; it is something to do with the nature of the problem, which we are trying hard to address.</p><p>Christina McKelvie raised gender issues. I accept that we still seem to have a cultural apartheid, with girls doing hairdressing and boys doing motor vehicle training. Although that still seems to exist, huge progress has been made in the last year or so as regards the number of women who are taking up apprenticeships. There has been a huge shift. Unfortunately, the process still seems to run along particular tramlines, as Christina McKelvie mentioned. We have impressed on our partners the need to address the issue and have had discussions with the trade unions, which are also extremely concerned about it.</p><p>We can use marketing initiatives and any other tools that we have to get across the idea that in some industries into which we cannot get women to go, particularly the industries involving construction skills, we must try to effect a culture change. That will not happen quickly. In addition, I was told last week by a representative of JP Morgan that in Glasgow, for example, it is extremely difficult to get women coming through as computer engineers from university IT courses and that the industry is crying out for people.</p><p>On trade union learning, Karen Whitefield made a point about European social fund funding. I responded by saying that the Government has contributed substantially more to trade union learning than previous Governments. She asked whether that is sustainable. I mention the European funding because the extra money that <place-holder colnum=\"29508\"/> we have given to trade unions to encourage more trade union-based learning has allowed them to access additional moneys from the ESF. Even if all the ESF moneys were taken away, there would still be more money going towards that. We must look at the budgets that are coming up soon before we can make further commitments, but we are engaged in discussions with the trade unions on the matter.</p><p>Tricia Marwick and other members spoke about trying to anticipate the skills that we need for the future and recognising the immediate need for skills. I would not want to underplay the difficulty of anticipating the skills that will be required. I discussed that matter earlier with David Whitton. The renewables industry, for example, will need many traditional skills and it takes a fair bit of thought to anticipate what skillset we will need and to develop courses that will provide the proper mix of skills. I agree with Tricia Marwick. People who have trained in traditional industries such as plumbing and electrical engineering or have trained to become electricians may not have a job at the moment, but they may be retrained more easily than others in multiskilled positions. That would help us with the expected high demand for their skills in the renewables boom that is coming our way.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006955", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy (Refresh)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not think that I agree with that statement, but the point that I was making was that we recognise that there is a need for change, partly because of what we expect to come from Westminster and partly because of what we require from the careers service.

He asked for a couple of examples of Government engagement with employers, which I gave him. I was unable to give him an exhaustive list of how we engage with employers, because we do that in many ways and it would take me a long time to go through the whole list.</p><p>One example that I gave was of the summer leavers package. To make sure that that hotline was established by employers we engaged all the employers organisations, including the small business organisations.

The amendment, and the way in which David Whitton in particular has engaged on the matter, show an understanding of the gravity of the situation that we face.

I accept that Liz Smith has differences with some of our suggestions, but she proposed positive measures to try to improve things, although I do not necessarily agree with them.</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the Liberal Democrat amendment, which is carping, pointless and negative. The Liberal Democrats' approach is consistent with the approach that they took the last time we had a skills strategy debate. Margaret Smith's amendment should be contrasted with the comments of, for example, Alison Hay, who is a Convention of Scottish Local Authorities Liberal Democrat. She fully supports the skills strategy and thinks that it will be an important addition to how we deal with skills in Scotland.

The Government is now setting out a flexible package of skills support. We all agree on the importance of modern apprenticeships. It is vital that the programme continues to provide people with the opportunity to gain the skills, training and experience that are needed to find sustained employment. It must also continue to provide businesses with the expertise that will help to drive future success.</p><p>Last year, more than 20,000 people started modern apprenticeships in Scotland&#8212;that is up by more than 90 per cent on starts in the previous year. The proportion of female starts also increased significantly, but work has still to be done to increase women's participation and achievement in a number of sectors, including information and communications technology. People in the ICT industry and in the banking industry have told me that they are keen for far more female graduates with an ICT background to come to them.<place-holder colnum=\"29472\"/></p><p>We will continue to promote accessibility and diversity in the modern apprenticeships programme and throughout other learning environments. This year, Skills Development Scotland has been set the target of delivering 20,000 modern apprenticeship starts and more than 40,000 training places in total. That figure includes 14,500 training places to help to support the unemployed to enter the labour market.</p><p>This year, SDS is also providing 5,000 flexible training opportunities that are designed to meet small employers' skills needs. During my visit to Gems Engineering Ltd in Glasgow on Tuesday, I saw at first hand the benefits of that flexible scheme, which is helping employers to enhance the skills of their staff and to bring real benefits to their businesses through improved productivity and a stronger and more confident workforce. As we move forward, we will continually seek to develop innovative models of skills support to encourage greater employer investment in skills.</p><p>The strategy also recognises the need for a flexible and responsive skills approach to new and emerging economic opportunities, including those in the low-carbon economy. The start of a new wind turbine modern apprenticeship framework at Carnegie College is an example of that.</p><p>In January, we agreed that the skills strategy should provide the support and opportunity for young people, including those who are traditionally the hardest to reach, to be successful. The threats from rising youth unemployment are clear. Since the start of the downturn, the Government has guarded against those threats.</p><p>In June, I announced a substantial programme of support for the large number of summer leavers from schools and colleges. It included a minimum of 800 targeted pathways opportunities; a new SDS one-stop shop providing guidance to employers on offering young people a chance to get started in the labour market; and a &#163;1,000 incentive for employers recruiting a young apprentice who faces additional barriers that restrict their ability to participate. Those opportunities will be available throughout this financial year and will complement other support for young people, including the universal delivery of 16-plus learning choices and record investment in universities and colleges to provide more and better learning opportunities.</p><p>Since the summer, we have been working hard to help school leavers to secure a place in learning or training. We have also tasked ProjectScotland with working with SDS and partners in the voluntary sector to target volunteering opportunities at the summer leavers who are yet to secure positive destinations. Many young people have successfully taken up places in college or <place-holder colnum=\"29473\"/> training; it is the right time to target volunteering places at those who are still in need.</p><p>I flag up the importance of the curriculum for excellence. We often talk about wanting our young people to be successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors. We will achieve that by ensuring that they can develop skills for learning and skills for life, as well as the skills that they need for work. We recognise that those skills can be taken forward across the curriculum and in all of the different environments in which a young person learns.</p><p>The strategy recognises the increasing number of unpaid adult carers and young carers in Scotland, who gain invaluable skills in carrying out their caring tasks. Many carers and older young carers&#8212;if I may call them that&#8212;also want to be supported to remain in employment, to access employment and to learn and gain new skills. The skills strategy and the carers and young carers strategies set out how we can help them to achieve that.</p><p>We wish to focus on employer need. This week we set out the ambition for a skills system that is driven by what the labour market most needs, rather than by what the skills system can most easily deliver. The commitments in the strategy will help to achieve that by placing greater focus on working together with employers better to understand and to assess the skills that they need to be successful, and by ensuring that the supply of skills can be responsive to those needs.</p><p>In January, we spoke about the need for an annual skills and training summit.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006955", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy (Refresh)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate comes at an important time in Scotland's economic recovery.

Instead of being bounced around a number of agencies, employers could access the available opportunities through a sole telephone line. The person on the other end of the phone was able to direct them to those opportunities without having to put them on to a different organisation, which made things easier.</p><p>Similarly, we have directed many of our new initiatives at small businesses. We recognise that it is more difficult to engage with a large number of employers. Although the strategy sets out the way in which we intend to do that, that work is not finished and there will be new measures to take it even further.<place-holder colnum=\"29474\"/></p><p>A partnership approach is vital. Annual summits offer a great opportunity to make ideas a reality. Last year, those ideas included the adopt and safeguard an apprentice schemes and the innovate with an apprentice two-for-one incentive for the life sciences sector. This year's summit helped to inform the structure and content of the strategy that we are debating today. I particularly welcome the support that was received at the summits from John Park, who is not in the chamber, and David Whitton, who is. We will continue to support that collaborative approach.</p><p>I turn to the subject of simplification. As I have just said in response to Gavin Brown, I am aware that some employers have experienced difficulties in the past when trying to engage with the skills system, which is why simplification is a priority theme of the strategy. Through it, we set out a range of initiatives that will help to ensure that the system is more coherent and accessible both for individuals and for employers.</p><p>It is a national strategy, but we recognise that local challenges are faced around the country. We would all agree that the best people to make decisions at local level are those who work at local level. The strategy sets out our intention to ensure better alignment between national agencies, community planning partnerships and local employability and economic groups. In doing that, we can ensure that services are properly targeted to match the different needs of residents and employers in local areas.</p><p>The United Kingdom Government looks set to reduce funding to the sector skills councils significantly, as part of its wider reforms to the UK Commission for Employment and Skills. Even before cuts and reform begin, there have been impacts on Scotland. Skillsmart Retail has already reduced its presence in Scotland, and Cogent and SEMTA&#8212;the sector skills council for science, engineering and manufacturing technologies&#8212;have switched responsibility for life sciences in Scotland. Both of those moves were made with no prior consultation of Scottish stakeholders. That is unacceptable, as has been made clear to the chief executive officers of the SSCs concerned.</p><p>Against the backdrop of severe funding cuts, we still expect UKCES and the SSCs to retain some responsibility for functions that are critically important for Scotland, and we will ensure that Scotland's needs and expectations are clearly articulated around delivery of those functions. If other SSCs reduce their presence in Scotland, we will not hesitate to take radical and practical steps to ensure that the voice of our employers is heard across the Scottish skills system.</p><p>The refreshed strategy is published at a time of significant challenge for the public sector. We will know more about future budgets next month, but <place-holder colnum=\"29475\"/> our priority for skills will continue to be around providing individuals with the support that they need to find sustainable and productive employment.</p><p>There is no doubt that skills and training are a point of shared commitment across the Parliament. We are all determined to get it right for the benefit of our young people as they move into the labour market for the first time, for the benefit of those who are already in the labour market and who seek to upskill and stay in work, and for the benefit of employers who are seeking to take advantage of new opportunities and to increase profits.</p><p>Today's debate offers an opportunity to reach across political boundaries and achieve consensus on the right way forward for skills at a time not just of significant challenge but of opportunity.</p><p>Members from across the Parliament have made a strong contribution to the skills debate.

However, it is also true that recession hits young people the hardest and can do them disproportionate and lasting damage&#8212;as most of us who have lived through previous recessions will be aware. Sadly, the high price that was paid because of previous Governments' failures to tackle the effects of earlier recessions on young lives is still evident.</p><p>This time, we were not prepared to accept the prospect of another lost generation. From the word go, the Scottish Government has recognised the threat, which is why we have helped to build provision that helps young people to avoid the worst effects of the downturn. So far, we have made provision for record-breaking levels of investment in higher education, further education and training provision. We have made young people a priority for the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council and for Skills Development Scotland, we have introduced 16+ learning choices, which will offer appropriate post-16 learning to all our young people and, through ScotAction, we have provided an additional &#163;16 million in 2009-10 for 7,800 apprenticeship starts and a further &#163;16 million in 2010-11 to sustain those apprentices in training. In addition, we have made a commitment to Parliament that we will do yet more to stimulate growth, including creating the right business conditions and a new skills strategy that will position Scotland for recovery.</p><p>Although youth unemployment in Scotland has increased, our record on youth unemployment is the best in the United Kingdom. Our youth unemployment is still lower&#8212;at 14 per cent&#8212;than the 17 per cent that is recorded for the rest of the UK. However, we cannot be complacent. Although we are out of recession, we know that the recovery is fragile and that job prospects remain uncertain. Throughout the downturn, we have remained vigilant and proactive. We have anticipated movements in the labour market and we have acted swiftly and decisively.<place-holder colnum=\"27476\"/></p><p>Last year, we noted that a greater number of young people stayed in learning after the summer. Of course they did; with the number of school leavers going into a job down by 7 percentage points&#8212;the largest fall since 1992&#8212;a higher proportion returned to school. Indeed, the figure was up by more than 3 percentage points. In addition, a higher proportion went into college and university&#8212;the rise there was nearly 6 percentage points. That is good, because we want young people to stay in learning because that is the best way to improve their long-term employability. It is heartening that so many young people and their parents and carers also see that value. That increase in the number who are continuing in learning is also a clear demonstration that our institutions&#8212;our schools, colleges, universities and training providers&#8212;are able to respond effectively to increased demand.</p><p>However, more returners last year means that we are likely to have more leavers this summer. We recognised the challenge that such an increase would present in the coming year. Correspondingly, we have been planning in order to ensure that the whole process is managed as effectively as possible in the interests of young people. To that end, earlier this year I established a small task force to consider how we could best respond to such a development.</p><p>First of all, we had to understand the problem that we are dealing with. Let me give members the facts, in so far as we can predict them. From the information that we have been able to cull&#8212;not least from young people themselves&#8212;we expect a relatively modest increase of about 3,000 in the number of young people leaving school and college this summer. However, the figure could be greater. As I said, we are currently relying on information about young people's stated plans, but the reality might turn out to be different as young people change their minds and circumstances change. The vast majority of those 3,000 people are school leavers, most of whom will want to remain in learning or move into training, although some will want employment.</p><p>Although we expect that there will be more leavers than usual right across Scotland, the challenges in meeting increased demand for learning will, self-evidently, be more acute in areas that have high levels of youth unemployment. From previous recessions, we know that young people who already struggle&#8212;people such as care leavers&#8212;can be doubly disadvantaged. The Government is taking swift and decisive action to deal with the pressure. We believe that we know the scale of the problem, where it will be most acute, and which young people will need most help. We also know what support young people are going to need, and what employers need to help us to help young people.<place-holder colnum=\"27477\"/></p><p>Today, I am announcing a comprehensive and affordable package of incentives and support. This will comprise 800 vocational pathway opportunities for young people. It will include an incentive of &#163;1,000 for up to 2,000 employers who take on a modern apprentice who is a care leaver, or other young person who might otherwise struggle to get such an opportunity. It will also include around &#163;400,000 for a new entrepreneurial intervention. In addition, &#163;300,000 will be made available for graduate advice, information and work placements. Crucially, there will be a brand new Skills Development Scotland employer one-stop shop called step forward Scotland. In recognition of the fact that young people have a variety of interests and ambitions, there will be around 1,000 new volunteering opportunities.</p><p>That comprehensive offer builds on and complements existing Scottish Government investment. We have made available &#163;15.3 million for 4,100 additional college places. Last week, the First Minister announced 5,000 additional all-age modern apprenticeship places, and young people will have access to those opportunities. Altogether, and notwithstanding the additional measures that we announced recently, we will produce another &#163;6.5 million in additional measures that build on the wide range of opportunities and support that is already available across Scotland.</p><p>I will be clear. We are not creating jobs; we cannot do that. We are also not guaranteeing places; no Government has ever done that and we are not doing it. Our priority is to ensure that every young person who is leaving school, college or university this summer has the support that they need for as long as they need it, so that they can move into long-term sustainable employment. Skills Development Scotland will help us to deliver that. Our intention is that absolutely no one should fall through the net. When the jobs market is tight, those who are harder to help, such as care leavers, tend to get pushed to the back of the queue, and that is not acceptable. Our focus is on all young people, but we will emphasise vulnerable groups.</p><p>The job of Government is to lead and to act decisively. We have to make our priorities clear, mobilise all the resources that are at our disposal, and ask our partners to step forward for Scotland, which is precisely what we have done and will continue to do. Over the past few months, we have spoken to many people about our hopes and fears for young people. We have spoken to employers, local authorities, colleges, the voluntary sector, trade unions and many others. In all my time in public service, I have rarely encountered such consensus on a single issue. Tackling youth unemployment must stay right at the top of the agenda.<place-holder colnum=\"27478\"/></p><p>Employers, especially smaller employers, are often pressed for time, so we need to make it as easy as possible for them to access young people who are looking for opportunities, which can produce great benefits. This afternoon, I met some young people from Edinburgh who had found employment with an Edinburgh hotel group, which had invested in them by giving them training opportunities. That is exactly the kind of activity that we want to maximise.</p><p>I am certain that everyone in the chamber this afternoon can subscribe to our view. We might debate how best to tackle youth unemployment, but we must tackle it. The package that I have announced today is specifically designed to deal with the pressure that has been created by this summer's leavers. It will not make youth unemployment go away, and it will not distract us from the bigger job that is still to be done. I have every confidence that the efforts that we have made during the past few months, and the response that we can expect from our partners, will make a massive difference to our young people.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20853159", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy (Support for Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Young people are our future workforce.

Some of the points that he made about skills gaps that have been identified by employers will be addressed through the refreshed skills strategy. As I have done with the statement today, I will do what I can to ensure that he gets early sight of that strategy, which should help to answer some of the questions that he has asked.</p><p>It is fair to say that no Government has done as well as it should have done for care leavers, and we accept completely that it is not an easy issue to resolve. Through the one-stop shop, we intend to ensure that all care leavers are not left once they leave care. They rely on the state to a great extent throughout their lives up to that point, so it is only right that the state does not run away and leave them to fend for themselves when they leave care.</p><p>Each care leaver will, through Skills Development Scotland, be given a key worker who will work with them.

In addition, I have written to every single one of Scotland's colleges to ask them to have particular regard to that group of people and the opportunities that they represent.</p><p>We will also revisit the issue over the course of the summer. We know that the situation will change over the summer, but we also know that we will not get some of the relevant hard facts until September, or perhaps even later.

It seems obvious that we should introduce one, and the idea has been mentioned over many years in relation to various public services. However, it is much easier to say than it is to do, as it requires substantial systemic change. Although we are making the change for the particular pressure that we envisage, we think that it will produce long-term benefits for the whole skills agenda in forthcoming years, as people will find it easier to <place-holder colnum=\"27480\"/> access the skills agenda. That is particularly the case for employers, who will have one place to go to get answers to their questions and will not be shunted around different agencies, and for young people, who will also have one place to go to get the answers that they want.

We recognise that there is a strong economic need to help our young people to develop entrepreneurial attitudes. Exposing young people to the excitement of setting up and running their own business is key to our future economic success, and the contribution that programmes such as EDGE make is even more important during a recession.<place-holder colnum=\"26293\"/></p><p>However, it is also important to note that the EDGE programme is one of many that are designed to inspire and motivate young people to think about self employment and entrepreneurship as a viable career option. The current postponement&#8212;and it is a postponement, not, as the motion says, a cancellation&#8212;of the programme will not inhibit the significant range of other support that is provided by the Government and its agencies to promote entrepreneurship in our school pupils and university students.</p><p>In answer to the point that Willie Coffey raised, I should say that my understanding is that Scottish Enterprise is currently discussing changes to the EDGE programme with Scottish Government officials, Scottish universities and Skills Development Scotland. We will continue to work with and support Scottish Enterprise and its partners in developing a new delivery model for the EDGE programme.</p><p>As I made clear earlier, Scottish Enterprise has postponed the proposed delivery of EDGE in 2010 rather than cancelling the scheme and is working with partners to identify an improved model that will put the programme on a better long-term footing and ensure that it provides even greater value for money, which is something that every student of business will appreciate the need for.</p><p>The Scottish Government is not involved routinely in decisions that are connected to the delivery of specific Scottish Enterprise interventions. Those decisions are matters for the agency to make, taking account of value and the impact of its spend.</p><p>We are just coming out of a recession. The nightmare of the recession might be coming to an end, but the nightmare of the constraints on public finances is only just beginning. That is the environment in which we have to live.</p><p>The EDGE programme is one of many that are designed to inspire and motivate young people to think about self employment as a viable career option. The postponement of EDGE will not inhibit the significant range of other support that I mentioned. One element of that support is the Government's determined to succeed strategy for enterprise education for ages three to 18, which has entrepreneurial learning as one of its four key strands. That is part of our commitment to ensure that young people have access to information about all aspects of entrepreneurial learning: private; social; and cooperative. We also have a range of resources for teachers, including online resources and a continuous professional development package that is accessible through the enterprise in education website that is located within Learning and Teaching Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"26294\"/></p><p>Sandra White is right to point out that many of the figures concern projected or anticipated outcomes. We expect Scottish Enterprise to be able to give us a more up-to-date evaluation, which is essential to its decision about how to take forward the programme. We look forward to getting that, and I am happy to ensure that Sandra White and anyone else who is interested can see it as soon as it is available.</p><p>The work has been supported by our entrepreneurial focus group, which is made up of representatives from determined to succeed, Learning and Teaching Scotland, the Social Enterprise Academy, the Co-operative Education Trust Scotland, the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust, the British Franchise Association in Scotland and Young Enterprise Scotland.</p><p>The group supported a national event on 11 May at the Glasgow Science Centre, at which all 32 local authorities had the opportunity to meet organisations such as the business gateway and Shell LiveWIRE who can help support them in the delivery of entrepreneurial learning.</p><p>We might not always appreciate this, but Scotland is seen as a world leader in enterprise in education and entrepreneurial learning, Last November, determined to succeed hosted a three-day international conference highlighting enterprise in education and entrepreneurial learning in our school system to delegates from countries such as the United States, Denmark, Spain, Holland and Estonia.</p><p>It is important to mention curriculum for excellence, which is allowing all our pupils to enjoy entrepreneurial and enterprising education that better prepares them for life and work. We are mainstreaming enterprise in education in a way that has not yet happened in many other countries. Work with employers is a core element of determined to succeed and will be incorporated into curriculum for excellence as we go forward.</p><p>Enterprising approaches to teaching and learning sit at the heart of the curriculum for excellence, which enables all our young people to develop the skills for learning, skills for life and skills for work that they need to be successful.</p><p>I could mention many other programmes, such as the Deloitte employability initiative, which we are working with through Scotland's Colleges. I am happy to provide more information on that.</p><p>In conclusion, I do not think that anybody can be in any doubt about the Government's commitment to and investment in school pupils and students alike; indeed, we have a worldwide reputation as leaders in enterprising and entrepreneurial learning, as demonstrated by the response to our determined to succeed excellence through <place-holder colnum=\"26295\"/> enterprise international conference, which was held last November.</p><p>Through determined to succeed and the curriculum for excellence, we have put enterprise in education and entrepreneurial learning at the heart of our education system.</p><p>We agree that EDGE supports our aims to develop a can-do, will-do attitude in our young people. It is important to note that, as I said, the programme is being not cancelled but postponed as Scottish Enterprise reviews the model and takes positive steps to realign the programme to ensure that it meets the needs of our young people and the businesses that support it.</p><p>As Sandra White said, by taking into account the needs of all EDGE partners, Scottish Enterprise hopes to provide an alternative delivery model, which will deliver benefits to all those involved.<place-holder colnum=\"26296\"/></p><p>Scottish Enterprise is best placed to make the important decision about the future of the EDGE programme. However, there should be no doubt that giving our young people opportunities for entrepreneurial learning in the global economy is extremely important to us all. Working with our partners, we hope to create an environment that excites young people, engages them in entrepreneurial learning and helps them to develop those attitudes in whatever career they choose to follow. We need to develop young people with skills and ambitions for Scotland to achieve our key aim of sustainable economic growth, and we will continue to work with our schools, colleges and universities to ensure that that happens.<place-holder time=\"17:41:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:41.</em></p>", "hdate": "2010-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766604", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Encouraging Dynamic Global Entrepreneurs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jackie Baillie on securing this debate.

Through our economic recovery plan, the Scottish Government's response to the economic downturn has been flexible and dynamic. We have supported people and businesses through what has undoubtedly been a challenging time. We believe that we have acted decisively to support our economy and our construction sector. Last year, we maximised and accelerated some &#163;3.8 billion of capital spending to support infrastructure investment and some 50,000 jobs across Scotland.</p><p>In addition, we are clear that our modern apprenticeships programme is of paramount importance to a strong economic recovery for Scotland, as it equips people with the training and skills development that are needed to gain long-term employment. Over the past year, we have acted quickly to put in place incentives to support businesses to take on a new apprentice, to recruit an apprentice who has been made redundant, or to protect an apprentice who faces the threat of redundancy. Indeed, our ScotAction programme represents the most comprehensive support <place-holder colnum=\"25603\"/> package for apprenticeships in the UK. More than 20,000 people in Scotland started modern apprenticeships last year and are now receiving training and skills development to help them into long-term employment. Almost 3,500 of the starts were in construction-related jobs. We will continue to prioritise investment in skills and training this year by offering a minimum of 15,000 modern apprenticeship starts and a minimum of 34,500 training opportunities overall&#8212;and we will do more if we can.</p><p>At present, 79 companies and 160 modern apprentices in the construction sector benefit from the wage subsidy that is available through our safeguard an apprentice scheme. Given the continued uncertainty in the labour market, we will continue to offer both that and the successful adopt an apprentice scheme through to March 2011. I hope that that answers a point that was raised by Marilyn Livingstone.</p><p>Today's debate has raised a number of issues that I want to address. First, I thought that Andy Kerr's opening speech was a very poor start to the debate. Coming from a council where we are used to much higher standards of debate, I was disappointed that he managed to get through 13 minutes of a speech without mentioning Labour's recession. Speaking for 13 minutes without acknowledging the 13 years of the failure of the Goldman Sachs-type Government that we have had in the UK takes some skill in itself, so perhaps that justified the tiny mention of skills that he made at the end of his speech.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763731", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we know, the Scottish economy entered recession in the middle of 2008 and returned to growth in the final quarter of 2009.

There are one or two who have different views on how we could best go about addressing the problems, but without exception people are clear about the cause of their concerns in the construction industry: it is, first and foremost, Labour's recession. They know that that is the big problem. How we try to deal with it is obviously a matter of debate.<place-holder colnum=\"25604\"/></p><p>Last year, in agreement with the Labour Party, we aimed for 18,500 apprenticeships, and we have exceeded that with 20,000 apprenticeships&#8212;the figure will be beyond that by the end of the year. From my discussions with the industry, I think that it will be troubled by Labour's new policy development to guarantee apprenticeships. That is incompatible with the employer-led apprenticeship scheme that we have. That scheme was not followed in England, where people now wish that it had been. It will be interesting to see in the coming days how Labour members explain the change in policy and how they will fulfil a guarantee of an apprenticeship for young people. On our part, we guarantee, and are happy to work with others who support it, the idea that there is a training opportunity or apprenticeship for people in that age group. However, not everybody can be guaranteed an apprenticeship under the current scheme. It will be interesting to see what happens.</p><p>As for the Lib Dems, I do not deny that there is something to be said for the idea of encouraging refurbishment and not always new build&#8212;if only that had been the case in the eight years of the Labour-Lib Dem Administration, when every PFI project channelled in the idea of new build rather than refurbishing existing buildings.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763731", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The point was asked about and answered earlier on.

That means that, in general, we have a fairly good consensus on skills, which is important for one reason in particular. Over the past year, we have faced difficult times and we will continue to do so. It is because of the fact that we are in such serious circumstances that many people are struggling. People would not take it well if we were to knock lumps out of one another and make points for the sake of making points, so it is worth acknowledging the constructive manner in which the debate has been held.</p><p>The point has been made a number of times in the debate about everyone's desire not to have a lost generation, as has happened as a result of previous recessions. I point out that some of the problems that have been identified, not least by David Whitton, who spoke about people who are extremely hard to reach and bring into the jobs market, arise from the recession of the early 1980s, which was one the worst. The people concerned may not even have been born then, but we are still dealing with the consequences of that generational change. Of course, that makes it harder to deal with the effects of the recession with which we are now dealing. We are dealing with inherited problems.<place-holder colnum=\"23320\"/></p><p>I will try to deal with as many of the points that have been made as possible; I apologise if I do not reach all of them.</p><p>Liz Smith talked about training being focused on employer needs. We support considerable business involvement in training design and delivery, and we work with sector skills councils in particular. I acknowledge the work that has been done on that by Jackie Hepburn&#8212;who is in the gallery&#8212;in particular. We work closely with sector skills councils on the design and promotion of modern apprenticeships and on other training programmes and qualifications. Last year, we held a business-led apprenticeship summit, which John Park mentioned, to ensure that we focused on additional opportunities in which business demand was greatest. We would be interested in a further summit this year&#8212;John Park mentioned that, too. I take on board his constructive suggestion about having an annual summit, which we will certainly consider. Obviously, that would involve a wider skills and training agenda than there was at the apprenticeship summit last year.</p><p>Liz Smith talked about a skills academy. We generally support the idea of a skills academy model if it adds value, avoids duplication and focuses on key areas, but that is not the same as supporting a skills academy in a physical building. That said, we support that model and the employer involvement that it implies.</p><p>Christina McKelvie, Claire Baker and David Whitton talked about carers and the representations that all members received relating to the debate. As part of an overall carers strategy, we are developing a young carers strategy for publication in the first half of this year. That strategy will consider young carers in transitions, including those who are seeking further skills development through further education, higher education or employment. It is also worth saying that we provided funding of &#163;200,000 to the Princess Royal Trust for Carers for three young carer initiatives, including a skills development strand. I take on board the comments that were made. We generally support the idea of being as flexible as possible to ensure that we reach that otherwise hard-to-reach group, but the representations that we all received made it clear that some of the problems relate to the benefits system, which sometimes cuts across what we are trying to do.</p><p>John Park has made constructive suggestions on adult apprenticeships and being flexible to me and to the cabinet secretary, and we will consider them.</p><p>Marilyn Livingstone spoke about the number of architects and planners that we are producing and the money that is going towards that. The issue is quite complex. There are quite a lot of arguments <place-holder colnum=\"23321\"/> behind the Scottish funding council's treatment of the matter. I am happy to go into more detail in writing to Marilyn Livingstone on why the funding council is doing certain things. If she is still unhappy, I will happy to discuss the matter further with her.</p><p>We have heard what Iain Smith said about rural colleges a number of times before. I intervened to say that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning allocated the additional consequential money to the funding council with the agreement of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, and the funding council takes its own decisions. A number of rural colleges did not benefit from that, but, since then, I have had a number of discussions with individual principals of rural colleges, who have said that, although they did not benefit on that occasion, if the distribution had been done according to a formula, the amount that they would have received would not have made a substantial difference to what we are trying to achieve for economic recovery. At the time, it was about getting the biggest bang for our buck. I am sure that the cabinet secretary will consider each case on its merits in future if there are moneys to be distributed and that he will ensure that we get the best possible response from those moneys. There was no prejudice in any way against rural colleges; the intention was to deal with the areas of greatest need.</p><p>Iain Smith also mentioned the graduates for business scheme. That is not within my portfolio, but I am happy to say that, through the Scottish funding council, we are giving &#163;3.5 million to support graduate skills and employability. That support focuses on work that is related to learning and training, enterprise, entrepreneurship and workforce development. Iain Smith will know that an alternative scheme is to come forward by the end of June, which will, I am told, result in an improved offer for graduates, not least because it will be applied more consistently throughout the country.</p><p>Claire Baker, who also mentioned the graduates for business scheme, spoke about student support, additional places in college and more investment in facilities. I agree with her points but, as I tried to make clear in my response to Marilyn Livingstone, we have done a great deal in that area already, although we are constrained by having a fixed budget. Adam Smith College, which Claire Baker mentioned, has received additional money for places&#8212;the figure throughout the country was a 9 per cent increase&#8212;and additional money for student support. The college has also received an additional &#163;1.6 million to help with a new facility, which several members mentioned. That will be fantastic, because it will bring the best possible facilities for training apprentices and <place-holder colnum=\"23322\"/> people for the renewables demand that is coming. Additional support has been provided, but we must have regard to the overall budget in doing that. However, I take the points that Claire Baker made.</p><p>Hugh O'Donnell made several points about Skills Development Scotland. It is true that the corporate plan cannot provide every possible detail that he would like. That will be dealt with by the operational plan and the communications plan. However, I take on board his points about the call centre and I will speak to Skills Development Scotland about that. I reiterate that the focus for Skills Development Scotland had to be on taking the necessary action to get people into apprenticeships and training and back into jobs. In the body's first year, it would have been wrong for us to have pushed it too hard on documents such as the corporate plan.</p><p>Gavin Brown spoke about the tourism industry. I worked for many years in that industry and have an understanding of the problems that he highlighted. However, he will find&#8212;he probably knows this in any event&#8212;that one of the issues is that wages in the industry tend to be low, which perhaps has a big impact on retention. I take on board the points that he made and undertake to consider them, but it is worth saying that a great deal of work is going on throughout the country. For example, North Highland College has a superb facility in Dornoch that is coming to fruition.

As we seek to accelerate Scotland's recovery and to take the fullest possible advantage of new opportunities as they emerge, it is critical that our skills and training support is substantial, sustainable and flexible.</p><p>Even as we see some positive signs, the reality for many Scots firms is one of continuing challenges in sustaining their business.

That is why we are prioritising skills investment in the draft budget, with investment of more than &#163;2 billion in our colleges, universities and national training programmes. We have already seen the difference that a flexible approach to skills investment can make in tough economic times. Through our ScotAction programme, we have directed some &#163;145 million to support training for work, training in work and training from work to work. We have expanded the modern apprenticeship programme, making available an extra &#163;16 million to create an additional 7,800 opportunities in 2009-10&#8212;on top of the 10,700 that were already in place&#8212;taking the number of new opportunities to the extremely ambitious level of 18,500.

In addition, we realise that a number of small construction companies may not have the same capacity as larger companies to access apprenticeships, or even to be aware of them and to find out where they are. We have produced a short, direct, simple leaflet for such employers, to ensure that they are able to access apprenticeships. The member will be aware of this morning's very positive news that there is a more positive outlook among construction employers in Scotland than in the rest of the United Kingdom. We are doing what we can in that regard, although there is obviously more to be done.</p><p>We have expanded the modern apprenticeship programme, making available 7,800 opportunities in addition to the 10,700. Next year we hope to be even more ambitious, by offering a flexible range of training opportunities to accelerate the recovery.</p><p>A key priority group for the Government, the Parliament and the country is, of course, our young people. Too often in previous recessions, young people have suffered most and the effects have continued for them while the rest of society has moved on. Scotland's young people deserve better. We are determined not to repeat that past mistake.</p><p>The 16+ learning choices model is our guarantee of an offer of a place in learning to every young person who wants it. Local partnerships, led by local authorities, are working together to ensure that the range of opportunities that is available to young people meets their needs and supports them into further learning and employment.</p><p>This year's school leaver destinations return, which was published in November, told a much better story than we might have feared during the recession, with an increase in the proportion of young people going into further and higher education and training. School staying-on rates are also significantly higher than in previous years, which is perhaps not surprising during a recession. However, as we would expect, the proportion of young people going into employment has fallen. This is not the time to take our foot off the gas. If we want to secure a sustainable economic <place-holder colnum=\"23280\"/> recovery for the benefit of everyone in Scotland, we must provide the right support where it is needed.</p><p>There is no question but that we need to be prepared for the summer of 2010, given that more young people will be coming out of school and college into a labour market that is likely to remain tight. We must all be prepared to support those young people into further learning, training and employment. Our young people must have a flexible range of options in the year ahead, and continuing support to sustain their learning choice. The draft budget puts in place the funding to provide that, and we must all get behind the efforts that are being made to deliver those options.</p><p>The Government has been very impressed by the way in which colleges have responded flexibly to increased demands. That remains a priority in the year ahead. Skills Development Scotland's continuing training budget has been protected. When four organisations come together, it is natural that there will be some efficiency savings and those are now being delivered. However, as we have always said, front-line services will be maintained. SDS is well placed to respond flexibly to emerging demand. If the evidence shows that another year of focusing on providing high numbers of modern apprenticeship starts is key to accelerating recovery&#8212;we believe that it is&#8212;the draft budget provides for that.</p><p>Using skills to support growth is not all about money. It is equally important to provide the right support to those who need it most and to ensure that Government and its partners work together to deliver that support as effectively as possible.</p><p>As I said, we must be prepared for the summer of 2010. More young people will be coming out of school and college on to the labour market, which&#8212;according to every estimate that we have heard so far&#8212;is likely to remain very tight for the foreseeable future. We must be prepared to support those young people into further learning, training and employment.</p><p>Since coming to power, the Government has had a single purpose: we want to create a more successful country, in which everyone shares the benefits of sustainable economic growth. In the economic climate in which we have found ourselves, the need to focus on doing all that we can to support the economy has never been more important. We understand that skills are a critical element to economic growth in a country such as Scotland. There is a great deal to be said for the work that the former Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning did on skills utilisation, which has now been taken over by the current cabinet secretary. That work aims to ensure that we get competitive benefits from the skills that we have in our workforce.<place-holder colnum=\"23281\"/></p><p>For existing businesses to be more successful, we need a large pool of individuals with both the skill set and the mindset to drive innovation and to deliver greater profitability. To attract new investment to Scotland we need a highly skilled, adaptable workforce that can contribute to the success of businesses that choose to invest here. In a public sector that faces huge challenges, we need individuals who can drive up public service productivity to unprecedented levels. It is difficult to anticipate properly the skills that any economy will need in the future, but if we can get it right, the competitive benefits&#8212;the advantage over competitors&#8212;can be huge.</p><p>There is no question but that the Government's approach to skills development and delivery has been tested to the limits in the past year. We are in an unprecedented recession, just narrowly coming out of it in the past few days&#8212;at least, that is what the data suggest. Having a single skills agency managing a range of programmes from within a single budget has allowed us to act quickly in response to a rapidly changing environment. Certainly, people who have been involved in the area for a long time tell us that focus on and scrutiny of training and careers opportunities are far greater than they were in the past, as a result of a single agency being in charge.</p><p>As I said, our colleges have been hugely responsive to an unprecedented surge in demand and we have acted quickly to support them. We have sustained a positive story on school leaver destinations, and the rate of increase in unemployment has decelerated much more quickly than might been have anticipated a year ago.</p><p>However, this is not the time to take our foot off the gas. If we want to secure a sustainable recovery for the benefit of everybody in Scotland, we must provide the right support where and when it is needed. In years to come, I want to be able to look back on how we worked collectively to respond to the recession and I want to be able to take pride in the success of our approach. A flexible approach to skills and training was right before the recession and has definitely been right during the recession. I am convinced that it will be right as we seek to accelerate recovery. I commend the motion to the Parliament.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of businesses and employees are critical elements of a successful skills strategy in helping tackle the challenges of the recession and the recovery and believes that the Scottish Government must maintain its focus on developing practical initiatives that help people and businesses with training for work, training in work and training from work to work.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20534753", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We work closely with ConstructionSkills, which is a strong sector skills council, and regularly meet employers in the industry, who have a good track record on apprenticeships.

Its success in growing innovative and accessible part-time education in the past 40 years has been remarkable. It is an excellent example of what can be achieved with imaginative thinking in meeting learning needs in Scotland and throughout the UK. Bill Kidd's comments about the environment in which learning takes place in the OU leads me to look with envy on its record on class sizes.</p><p>High-level learning and skills are integral to achieving our overall purpose of having a more successful country with opportunities for all of <place-holder colnum=\"22252\"/> Scotland to flourish through increasing sustainable economic growth. However, that can be achieved only if we develop and use the skills of our people to best effect. For many people, part-time learning will be the best option to improve and develop their skills. Some choose part-time learning because they need to continue to work while they learn; others have caring responsibilities or issues with access or disability. As we have heard, part-time study also offers a second chance to people who previously were disaffected with education, and it can be the route to enhance or develop new career prospects or directions.</p><p>Alongside those varied individual motivations for engaging in part-time study, as Bill Kidd said, demographic drivers in our economy and society will increasingly focus attention on part-time study opportunities to improve skills utilisation. The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 gives employees the right to request time off to train. It is crucial that we achieve the right balance between full-time and part-time learning and that we extend the range of available part-time and flexible learning opportunities.</p><p>As we all know, part-time learning plays an increasingly important role in today's economic climate as Scotland faces the challenges of the economic downturn. We have developed an extensive economic recovery plan to help Scotland's people and businesses through the difficult period. A key plank in the plan is the provision of flexible help for vulnerable individuals. As Bill Kidd and others have said, the inclusive nature of the Open University&#8212;which is suggested by its very name&#8212;is crucial. The impact of the downturn on the need and demand for retraining and upskilling varies considerably in different groups.</p><p>We recognise the financial pressures that learners face, which Claire Baker mentioned. We also recognise the need to maintain Scotland's world-class education system. People need to be able to learn new skills to contribute to Scotland's future economic success. We must ensure that individuals can access relevant learning opportunities to support retraining and upskilling and that financial assistance for learners is flexible enough to support individuals now to help sustain and improve our skills base for future growth. Part-time and flexible adult learning will be vital, which is why the Government has taken action to provide assistance for part-time students.</p><p>Claire Baker mentioned some technological innovations that are relevant to the OU today. The one that I remember the best is VCRs&#8212;video cassette recorders. I remember when people were condemned to watch programmes at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning. When VCRs came along and people worked out how to programme them, <place-holder colnum=\"22253\"/> they could set them to tape through the night and watch the programmes at their leisure. We might find that most people who are good at VCR programming&#8212;not that we need to be any more&#8212;were OU students in the past.</p><p>In July 2008, we introduced a &#163;500 part-time grant, which replaced the previous &#163;500 part-time loan. That major new funding of &#163;38 million will benefit up to 20,000 students a year. The grant complements a solid existing base of financial support for part-time learning through individual learning accounts. To better align ILAs with the aims of our skills strategy, we have extended funding to work-related learning and to adult literacy and numeracy provision. We have removed the minimum personal financial contribution that was required from learners and made ILAs fully grant based. We have also widened access to the scheme for learners and learning providers and extended course choice. We have launched a pilot part-time postgraduate initiative, which provides grant funding for tuition fees and can currently support up to 150 part-time students. We have extended ILA eligibility to 16 and 17-year-olds and increased the income threshold from &#163;18,000 to &#163;22,000, which extends ILA support to an extra 250,000 people, making nearly half of the adult workforce eligible.<place-holder colnum=\"22254\"/></p><p>We all understand the challenges that are ahead. I am confident that we can grasp the major opportunities that are before us. We must work together and continue to focus on building a single skills system, to benefit individual learners and employers and to achieve the vision of a smarter Scotland with a globally competitive economy that is based on high-value jobs.<place-holder time=\"17:30:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:30.</em></p>", "hdate": "2009-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20460924", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Open University"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have done, I thank Claire Baker for giving us the opportunity to congratulate the Open University in Scotland in this its 40 th year.

It is important that we debate this issue and discuss the important new resource that we have.</p><p>Around St Andrew's day, it is natural for many of us to reflect on a sense of history, especially at the end of this homecoming year. I would like to remind everyone how we are actively promoting learning about Scotland's history and equipping our young people with the knowledge and skills that they need to be successful learners, competent individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.</p><p>First, learning about Scotland's history is firmly embedded in the curriculum for excellence's experiences and outcomes, which were published in April following extensive engagement and which provide a clear framework for the biggest transformation in education in a generation.</p><p>We have glow, which is a world-leading secure schools intranet that provides fantastic opportunities to develop innovative teaching and learning practices. It is paving the way for an avant-garde education system that will inspire&#8212;and is inspiring&#8212;other countries to look to Scotland as an example of a leading education system.</p><p>We also have, as has been discussed today, the Scotland's history online resource. Last month, through Learning and Teaching Scotland and in partnership with our national galleries, museums, library and archive sources&#8212;the sources do not come from some SNP back room, but from those nationally accepted resources&#8212;we launched Scotland's history, which is a world-leading resource that benefits all learners who have an interest in Scotland. The site has had more than 20,000 visitors in the first month, and there have been almost 100,000 page hits to the resource. That is a great start, and it reflects the quality of the materials on the site.</p><p>It is worth repeating Fiona Hyslop's point that those materials came about as the result of concerns that history teachers expressed about the lack of materials. History teachers welcomed the materials when they were produced; there is not some ministerial plot to force materials on <place-holder colnum=\"21513\"/> teachers, as it was the teachers who asked for them.</p><p>All those resources build on the exceptional work that schools have done this year on homecoming. The cabinet secretary has already mentioned the winners of the homecoming award. In August, I was fortunate enough to visit one of the other finalists, Dallas primary school, which I understand showcased its work last night at Stirling castle. That brings us back to Rob Gibson's point about some of the excellent work and rich tasks that have been done in schools as part of the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>The homecoming research by pupils of Dallas primary school discovered that a former pupil of the school, Thomas Dallas, became a vice-president of America in 1867, and gave his name to Dallas in Texas. Another Dallas boy, Scotty Philip&#8212;the research does not explain whether that was his name before he went to America or if he adopted it once he was there&#8212;travelled to America in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, married the Indian Crazy Horse's sister-in-law, and then saved the American bison from being hunted to extinction.</p><p>The historical research that those young people undertook to unearth that information was exceptional&#8212;I saw the whole process and the narrative that they followed. The pleasure of learning about their own environments and what people from their own area&#8212;a very small area&#8212;had done gave them a real sense of pride, place and identity. Rob Gibson was right to highlight some of those points.</p><p>Some of the proposed amendments to the motion have been mentioned. Murdo Fraser's amendment suggests that we are promoting</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a nationalist agenda through the use of public resources and the teaching of history.\"</p><p>That was the same line that he took when I visited Bannockburn for the official launch of the funding from the National Trust for Scotland for subsidised school visits to Bannockburn, Culloden and the Burns birthplace museum. I should say, as Murdo Fraser said to Margaret Smith, that Culloden was not a fight between Scotland and England. It really is important, given all the learning that Margaret Smith told us she had undertaken at school and university, that she revisits that and gets the facts right.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20410566", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education (Scottish History)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to make a start to my speech first.

We have lifted over 13 per cent of Scotland's school estate out of bad or poor condition.</p><p>In addition, we have announced a new school-building programme that will involve investing a further &#163;1.25 billion in the school estate the length and breadth of Scotland, delivering around 55 new schools. Auchmuty high school in Fife, which has been mentioned, will be one of the new schools that will be built as part of that programme.

However, I also acknowledge the points that were made by Iain Smith, who made a persuasive argument for the proposals that Fife Council is pursuing. I make it clear that this is a matter for Fife Council, which is responsible for the provision and maintenance of school buildings in its area and for deciding what priority is to be accorded to work on particular schools. Given that responsibility, ministers must stand back from involvement in discussions on the merits of options for work on individual school buildings and cannot intervene in council business to influence which schools are identified as priorities for <place-holder colnum=\"20771\"/> replacement or refurbishment or decisions on the establishment of new schools.</p><p>On 28 September, the Government, jointly with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, published its new school estate strategy, \"Building Better Schools: Investing in Scotland's Future\", which provides a new route map to ensure that all of Scotland's school estate is up to the required standard. Our shared vision, with COSLA, sets out the high value that we place on places of learning that people and communities can enjoy using and be proud of and that enrich the communities that they serve and the lives of learners and their families.</p><p>The strategy sets an ambitious joint Government-COSLA target to ensure that no less than 90 per cent of children in Scotland will be educated in good-condition schools&#8212;schools in conditions A and B&#8212;with firm plans to lift the remaining children into better-condition schools. As Iain Smith indicated, it is absurd to suggest that either the council of the past two years or the Government of that period are responsible for a huge change in the past two and half years in the number of people who are being educated in C-category schools. Ted Brocklebank mentioned that this has been an issue for 50 years.

Schools should be efficiently run and should maximise value for money. Having an estate that is both flexible and <place-holder colnum=\"20772\"/> responsive to future changes in demand is in the interests of us all. Pupils, parents, teachers and communities across Scotland, including Fife, are entitled to a school estate that delivers those aspirations for them.

That does not sit well with the fact that, for the majority of the 50-year period during which the issue has been discussed, according to Ted Brocklebank, we have had Conservative or Labour Governments and a Labour council in Fife. The member suggests that it was a pressing issue, but nothing happened during that time. Two and a half decades of nothing, according to Ted Brocklebank, stand against two and a half years of an SNP-Lib Dem council in Fife that has made substantial progress.</p><p>The Government has increased substantially support for capital spending by local authorities across Scotland. This year and last year Fife Council has received &#163;94.3 million for investment in infrastructure, including schools, according to its priorities. We believe that, under the concordat and more generally, local authorities should, where possible, have the power to decide their own affairs. Fife Council should choose its priorities for investment in its school estate, as it does for other areas of its estate and as other councils across Scotland do.</p><p>Ministers welcome Fife Council's investment plans for its school estate, with &#163;140 million-worth of investment identified within the council's capital plans.

The Government has always been a strong supporter of our colleges. The contribution that they make to providing better opportunities for the people of Scotland becomes even more important during a recession. They help to provide&#8212;and will continue to do so&#8212;the skilled workforce that we need if we are to achieve the sustained economic growth that we all want in Scotland.</p><p>Our colleges continue to reposition themselves to address the new circumstances and challenges that have been brought by the recession, and to engage with students, employers and communities to develop the confidence and employability of our young people. As a result, we will see more confident individuals, stronger communities and competitive businesses that are able to tap into the full potential of their employees.</p><p>Some of the points that have been made are worth repeating. In January, the funding council allocated &#163;7 million in 2008-09 and 2009-10 to support colleges' participation in our partnership action for continuing employment. With more choices, more chances, every young person has a choice of provision at every level for every style of learning everywhere in the country. Our 16-plus learning choices scheme offers a suitable place in learning well before the individual's school leaving date, at any transition point during the senior phase.</p><p>Over the period 2007-08 to 2010-11, this Government plans to invest &#163;2.685 billion in the college sector&#8212;a 17 per cent increase on the previous Administration's investment. I say in <place-holder colnum=\"20274\"/> response to Jeremy Purvis's point that it is important to try to focus on the crucial figure, which is how much&#8212;what proportion of the budget&#8212;was spent on colleges under the respective Administrations. Under the previous Administration, it was around 2.3 per cent and under this Administration it is around 2.37 per cent. We have also accelerated capital spend&#8212;&#163;8.5 million for colleges from 2010-11 into 2008-09 and 2009-10.</p><p>As a number of members said, we have brand new, purpose-built, world-class facilities, such as Anniesland College, South Lanarkshire College and Stevenson College&#8212;the cabinet secretary mentioned other colleges in her opening speech.</p><p>We have also heard a great deal of mention of the UK budget consequentials of &#163;28.1 million that has been allocated to colleges to support young people and capital investment. That money was for the areas of greatest need&#8212;that was the guidance that was given by the cabinet secretary to the funding council, which was in charge of the final distribution.</p><p>The draft budget for 2010-11 includes a &#163;45 million increase on 2009-10, which is more than 5 per cent above inflation.</p><p>I want to address some of the points that were made during the debate. As the cabinet secretary made clear, we acknowledge the point that was made by the Conservatives in particular that rural colleges have concerns. I met the college principal, whom Mary Scanlon described as \"a first-class principal\"&#8212;I certainly agree&#8212;of North Highland College in Thurso. Those concerns have not been ignored, but have been listened to. The guidance that was given to the funding council instructed it to focus on young people in the areas of greatest need. When speaking to the principal of Northern College and other principals in rural areas, I had the impression that their concerns are not limited to the funding allocation from this set of budget consequentials. They also feel that they sometimes suffer as result of their remoteness and size, which affect the extent to which the funding council hears their voices. The cabinet secretary and I have listened to those concerns and will take on board the points that are made in the Conservative amendment.</p><p>It is worth pointing out how well our young people did in the recent Worldskills International tournament in Calgary. We had our biggest-ever representation in the UK delegation, which achieved its highest-ever place in the tournament. The Scottish representatives accounted for two of the three gold medals that were won; had Scotland been accounted for separately, we would have had the top results in the world. That is a fantastic achievement by the young people who were over in Calgary.<place-holder colnum=\"20275\"/></p><p>I have spoken to many principals, both publicly and privately, who recognise the pressures that the recession creates, some of which have been mentioned by members. However, they also see in the recession an opportunity to place colleges up front and at the centre of public life in Scotland. As Kenny Gibson in particular pointed out, colleges believe that vocational education deserves parity of esteem with academic education. It does.</p><p>Margaret Smith referred to differences in child care funding between Scotland and England, where such funding is an entitlement. It is, but the system that we have was supported by the previous Administration. I am grateful to Margaret Smith for acknowledging the additional moneys that the cabinet secretary has managed to invest in the area.</p><p>David Stewart mentioned Dornoch, which I have visited, and the work that has been done there on the Scots diaspora. Also worthy of mention is the work that has been done on hospitality, for which a new facility is about to be created. The North Highland College has concentrated on front-of-house training for our hospitality industry, which is an area in which we were not so strong in the past.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200954", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Colleges (Economic Recovery)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has clearly laid out the role that Scotland's colleges have in contributing to economic recovery.

Many secondary schools are also doing that when they did not do so before. That contrasts with the points that some members have made about a lack of progress.</p><p>I met representatives of ADES at the Health and Sport Committee's suggestion, and put forward as a template what has been done in East Renfrewshire. Members will realise that in education in Scotland there is some resistance to the regular presentation of East Renfrewshire <place-holder colnum=\"19637\"/> models, not only because of the excellence of that local authority but because its socioeconomic make-up is not entirely typical of every authority in Scotland.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has&#8212;as I said when I appeared before the committee&#8212;asked HMIE to comment on progress towards the target of two hours of PE a week for each pupil in every single report that it produces. As a result, the inspectorate has rewritten the procedures that it applies in relation to the target.</p><p>I said that we have met every council in Scotland. I should mention that progressing the target through the curriculum for excellence was not only this Government's idea; it was Peter Peacock's idea. That is how he said it should be delivered. Of course, the curriculum for excellence has taken some time to come to fruition&#8212;not least because of the request to delay it for a year, but also because of earlier delays.</p><p>The single outcome agreements all mention the curriculum for excellence. Apart from the six agreements that have been mentioned, they do not mention the target of two hours of PE a week because they do not go into that kind of detail. The method for delivering the target is through the curriculum for excellence. In contrast to the point that Ken Macintosh made, the target was in \"Building the curriculum 3\", which was published in 2008, so it was not a late addition, as has been suggested.</p><p>The school estate strategy will start to address some of the concerns that have been raised about the lack of facilities, which I understand and accept. Many schools have said that the available facilities are a reason why they find it difficult to address the problem, although other schools have been happy to move beyond the school gates and use surrounding areas, as happened when I was at school. A lack of appropriate facilities is not an excuse for not meeting the target, but we understand that it is a constraint.</p><p>Through the work that we have done with HMIE, ADES, East Renfrewshire Council and others to promote what East Renfrewshire Council is doing, huge progress has been made, although we cannot tell other councils to do it.

It gives us a chance not only to commemorate the life and tragic early death of a remarkable young woman but to stand united against racism, discrimination and intolerance in all its forms. A number of members have mentioned how present that threat can be, for example in the results of the recent European elections, not just in this country but, sadly, even in Holland.</p><p>Anne Frank's 13<sup>th</sup> birthday, on 12 June 1942, was the day on which she began to keep a diary. One of her first entries, on 20 June 1942, reads:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a 13-year-old schoolgirl.\"</p><p>Since its initial publication in 1947, Anne's \"musings\" have inspired, moved and educated successive generations of young people and adults. She lived a short but dramatic life, suffered an early and tragic death, and left a first-hand testimony of the hardship of life under Nazi rule, including an invaluable record of the daily tribulations, hopes and fears of two years in hiding.</p><p>Like other members, I applaud the work of the Anne Frank Trust UK in bringing her story to Scottish schools. We want our young people to grow up with an understanding of the world and their place in it. We want them to understand what it means to be Scottish but at the same time to admire and accept the identities of others. That means taking a stand against racism, discrimination and intolerance in all its forms. Educating young people about the Holocaust can contribute greatly to that aim.</p><p>Holocaust education is important not only in its own right but because it opens windows to wider aspects of citizenship education. It provides rich opportunities for analysis, discussion and debate. Holocaust education sits well with the Government's policies in the curriculum for excellence, which has as its aim the idea that young people should become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and, crucially, responsible citizens. Pupils will be able <place-holder colnum=\"18433\"/> to learn across the traditional subject divides and benefit from learning experiences inside and outside the classroom. As a counterpoint to Jackson Carlaw's point, in addition to Holocaust education, children nowadays visit world war 2 battlefields much more frequently, which helps to educate them on the consequences of war.</p><p>Learning about the life of Anne Frank and reading her diaries can not only open young people's eyes to a different world but help them to reflect on the problems and challenges that they and their society face today.</p><p>The Government is giving the Holocaust Educational Trust annual funding of around &#163;214,000 for the next two years to run the<strong> </strong>lessons from Auschwitz programme. We also run a number of other initiatives, some of which I will mention shortly. On the point that was made about meeting the Anne Frank Trust, I can confirm that Scottish Government officials will meet the trust on 23 June.</p><p>Through that funding, around 400 senior pupils each year will be able to visit the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Government funding will enable pupils to travel to Auschwitz for only &#163;49 each. I speak from personal experience when I say that those visits are a profound experience for those involved. I went to a night that was organised by Beaconhurst school in my constituency to hear two young women talk about their visit to the death camp. Many people were there&#8212;parents, local politicians and others&#8212;and no one was left in any doubt of the impact that that trip had had on them and on those at the school who heard about it.</p><p>Each participant in those trips will share their experiences with their school and the wider community. That is the point&#8212;the trip is not just for the individual themselves. On 16 June, the First Minister will speak at a gathering of previous participants who have gone on to become student ambassadors for Holocaust education.</p><p>We have also been working closely with the Holocaust Educational Trust to ensure that those visits benefit pupils from across Scotland. We want to ensure, as I have mentioned, that the visits are closely aligned with the curriculum for excellence and the work of Learning and Teaching Scotland, through which the funding that I mentioned earlier is disbursed.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8212;the present Administration and the previous Administration&#8212;has supported Holocaust memorial day every year since 2001. The most recent event, which was in Paisley on 27 January 2009, attracted Government support of &#163;25,000. Learning and Teaching Scotland has enabled teachers who are involved in Holocaust education to go on <place-holder colnum=\"18434\"/> professional development study visits to Amsterdam and Berlin. Those trips have included visits to the Anne Frank museum in Amsterdam and Berlin's Anne Frank Zentrum, an educational museum.</p><p>We have also funded \"Testimony\", an exhibition about the Holocaust that features the personal recollections of Scottish survivors. That exhibition can be used in schools and communities to support Holocaust education.</p><p>As is evident from the speeches this evening, people remember the Holocaust and all the victims of Nazi atrocities with the positive aim of preventing anything like that from happening again. Tragically, however, nearly 65 years after the end of the second world war, genocide remains a threat in&#8212;as Hugh O'Donnell mentioned&#8212;places such as Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur. Like most people, I believe that education is one of the keys to ensuring that genocide is not allowed to take place again. We must ensure that young people grow up with an understanding of the events of the Holocaust and of how and why it was possible for it to happen.

Three months before her 16<sup>th</sup> birthday, she wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"what are you supposed to do if you become part of the suffering? You'd be completely lost. On the contrary, beauty remains, even in misfortune. If you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and regain your balance. A person who's happy will make others happy; a person who has courage and faith will never die in misery!\"</p><p>She also wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It's difficult in times like these; ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical.

We are committed to providing the best possible care for children and young people in Scotland. It is perhaps a truism to say that children are our future&#8212;in fact, it is a line in a song, as much as it is anything else. Nonetheless, it is true. Investing in our children is a way in which to invest in our future; it pays dividends in the long run.</p><p>Investing in a child's earliest years pays dividends in terms of their physical and mental health. It is for that reason that we have worked with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and other partners and stakeholders to develop the early years framework. Our aim is to maximise the opportunities for all children to get the best start in life, no matter their background or circumstances.</p><p>We also have a commitment to improve the mental health of children and young people. We work closely with NHS boards and partners to continue to address and progress the recommendations that were made in \"The Mental Health of Children and Young People: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care\". Full delivery of the framework by 2015 will ensure equity of access across Scotland to services that are designed to meet the particular prevention, care, transition and recovery needs of children and young people.</p><p>Our aim is to ensure that the right care and treatment are available for children and young people in the right place and at the right time. Our attention to child and adolescent mental health services is also underlined by a new target for NHS boards to deliver faster access to those services. The target will prepare the way for a new waiting time target for 2010-11. To support that, we are focusing attention on the workforce, services, data collection, quality of care, referral protocols and information systems. We have also offered NHS boards &#163;2 million of new money to accelerate the development of specialist CAMHS in-patient services and to support intensive community services.</p><p>We are investing in children and young people in other ways. In January this year, my colleague the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing <place-holder colnum=\"16651\"/> launched the \"National Delivery Plan for Children and Young People's Specialist Services in Scotland\", as guidance to the national health service in Scotland on the planning of sustainable specialist children's and young people's services throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14931875", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Project Linus UK"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I did not think that I would be speaking as early as this in the debate, Presiding Officer.

I mentioned the \"National Delivery Plan for Children and Young People's Specialist Services in Scotland\", which will provide guidance to the NHS. The plan was developed following a review of 12 specialist paediatric services that examined many issues, including accessibility of services, future service demands and workforce challenges. We are also committed to the development of two new children's hospitals, in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and are continuing to support the recently built Royal Aberdeen children's hospital and the recently opened children's hospital in Dundee.</p><p>The Government acknowledges the need to provide sustainable children's services in local district general hospitals throughout Scotland. To that end, last year we announced additional investment of &#163;13 million over three years&#8212;from 2008 to 2011&#8212;to implement the recommendations of the national delivery plan.</p><p>We also recognise the commitment to raise the age of admission to children's hospitals to 16 and that the needs of the 12-to-15 age group are different from those of both children and adults. Further guidance on that topic will be published next month; a national conference to address the issues will take place on 6 May.</p><p>We are also providing funding to voluntary organisations&#8212;of which Project Linus UK is a good example&#8212;that provide services for children and young people, including those in hospitals and hospices.

Like other members, I welcome representatives from the different parts of the Commonwealth to the Parliament.</p><p>Karen Gillon said that we might be able to learn something about minority Government from Canadians. All three of my children are Canadian citizens and although I have not learned much from them about minority Government I have certainly learned a lot about being a minority in my own family.</p><p>I, like other members, have visited a number of Commonwealth countries, particularly Canada, where I was involved in one of the university-level education exchanges mentioned earlier. Perhaps <place-holder colnum=\"15671\"/> unusually, I have also visited the Falkland Islands, which I would very much like to return to. I hear that it is much quieter now than it was when I was there. I believe that a former member of the Parliament, David Davidson, also visited the islands.</p><p>Scotland's historical links with Commonwealth countries are well known. I am pleased that, although the nature of the relationship with our partners has changed, the spirit of working together for peace, democracy, equality and good governance continues as a theme for the Commonwealth today. For her part, Scotland continues to look beyond her borders with a strong sense of social responsibility for those around us, regardless of their place in the world.</p><p>I believe that that is reflected in our international development policy, which was launched last May and which builds on the historical and contemporary relationships between Scotland and many Commonwealth countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. As Karen Gillon and others pointed out, our long-standing engagement with Malawi continues to go from strength to strength. Through the sub-Saharan Africa development programme we are developing programmes in two other Commonwealth countries&#8212;Zambia and Tanzania&#8212;and the international development fund has enabled us to support work in developing countries with vulnerable children who are at risk of abuse and exploitation.</p><p>In looking beyond our borders, we must also keep an eye on what others can teach us. The Scottish Government is determined to increase opportunities for all young people to experience international education in schools and we are working in partnership with organisations to ensure that international education is embedded in the school curriculum. As Peter Peacock made clear, international education presents an exciting range of opportunities for teachers to deliver many of the outcomes and experiences set out in the curriculum for excellence, the programme of change that we are introducing in our schools. If our young people are to participate actively in a global society, they will require a range of knowledge and skills, which international education will develop, to ensure that they not only grow up with knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland's place in it, but are tolerant, understanding and respectful individuals. Teacher exchanges, such as those organised by the League for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers, and study visits have a positive impact on learning and teaching in schools and provide an opportunity for teachers to reflect on their practice.</p><p>With regard to higher education, we want to continue to attract the brightest and best overseas <place-holder colnum=\"15672\"/> academic talent to help us build a smarter, wealthier and fairer Scotland. Our funding of both Commonwealth and Chevening scholarships will enable our universities to attract overseas students and therefore build on their links with developed countries such as Australia and Canada as well as to further relationships with developing countries, such as Malawi. I confirm from my own experience that the year in which I did an exchange course at university was by far the most fruitful year that I had there. It was certainly the most memorable year.</p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to building on the strong, historic and modern relationship between Scotland and India, as outlined by Ted Brocklebank. We are developing a new programme for the Indian sub-continent that will recognise not only our historical links with it, but reflect modern patterns of migration and cultural diversity in Scotland. The Scottish Government is working to develop those links. Last week, two Scottish ministers&#8212;Jim Mather and Mike Russell&#8212;met stakeholders to discuss where the Government could add value to the on-going activity and the forthcoming opportunities for strengthening our relationships with India.</p><p>The Glasgow Commonwealth games in 2014 have been mentioned. The Commonwealth has put its trust in Glasgow and Scotland to deliver those games, and we take that enormous vote of confidence from the international community very seriously. Scotland has been given a mandate to deliver the best games that it can, and I am confident that we will do just that. We are building a legacy plan with health as a unifying theme across a range of areas: health, sport, education, culture, volunteering, the environment, business, skills and employment, and tourism and international profile. The games can help to change people's attitudes by providing opportunities for young people to embody the Commonwealth Games Federation's values of humanity, equality and destiny.</p><p>The Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament have cultural links across the Commonwealth that are too numerous to list in this speech. Many will have celebrated those links in Burns suppers in the past few weeks. Last month, a contribution of &#163;200,000 from the Scottish Government enabled the Scottish Chamber Orchestra to become the first western orchestra to make a multidate tour of India. \"Black Watch\", which has recently received a number of honours, played across Australia to critical and popular acclaim.</p><p>Alongside culture, trade bonds the Commonwealth together. Scottish Development International has offices in India, Singapore, Canada and Australia. Next month, my colleague <place-holder colnum=\"15673\"/> Mike Russell, who is an enthusiastic member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, will attend two Scotland week events in Toronto and Vancouver. We look forward to strengthening those particular links.</p><p>In conclusion, the world has changed and the Commonwealth has changed with it. The Commonwealth is now more than ever a partnership of equals, as it must be. We live in a world in which we depend on one another for peace and prosperity. The peoples of the Commonwealth will continue to face their challenges. I commend the motion and Commonwealth day in general for recognising that those challenges are better met by independent states co-operating and consulting in the common interest.<place-holder colnum=\"15674\"/><place-holder time=\"17:38:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:38.</em></p>", "hdate": "2009-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14794170", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Commonwealth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "After listening to members, I am heartened by the chamber's support for the Commonwealth's work and assure the representatives of other Commonwealth countries in the gallery that, even though they have not been able to attend the debate, colleagues from all parties share that position.

If that were to happen, we should all relish the achievement, which would be an achievement for not only minority government but the inclusive politics for which we all stated our support at the outset, even if the latter has not been much in evidence thus far in the debate.<place-holder colnum=\"14668\"/></p><p>Even though saying this puts me at risk of being accused of crawling, I will say it: the achievement has a great deal to do with the businesslike and straightforward approach of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, not least in the way in which he dealt with the less-than-easy job of negotiating with several other parties&#8212;parties whose views diverge legitimately from those of his Government and, indeed, of other Opposition parties.</p><p>I am sure that, compared with the past few weeks, last year's budget process now seems like a cakewalk and that the cabinet secretary will take even greater satisfaction in the passing of this year's budget bill than he did in the passage of last year's. If it is passed today, the budget will represent an achievement above all for the Parliament. We know that there are many and vocal interests who seem happy only when the Parliament is seen to stumble, and it will be interesting to see how they use this situation to deride the Parliament again&#8212;as I am sure they will.</p><p>I will focus on an area in which, I believe, the budget has been substantially improved since we discussed it last week. It might not cost any money, and it has already been the subject of some derision by David McLetchie, but I believe that the commitment by some parties to co-ordinate their activities to promote borrowing powers for the Parliament is significant.</p><p>I mention that commitment not simply because it has been the subject of one party's discussions with the Scottish Government over the past week. I mentioned borrowing powers during the debate on the report from the Council of Economic Advisers, and I lodged a consensual motion on the issue two weeks ago. I have sought support from other parties for an agreed approach on borrowing powers, and I hope that those parties will encourage their members to support that motion, especially as we are discussing the matter tomorrow.</p><p>How powerful an argument it would be if the whole Parliament could agree on the need for more borrowing powers. It is easy to attach party-political considerations and party advantage to the initiative, but any party in the Parliament that harbours ambitions to govern in the future has to pause for only a second to realise how willing it would be to have those powers even in good economic times, far less during the current economic recession.</p><p>Wendy Alexander has previously mentioned the urgent action that is required to tackle the downturn. That is true both in absolute terms, with respect to how quickly action can be taken to help save and promote jobs, and in relative terms, with <place-holder colnum=\"14669\"/> respect to how quickly that can be done compared with other economies.</p><p>We are substantially behind the curve when it comes to borrowing powers, which are one of the fundamental tools that Governments are currently using to address the economic downturn. As we have heard from civic Scotland&#8212;this has been said, for example, by Reform Scotland, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Liberal Democrats and, in a previous debate, Malcolm Chisholm&#8212;there is general support for the idea of borrowing powers. However, at least not until now, there has been no real urgency on the issue.</p><p>In last week's debate, I said that the Calman commission could meet quickly to address the matter. There is no reason why it has to wait for its next meeting: it could meet quickly, agree a position&#8212;if there is consensus&#8212;and work with the Scottish Government, as now appears possible, on a joint approach to Westminster in order to deal with the issue as quickly as possible.</p><p>Public-private partnership is still a matter of division between the parties, and I do not intend to rehearse the arguments, but they are substantially superseded both by the new accountancy procedures that we will be obliged to follow in the late spring and by the fact that PPP projects down south are being delayed and deferred because of the lack of private finance for funding them.</p><p>We are perhaps behind civic Scotland on borrowing powers. All sorts of bodies have supported them in the past, and there is no reason why we cannot act quickly now. The fact that we appear to be moving quickly today to agree a budget that was not agreed last week shows that, when the Parliament wants to do something and when there is consensus, we can move very quickly. Members are giving their own reasons for their positions last week, which are not their positions this week, but, whatever those reasons, the severity of the economic downturn is one of the major things that have been playing on people's minds.</p><p>I do not mean this on a party basis, but there has perhaps been a time lag for some people in appreciating how severe the economic downturn is and how quickly it is happening. If we vote unanimously, or nearly unanimously, in favour of the budget, having moved very quickly through the three stages of the budget bill in one day, there is no reason why we cannot show the same urgency of action on borrowing powers.</p><p>Despite my sometimes harsh words towards the Liberal Democrats in the past, I appreciate the significance of their commitment to campaign against the &#163;500 million of cuts that are coming down to us. That will be a key subject of political <place-holder colnum=\"14670\"/> debate in future years, and to have support against the cuts is important.</p><p>Considering the various initiatives that members have mentioned&#8212;help for apprentices and building works, for example&#8212;we could do so much more in the short term if we had borrowing powers. Much more labour-intensive activity would be possible, which would help to soak up unemployment and provide opportunities for apprentices to go into real jobs. That is a crucial aspect in the Parliament's consideration of the current economic crisis.</p><p>Some parties might have fun having a go at each other today&#8212;that is part of the debate&#8212;but I hope that we can concentrate on the fact that, at least for a brief moment, we have some unanimity, consensus and a willingness to work in an urgent fashion.

Then, when that amendment was agreed to, they voted against the budget or abstained from the vote. This year, as we have already heard, Labour has been against the budget, then has been for the budget, and is now going to vote against it. Labour has chopped and changed. It has provided no alternative budget and lodged no amendments. I think that we can conclude that there is no principle behind what Labour is doing today.</p><p>That point was confirmed by Andy Kerr when he characterised Labour's view of the budget process as a game. It is not a game to council tax payers in Clackmannanshire, who will face a 29 per cent increase in council tax unless there is additional support for council tax freezes. It is not a game to people who would lose investment in infrastructure across Scotland. It is not a game to small businesses across the country that would lose the money from reduced business rates that is helping jobs. It is not a game to people who would lose their jobs without that assistance.</p><p>It is not a game to town centres such as that of Alloa.

We heard a great deal from Jackie Baillie about the different methods by which another budget could be produced, but whether or not it was true, it missed the basic point. One of the biggest problems that we face just now in the economy is a lack of confidence. If the Parliament fails to vote through the budget, councils throughout the country will be unable to budget with any certainty.

For that reason, it is timely and welcome. As the Scottish Government is currently bringing forward its economic recovery budget, the report suggests key actions to address the current economic crisis as well as the long-term challenges that we face as a country.</p><p>We have had a public debate that, in addition to concentrating on the current economic crisis, has raised questions about how much the Parliament and the Scottish Government can do; the size of the Government's budget; the extent of its powers; and the discretion&#8212;as opposed to standing obligations to spend&#8212;that it has within the budget.</p><p>The report highlights the current extent of our powers and acknowledges, in particular, the absence of borrowing and macroeconomic powers. There is a degree of relative unity among members about the gravity of the situation that we face and the need for action, and recommendation 20, which Jeremy Purvis mentioned, highlights the need to explore alternative borrowing powers outwith the current private finance initiative regime.</p><p>If it is true that we must be flexible, dynamic, innovative and bold in responding to any crisis, it is particularly true in the current economic crisis. The Parliament must show flexibility, innovation and boldness, and I suggest that the most effective thing the Parliament can do is unite behind the idea of establishing borrowing powers. I know that there are some disagreements about that among the parties, some of which say that the matter is being considered by the Calman commission, which is not yet ready to report. I understand that point, but in response I make the point that we are in a huge crisis. Given the news that we saw on television last night about further job losses and other economic indicators, it is obvious that we do not have a great deal of time to respond quickly and effectively to the crisis.<place-holder colnum=\"14268\"/></p><p>I do not think that the other parties have substantial objections to the idea or would rule out borrowing powers in principle. If we consider the other actors who have commented on the economic situation and their views on borrowing powers, it is clear that the matter should not necessarily divide the parties in the Parliament. Reform Scotland and the David Hume Institute have spoken in support of borrowing powers, while the STUC, which John Park mentioned a number of times in his opening speech, could not be clearer in its support for the establishment of borrowing powers for the Parliament. Unison and other trade unions also support the idea.</p><p>We should consider the anomalous position in which the Parliament and the Government find themselves in comparison with local authorities, which have been able to borrow for many years. In theory, their borrowing power was increased dramatically with the move to prudential borrowing and, rightly, the only limit on their potential to borrow is what they can properly service through their revenue streams, as long as they act in a prudential way.</p><p>The Northern Ireland Assembly can borrow up to between &#163;2 billion and &#163;2.5 billion, and even the Scottish Government, through its projects with Network Rail, can tap into borrowing powers to fund infrastructure projects for the railways. There is no logical reason why the Scottish Parliament, which is perhaps the most powerful of the devolved Parliaments and Assemblies, cannot borrow as well. Our inability to do so fundamentally limits our ability to deal with the current economic crisis.</p><p>Many people, including the economic advisers, have highlighted the need to bring forward infrastructure projects. The benefit of doing so is that it produces a long-term return to the country and the economy well into the future. Improvements to the country's infrastructure such as road bridges, rail projects, education projects or communication projects produce long-standing benefits, not least because they improve our economic situation compared with our competitors.</p><p>Borrowing powers are crucial at the best of times, but they are even more crucial at present because we need to establish new jobs and new public works. It is also the case that the economic downturn itself presents a great advantage. For example, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning recently announced &#163;21 million of funding for a new Forth Valley College in Alloa. That college will be built during a tough time for the construction industry, so we will get it for a good price; the existing college will, I hope, then be sold when the upturn comes, so we will get the <place-holder colnum=\"14269\"/> best price for it. There are opportunities, but they have to be taken quickly.</p><p>Yesterday, I lodged a motion on borrowing powers. I seek all members' support for going to the Westminster Government and asking for borrowing powers outwith any debates about fiscal autonomy, independence or further devolution. Our request would be a response to the current economic crisis, and I do not see any reason why any party in the Parliament should oppose that.</p><p>Such a move is a short-term measure that can be done fairly quickly. There are different views about whether it can be done by ministerial order or whether primary legislation is required, but whichever approach we take, we must respond quickly and imaginatively to the current crisis. Other economies throughout the world have developed quick responses, perhaps taking steps that they would not have taken before. The fact that we talk quite glibly these days about the nationalisation of the whole banking system shows how much things have changed.</p><p>I end with a plea that we try to achieve some consensus. The public would be grateful if the Parliament could establish borrowing powers that allowed us to take forward infrastructure projects. That would be a bold step towards dealing with the economic crisis.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621968", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill: Stage 3: \"First Annual Report of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers: December 2008\" (Scottish Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the cabinet secretary said, the council's report has been received during grave economic times.

I, too, highlight the point that Alasdair Morgan made about this necessary change being made at nil cost to the public purse, or at least as best the estimates can determine. As Alasdair Morgan also said, the debate is the culmination of a detailed piece of work to introduce a highly technical but necessary bill to bring the pension and grant schemes up to date.</p><p>Members of the Scottish Parliament are not alone in looking at pension provision and seeking to find cost-efficient and effective ways in which to plan for retirement, whenever that may come. In <place-holder colnum=\"14246\"/> November 2008, the Pensions Act 2008 introduced measures including a duty on employers to automatically enrol all eligible workers who were not already members of a good-quality workplace pension scheme into such a scheme and to provide a minimum contribution. The 2008 act also allows for the establishment of a new scheme&#8212;currently it is known as the personal accounts scheme&#8212;which is a simple, low-cost pension savings vehicle that is aimed at those who do not have access to a workplace pension scheme. Everyone needs to plan for their retirement.</p><p>With that in mind, I turn to the work that was undertaken on the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill. I thank Alasdair Morgan and the members of the Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme Committee for the work that went into producing the bill as introduced. Pensions have become shrouded in jargon and regulatory complexity. As the convener of the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill Committee, which scrutinised the bill at stage 2, I can say that our task was made more straightforward than it could have been by the input and obvious determination of the members of the scheme committee to make the provisions of the bill practicable, workable and relatively understandable. As Alasdair Morgan hinted, a lot of the work was done prior to the public proceedings of our committee.</p><p>Before the stage 2 proceedings, the committee held an informal meeting with the bill team to give members an insight into the policy development behind the bill. Also, to aid our scrutiny, we sought explanation of and clarification on the various provisions in the bill. A couple of weeks later, with committee members having had the opportunity to chew over the information, formal consideration took place.</p><p>The only amendments at stage 2 were those that were lodged by the member in charge&#8212;in the main, they were technical and tidying-up amendments. For example, it was important to make it clear that pension credit members of the scheme are prevented from becoming remunerated trustees of the scheme. Any member who benefits financially from the scheme should not receive financial benefit as a trustee. Deeming the amendments to be eminently sensible, the committee was content to accept them.</p><p>I appreciate the point that Alasdair Morgan made in saying that, even if the bill is passed today, our work to ensure that all the new arrangements are put in place is not an at end. Like him, I thank the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee for its on-going work to produce the necessary changes to standing orders. In addition, I thank the clerks to our committee.<place-holder colnum=\"14247\"/></p><p>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to the process and to today's debate.

However, it is unbelievable that such an argument can be made with any sincerity by a party that is committed to carving &#163;800 million out of the Scottish block every year. By my calculations, with &#163;800 million we could build a bridge over the Forth for buses, a bridge for bikes and a bridge for cars, with enough money left over to build an airport on either side. As long as Tavish Scott was not in charge of the project, we could also have free coffee and newspapers for every commuter.</p><p>Even if inadvertently, the Lib Dem amendment highlights the key issue, which of course is the anomalous position of the Scottish Government in terms of its inability to fund large-scale capital projects in the same way as individuals, businesses, local government and national Governments the world over&#8212;by borrowing to <place-holder colnum=\"14115\"/> invest. That is the real issue here, not whether there should be a bridge&#8212;all parties, with one honourable exception, believe that there should. Whether the bridge will be built is not an issue either, because the Scottish Government has confirmed its timetable and the fact that the money is available to build it. The issue is really about how the cost of the bridge should be funded. Thankfully, it appears that tolls have, if somewhat belatedly, been ruled out by new Labour. It would seem that iron man Iain Gray has overcome those such as David Whitton and Des McNulty who have refused to rule out tolls. Perhaps we can call that faction of the new Labour Party the tollies.</p><p>However, having adopted the love-child of the Tories and big business&#8212;PFI&#8212;and having showered it with gifts of hundreds of billions of pounds over a decade or more, the Labour Party, it seems, cannot let it go. Exactly how it could make PFI work on this project is not clear. Without tolls, there is no revenue bribe like that which made the Skye bridge, for example, such a lottery win for the Bank of America&#8212;and such a burden on taxpayers and toll payers. With the frozen credit markets, where would the private finance come from, and at what price? Most crucially, without the fig leaf of the off-balance-sheet con, what is the point of PFI?</p><p>On George Foulkes's \"constructive\" suggestions, I ask him to consider what funding a bridge project on such a scale would do to the capital projects of the local authorities that he mentions, particularly schools projects.</p><p>Having been on \"Newsnight\" with David Whitton, the deputy leader of the tollies, when he declared&#8212;solemnly and with an air of real menace&#8212;that he would ensure that the issues would come before the Parliament, I find it hard not to be a bit disappointed with the damp squib that is the new Labour amendment. I am also a bit disappointed by the unexplained absence of David Whitton. I do not know how significant that absence is.</p><p>Today's debate allows for three crucial points to be given prominence. First, the Scottish Government has ruled out tolls, and as a result has elicited a similar position from new Labour. Secondly, as the Tory amendment points out, it is now down to the two Governments \"to work together\" on the funding issue. Thirdly&#8212;and most important&#8212;borrowing powers have been brought into sharp relief.</p><p>Ironically, if we were talking about building a new Forth bridge, as opposed to a new Forth road bridge, borrowing would possibly be available through Network Rail's borrowing powers.

The figures are public and are readily available, as they are in the old budget documents. By my reckoning, about &#163;5.5 billion was given in 1999.

Those who still harbour doubts should listen to the chancellor's pre-budget report.</p><p>The UK economy is flatlining, borrowing is going through the roof, and fewer and fewer Labour politicians are willing to parrot the absurd claims of Brown and Darling that the UK is uniquely well placed to weather the recession. More and more people are realising that, through the crass mismanagement of the UK economy, the UK is uniquely poorly placed among G8 countries to deal with the chill wind that is now blowing. That is especially evident due to the UK's dependence on its housing market, its reliance on financial services and its willingness to spend billions of pounds on nuclear weapons and illegal wars.</p><p>However, the response from Gordon Brown is that we are not as badly overborrowed as some of the other G8 countries. Why not compare our borrowing with that of Ireland, which is another country that new Labour ministers in particular are always anxious to denigrate? Despite their troubles, the Irish expect their borrowing to rise to no higher than 24 per cent of their gross domestic product. We are looking at double that level here. Borrowing is set to rise to &#163;1.1 trillion in the next <place-holder colnum=\"12978\"/> five years, and that figure does not, of course, include the ever-increasing costs&#8212;around &#163;216 billion and counting&#8212;of new Labour's love affair with the PFI. I know that the scale and novelty of such sums make it difficult for people to fathom the nature and extent of the crisis that we are in, but I am equally sure that many people know in their heart of hearts and in a profound way that we have let down future generations for many years to come. Their prosperity has been hindered by our profligacy. They will be heavily indebted and taxed, and their life and employment opportunities will be inhibited because of the crisis. That is not to mention the increased new Labour threats to public services from the &#163;1 billion cuts that the cabinet secretary has spoken about.</p><p>People talk about the need to leave a legacy from the Olympics. Immediately after the Olympics have finished, we will be looking at a debt legacy of Olympian proportions. Many of us remember new Labour's nauseating election broadcast 18 months ago in which it was said that every family in Scotland would face a &#163;5,000 bill for Scottish independence. That sum is beginning to look like a bit of a bargain now that new Labour has reminded us that the cost of being part of the union will be &#163;25,000 per family.</p><p>It is undoubtedly true that the most culpable among us is the UK Government, which has failed to regulate, has perpetuated the lie not only that the PFI is cheap credit but that it is not really debt at all, and has squandered billions of pounds on warmongering. However, it is also true that each and every one of us has played a part in blowing up the bubble of debt.

The spending that we should support&#8212;as the Scottish Government is doing&#8212;includes that which is aimed at helping businesses and individuals, and that which helps to build future productivity and competitiveness, because we can rest assured that, when we come out of the debt tunnel some years hence, we will be in a landscape of ever-greater competition.</p><p>We should spend to invest, including in our environment. That is crucial. This is the time when we can undertake capital spending that will help us to meet both the aims in our competitive agenda and our environmental imperatives.

The members who have not been able to talk to the motion but who have instead used the debate for other purposes should take a leaf out of the book of Dennis Canavan, who is in the public gallery again and who has tried for many years to have St Andrew's day celebrated properly.</p><p>I am happy to take part in the debate for two reasons. The first is the long-standing interest that I have had in St Andrew's day since, some years ago, when I was leader of Clackmannanshire Council, I proposed that it should be a public holiday in the council area. The second reason is much more recent and relates to the People's Postcode Lottery. Before anyone suggests otherwise, I have no interests, as yet, to declare in that regard. However, it transpires that today many of my constituents in part of Kinross have become the winners of the first-ever St Andrew's day belter and will share &#163;1 million as a result. As we debate the significance of St Andrew's day and how and why we should celebrate it, my constituents in Kinross know exactly why they will celebrate that special day forever more.</p><p>I should clarify that my good friend and colleague the Minister for Parliamentary Business, although a resident of the fine town of Kinross, will have to satisfy himself with more traditional reasons to celebrate St Andrew's day. To coin a phrase and to refer to another lottery, he should be aware that you have to be in it to win it. I should also mention that the Kinross residents' win will be celebrated on St Andrew's day with a party in Kinross.</p><p>As I said, several years ago Clackmannanshire Council established St Andrew's day as a local holiday but, unfortunately, the decision was subsequently reversed by a Labour administration. <place-holder colnum=\"12913\"/></p><p>When I proposed the idea, I mentioned that it should perhaps be the kick-off for a winter festival that would run through to Burns night. I also suggested, although I would not do so now, that it might be a good idea to make it the first day on which people were allowed to go Christmas shopping. That was a personal ambition, but it did not work then and it perhaps would not go down well today. The day continues to be celebrated in Clackmannanshire. Tomorrow morning, Alva academy will have its second annual St Andrew's day awards, which John Beattie and I will attend. Strathdevon primary school will also hold events. It just so happens that my two sons go to those schools. It is good to hear from members that similar events are happening more widely throughout Scotland.</p><p>As others have said, although St Andrew's day is a Scottish event, it is also international. The St Andrew's cross furnishes the flag of Tenerife and the Russian naval ensign, as well as the other flags that members have mentioned. St Andrew was crucified in Greece, in the city of Patras, which now honours him and, of course, 30 November. Coincidentally, Patras is traditionally considered to be the birthplace of the Greek revolution for independence and against Ottoman rule in 1821. Before anyone accuses me of trying to make a national holiday a nationalist one, they should consider that, in Greece, there is no distinction between the two. As one of the definitions of nationalism is that it is the idea of supporting one's country and culture, I do not understand why some members are so afraid of being nationalists, or why some are afraid of being Scottish nationalists when they are happy to be British nationalists.</p><p>The SNP has been charged with using the saltire for political purposes. Those comments were made much more widely in the corresponding debate last year, but they were made again today by Pauline McNeill. The reason why that happens is that, in the past, the unionist parties have been afraid to use the saltire in any literature and have not been nearly as ready to use it as they have been ready to use the union jack. Famously, Tony Blair always had a union jack behind him when making public statements and we should remember his entry to Downing Street, with union jacks supplied by the Labour Party. The idea of a Britain day has been touted by the current Prime Minister. Members would do well to ensure that they are not in a glass house before they start throwing those stones. I recall from my time as an elections officer that, some time ago, Fife Council ordered the taking down of a saltire from one of its schools because it was seen to be eliciting support for the SNP&#8212;that was the returning officer's decision.</p><p>I do not really care whether St Andrew's day is <place-holder colnum=\"12914\"/> national or nationalist; such a discussion makes me think of angels, or perhaps patron saints, dancing on the head of a pin. I care that the day is accepted as a celebration of Scotland and its shared heritage with Europe and the wider world, which is sometimes all too easy to forget, and I associate myself with Pauline McNeill's remarks about anti-racism in that regard.</p><p>Last week I had the chance to speak at a conference in Edinburgh on issues relating to migration to Scotland. I will remember that conference for a long time, not least because, when I left after talking for too long, I found that I had a &#163;30 parking ticket&#8212;perhaps we could use such an innovation in Parliament. I mentioned at that conference that when people come to this country, we should take it as a real compliment that they want to make their future here. That contrasts with the fearful tones that we strike sometimes when we talk about immigration. A number of speakers at the conference who are involved with immigration were complimentary of both the Scottish Government's and the previous Scottish Executive's approaches to immigration through the one Scotland, many cultures theme.</p><p>The point has been made that although Scotland is internationalist, it has its own culture. We have to bear it in mind that many people come to Scotland to celebrate that culture, so we should not be afraid of displaying it or celebrating events such as St Andrew's day. We should be keen to let the world see what we can do through a revitalised St Andrew's day in a renewed Scotland.

Neither proposition stands reasonable scrutiny.</p><p>The best antidote to cant and posturing is the application of hard facts, although I realise that for the new Labour Party at least, the facts are difficult.

That is a legitimate aspiration, but it is not legitimate to pretend that it would not have impacted on the health budget.

Furthermore, it is political theatre at its most depressing level.

The crucial period in history, in this context, was not hundreds of years ago, but just a few months ago. That was when the Lib Dems joined the Labour Party's knee-jerk chorus that SNP members were villains and misers and, even worse, that the Scottish Government was supposedly perpetrating the most painful cuts since the French revolution. That was when the Lib Dems shouted for more money for universities, more money for housing, more money for class sizes and more money for hospitals&#8212;more, more, more. An observer would be forgiven for thinking of those times as the good old days.</p><p>Now, suddenly, the Lib Dems want to throw away &#163;800 million pounds like a rattle from a pram. I said in the past that when the Lib Dems speak in the chamber they often act as if they are still in coalition with the Labour Party. Perhaps the previous speech demonstrated that. It is also demonstrated by the fact that when Lib Dems speak in the chamber they frequently look across to the Labour benches for approval. It reminds me of children showing off to their parents. Now they have perhaps started growing up, and here we are in Holyrood, caught in the midst of their adolescent rebellion. The Lib Dems say that the change is not that they have been hit by political growing pains; they say that it is the big bad wolf come a-knocking, and that the UK economy has suddenly turned out to be a house of straw.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14186248", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rising Cost of Living"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will now address the motion.

Labour and Conservative members on the front benches&#8212;I excuse the back benchers who have spoken&#8212;have made fairly puerile attacks on independence. I was genuinely interested to find out what division the Labour amendment sought to highlight, in order to see whether it was anything <place-holder colnum=\"11804\"/> more than the usual default position of decrying any lead that is taken by the Scottish Government. It reminded me of somebody&#8212;Baroness Thatcher&#8212;who I know inspires our current Prime Minister. She said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Where there is discord, let there be harmony\",</p><p>but instead we seem to have the opposite, in the manufacturing of a fairly synthetic amendment to try to draw a division.</p><p>The new diversity&#8212;which Jamie Hepburn spoke about earlier&#8212;within the British-Irish Council has led to a new sense of purpose and energy in engagement with other such bodies, and with other institutions within the European Union. Like Jamie Hepburn and Margo MacDonald, however, I would prefer the title of council of the isles.</p><p>As one of this Parliament's members of the European Committee of the Regions, it strikes me that the commonalities and the common interests of the nations and Governments in the British-Irish Council are very obvious when one engages in that committee, which has 27 members from the 27 EU member states. One very quickly finds oneself&#8212;as I recently did&#8212;in the company of people from Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England. At the recent meeting, a Plaid Cymru member of the National Assembly for Wales, a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords, a Labour member of North Lanarkshire Council, a number of the Irish representatives and I all quickly found each other's company, because there is a great deal of shared history and neighbourliness between our countries. That is natural, and we will have to keep hold of it even once Scotland becomes an independent state. It will be in all our interests to ensure that we are still good neighbours, and that we collaborate in areas of common interest.</p><p>One of the lessons from the European Committee of the Regions that the British-Irish Council exemplifies is the fact that interregional and international groupings are the way in which most countries in Europe seek to exert their influence. The Irish, of course, are past masters at that, but I recently had an approach from a French provincial representative who was seeking to establish a new North Sea grouping within the European Committee of the Regions because of the shared interests there. Even large states such as France, therefore, recognise that interregional and international groupings are the way to find common interests and to promote those interests through international bodies. That is very much in the spirit of the British-Irish Council, and there is no reason why the things that that body discusses cannot be used to promote the interests of its constituent parts in other bodies.<place-holder colnum=\"11805\"/></p><p>It seems to me that the increased prosperity in Northern Ireland since the peace agreement and the development of the council holds out opportunities for the other parts of the body. What is important in that regard is not just prosperity&#8212;which goes further than the British-Irish Council and relies on European Union and United States support&#8212;but the engagement that now exists. For example, there is now much more familiarity with the situation in Northern Ireland in the other parts of the islands that we inhabit. People in Northern Ireland often felt that they were known for only one thing, but the multidimensional nature of Northern Irish society is much more to the fore these days. That is certainly what they would say.</p><p>However, I can tell Parliament of the bemusement and, indeed, anger among Irish representatives about allegations that have been made&#8212;especially by somebody called Murphy&#8212;that denigrate the Irish Republic. Those allegations have really hit home among people in the Irish Government and Opposition parties. That will become more obvious as time goes on. It has been claimed that Ireland is in some way insolvent, yet it has the same problems with budget deficit and debt, on almost exactly the same scale, as the UK Government.</p><p>This might not be a popular cause, but I also decry the despicable bullying of Iceland by the UK Government.

It is good to have the chance to debate this issue on the back of the success of what we prefer to call the Alloa to Stirling line, rather than the Stirling to Alloa line.</p><p>As Richard Simpson mentioned, he and I are veterans of a successful rail campaign. It is interesting to note the pattern that such campaigns have followed. As the person who proposed the public transport fund bid for Clackmannanshire Council and, subsequently, the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine Railway and Linked Improvements Bill, which was promoted by Clackmannanshire Council, I see an emerging pattern, but there is one difference between the campaigns. A huge number of agencies were involved in the Stirling to Alloa project, which was in a state of considerable flux. Although the current campaign is still relatively fragmented, there is more stability, so it should be easier to get the initiative off the ground.</p><p>It is fair to say that consideration of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine link, if we may call it that, is essential to the discussion. That line is mostly used by passengers, but some freight travels on it. If we did not have it, we would not be discussing what we are discussing. For many people in Clackmannan, Kincardine and Culross, the discussion is not about a new connection, but a chance for their villages to get on the national passenger network.</p><p>Several members have mentioned the popularity of the new line. It has been projected that more than 400,000 people will use it this year, which is far more than the estimates on which the project was predicated. That is testament to the fact that <place-holder colnum=\"11547\"/> there is increasing interest in and demand for rail services&#8212;I think that Jim Tolson spoke about that.</p><p>I have had a number of meetings with Ian Chisholm of the south east of Scotland transport partnership, and am pleased that that partnership is proposing a study. I have also met the minister to discuss the matter. Obviously, there are many demands on his budget, especially with the new Forth crossing, but the door has not been closed on considering the project. Today, there was a useful meeting with Network Rail, which some members were able to attend. We found out about the practical problems that exist and the different options that are available, depending on what is intended. We may go for a stage-by-stage approach. Obviously, there are straightening works to be done, and there are additional signalling requirements. Those of us who were involved in the work on the Alloa line will know how central signalling was to the problems that were endured in that project. There is a lack of signalling capacity and expertise, especially in design, in this country. I think that we had to rely on signal designers from India and eastern Europe.</p><p>Different options are available, but the most essential thing is that we get things off the books with a study. The Scottish transport appraisal guidance 1 study that SEStran, I think, proposed will go only so far; the active involvement of Transport Scotland in a study is crucial. As Richard Simpson said, commitment is not needed; it can simply consider the options and the costs. Such a study would not be definitive by any means, but it would certainly give us a better idea of the passenger demand that exists and the benefits that would result. The wider benefits to central Scotland, not only the benefits that would result to the local area, were crucial to winning the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line.</p><p>It is also important that we do not forget the options at Rosyth. As a result of the efforts of the minister and others on the ferry link with Europe, a real possibility exists of having a genuinely integrated transport network. Freight and passengers can come directly from Europe and go straight on to Edinburgh or Glasgow. Freight can then go on to Ireland. There is real potential for integrated rail improvements to the transport network in my part of Scotland. In the meantime, we can consider, for example, direct links from Alloa to Edinburgh, which could also go the other way. That would certainly improve that service even further.</p><p>I am delighted that the motion has been lodged. We are at the start of a process. Through Clackmannanshire Council, I have called for Fife Council to become engaged in the project for two <place-holder colnum=\"11548\"/> and a half years.

People move and the current system is perfectly able to track those changes, even when people are being paid&#8212;or not&#8212;from Lithuania.</p><p>The tactic of the threat to withhold moneys is of a piece with the general themes of keeping us in our place and, by intimidation, discouraging any deviation from Westminster-approved changes. For me, the most disappointing aspect of that approach is that the Scottish branches of the UK parties have used the tactic with such gusto, with some honourable exceptions. Of course, with Labour, the London Labour line was always going to be preferred to independent thought or any notion of the Scottish interest. However, it is beyond doubt that the &#163;400 million belongs to Scotland. Alistair Darling, whose view one would think would count for something, said in 1997 that, under devolution, council tax benefit and housing benefit</p><p class=\"indent\">\"will come within the Block for the first time.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, House of Commons</em>, 9 December 1997; Vol 302, c 511W.]</p><p>At this point of the argument, those who are too afraid to let go of the council tax&#8212;maybe we can call them the council tax cling-ons&#8212;adapt their argument from saying that it is not our money but is graciously dispensed to us by Westminster as part of the union dividend, to saying that it might be our money but it comes with strings attached. Because it is called council tax benefit, they say, we must use it for that purpose. One can understand why those in the Tory and Labour parties who never wanted devolution use that argument, but, more is the pity, it seems to have become a mainstream argument rather than one that is confined to the extreme unionist fringes of those parties.</p><p>One clear contradiction in the arguments on a local income tax is that some of those who oppose it say that they are in favour of local decision making, of councils taking responsibility for their decisions and of local democracy. However, they make those arguments while defending the hugely centralising effects and intent of the council tax regime. Since the 1970s, successive Labour and Tory Governments have sought to constrain and limit the financial freedom of local government&#8212;a fact rather than a matter of party contention for any student of local government. Whether it was the poll tax, rates or council tax, the aim was to control councils by cutbacks, capping or ring fencing.</p><p>The Scottish Government has made a good start in three of its actions&#8212;getting rid of ring fencing, increasing the share of the Scottish budget that goes to local government and providing extra <place-holder colnum=\"11397\"/> resources to allow councils to choose to freeze the council tax.

The debate is important for a large swathe of Scotland's population. For propriety, I declare an interest. Veterans Scotland's definition of a veteran is anybody who has served in the United Kingdom armed forces&#8212;regular or reserve&#8212;and, for a short period a long time ago, I served with the Royal Marines.</p><p>I would like to say how many are in the veterans community in Scotland, but all that anyone has to go on is estimates. In 2005, research by the Royal British Legion estimated that just over 1 million were in the ex-service community in Scotland. Half those people are former service personnel and the rest are their families. In both categories, most members of the community are at the older end of the scale&#8212;three quarters are over 55 and 60 per cent are over 65. Most of our veterans are senior citizens, but tens of thousands of ex-service personnel who are in their 20s and 30s also face special challenges, not to mention the challenges that their partners and children face.</p><p>This is a members' business debate, so I do not want it to become a partisan session in which the Scottish Government is congratulated on excellent work&#8212;perish the thought&#8212;but it is important to recognise at the outset that the Scottish Government has gone out of its way to examine the problems that veterans encounter. The Parliament is not responsible for our citizens when they are in uniform, but when they leave service we are responsible for supporting them in their <place-holder colnum=\"11140\"/> health, their housing and their chances for learning and training. I therefore welcome the Scottish Government's initiatives in that regard. From my contact with the charities that work with veterans, I know that they appreciate the Scottish Government's intent and genuine effort. I am sure that the minister will be all too happy to detail the initiatives.</p><p>The growing concern in the Scottish Government and in wider society about the issues that veterans face is mirrored by greater awareness of those problems. Cross-party effort in the Parliament has created the formal cross-party group on supporting veterans. I am delighted to be a vice-convener of that group. Its convener is Jeremy Purvis and it has Labour and Conservative vice-conveners.</p><p>There could be many reasons for the growing awareness of veterans issues; I will suggest one. Yesterday, <em>The Herald</em> reported that 1,500 Scots are preparing to start a tour of Afghanistan next year. The legacy of fighting protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is bringing home the reality that we as a society need to support the veterans who return from those conflicts. This week, 150 Royal Highland Fusiliers returned from Afghanistan.</p><p>People join the armed forces for many reasons and&#8212;as I can testify&#8212;often at a young age. They also take on an obligation that is required by few other paths in life&#8212;to put life and limb on the line. I disagree with the Iraq war, but I reject the idea that&#8212;whether from malice or ignorance&#8212;we should condemn those whom presidents and prime ministers send to fight such wars.</p><p>In America, where veterans have historically been held in higher and more general regard than is the case here, it is well recognised that the burden of fighting a war and surviving its aftermath always falls most heavily on those who start with the least. I learned recently at a veterans day film festival in Stirling that the number of suicides among Argentinean veterans of the Falklands war is nearly the same as the number of Argentinean deaths in combat in that war. That statistic is appalling and I worry about what the equivalent figure might be for forces from Scotland and the UK.</p><p>Even without active service in conflict, the military lifestyle is the furthest from a regular 9-to-5 job that can be imagined. It is intense and at all times close and personal. It is no pun to say that it is regimented to the last detail. Moving from that to a lifestyle in which the first stop is most likely to be a college or a job centre is a radical change that can affect a person profoundly. Veterans Scotland brings together 31 organisations and charities whose work is dedicated to helping with all aspects of that transition for many years&#8212;sometimes even a lifetime&#8212;after. Organisations <place-holder colnum=\"11141\"/> deal with specific services, types of welfare and forms of recruitment. The problems in practice are no less varied. Listing all the issues that face veterans in those circumstances would be impossible in an hour, so I will not try to list them all.</p><p>I mentioned the mental health of the ex-service community. While national attention focuses on alcohol abuse, we should consider whether veterans have a particularly difficult relationship with alcohol and substance abuse, and take that into special consideration in our national strategies.</p><p>There is also a widespread problem in housing. Although the difficulties that some veterans face are shared by the mainstream, other veterans need adapted housing and specialist help or would benefit from being part of a certain community. Recently, I suggested that veterans housing charities should have first priority, or more favourable terms, when the Ministry of Defence sells off land or property. The idea is interesting, and the Scottish Government could explore it further with Whitehall.</p><p>I am delighted that the cross-party group has managed to achieve an undertaking from the MOD that it will attend all our meetings. The issues are difficult to address if the Scottish Government or Westminster try to address them alone. Collaboration is important in all of this.</p><p>There are, of course, many other possibilities. I recommend that all members read Poppyscotland's \"Meeting the Need: A report into addressing the needs of Veterans living in Scotland\". I am pleased that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has taken forward the concerns that I and others have raised on the location of fatal accident inquiries that result from the deaths overseas of Scottish and Scotland-based personnel. As we have heard, it can be traumatic for families, who wait years for an FAI to take place, not only to have to travel down south but to remain there for the duration of what can be protracted investigations. Furthermore, an FAI can make families relive events that they may have been trying to forget.</p><p>Much is being done, but much remains to be done. I am sure that other members will add their personal experience and that of their constituents and organisational contacts. I am delighted to have secured the debate and that it has given the chamber the opportunity to debate the subject.</p><p>Whatever else Holyrood does, Scots who have fought in wars or worn a uniform, and their partners and families, deserve nothing less than to be centre stage in our considerations.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans Support"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the members who signed the motion, which allowed the debate to take place.

Unlike George Foulkes, I believe that we have come a long way towards global citizenship as a country. I am glad to have this chance to take a moment to pause and consider, now that we have begun to shoulder the responsibilities that come from that global citizenship.</p><p>The report has two themes. One is the review of how the international development programme has worked so far and how it can be improved; and the other is the much wider issue that has been raised of mainstreaming international development practice across all Government activity.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank, Jack McConnell and others have mentioned Malawi and, during the evidence-taking sessions in the committee, the importance of infrastructure and capacity building in particular was emphasised by those with most direct experience. With regard to the idea of helping others to help themselves and ensuring that projects are sustainable beyond the end of aid, I agree with Jamie Hepburn's point about the need to move beyond the straightforward donor-and-beneficiary relationship. The evidence from Lloyds TSB&#8212;perhaps soon to be Lloyds TSB HBOS&#8212;and the Hunter Foundation was particularly <place-holder colnum=\"10888\"/> interesting because of the way in which they had, in a way, bypassed the operations of the governmental organisations in order to do their own thing. The question of cui bono&#8212;who benefits?&#8212;is borne in mind by people on the ground more than it is by Government officials. It is interesting to note that DFID spends more on consultants than does any other Whitehall department; by some estimates, it spends up to &#163;700 million on consultants, compared with the &#163;9 million and rising for our entire international development programme. From the evidence that we took, I understand that that is exactly what the organisations that do the most valuable work seek to avoid.</p><p>The success of the programme, the huge funding increase from the Scottish Government, the cross-party support, and the expansion to the Indian sub-continent and to sub-Saharan Africa were all appreciated, which brings me to the second, broader matter. The saying in the medical profession \"First do no harm\" is a worthy principle that is as valid for the treatment of the global problems of poverty and underdevelopment as it is for the treatment of the sick and the dying. It comes as no surprise to see in the report that the charities and civic organisations that I have mentioned have pushed that to the top of the agenda.</p><p>We have heard about the procurement situation. The Scottish public sector spends around &#163;30 billion per year of which, according to the report, around &#163;8 billion is spent on goods and services. As Alex Neil, the deputy convener, pointed out in the committee, not all of that &#163;8 billion can be used in the way that has been suggested, for practical reasons, but it is clear that not enough progress has been made in that area.</p><p>However, there is a double jeopardy for the Scottish Government. The UK Government has to look over its shoulder at what the European Commission might examine, and we have to look over our shoulder at what the UK Government might say. Robin Harper asked why we do not just write to Westminster. However, why has Westminster not said, \"You can do this\"? That would be a simple thing to do. Why has no Labour member said that Westminster should have given the lead?</p><p>The UK is the member state in this regard as it carries out the negotiations between Governments, and it could have given a very simple lead. If the issue is so pressing, why has it not been taken up by the Westminster Government? Guidance issued by that Government would have been ideal. Throughout Europe, people say that the UK Government gold plates legislation instead of taking the most <place-holder colnum=\"10889\"/> practical approach, which is why the Dutch have moved so much further ahead than we have.</p><p>In recent years, equality and non-discrimination have become a thread that runs through every organisation, but we are now also beginning to consider the environmental impact of action. In the Scottish Parliament, any laws that are passed must, as Robin Harper mentioned, include a statement that they comply with human rights. The Scottish Government is also bound by that legislation. In the longer term, a big change would be to add global social impact as another criterion to the list, rather than sitting in a corner that we have marked off as fair trade. We could then take that into account in all our work. As far as I know, the Scottish Government is open, as we all are, to that idea.</p><p>As a country, we are teaching the importance of citizenship as part of the curriculum for excellence, and we are open to that idea as a country. It is important to take two lessons away from the report: how the programme works, and how we can embed it throughout society and in government. Scotland's actions to fight poverty and relieve suffering on the international stage are one of the many reasons to be proud of this country.</p><p>We perhaps find most evidence of that in schools, as Robin Harper said. Kinross school, which Jack McConnell visited when I mentioned it to him, and Dunblane high school both have relationships with Malawi, as does the school from East Lothian that appeared before the committee. There is passion and meaning in those relationships when children are involved and have direct experience of the lives of children in Malawi; it motivates them in a lifelong way.</p><p>The potential for Scotland's contribution to the world would expand a thousand times over if we moved from being treated as little more than a province as we are now&#8212;as we heard eloquently from Lord Foulkes&#8212;to being a proper member of the global society of independent states. Before the partisan hackles start to rise, however, I will say that, whatever we might be able to do to help international development under a different constitutional situation, I am glad that we seem to be making quite a good job of what we can do here and now.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14002440", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I apologise to you and to the convener of the European and External Relations Committee for not being here for the start of the debate.

However, there is also a virtue in bringing a fresh eye to such matters.</p><p>I do not disagree with members' comments about the difficult and complex nature of such cases and with the observation that, at a time when emotions are running high, it is very hard to focus people's attention on the child's interests. However, we cannot stand back from the consequences that have been presented to us simply because there are extreme difficulties. If we have evidence that the rights of individuals are being left behind or ignored, as the motion and the examples that Nigel Don gave suggest, the law must be examined. Of course everybody wants mediation to happen where it can, and the collaborative initiatives that have been talked about are welcome, but in the final analysis, if the law is not working in the interests of everyone involved and is not protecting everyone's rights, it must be looked at.<place-holder colnum=\"10835\"/></p><p>Robert Brown knows far more than I do about the sanctions relating to contact orders that are available to the courts, but the representations that I have received suggest, for reasons that Robert Brown and Christine Grahame mentioned, that there is little evidence that the courts are willing to impose penalties. Sometimes that may be for obvious reasons. For example, in whose interest would it be in such circumstances to imprison a parent? However, if a parent wilfully ignores a contact order that a court has made, we must acknowledge that the other parent's rights have been trampled on. If we accept that the interests of the child must be at the centre of things, we must accept that the rights of one of the child's parents not being respected cannot be in that child's interests.</p><p>It is obvious that when a parent with custody of a child breaks a court order for access, there will be no quick resolution to the problem, and usually no penalty will be imposed on that parent. The parent without custody of the child must then go through the courts again and engage in what can often be a long drawn-out and expensive process&#8212;it can also be emotionally trying, as has been mentioned. Obviously, that can have an effect on parents' relationships with their children.</p><p>Lewis Macdonald rightly spoke about many of the legal issues in the background of the main case that Nigel Don highlighted. However, as far as I can determine, the simple fact is that a parent was deprived of access to their child for seven entire years and was falsely accused of a fairly horrendous crime. That is the information that I have. If that can happen, the law must be examined.</p><p>In the case of unmarried parents, schools and other authorities often advise the parent who has custody of the child on issues relating to the child, but the other parent is not advised. I also understand that the non-resident parent is not advised of children's panel issues.</p><p>There are issues, and it is right that, for the reasons for Nigel Don gave, a legal resolution to such problems should at least be considered.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13979328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Family Law Disputes"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Nigel Don for his motion, which I was happy to support when it was first lodged, and for the eloquent and reasoned way in which he set out his case.

The full details of that complaint are set out in the report that the committee published on 10 July 2008, which also includes a detailed report on the complaint by the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. It is important to remind members that the committee is unaware of any complaint made to the commissioner until the commissioner reports to the committee at the end of stage 2 of the complaints process, and that his investigation is entirely independent of the committee.</p><p>In summary, the complaint was that the member failed to register in the register of members' interests within the required timescales 10 donations above &#163;520 in value that were made to her campaign for the leadership of the Labour group of MSPs. Paragraph 6 of the schedule to the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Act 2006 requires that members must register any interest if the member receives or has received</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a gift of heritable or moveable property or a gift of a benefit in kind and ... the value of the gift, at the date on which it was received, exceeds 1 per cent of a member's salary on that date ... and ... that gift meets the prejudice test.\"</p><p>Section 3(2) of the act states:<place-holder colnum=\"10438\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"An interest meets the prejudice test if, after taking into account all the circumstances, that interest is reasonably considered to prejudice, or to give the appearance of prejudicing, the ability of the member to participate in a disinterested manner in any proceedings of the Parliament.\"</p><p>The act requires that interests are registered within 30 days of the date on which the member acquires that interest.</p><p>The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee considered and agreed the following findings of fact made by the commissioner. Between 15 August and 14 September 2007, the member engaged in a campaign to be elected leader of the Labour group of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament. Donations towards the cost of that campaign were received from individuals and organisations and paid into the WA campaign account, to which the member was not a signatory. Ten of those donations were of a value over the registration threshold of &#163;520 for gifts. They were banked between 31 August and 5 November 2007. Although the member did not have direct ownership or control of the campaign funds, she had a beneficial interest in them. Contrary to a claim that was implied in the complaint, the campaign team was not a company or partnership. The member made no entry relating to the relevant donations under gifts in the register of members' interests within 30 days of their receipt. The member sought and received written advice from the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee clerks on 8 November 2007. That advice was to the effect that registration of the donations in the register of interests was not required. The advice was sought after the deadline for registration of around half of the donations had passed.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948565", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Act 2006 (Breach)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members should excuse my breathlessness.

Daiglen of Scotland is based in Tillicoultry. It is the last of a long line of textile and tartan-producing concerns across the hillfoots of the Ochils. It is where I got my most recent kilt. AS Campbell is based in Alva, and the oldest manufacturer of tartan is in Bannockburn, part of which is in my constituency.</p><p>To my mind&#8212;although I am not nearly as expert as some previous speakers&#8212;the bill is about using the credibility and integrity that would arise from the establishment of a register for the further <place-holder colnum=\"10055\"/> exploitation, if I may use that word, of the commercial and cultural potential of tartan. That is entirely right.</p><p>Although we should consider classification and accept the reason for it, we should not be at all snobbish about tartan. What Rob Gibson had to say was true: many people have tartans for many reasons, and we should not seek to circumscribe those reasons. We obviously wish to protect tartans with an ancient history and a cultural background, but people will see that from the register and will know exactly what kind of tartan they are looking at.</p><p>We have heard about modernists and wovenists, but not yet about a woven modernist. I am not sure what that would look like. We could also have dye-hard wovenists&#8212;is that a woven one that is hard to dye? I am not sure. Anyway, we should not be snobbish about classification, and we should make it as open as possible.</p><p>Kenneth Macintosh was right to say that Celtic and Rangers have their own tartans. So does Hibernian. It is a very nice green tartan that I am holding up now, if anybody is interested to see it. As Elaine Murray said, all the Canadian provinces have a tartan, which have official status in Canada. The Royal Marines have a tartan, which surprised me more than the fact that the United States Marine Corps have a tartan, too. Our universities have tartans&#8212;and even individual university departments are now declaring that they have a tartan. Apparently the Hare Krishna movement has its own tartan. I find that very interesting. On a more serious note, the veterans have the Erskine tartan, which is interesting to note as we are about to go into veterans week.</p><p>Members have spoken about their own tartans. I have a choice of two. I was surprised to hear Stuart McMillan say that he has a choice of six. One of my choices is the MacMillan tartan; the other is Lamont. The MacMillan was named, I think, after a haircut sported by a 12<sup>th</sup> century monk&#8212;which counts against using that one. The clan motto, which Stuart McMillan mentioned, contains the word \"disco\", which put me off a wee bit&#8212;although it means \"I learn\" in Latin. The clan fought at Bannockburn, of course.</p><p>Lamont, to commend it, is believed to have come from the Norse for \"law man\". It is associated with great legends of the statesman-like rulers of Cowal and Argyll of Irish and Norse descent. As against that, we have Johann Lamont, John Lamont and Norman Lamont. In any event, I chose the Lamont tartan in the end because it is nice and is more like the Hibs tartan.</p><p>The bill has a lot to commend it.

However, that means that the policy becomes environmentally unsustainable, because buildings that are, in many respects, worthy of refurbishment simply get torn down.</p><p>Moreover, developers do not like refurbishments as they often preclude the sweetheart deals that they manage to strike over land for developments that have nothing to do with the school and are often built at the expense of playing facilities and green space for children.<place-holder colnum=\"9461\"/></p><p>I have known councils to change the location of proposed schools because the developer wanted it that way. In our scheme, for example, we had to take out the children's whiteboards at the developer's request and cover the cost of demolishing one of the schools because the developer refused to fund it at the previous price.</p><p>The SFT model outlined by the cabinet secretary will have the virtue of putting those who use&#8212;and those who pay for&#8212;our new schools back in charge of where they are located and what facilities they have.</p><p>Why did the local Labour Party exchange the trust model that the SNP had won for the present PFI scheme? The debate on the subject that took place in the council chambers when the decision was taken was fascinating. It is worth recalling that not one Labour councillor was prepared to advance a single argument for the merits of PPP; indeed, most of them said that they did not like or want it. The only argument for accepting it was the clich&#233; that we have had to listen to for a number of years&#8212;it is the only game in town. That was the reality as those Labour councillors saw it. The picture that Andy Kerr painted, whereby there was a kind of schools supermarket in which, on arrival at the checkout, a council would be asked whether it would like to pay for its new schools through traditional borrowing, through the use of a trust or by putting them on a PPP gold credit card, is not an accurate representation.</p><p>The argument that PPP is the only game in town&#8212;that there is no alternative&#8212;is one of intellectual poverty. It means that the merits of any given proposal are not considered. PPP is a Thatcherite policy with a Thatcherite slogan: \"There is no alternative.\" Everyone knows that, under Labour, PPP was the only game in town when it came to our schools.

However, it is worth bearing in mind the fact that we are dealing with a scheme that was advanced by the previous Administration.</p><p>That is not to say that there are no potential problems, as John Park said. I will concentrate on the areas in my constituency that will be affected: the Gartarry roundabout, which has been mentioned, and places along the A977, such as Crook of Devon, Blairingone and Forest Mill, which will experience a substantial increase in traffic and, along with Kincardine, currently experience a huge effect when the Forth road bridge is closed to high-sided vehicles.</p><p>It is important that the required refurbishment of the Kincardine bridge is carried out. I will wait to hear what the minister says, but I am not convinced of the feasibility of not having a full closure. The better solution might be traffic calming measures, as has been mentioned. I hope that they will be considered.</p><p>It is right to raise those issues, but this is a great day for Clackmannanshire, the area surrounding it <place-holder colnum=\"8755\"/> and Kincardine, because today, the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail line was open for the first time in 40 years. I was pleased to attend that opening earlier with the minister.</p><p>The bridge will have a huge impact on traffic. Looking further down the line, we could have four bridges, but there will inevitably be disruption in the meantime as one of them is constructed or substantially refurbished. Having spoken to the local councillor for Kincardine&#8212;or the chap who was the local councillor; his ward is now larger&#8212;again this morning, I appreciate that the town has seen the benefit of the bypass of late, but that it will face a surge of traffic when the bridge closes.</p><p>Despite that, I am delighted that the new bridge is being built. I am hopeful that the minister will take the right decision and call it the Clackmannanshire bridge. We have been asking for that for some time, but we will have to wait and see how the decision goes. I am sure that it will go the right way if it is down to the efforts of people in Clackmannanshire, who have written in. We will see.</p><p>I know that this does not address the precise point that John Park raised, but I hope that, in the longer term, the passenger service that now runs from Stirling to Alloa will go right the way through Kincardine and on to Rosyth and Dunfermline. I have not addressed that point to the minister as yet, but I am sure that he will hear about it. If we can create an integrated transport system that takes people and goods from west to east and vice versa right across the north side of the Forth, it will have a huge impact on Kincardine and all the other places that John Park and Jim Tolson mentioned.</p><p>I am happy to have taken part in the debate. John Park has raised some issues of real concern, and I am hopeful that the minister will deal with them as well as they can be dealt with.

As we all know, a broad range of wider macroeconomic and social consequences is attached to that rise.</p><p>I would prefer that we were back in the days when whether one knew the price of milk was a frivolous journalistic question rather than the serious question that it is now. Now, especially for people on lower incomes, the question is foremost in people's minds locally and around the world.</p><p>As we have heard, put simply, the global market is failing and prices are soaring. For example, the average world price of rice has gone up by 217 per cent. That is one thing for those of us who enjoy curry dishes&#8212;as at least one or two of the members present do&#8212;but it is quite another for the more than 500 million people in India and China who, despite their countries' economic growth, according to the United Nations still live on the equivalent of $1 a day.</p><p>We have gone over the causes already: the effect of high oil prices on fertility and transportation; droughts and poor harvests that may or may not be related to climate change; the growing middle classes in some parts of the world spending money on larger and richer diets, particularly in China, where there is a growing demand for meat products, which, of course, consumes other basic products; and the poor implementation of biofuel expansion, which draws on land that was previously used for farming. It is a sobering fact&#8212;to add to the other facts&#8212;that the amount of maize needed to fill one tank of petrol is the same as the average African eats in a year.</p><p>There are lessons from history that many Governments so far have not learned. The famines of the 1980s and the debt crisis that began then&#8212;which, despite the fantastic efforts of the make poverty history movement, still plagues most of the developing world&#8212;all stem from a first <place-holder colnum=\"8150\"/> great wave of movement in agriculture away from growing food towards growing cash crops such as cotton or coffee. The idea was that those luxuries would raise more money, which would allow the farmers to buy food with room to spare. Of course, the price of coffee went down and the price of grain went up; and the poor stayed poor and hungry.</p><p>I am glad that the Parliament is discussing the matter. It is as weighty and immediate as it is domestic and global. I am pleased to see that we have been remarkably consensual&#8212;in fact, almost unanimous&#8212;in the face of it. We must also look beyond the causes and determine what can be done. Anyone who has seen the television pictures of the situation in Haiti&#8212;where starvation is now a real prospect for many people who, although poor, until now largely were able to buy the food that they needed to sustain themselves&#8212;knows that we all have a responsibility to consider it.</p><p>Even here in Scotland, we must think about the plight of a pensioner in Alloa who squints at the shelves to find something that she can afford. The situation exists in our local communities, so we must think of solutions, which is not easy. I agree with the Conservatives that we require Government action at all levels, including in Europe, which I am pleased to see mentioned in the Tory motion. Such action must include influencing a system that has been governed and failed by a free market.</p><p>John Scott presented a compelling picture of what he eloquently described as the coming of a perfect storm, and he asked for ideas. Where necessary, we should allow Government intervention. We should increase aid to developing countries to allow them to improve their infrastructure and production. In my view, we should oppose the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization when they make unreasonable demands for poorer countries to cut their subsidies while saying that the richer ones may continue with their own. We should not allow the problems of growing first-generation biofuels to make us abandon all renewable and alternative fuels. In my view, climate change is likely to cause more shortages. If it does not, the ever-increasing price of oil definitely will, as we heard from Robin Harper.</p><p>We must support local producers, as I recently did in my constituency, in conjunction with the <em>Alloa &amp; Hillfoots Advertiser</em>, when we highlighted local suppliers to the local population. People are willing to support local retailers, but it helps to make them aware of where the local suppliers are.</p><p>There are public concerns about the role of supermarkets, and I am delighted that the First Minister recently met representatives of <place-holder colnum=\"8151\"/> supermarkets operating in Scotland to discuss the various issues.</p><p>There are some ideas about what we can do, and I am delighted to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Security"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate and congratulate John Scott on securing it.

I will concentrate solely on the holding of FAIs into the overseas deaths of military service personnel, which I raised with the Cabinet Secretary for Justice a few weeks after my election to the Parliament last May.</p><p>A number of members have mentioned the difficulties that are encountered by the families of service personnel who were based in Scotland and were killed overseas, but it is worth repeating that we in the Parliament are united in our support of, and our profound sympathy for, soldiers and their families, regardless of the differences that we may have about decisions that their political leaders have taken in sending them into the path of danger. Jeremy Purvis recently arranged a meeting involving veterans and representatives of service organisations, which members from all parties attended. We hope that that meeting will result in the establishment of a cross-party group on veterans' affairs, which may consider the issue that we are debating. The feeling at the meeting seemed to be that that should happen.</p><p>As we all know, the difficulties that the system poses for families of service personnel were brought into sharp focus by the deaths in <place-holder colnum=\"7488\"/> September 2006 of 14 Royal Air Force personnel from Kinloss, but the system has been a problem ever since the current legislation was introduced.</p><p>We are discussing fatal accident inquiries because of the unfairness of a system that means that accidental deaths abroad of Scotland-domiciled service personnel trigger a whole set of legal proceedings that must take place in the south-east of England. Families that are already devastated by the loss of a loved one must travel hundreds of miles to a part of the world that is often unfamiliar to them if they want to attend an inquest. There is also the rather intimidating process of the inquest itself. Those families should be assured that their loss is being properly investigated and that answers are being found. How can they begin the difficult task of moving on from what has happened, with due sympathy for and consideration of their feelings, if they must travel down to Oxfordshire or Wiltshire to undergo such an ordeal?</p><p>Delays have been mentioned. Sometimes it can take up to five years to hold an inquest. The old saying that justice delayed is justice denied is relevant. Many families see inquests as part of the justice process&#8212;the state is taking account of what has happened and investigating it&#8212;and, as the Solicitor General said, legal proceedings can result in some circumstances.</p><p>Criticism has been made of the accessibility of justice. There is an old saw about law courts, like the Ritz, being open to all. An FAI is open to everybody, but a person from Scotland must travel down to the south-east of England and wait for four or five years for it to happen.</p><p>I will say something about my own experience when I served with the marines. In 1982, a number of Special Air Service and Special Boat Service soldiers died when the helicopter in which they were travelling to South Georgia ditched in the sea. In my troop, the mortar group of 45 Commando, there were a number of accidental deaths&#8212;such deaths are now referred to as deaths by friendly fire. Many of the people who were involved were from other parts of the United Kingdom, but were firmly domiciled at the marine base in Arbroath. What is true for Scottish soldiers is also true for those who have been moved to bases in Scotland, whose entire family live on the base and who have, to all intents and purposes, made their home in Scotland. The same considerations must apply in such circumstances.</p><p>I do not know why such inquiries have not been addressed until now. It seems fairly obvious to me that they should have been. I am not trying to belittle the legal problems that lie in the way&#8212;the issues seem to be much more of a minefield than I understood them to be before I became involved. <place-holder colnum=\"7489\"/></p><p>However, as far as I am aware, they have not been raised before now.</p><p>I would hate to think that an element of nit-picking is creeping into the tone of some of the correspondence on the subject. For example, I understand that, since last year, Whitehall officials have changed their position on the mandatory element, which Pauline McNeill mentioned and which has now been clearly enunciated by the Secretary of State for Defence. I hope that better-informed people can shed light on why that is such an issue now.</p><p>The public, service personnel and their families will understand perfectly well that we are talking about a complex area that involves two different legal systems in two different countries with different jurisdictions, but they will not understand why we cannot now make progress when both Governments appear to want the same end.</p><p>I hope that, given the tenor of today's debate, there will be unanimity in the Parliament and that, as a result, the Scottish Government will be encouraged to act with haste to try to convince the Westminster Government to act, and that people in different parties in the Parliament will do their part by talking to their counterparts at Westminster to ensure that we can act as soon as possible.</p><p>Someone who has lost their loved one overseas in a military context will be already distressed without having to wait up to five years to get answers to questions to which answers can often be difficult to find&#8212;perhaps of necessity, given that they must be found in a service context, in which secrecy is often important.</p><p>Consideration should also be given to the fact that the families may be living cheek by jowl with other service families. Often, the circumstances of such deaths can give rise to all sorts of rumour, division and suspicion. That is exactly the kind of atmosphere that one does not want on a military base.</p><p>I am hopeful that our unanimity today will lead to early progress on the issue. I look forward to hearing what other members have to say.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401894", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fatal Accident Inquiries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion welcomes an independent review by a figure of the highest reputation and legal standing to resolve a set of problems that I hope we all agree exists.

The simple fact, which the member refuses to acknowledge, is that Labour reduced local government's share, year on year, in every year for which it was in office.</p><p>We are here to debate whether to pass extra money to councils to enable them to freeze their council tax. I did not expect Labour or Liberal Democrat members to oppose the freezing of the council tax and they have not disappointed me. Instead, however, we have heard talk of cuts, cuts and more cuts. In politics, there are debating tricks, and everyone has the right to present their case in the best possible light, but there are times when that verges on&#8212;or even crosses into&#8212;being downright deceitful with the public.</p><p>What we have heard is deceitful because the funding that councils have received from the Scottish Government is generous, and more than the previous Administration gave them last year. That is a simple statement of fact. For example, in the next three years, funding for Clackmannanshire Council and Stirling Council, in my constituency, will increase by 15.4 per cent and 14.4 per cent respectively. Both are Labour administrations&#8212;or at least they were until two weeks ago, when Labour was thrown out of office in Stirling and the SNP took control of the council.</p><p>The Labour administration in Clackmannanshire has done its party duty and complained at every opportunity about what it calls the cost of the council tax freeze, but we should remember that it goes through bad Audit Scotland reports faster than Wendy Alexander goes through press officers. The administration has presided over financial mismanagement on such a scale that its cash reserves fell to just &#163;6,000 a few months ago. Now, somehow, despite the council tax freeze, it projects the reserves going back up to &#163;3 million.</p><p>Strangely, though, despite all the extra money that it is getting from the Scottish Government, the <place-holder colnum=\"7417\"/> Labour administration in Clackmannanshire proposes spending cuts and efficiency savings that are twice what the SNP opposition proposed. So much for Wendy Alexander and her famous declaration on January 13:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I have no doubt that Labour councillors, indeed Labour councils, have spent their life looking after the homeless, women's aid, all of these poor, weak, vulnerable groups that we came into politics for.\"</p><p>In Clackmannanshire, the Labour group is cutting school crossing patrols and classroom assistants. Those cuts could have been easily avoided if it had accepted the SNP's alternative. The simple fact is that the council is seeking to increase its reserves to &#163;3 million at the same time as making cuts. It had alternatives to that.</p><p>If a Labour council can do no wrong, how come a council&#8212;let us say, for example, Stirling Council&#8212;has managed to reduce its council tax? How can the council tax freeze possibly be hurting services to those poor, weak, vulnerable groups? Like a grumbling Labour back bencher, it does not follow. Either the forcibly retired Labour administration in Stirling was a bunch of chancers, or the &#163;70 million that is attached to the council tax freeze means that there is no damage to those services, in which case the members of the Labour group in the Scottish Parliament are the ones who are being less than truthful about these things. When I consider those two possibilities, I wonder whether both the Labour administration in Stirling and the Labour Opposition in the Parliament are merely scaremongering, as they have been doing for a number of months now.</p><p>The word on the ground is that Stirling Council's dear, departed Labour administration knew that the funding settlement was a gift given by a Scottish Government that could not really afford to be generous. According to a Scottish Executive survey three years ago, a third of the population has no meaningful understanding of what a percentage is. I clarify that that was a survey by the Scottish Executive and not a survey of the Scottish Executive. One does not have to be John Swinney to know that, when the Scottish Government's budget increases by 0.5 per cent but its funding to councils increases by 2 per cent, councils are getting an extremely good deal.

Perhaps Hugh Henry would have more credibility if he had condemned North Ayrshire Council and commended Perth and Kinross Council when he was going on about Renfrewshire Council.

Again, that innovation did not last long under the Labour Party, which was unfortunate.</p><p>In talking about cross-cutting in teaching, I am reminded of a conversation that I had with a professor of English, who told me that far more original thought happened in the university cafe than at the individual study desks in the library. Subjects have never lived in separate cubicles, even if it can be convenient to divide them up in that way. Teaching flourishes most when ideas from one area can be drawn into another. Any schoolteacher can tell stories of being happily surprised by pupils who do that spontaneously.</p><p>Most of the lessons that we remember from our school days are the ones that were the result of an inspirational teacher&#8212;in those cases, it was not so much that we learned from the curriculum but that we drew inspiration and support from a teacher in particular. Very good teachers are invaluable in the system.</p><p>I am glad that the Scottish Government acknowledges that Scotland's education must have a place for Scotland. This country has never been on the sidelines of the world except, perhaps, constitutionally, and it has led in fields from engineering and science to art and literature. However, especially in the teaching of history and culture, we are guilty of placing ourselves on the sidelines. During the recent debate on the teaching of Scottish history, I was astonished at the various ways in which the Opposition parties tried to justify not teaching Scottish history in our schools.

As I understand it, time for reflection serves in part to inspire us and to remind us that there is a higher purpose in what we do. Today, the two important guiding principles of morality and generosity were outlined.</p><p>The proposed budget is generous, within the constraints of the mean-spirited grant from London. That is a sincerely held view; any checking of the evidence on grants that we have received from London during the past nine years bears out that the settlement was a vindictive slap to Scotland for voting for a real Government.</p><p>The budget is also profoundly moral, because it helps the people who are most in need throughout Scotland. In particular, it helps people who suffer from criminal and antisocial behaviour in our communities. It is easy for those of us who live in areas that are not blighted by antisocial behaviour to forget about such issues, but the cabinet secretary's announcement on police funding will <place-holder colnum=\"5888\"/> reassure many communities. It will certainly reassure many communities in my constituency where lives are blighted by antisocial behaviour and criminal activity, including drug dealing.</p><p>I remember siren voices in the Parliament saying that the council tax freeze that had been promised would never happen. When the BBC surveyed councils recently, I do not think that it found any council that was not going to freeze council tax. We must wait and see what happens. There is an element of morality and social justice to the council tax freeze. The Labour Party's independent review found that people in the lower and middle income deciles pay up to twice as much council tax as a proportion of their income as do people in the higher deciles. The word that we use for a tax that is more punitive for people who are paid less is \"unfair\". The council tax freeze seeks to address that.</p><p>There are other important aspects of the budget, for example in relation to pension payments. When I was the vice-convener of a police board for several years, we could not get the Government of the day to listen to the problems that were building up as a result of structural changes to police and fire service pensions. The present Government is making provision for those but, incredibly, it is being pilloried by the party that did nothing when the problems were at their worst. It is important that we deal with those issues, not least because we rely on the fire and police services to deliver many services to people who are most in need.</p><p>The measures on prescription charges, which Alex Neil mentioned, will have a beneficial effect, particularly on the more deprived communities. Also, a bigger slice of the cake will go to the education sector. Students&#8212;a group in society who were not looked after well in the previous Government's settlements&#8212;will benefit from that. Several aspects of the budget are generous and moral, in that they seek to improve people's lot.</p><p>Clackmannanshire Council is Labour run, but it has announced recently that it will do as much as it can&#8212;which is quite a lot, it seems&#8212;to help deal with the problems of the central heating project. Several councils have made similar announcements. They realise why problems have built up and they will work in partnership with the Government to address them, in addition to the action that the Scottish Cabinet has taken. It is a sign of the times that we have partnership working, even between Labour councils and the new Government.</p><p>It is important to reflect on the point that Suzanne Dance made about responsibility and self-acceptance during today's time for reflection. I commend that point to the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, because it would do them good <place-holder colnum=\"5889\"/> to try to accept where they are in the current situation. It might improve their performance as Opposition parties. The coalition that those parties had previously is obviously continuing now that they are in opposition, but at least it is no longer at the expense of the people of Scotland.</p><p>It was interesting that Tavish Scott mentioned the proper stewardship of public funds, which I thought was rich, given that the cost of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway project in my constituency went from &#163;13 million to &#163;84 million under his watch.

Before I came to the Parliament today, I met, by chance, the minister of Alva parish church when I was getting petrol in Alloa&#8212;we still have to travel by car from Alloa because the new railway line has been delayed, as Tavish Scott will know.

For those reasons, I welcome the OECD's review.</p><p>I congratulate the OECD, an esteemed international organisation, on its methodology, which, in placing Scottish schooling in international rankings, recognises that although we may not have our independence as a country we at least have it for our education system. I am looking forward to what the new Scottish Government will do with that independence and I am glad to see that evidence from the OECD endorses the Government's educational priorities.</p><p>The SNP has already recognised the importance of the earliest years, with our proposals for the expansion of pre-school provision by 50 per cent. Not only does pre-school provision improve attainment but, in the words of the OECD report,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Pre-school moderates the gap in achievement which tends to widen during primary school and which, unchecked, undermines compulsory secondary education in comprehensive schools.\"</p><p>The report's title refers to \"quality and equity\". No one could object to those priorities and I hope that no one in the chamber would object to the focus on pupil-teacher ratios in the early years of primary school. An investment in our children at the earliest stages pays off over their whole time in school and, beyond that, over their whole lives.</p><p>The Lib Dem amendment highlights the importance of the transition between primary school and secondary school. Having spent 11 years on an education authority, I know that that is a stubborn problem, which is at the root of how we can solve the problems in our secondary schools.</p><p>As a former council leader, I find it rewarding to see that we are now starting properly to recognise the autonomy of local authorities. During my time at Clackmannanshire Council, as has been mentioned by Liz Smith, new ground was broken with the much talked about the synthetic phonics method of teaching reading. Not only did synthetic phonics have an immediate impact but it meant that primary 7 reading was consistently ahead&#8212;up <place-holder colnum=\"5086\"/> to three years ahead, by some measures&#8212;of where it was previously. It reduced the differences between socioeconomic groups and, interestingly&#8212;as this is not really touched on in the report&#8212;between genders. It has been interesting to hear some of the discussion about the purpose of education and the extent to which socioeconomic inequalities are still being reflected in the education system. Of course, one of the original purposes of education was to reduce and eliminate those socioeconomic inequalities. However, that is not happening sufficiently at present.</p><p>I hope that the lessons of local authority experiments feed into the curriculum for excellence&#8212;not just the lessons of Clackmannanshire but those of West Dunbartonshire, which has taken on the methods as well. Rhona Brankin asked for a national strategy based on the West Dunbartonshire experience, but I would ask her why there was no national strategy based on the Clackmannanshire experience eight years ago.</p><p>For years, the SNP has made commitments in its manifestos regarding more vocational opportunities. Admittedly, the Labour Party has done so too, but the difference is that we have not been in a position to implement those commitments before now, whereas Labour has.</p><p>I was also disappointed to see from the report that, in the past eight years, socioeconomic status has become more of a factor in how well young people do in education. The number of young people who left school and ended up not in education, employment or training has gone up as well. The Labour Party often talks the right talk&#8212;as they say, a stopped clock is right twice a day&#8212;but now we can see just how short on action it has been.</p><p>Earlier, some of us&#8212;including Peter Peacock, I think&#8212;listened to a Scottish Trades Union Congress delegate talk about dyslexia in the workplace. In that man's experience, there were two shocking things. The first was the bullying, harassment and hostility that he received when it was discovered that he had dyslexia&#8212;his employer was the Department for Work and Pensions. The second shocking thing was that it was not until he was 41 years old that it was discovered that he had dyslexia.</p><p>There is a lot of evidence in the report about the confidence and professionalism of our teachers.

As public servants, individual elections officers and returning officers will usually spurn public comment such is their determination to maintain their well-won reputation for impartiality. However, I was well aware of the concerns that they were expressing to one another before the election. They believed that the last-minute changes for the May elections were ill thought out and the changes to the design of the ballot papers very wrong.

The changes to the postal voting were late in coming, very complex and hard to deal with. The electronic counting system was horrendous, expensive and cumbersome. For the Ochil constituency, it was proposed to hold the election count in Stirling. Much though I would have liked to share Bruce Crawford's triumph on the night in Stirling, it is completely wrong that local election counts for Clackmannanshire Council should take place outwith the council area. However, that was proposed because the accommodation could not take the electronic counting system. The contempt for the democratic process that was shown by the DRS Data Services staff who were involved on the night when things started to go wrong should never be repeated. We should never have got into that position, but most of those problems were widely known. They came as no surprise to many people who were involved in administering the elections when they came to fruition at the election time. That is why the Parliament is right to welcome the Gould report, especially its central provision that we should run our own elections.</p><p>The Gould report also recommends that we should overhaul the system of returning officers in each constituency. As someone who has acted as a deputy returning officer, I have seen at first hand how much that is needed. Folk should be aware that the actual work for elections is carried out not by the returning officers but by the deputy returning officers and elections officers, who do not get the compensation that returning officers receive. We should end that fiction.</p><p>We should also accept Gould's crucial recommendation that the Scottish Parliament and local elections should be decoupled. I remember arguing, as leader of Clackmannanshire Council, with Iain Smith and the Local Government Committee that the elections should be decoupled. At that time, no other party supported that position, but it has attracted the support of the Conservatives within the past year or so. I welcome that party's conversion to the cause as much as I welcome Labour's conversion to the idea of the transfer of powers. Decoupled elections are, quite simply, the fairest way to run things.

That is why the Gould report recommends that the Scottish Parliament would be the logical institution to take responsibility for the two sets of elections. It will surprise no one that I would like the Parliament to take on responsibility for elections to the European Parliament and other institutions, along with all the other powers of a normal independent country.

In particular, I thank Hugh O'Donnell&#8212;without his support, I would not have secured tonight's debate. I know that he takes issue with the part of the motion that calls for the transfer of broadcasting powers to Scotland, so I am grateful that he was able to support it.</p><p>Before thanking the many people who have written to me since I first raised the issue, I should mention that Stuart McMillan raised the issue some time before I did. He previously lodged a petition with the Public Petitions Committee, which I am sure he will mention when he speaks.</p><p>I have received letters of thanks from, for example, pensioners in Sutherland who could not afford Sky television and who live in a village where no pub can afford Sky, either. I have been thanked for raising the issue by a person from Dundee whose back problem prevented him from standing for two hours in a crowded pub to watch the recent Scotland v Italy match. I was also <place-holder colnum=\"4851\"/> contacted by someone from Glenrothes who, as a licence payer, simply objects to the fact that the BBC seems to be failing to fulfil its role of broadcasting in the public interest. Many other people have been in touch because they are concerned that they should be able to see their national team play their national sport, especially its most important matches. People are disappointed because they cannot do so. Many people feel that the BBC is failing on the issue.</p><p>Although the BBC is often mentioned, other terrestrial broadcasters could have purchased the rights to the matches, thereby ensuring that one of the criteria for designating events that are to be shown on terrestrial TV&#8212;provision of 95 per cent coverage&#8212;was met. However, the BBC exists to bring entertainment and political, cultural and sporting events of national importance into the homes of ordinary people the length and breadth of the country. The crucial Scotland matches at the end of the recent European championship qualifiers were two such events.</p><p>BBC Scotland is limited in what it can do. The core service of the BBC has a budget of about &#163;90.3 million, out of a total United Kingdom-wide spend from the licence fee of more than &#163;3.2 billion. It is hardly surprising that BBC Scotland was outbid by Sky and has been outbid for the remaining available world cup qualifiers by Setanta. To win the rights to televise the Scotland matches, the BBC would have had to break a very undersized bank. However, like many other members of the Scottish viewing public, I could not help but notice that the BBC managed to secure all England's matches on the same commercial basis. That is not anglophobia&#8212;I am happy to congratulate the BBC on having won the rights to televise those matches, but I wish that it had funded the BBC in Scotland adequately, so that it could have won the rights to televise Scotland's matches. I might also question the sensitivity of the decision to show England's matches throughout the UK when there was no broadcast of Scotland's games, although in the end I rather enjoyed the England v Croatia match.</p><p>I believe that there needs to be devolution of broadcasting because BBC Scotland, or the Scottish broadcasting corporation&#8212;or whatever name the marketing consultants come up with&#8212;would be able to respond to the Scottish viewing audience far better if it were independent. It would still be able to broadcast shows and events from down south, just as the BBC and other channels can broadcast shows and events from around the world.</p><p>In the meantime, there is another option available in respect of Scotland matches. Before the next round of rights&#8212;for the qualifiers for Euro 2012&#8212;is released, the Westminster Government <place-holder colnum=\"4852\"/> could add those matches to the list of protected sporting events that must be made available to broadcasters that can reach 95 per cent of the population. That describes both the BBC and STV but would exclude Sky, to which fewer than one in three households subscribes, and it would totally block Setanta. The current list covers events such as the Olympics, Wimbledon, the Derby and the Scottish cup final. To be fair, it also includes all European championship and world cup finals matches, although not qualifying matches. It is unfortunate for Scotland, but often the qualifying matches are our finals. Far be it from me to go against the mood of optimism that is sweeping the nation, but as a long-suffering Scotland fan, I cannot help but notice that the current protection has not done us much good for the past 11 years.</p><p>When Scotland played Italy on 17 November, the match was watched by supporters in some homes and pubs in conditions in which it would probably be illegal to transport cattle, but in Italy the match could be watched in any home in the land. The Italian Government, unlike its Westminster counterpart, had added all of the national football team's fixtures to its protected list and had sensibly recognised the importance and popularity of the game throughout the country.</p><p>Designating matches in such a way comes at a cost. Recently, and rightly, the Scottish Football Association has pointed to the fact that it receives much-needed income from the rights that it has sold and has tied that income to provision of youth facilities and training in Scotland. However, at present less than a fifth of the SFA's income comes from television and radio, and most of that comes from the Scottish cup. It cannot be right that we should seek to fund youth involvement in our national sport by excluding vast numbers of people from watching our national team playing that sport. If BBC Scotland were run from Scotland and properly funded, the SFA would not have to lose out.</p><p>I have proposed the listing of European championship and world cup qualifying matches to James Purnell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. His response was not altogether dismissive. He accepted that crucial matches, such as those towards the end of the qualifying rounds, would meet the criteria. He also stated that his predecessor had planned to review the list in 2008-09. Even if the list is changed to include only the final matches of qualifying rounds, that will be a step forward.</p><p>The Scottish viewing public has a right to see all the international performances of their country at the nation's favourite sport. I hope that the members who follow me will agree with that fundamental principle. This is indisputably an issue that could&#8212;I think should&#8212;unite the nation. <place-holder colnum=\"4853\"/></p><p>It is about our national sport and about our national team playing in international events.

It held one for the Scottish Parliament because, we were told, Tony Blair was not a great fan of devolution and he wanted to lose&#8212;at least, so the rumours go. Yet Labour has proposed other referendums that it thought, or at least said, it would win. Members may remember that we were promised a referendum on the euro in Labour's 1997 manifesto, as well as a referendum on proportional representation at Westminster. It also proposed a referendum on the European treaty. Those are referendums that Labour has not held. It feels like the Labour Party is really committed only to referendums that it thinks it will lose&#8212;on which basis we look forward to support for a referendum on Scottish independence.

If it does not, it will be not just the Labour Party but democracy itself that loses.</p><p>The Lib Dems for once had a point when Vincent Cable noted that no one under the age of 50 has had a vote on the EU. Incidentally, we are still waiting for one on the Act of Union 1707. However, it is the same for every other constitutional matter: referendums happen when specific proposals are put forward. The Lisbon treaty is a specific proposal, or a large set of significant proposals, and it&#8212;not the wider question of the EU in general, which is the subject of consensus across the political spectrum, aside from one or two fringe parties&#8212;should be voted on.</p><p>Such consensus is fairly rare.

When they change that substantially, their authority is diminished.</p><p>Those principles are also violated when the European Union takes on too much or centralises unnecessarily. Opposition members will not be surprised or delighted that I cite control over marine policy as an example of that. The Lisbon treaty entrenches Brussels's dominance over Scotland's biological marine resources, just as the UK grants London dominance over one or two other important offshore resources that I could name.

It is a vital Scottish interest that is proportionally far more important to Scotland than it is to the UK as a whole. That is another sign of how the interests of Scotland and of the UK diverge.</p><p>As I have said before, unexpected common viewpoints can be found on fishing. For example, a Labour MP said on 26 April 2004:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I think there is an argument for repatriation of control over fisheries and that the SNP has a valid point.\"</p><p>Those are, of course, the words of George Foulkes. Perhaps he will join the rest of his party in changing his mind not only on European control over fisheries but on a referendum.

That is bad for democracy and a disaster for trust in politics.</p><p>As for the point that Margo MacDonald made&#8212;unfortunately, she has left&#8212;we must constantly challenge ourselves and the EU to ensure that what the EU does benefits everybody and that there is interest in its policies.

However, we must be aware of the dangers of an overweening EU, which can happen. The minister has taken the right approach in guarding against that danger while embracing the benefits.</p><p>I will point out one or two inconsistencies. The Tories did not want a referendum on the <place-holder colnum=\"4585\"/> Maastricht treaty, but they want a vote on the Lisbon treaty. The Lib Dems are inconsistent and illogical, because they want to put a question that nobody else is asking. If Iain Smith thinks that it is impossible to vote against a treaty and remain a member of the EU, perhaps he should tell that to Holland, France, Ireland or Denmark. Labour wanted a referendum on the Maastricht treaty, but it does not want one on the Lisbon treaty, even though it explicitly promised one.</p><p>Helen Eadie mentioned an auld alliance. It is strange to hear that from a member of a party whose leader, Gordon Brown, has said that the SNP and the Tories are working together to undermine the union in the UK, at the same time as his party has joined with the Tories to save the UK.

I also welcome the people from Clackmannanshire who are in the public gallery tonight, including Councillor Bob McGill, who is a representative of the local council on the trust.</p><p>The background and history of Clackmannanshire and Stirling's eastern villages is similar to that of the areas that have been <place-holder colnum=\"4037\"/> mentioned already. The situation is familiar to anyone who represents such areas: the coal industry that once brought jobs has gone and we are left with its very poor legacy. For example, Clackmannanshire has higher levels of poor health and limiting long-term illnesses than Scotland as a whole, and Stirling's eastern villages are no better off. In fact, because they are part of an area that is generally seen as prosperous, they are sometimes overlooked. There is also the environmental legacy. The work of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust is helpful in that regard.</p><p>Obviously, the regeneration of any area is a huge job and one in which many agencies have a role to play. For example, one of the biggest regeneration projects in the Clackmannanshire area is the reopening of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway, for which Clackmannanshire Council led the campaign.</p><p>Local authorities make an invaluable commitment by providing funding and support across their range of responsibilities, but programmes such as those that the Coalfields Regeneration Trust supports deliver resources to groups on the ground, which leads regeneration from the ground up. It adds value to projects that would not otherwise get support.</p><p>Over the past two years alone, groups in my constituency have received more than &#163;520,000 from the trust. It is interesting that that is more than double what groups in the area have received from the big lottery fund. The point is important in the context of Clackmannanshire and the eastern villages of Stirling: the trust is very accessible and helpful to groups that ask for assistance&#8212;perhaps more so than some of the larger national grant-giving bodies.</p><p>I have met many people who are involved with the groups that the Coalfields Regeneration Trust supports. One such group is recyke-a-bike, a social enterprise project that is based in Fallin, which is shortly to be visited by John Swinney, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth. The project combines employment with opportunities for training and apprenticeships, which also have environmental benefits. Its promotion and support of cycling has been taken up as an initiative by local primary schools and the University of Stirling. Over recent months, I have donated three bikes to recyke-a-bike, bought a second-hand recycled bike, and had my three children's bikes repaired. I encourage other members to do the same.</p><p>Just down the road from recyke-a-bike is the Polmaise mining museum, which owes a great deal to the work of Archie Bone, a local figure who was very well known in the eastern villages of Stirling. Sadly, he passed away last week. The museum would never have been established <place-holder colnum=\"4038\"/> without Archie, who I think worked the number two pit at Polmaise.</p><p>The trust also supported the community takeover of the Clackmannan town hall building, by way of money for redecoration, and it helped Alloa rugby club to provide disabled access. Very often, those projects would not get support from statutory or other bodies. The trust's support is even more valuable for that reason.</p><p>All the schemes that have benefited from the trust's support are an essential part of the regeneration of Clackmannanshire and Stirling's eastern villages.

I have met the Federation of Small Businesses twice in the last week, since the budget was published. It is true that it would like more to be done, but it is grateful for the support that is being offered by the Government through the small business bonus scheme, which goes far further than the Lib Dems, Labour or even the Tories have gone in the past.</p><p>The economic strategy also recognises that transport infrastructure&#8212;public transport and crucial road networks&#8212;is vital. The Government is delivering more, and doing so more efficiently, than any of the other parties proposed. I remember when, in 1999 on Clackmannanshire Council, we identified the fundamental nature of transport infrastructure projects, such as the completion of the A907, the new Kincardine bridge and improved railways&#8212;all of which are now happening or have happened. Transport infrastructure is essential to future economic growth.</p><p>We recognise that education is crucial. The Government is delivering more on class sizes for the youngest pupils and more on fees and debt for students than any other party ever demanded or suggested. It is worth noting that Clackmannanshire Council in my constituency has oversubscribed to so much debt for its secondary school estate that it has not a single penny left to improve its primary school estate. The council has subscribed to almost &#163;750 million of debt for three secondary schools.

We are told by the other parties that those are big boys' toys and we do not have the ability or responsibility to handle them. Although the strategy has ambitions and targets for 2011, we in the SNP have ambitions for an independent Scotland to go far beyond that. The strategy is a core part of that positive vision.

During a previous debate on the issue in 2004, a then Westminster member of Parliament, who is now a member of this Parliament and who is still at Westminster, was quoted in <em>The Herald </em>newspaper on 26 April 2004 as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I think there is an argument for repatriation of control over fisheries and that the SNP has a valid point\".</p><p>That was quoted in the <em>Official Report</em> of 29 April 2004. The MP was not Alex Salmond, but Lord Foulkes. It is a shame that Lord Foulkes has left the chamber, but perhaps one day he will extend his support for the principle of repatriation of powers to Scotland to the powers that are currently exercised by the Westminster Parliament, in which he sits, at least on a Tuesday.</p><p>The fisheries issue exemplifies the difference between the representations that can be made by an independent nation state in its own interest and the misrepresentations of a nation's interests when pursued by another state on its behalf. Simply put, if we choose not to exercise power <place-holder colnum=\"3266\"/> over ourselves, we allow others to exercise power over us. The problem is that those others may not, and usually do not, exercise that power in our interest, but in theirs. Fishing is a vital Scottish interest but, as far as Westminster is concerned, it rates only as a bargaining chip that is to be used to promote other interests. That is why we should have as our first priority the independence that will allow us properly to represent the interests of the people of Scotland within the EU.</p><p>On independence, I should highlight what may appear to a disinterested observer to be a puzzling development, whereby Wendy Alexander, the leader of a unionist party in Scotland, accuses the SNP of being in league with the Tories to undermine the union while, at the same time, she is sitting down with her fellow unionists in the Tories to devise a strategy to save the union&#8212;Tartan Tories and grubby deals. If that is not confusing enough, I remember that on 4 May, when I had the privilege of appearing with David Whitton on the \"Scotland at Ten\" programme on the night of the election, he sneeringly suggested that the SNP might look to do a deal with the Tories and laughed off my suggestion that it was much more likely that his party would work with the Tories. I have often wondered since then how he feels about his party's coalition with the Tories on his local council, East Dunbartonshire Council, as well as the rainbow alliance of Tories, Liberal Democrats and Labour in the Parliament.</p><p>One of the Government's priorities is its vision for a fairer Scotland. That vision must include priorities, which are shared with the EU, for Scotland to be a welcoming place where respect for and celebration of the diversity of cultures and communities in the EU have resonance in a Scotland that welcomes people from throughout the EU who seek to visit, work and live here. In that context, I associate myself with the remarks of another Labour MP, Keith Vaz, who said in a debate this week that Gordon Brown's mantra of British jobs for British workers could be regarded as \"employment apartheid\", with its implication that foreigners are stealing our jobs.</p><p>In my constituency, and throughout Scotland, a significant number of EU nationals, mainly from Eastern Europe, have contributed hugely to the local economy and to the enrichment of our culture. I agree that the Westminster Government's unemployment figures are hopelessly fiddled, to the extent that they describe those who claim benefit, rather than those who are not in gainful, meaningful employment, but even those figures are declining. With the claimant count decreasing, how can it be that jobs are being stolen by EU nationals? More crucially, how does Gordon Brown seek to fulfil his promise of British jobs for British workers? The immigration and other EU provisions that his Government has <place-holder colnum=\"3267\"/> willingly and rightly signed up to do not allow the exclusion of other EU nationals from employment opportunities in this country. Could it be that that will be Labour's latest broken promise?</p><p>By contrast, I hope and believe that the Scottish Government will promote the real priorities of the people of Scotland&#8212;on EU reform, which has to happen; on competence over fisheries, which must happen for the sake of our fish stocks and fishing industry; and on the raft of justice and home affairs measures, which must acknowledge and accommodate Scotland's distinct legal system.

That is how I understand the report&#8212;as a starting point. Professor Crerar has done some of the heavy lifting, so to speak, in his collation and analysis of the extent and scale of scrutiny and complaints handling in the public sector. However, I want gently to disturb the consensus that is building by saying that I do not think that the report goes far enough in what it proposes. I hope that, in considering Professor Crerar's recommendations, Parliament and ministers will think radically. Although it may not be possible, eventually, to act as radically as we might, we should start by thinking radically about the possible solutions. We should also be prepared not to give in to special pleading from various bodies and organisations.</p><p>If anybody wants a countervailing view to the points that are made in the report, they should read the submission from Keir Bloomer, the former chief executive of Clackmannanshire Council. I say that with some bias because for years he and I railed against the increasing weight of public scrutiny on local government. He makes some compelling points. In respect of auditing, councils are different from other bodies because they have their own democratic mandate. I think that, increasingly, that is not being recognised by, for example, Audit Scotland, which is progressively going beyond public performance reporting and is involving itself in policy matters and democratic scrutiny matters, which are not within the remit that it was first given.</p><p>As well as being audited by Audit Scotland, every council must pay for external auditors, who are very expensive, and have its own internal audit section. I will give members an idea of the costs of all that. The smallest council in mainland Scotland, Clackmannanshire Council, in 2002-03 spent &#163;171,000 on auditing by Audit Scotland. By 2005-06, that figure had increased by 35 per cent to &#163;231,000. Audit Scotland is always good at telling councils to be more efficient, but it increases its fee annually, which local authorities have no choice but to pay. On top of that, there are fees for external and internal auditors.<place-holder colnum=\"2354\"/></p><p>On the sheer weight of scrutiny, Keir Bloomer says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The regime is widely perceived as punitive and has instilled a fear of taking calculated risks, thus reinforcing the innate conservativism of the public sector.\"</p><p>That is true and apparent to most people who work in local authorities. As I said, Audit Scotland has gone beyond public performance reporting.</p><p>An important point is that scrutiny of public bodies should lie with Parliament, so there is a question about the extent to which public performance reporting bodies are encroaching on Parliament's role. That is something for Parliament to think about. Perhaps it would be best if it was not a lawyer that considered that issue. I hate to suggest it, but it may be best if a political scientist or someone like that were to examine the balance between democratic and public performance scrutiny.</p><p>I am trying not to use the word \"cluttered\" about complaints handling, but it is extremely cluttered in the public sector. As Professor Crerar makes clear, it is confusing to the people whom the systems are meant to serve and, as Christine Grahame pointed out, people often feel at the end of the process that it has not served them well. That is partly because when each of the bodies were set up, what they could look at was tightly constrained: for example, the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman&#8212;I share the concerns of Tavish Scott and others about it&#8212;can only consider maladministration, but the public does not realise that and thinks that the body has a far wider remit, which is why people can become frustrated.</p><p>The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman started off fairly well with the good intention of drawing in more areas, such as health, but it has lost its way. I have worked with the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman's office for the past 10 years and it is not operating as people envisaged it would.</p><p>As I said, the public sector is under a huge burden. I have a final quotation from Keir Bloomer.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Public service organisations are overwhelmed by the numerous and disparate exercises they are subject to. There is little evidence of co-ordination or joined-up working between the distinct scrutiny bodies demonstrated by discrete exercises occurring simultaneously or concurrently, including the recent audit of Housing&#8212;\"</p><p>in Clackmannanshire Council&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"which coincided with the Best Value &amp; Community Planning audit and a visit by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) with the Community Learning audit. A number of these separate exercises also replicate the work of others. For example, reviews of Psychological Services, Child Protection, Children's Services\".<place-holder colnum=\"2355\"/></p><p>Clackmannanshire Council serves about 48,000 people. We are a country of 5 million people&#8212;I do not think that a country of our size should have the weight of scrutiny and audit on its public sector that we have. That is why this is the time to be radical. We could make real savings, although that should not be the first priority, which must be rationalisation that is understood and proportionate&#8212;another word that comes up time and again in the Crerar report.</p><p>Although some members have argued against it, we should have a single agency in mind when the issue is being considered and we should only consider as exceptions agencies that can prove that there is a good reason why they should be part of the single agency. The savings in backroom staffing and other costs could be huge, and the agency could be much more understandable to the public that it is meant to serve.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crerar Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the cabinet secretary said in welcoming the report from Professor Crerar, the report is an excellent and informed starting point.

That possibility was also raised at the end of session 2 by the previous convener of the Standards and Public Appointments Committee, who suggested that the formation of one committee for standards and procedures might be appropriate, to assist members in making the most efficient use of their time.</p><p>In reaching its conclusion, the Procedures Committee considered a number of factors relating to the merging of the committees. First, we noted that, in addition to the references to the Standards and Public Appointments Committee in legislation, there are references to that committee and its clerks in other parliamentary documents such as the \"Code of Conduct for Members of the Scottish Parliament\" and determinations by the Parliament on the register of interests. We questioned whether the establishment of a new, merged committee might affect the validity of references in other documents to either committee as previously constituted. We are content that such references would, where appropriate, be read as if they referred to the new committee.</p><p>Secondly, we noted that the Parliamentary Bureau had already sought clarification of any potential conflict of interest that would result from bringing together the committees' remits. As both committees report to Parliament on, and require Parliament's approval for, any recommendations that they make, we see no conflict of interests for <place-holder colnum=\"2295\"/> a member who happens to be a member of both committees. Accordingly, we do not see that as an issue for the new committee.</p><p>In previous sessions, the Standards and Public Appointments Committee considered a fair amount of legislation. As a result of the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Act 2006, the committee carried out a review of the code of conduct, to ensure that it reflected the new requirements for members to register their interests. However, it is unlikely that the same amount of legislation will be forthcoming in this session, so demands on the committee's time will be reduced. The Procedures Committee and the Standards and Public Appointments Committee understood that a new committee could not predict its workload&#8212;for example, the number of complaints that might be made under the code of conduct or any urgent procedural issues that needed to be considered&#8212;and that meetings to consider such issues would be required when necessary.</p><p>We concluded that there was no reason why one committee could not manage effectively the areas that are covered by both of the current committees' remits, subject to our ensuring that the new committee examines procedures and standards issues separately at all times.

Half a million pounds was spent on new flood defences at Milnathort, yet, within a few months of their completion, major flooding&#8212;with all the accompanying trauma that other members have described&#8212;took place there. Some people have still not returned to their homes, they have lost all their belongings and they have to live some distance away, with no real prospect of returning to their homes. More important, they have no confidence about going back to their houses&#8212;Sarah Boyack referred to that. There is real fear. I live 13 miles away from Milnathort, but every time that there are two successive days of rain I start to wonder what is happening there. That is becoming more acute with the onset of winter.</p><p>Bridge of Allan, in my constituency, is an example of a place in which one house can be affected by flooding, but the cause of the flooding can be traced back to previous flood defence systems that were put in place. It is hard to get funding to deal with that problem. Another case is the Wallace high school, which is currently under construction in Bridge of Allan and is said by local people to be Scotland's first underwater school. It has been built on a flood plain, and it is behind schedule and well over budget because of the cost of pumping out the water during its construction.</p><p>In the middle of my constituency, we had&#8212;as Mike Rumbles mentioned&#8212;the River Devon natural flood management scheme, which was funded not by the previous Executive but by HSBC working in partnership with Clackmannanshire Council and WWF Scotland.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary has said, it is not a simple case of new soft, natural flood defences being far better than the old engineered system. We must have the right solution for the right place.

Scottish Natural Heritage called the Ochil hills, which the Wallace monument looks out on,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a landscape experience that is unique in Scotland\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"one of the most visually sensitive areas in Scotland\".</p><p>My predecessor as MSP for Ochil, George Reid, said that he was stunned by the proposals and that no other country in the world would think of despoiling an area of such national importance.</p><p>I have worked in Stirling for the past 15 years and, for most of that time, I have driven to Stirling on the A907 through Tullibody. On that road, drivers can see the vista opening up before them, with the Wallace monument sometimes shrouded in cloud. That fantastic view will be despoiled, if the proposal succeeds, with huge pylons right in front of that view. The pylons are massive&#8212;up to 65m high, which is 220ft, in old money. It is worth thinking about the fact that no building in Edinburgh is as tall as that, not even Appleton tower or Martello Court.</p><p>We do not have time to go into the health issues, but I hope that they will be taken into account by the inquiry, if it should relax its procedures. In that regard, I refer members to the recent Westminster report that talks about <place-holder colnum=\"1902\"/> recommended areas either side of pylons that might generate emissions.</p><p>The eastern villages of Stirling are often forgotten about in this context but have regularly been seen as a dumping ground for pylons and various other public utilities, to the detriment of their people. I hope that their interests will also be taken into account.</p><p>History has shown us that when decisions on what is beautiful and what is ugly are made by the state, the result is as often as not cultural vandalism or concrete monstrosities. I do not think that any of us want that to happen in relation to the areas that we are discussing. Some 27,000 people are now offering their opinions.

While I was reading today's papers, I remembered that, in the seven years during which I worked in Brussels, the only people in the whole of the European Union who strolled the corridors of power trying to convince everyone else that Scotland would be some kind of pariah standing apart from the European Union were the fevered Labour members. Nobody else I spoke to, from any group or from any country, held that view. It is interesting to consider what would happen if Commissioner Borg's statements were carried to their logical conclusion. For example, if Belgium broke up&#8212;as is currently being talked about by all the mainstream parties&#8212;his office would be outside the European Union in Brussels. It is a strange logic, but some people find it attractive.</p><p>It is sad but true that the Scottish Parliament has no direct role yet in negotiating or ratifying the treaty, but Scotland has vital interests in key issues such as fisheries policy, the Scottish justice and legal system, energy policy and representation in the European Parliament that cannot be properly promoted without the clear voice of Scotland's Government being heard. To maximise that voice, I hope that, wherever possible&#8212;I realise that doing so will sometimes not be possible&#8212;parties will take a team Scotland approach that seeks to galvanise the views of our MEPs of whichever party, members of the Scottish Parliament's European and External Relations Committee of whichever party, and Scotland's representatives on the European Committee of the Regions from whichever nominating institution and of whichever party, and that all parties will seek to give mutual support and reinforce areas of agreement that are in Scotland's interests. That was the key role that the European members information and liaison exchange&#8212;EMILE&#8212;network, which was set up by the former First Minister, Mr McConnell, some years ago, should have had. It never carried out that role, but most people in the parties outwith the then Scottish Executive believed that that would have been its most productive role.</p><p>I say to those who are sceptical that we can find areas of agreement on which we can work together, that all the parties that are represented in the chamber&#8212;I think&#8212;opposed reducing the number of MEPs from Scotland from seven to six, and that there is broad agreement in areas that relate to Scotland's distinct legal system. I make that point because, in my experience in Europe, countries such as the Republic of Ireland have for many years achieved fantastic deals from Brussels as a result of all the parties adopting a united approach. All the parties in that country work together as team Ireland and achieve a great deal by doing so. Obviously, they have <place-holder colnum=\"1865\"/> fundamental differences but, by and large, they work together when it comes to important national interests.</p><p>It is right that the EU treaty should streamline the EU and that it should start to return power to national Parliaments&#8212;indeed, I hope that one day it will return power to the Scottish Parliament. That such changes should be considered in a union of 27 members is right. It is inevitable that compromises will be made&#8212;that is simply part of the game&#8212;but we should take a team Scotland approach in the areas in which we can agree, so that, like countries such as Ireland, we work together and achieve real progress in Scotland's interest.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387773", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Treaty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, but I will try to address the point that Robert Brown made.

Whether I was a student of local government finance, a local government employee or a councillor&#8212;and, like Charlie Gordon, a council leader who had to propose council tax increases&#8212;it was always clear to me that a property-based tax such as the council tax is inefficient and unfair.</p><p>Council tax is now defended by new Labour&#8212;although perhaps not much by Charlie Gordon. Labour clings to the council tax with a tenacity that <place-holder colnum=\"980\"/> it did not have even in relation to clause IV, which surprises me. If any member thinks that the reform that was proposed by the Labour Party during the election campaign was logical or coherent, they should use a spare night to watch the YouTube recording of Jack McConnell being interviewed by Bernard Ponsonby and try to find a rational and logical coherence to what Jack McConnell said.</p><p>The Tories, too, defend the council tax, but in speaking to a motion that is against local income tax they have acknowledged the failures and limits of the entirely discredited council tax. The fact that during the election campaign they described their proposed reforms to the council tax as radical shows how poor the tax is.</p><p>The fundamental limitation of council tax as opposed to local income tax is that it is not a buoyant tax. Do the two parties that still support the council tax also support a revaluation? They must do so, because that is the corollary of their position. Labour and the Tories should be up front and admit that we cannot have the council tax without a revaluation, which is long overdue, for political reasons.</p><p>Charlie Gordon knows as well as I do that local taxes have been used for far too long by the Conservatives and Labour to push through tax increases that the parties did not want to push through the income tax system. Local government and local government tax payers have paid for national policies that have been implemented by local government without being properly funded.</p><p>The real problem is that after the poll tax, which was a disgrace, there was no proper scrutiny of the council tax. People were so eager to get rid of the poll tax that they embraced the council tax too quickly.</p><p>The defining feature of a local income tax system is that it is fairer. People pay according to their ability to pay, as Bill Wilson said. The old nostrum, \"from each according to their ability to pay\" is useful in this context. A local income tax would also be cheaper to collect. It costs &#163;65 million to collect the council tax, but it would cost around &#163;25 million to collect a local income tax, according to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Council Tax"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My experience of local taxation, rather like that of Charlie Gordon, has been formed by my working in local government for nearly 20 years, by my being a councillor for 11 years and, before that, by my studies of local government finance.

Their abolition will be warmly welcomed in my Ochil constituency.</p><p>I want to begin by thanking my immediate predecessor as member of the Scottish Parliament for Ochil, George Reid. Many tributes have been paid to George in recent weeks, which may have included the anecdote that he has often told against himself. He recalls that when he was walking down Alloa's High Street recently, he was stopped by two laddies, who said, \"Hey, pal. You're that George Reid guy, aren't you? We get you at school.\" Flattered by the recognition, George said with a smirk, \"Oh, really? In modern studies?\" The obvious reply to his question was, \"Naw&#8212;in history.\" I hope that it is not too bold a claim to make on George's behalf that his place in Scottish political history, as a member of the United Kingdom Parliament or an MSP over 33 years for much of the area that I represent, and in getting to grips with the saga of the Parliament building's costs, is assured. On behalf of my constituents and many people in Parliament, I thank him and give my best wishes for the future to him and Daphne.</p><p>I also acknowledge the work of my predecessor's predecessor. Perhaps unusually, the Ochil constituency has had different MSPs in <place-holder colnum=\"369\"/> each of the three sessions. It is also unusual that the first, Dr Richard Simpson, re-entered Parliament as a list MSP at the most recent election. I acknowledge his efforts on behalf of my constituents between 1999 and 2003.</p><p>One of the most compelling reasons why the tolls on the Forth road bridge should be abolished is that, when they were proposed, it was specifically said that they would be put in place to pay off the capital costs of constructing the bridge. That was a long time ago; indeed, my father was working on the construction of the roads that lead to the bridge when I was born. I understand that the capital costs of the bridge were paid off in 1994. Then, as the Scottish National Party's transport spokesperson, I called for the tolls to be abolished, because the purpose for which they had been introduced had been served. Instead, it was decided to keep them on. I presume that that decision was taken because the tolls were a nice revenue stream for the Government of the day. In the process, another promise to the electorate was shelved. The Forth road bridge tolls became a stealth tax long before Gordon Brown had heard that phrase.</p><p>One reason why people are fed up with the political process is that politicians' promises are often not kept. Last week, Des McNulty mentioned the contract between electors and the elected. In this case, the contract&#8212;the promise by the then Government to have a temporary toll&#8212;was betrayed by those who were elected. To give an idea of how far we seem to have strayed from the notion of a democratic contract, we have only to consider the new idea that a party that gained the largest number of votes in an election can be accused of acting arbitrarily simply because it wishes to implement its specific manifesto commitments.</p><p>I am no admirer of tolls. Indeed, I was convicted for refusing to pay the Skye bridge toll back in the mid-1990s. The Skye bridge toll campaign was another successful campaign to get rid of unjust tolls. It would be nice if the Lord Advocate considered quashing my conviction and those of others who opposed that disgraceful toll, but I suppose that she could just as easily come after me for the &#163;50 fine that I have not paid in 12 years.</p><p>The tolls on the Skye bridge were wrong, and they have been abolished. The continuation of tolls on the Forth road bridge&#8212;I am concentrating on that bridge rather than on the Tay bridge, because it is much more important to people in my constituency&#8212;is also wrong. Those tolls should be abolished. Tricia Marwick has received e-mails from people who object to abolition of the tolls. Such people ask where the money will come from to pay for the maintenance of the Forth and Tay <place-holder colnum=\"370\"/> road bridges. That money should come from general taxation, which is where the Government that introduced the tolls said it would come from once the tolls ended. When it is asked why people in the north of Scotland and the Borders should pay for the upkeep of a bridge that they never use, we should say that they should do so for the same reason why those who use the Forth and Tay bridges pay for the upkeep of roads in the north of Scotland and the Borders. We all benefit from a comprehensive national road system whether or not we personally use every road in the country.</p><p>I will also welcome abolition because it should finally lay to rest the fear of people in my constituency that the new upper Forth crossing&#8212;there is a new crossing coming quite soon that I hope we will come to love as \"the Clackmannanshire bridge\"&#8212;will be tolled. Of course, any gratitude among my constituents for not tolling the new bridge will be tempered by the appalling news that the First Minister gave us earlier that it is now estimated that the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway will cost &#163;83 million and, I presume, will not be completed until next year. That figure and the delay that has been caused by poor management of the contract should have those in the previous Executive who were responsible hanging their heads in shame.</p><p>The abolition of the Forth and Tay road bridge tolls will be good news for my constituents and Scotland. It will provide a level playing field, remedy a long-standing injustice and will, I hope, represent a small step in the rebuilding of public faith in Government by respecting the idea of the democratic contract as a vital, but too often neglected, tenet of Scottish democracy. My party said that it would abolish the tolls and it is now doing so. It said that it would seek consensus around the proposal and it has done so, as can be seen from the cross-party support for the proposal. I will be delighted to support the motion to abolish the tolls.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384049", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bridge Tolls"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to make my first speech in a debate that I hope will result in the abolition of tolls on the Forth and Tay road bridges.
